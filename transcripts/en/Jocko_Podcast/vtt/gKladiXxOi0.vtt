1
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.550
So yeah.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.520
<v 1>By early December,</v>

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.520
1914 the punishing advance of the Germans had been stopped by the allies before

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.100
the Germans made it to Paris,

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.920
but it had been stopped at a great cost,
a sickening cost.

6
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.383
<v 0>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.760
<v 1>The now the armies had settled into the trenches</v>

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.160
and we know what the trenches were.

9
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.703
<v 0>Hell,</v>

10
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.620
<v 1>not some metaphorical approximation of hell,</v>

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.480
but actual hell,
hell on earth,

12
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.680
artillery,
mortars,
machine,
gun,
fire,
snipers,

13
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.220
shrapnel screams of the wounded and dying.

14
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.030
And on top of that,
the environment,

15
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.330
rain and sleet and snow and flooded trenches and freezing cold

16
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.690
Britain.
Of course,
death was everywhere,

17
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.803
everywhere.

18
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.340
And there seemed no end to the horror.

19
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.450
But on Christmas Day,

20
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.590
1914 the whole or did stop if only for a short time,

21
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.110
while men for a moment

22
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.420
recognized the men they were fighting against has other men

23
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160
as other men with the same hopes and dreams and desires that they had

24
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.900
themselves.

25
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.370
And the chief of all hope

26
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.670
<v 0>where's piece?</v>

27
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.960
And this is an excerpt

28
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.840
<v 1>of how the Christmas truce unfolded.</v>

29
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.540
According to Henry Williamson,

30
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.660
the British army officer who is there

31
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.030
parent,
here's what he wrote.

32
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.590
For weeks.
We had lived in flooded trenches.

33
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.100
The Germans were 80 yards away.

34
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.980
Our trench was and fileted.

35
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.030
We lost many men shot by snipers

36
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.160
night after.
Since

37
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.260
<v 0>the tailing off of the battle of eep res,</v>

38
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.690
we had toiled in the pair of pits,
filling sand bag with clay mud,

39
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.520
squelched through muddy lagoons of woodland tracks,
carrying rations,

40
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.120
duck boards,
pumps and ammunition.

41
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.990
<v 1>We were volunteers,</v>

42
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.970
rushed out to help general French's shattered expeditionary force.

43
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.650
A few weeks before

44
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.020
we had been schoolboys bank clerks,
undergraduates,

45
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.430
medical students.

46
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.710
Now our lives were ravaged.
Some of us,

47
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.360
the young ones who thought of their mothers were near to despair.

48
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.190
We were without hope,
without horizon.

49
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.750
At first trench life had been interesting,
even enjoyable.

50
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.850
It was fun cooking our own Bacon and making tea in the wood wall.

51
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.660
Shrapnel cracked overhead.

52
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.590
Good sports stalking the wild geese in the marshes.

53
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.880
Satisfying to feel the soft hairs of our unshaven chins.

54
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.170
The regulars were decent Japs heroes of Mons,

55
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.750
but the rains fell

56
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.310
and the trenches filled almost waist high.

57
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.940
After a few days,
we could scarcely move our legs,

58
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.410
nor did we seem to need food
at night.

59
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.550
We dragged ourselves out of the ditches and moved about uncaring of bullets

60
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.500
aimed at random in the dark.

61
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.330
All night we worked carrying parties,

62
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.200
pumping fatigues parapet building at dawn.

63
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:06.201
We slid into water again and set ourselves to endure the gray daylight.

64
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.650
Even now,

65
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.240
so long afterwards when I hear rain on the tiles overhead,

66
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.030
the ghost of that time makes me draw the blankets closer around my neck.

67
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.613
<v 0>Okay.</v>

68
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.960
<v 1>On Christmas Eve of 1914 we were in the support line about 200 yards inside the</v>

69
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:35.850
plug stick would,
it was freezing

70
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.460
are overcoats where as stiff as boards,
our boots were too hard to move,

71
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.940
but we rejoiced as the mud was hard too.

72
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.300
Also happy thought we would be able to sleep that night

73
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.060
inside a new block house of oak boughs and sand bags called Piccadilly hotel.

74
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.350
No bed but the cold earth,
no blankets even,
but sleep,

75
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.533
sleep.

76
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.370
Then came a message from brigade headquarters broad,

77
00:06:15.371 --> 00:06:20.371
I think by second lieutenant Bruce Baron's father of the Warrick's wiring

78
00:06:23.261 --> 00:06:26.740
parties were required in no man's land all night

79
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.070
and there would be a moon.

80
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.400
We would have to work only 50 yards from the German machine guns in the White

81
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.530
House opposite the eastern edge of the wood.

82
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.250
Two hours later we filed out of the dark trees into the naked moonlit terror of

83
00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:52.971
no man's land holding our shovels besides our faces in hope of protection

84
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.250
against the expected mortar blast,

85
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.360
the moon was high and white among the frozen clouds.

86
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.360
We were visible.
Someone slipped with a click of a spade or rifle.

87
00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:11.880
We flung ourselves on our faces and waited,

88
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.490
but the battlefield was a silent as the moon for an hour.

89
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.970
We worked in silence in a most mysterious soundless snus.

90
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.240
What had happened,

91
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.510
we began to talk naturally as we drove in steaks and pulled out concert teen

92
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.720
have prepared wire.

93
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.300
There was no rifle fire either up or down the line from way up north beyond.

94
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:47.511
He prays to South Beyond Armand Tyrus and the French army.

95
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.460
At midnight we heard laughing as we worked.

96
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.360
We heard singing from the German lines,

97
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.060
Carol's the tunes of which we knew.

98
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.910
I noticed a very bright light on a tall pole raised in their lines down opposite

99
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:14.050
the east Lancs trench in front of the convent.

100
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.890
A Christmas tree with lighted candles was set on their pair of Pitt,

101
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.370
the unreal moonlight life.

102
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.260
When on happily cries of,
come on over Tommy,

103
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:35.060
we won't fire it to you.
A dark figure approached me.

104
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.610
Hesitatingly a trap.

105
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:43.190
I walk towards it with a bumping heart.
Merry Christmas,

106
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.900
English friend.
We shook hands tremulously

107
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.660
then I saw that the light on the pole was the morning star,

108
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.960
the star in the east.
It was Christmas morning.

109
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.660
All Christmas Day.

110
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.550
Gray and khaki figures mingled and talk to no man's land.

111
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.090
Picks in spades rang in the hard ground.

112
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.250
It was strange to stare at the dead.

113
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.880
We had only glimpse stat swiftly from the trenches.

114
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.640
The shallowest graves were dug,
filled,

115
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.400
and set with crosses,
knocked together from lengths of ration,

116
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:33.420
boxwood marked with indelible pencil for King and country for fodder,

117
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.010
land on free height,

118
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.280
fatherland and freedom.
Freedom,

119
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.090
freedom.
How was this?

120
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.760
We were fighting for freedom and our cause was just,

121
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.610
we were defending Belgium,
civilization.

122
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.880
These fellows in gray,
we're good fellows.

123
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.570
They were strangely

124
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.900
just men like ourselves.

125
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.260
How can we lose the war?

126
00:10:11.261 --> 00:10:16.261
English comrade Har causes just we are ringed with enemies.

127
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.120
The war was thrust on us.
We are defending our parents,
our homes,

128
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.440
our German soil,

129
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.300
almost shaking,

130
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.450
staggering thought that both sides thought they were fighting for the same

131
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:36.360
cause.
The war was a terrible mistake.

132
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.840
People at home did not know this.

133
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.920
Then the idea came to the young and callow soldier that if only he could tell

134
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.370
them at home what was really happening and if the German soldiers told their

135
00:10:55.951 --> 00:10:58.020
people the truth about us,

136
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.100
the war would be over,

137
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.830
but he hardly dared to think it.
Even to himself.

138
00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.440
The next day was quiet and the next weaving hands from the trenches by day

139
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.720
singing and reflected blaze of trench bonfires at night.

140
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.990
It was a lovely time.

141
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.540
On the third afternoon came a message from the Germans.

142
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.320
At midnight our staff officers visit and we must fire our automatic pistol Olan

143
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.540
but we will fire hire nevertheless,
please keep under cover.

144
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.250
At 11:00 PM Berlin midnight,

145
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.500
we saw flashes going away into air

146
00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:02.050
two days later and army order came from Ghq to the effect that men found

147
00:12:04.281 --> 00:12:09.281
fraternizing with the enemy would be court marshaled and if found guilty would

148
00:12:09.501 --> 00:12:11.330
suffer the death penalty.

149
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.580
And again in that place the they relight sword over no man's land at night.

150
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.430
Then bullets cut showers of splinters from trees and sometimes human flesh and

151
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:31.564
bone.

152
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:38.470
So hope sank into the mud again

153
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.040
but did not die

154
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.060
despite a withering a new,

155
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:51.061
as each poor human unit fell in machine gun and mortar blasts and colossal

156
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:57.550
reverberating rending of the shells of those four years,

157
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.650
the years whose truth seems to be in communicable.

158
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.580
Sometimes as one listens to what people say here in the England,

159
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.010
a generation died for

160
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:24.700
it seems like almost pre war again.

161
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.580
Can it be that we lack imagination

162
00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.140
to see the other fellow

163
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.950
as ourselves

164
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.690
and Henry Williamson
continued to fight.

165
00:13:55.190 --> 00:14:00.190
He was eventually wounded by gas than when he was declared unfit to serve in the

166
00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:02.834
army.

167
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.700
He then volunteered for the air force to see if that could get him back to the

168
00:14:07.701 --> 00:14:08.534
front.

169
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.980
But he didn't make it back to the front.
Luckily,

170
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.190
because the war ended,

171
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.420
the war ended,

172
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:30.290
but not before 20 million were wounded and 17 million men were killed.

173
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.563
Men,

174
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.240
just normal men

175
00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.453
gone.

176
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.010
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

177
00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:00.010
<v 1>So this holiday season,</v>

178
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.703
please

179
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.670
think of those men and women around the world in the trenches now risking life

180
00:15:14.951 --> 00:15:17.920
and limb for what they believe in

181
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.533
<v 0>for freedom.</v>

182
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:30.060
<v 1>And think of the civilians trapped in those hellish places suffering</v>

183
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.820
in the merciless path of war.

184
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.800
<v 0>And finally,</v>

185
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.380
<v 1>as Henry Williamson asked,</v>

186
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.180
let us not lack the imagination to think,

187
00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.400
to think of other men
as men,

188
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.940
men like ourselves,

189
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.850
men like
us.

190
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.080
Merry Christmas to all.

191
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.920
And may there be peace

192
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:26.940
<v 0>on earth.</v>
