Speaker 1:          00:00          When I realized that losing your temper was a sign of weakness. As soon as I read, as soon as I made that connection, I said to myself this week I'm gonna try not to do it anymore. And what's weird is when you're a kid, I don't know if you remember this, but when I was a kid and you'd see someone get angry and it made you afraid. And so for a while I saw it as like a power, you know, it's kind of a way to achieve power that you can lose your temper and then all of a sudden you have this extra strength. And so when you're a little kid, and when I say a little kid, I mean when I was 1314 years old, I thought, hey, if I go, if I could get that rage going, and people are scared, like I used to feel. That's a positive thing. And then like I said, as I got older, now you, you know, now you're talking 1615 1617 I realized, hey, this isn't,

Speaker 2:          00:59          yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:00          this isn't cool. This isn't strength, it's actually weakness. And when I realized it was weakness, and I didn't realize that overnight, but I started getting the idea that that was weakness. And now when you see someone that is in control and even when bad things are happening there, you know, there's, there's standing stoically saying, okay, let me take another look at that and I'll get it done. You know what I mean? When they're just okay, then you realize, okay, this guy's really unflappable, which is a lot more impressive. So again, you, you gotta be able to detach from this. And you know, I like to take pride in the fact that I'm gonna keep my cool no matter what happens. And definitely once I was in that, once you're in the seal teams, you definitely want to be that guy that's keeping your, keeping your cool no matter what's happening, whether it's people are doing the wrong thing or you just want to be the guy that's, hey, okay, come back over here.

Speaker 1:          01:52          We need to Redo this. You just want to be that guy that's way more impressive than the guy that does not get bullied. Don't be that person. So, and I've talked about this before, what are the pre event indicators that show you or reveal to you that your temper is about to be lost? What are they? Is it you clench your fist, right? Is it you raise your voice and you start doing it, doing that stuff? Do you start to heavy breathing? Do you flow, flair your nostrils, right. Cause that's an animal thing where you're going to take in more oxygen. So you open up the nostrils cause you're about to get after it. Do you, you know, use your, does your, your head, you know, shaking or whatever. You can just like these things. What is it, what indicators do you have when you know that you're starting to feel that and as soon as you feel that you're detach, you go, oh, that's what that is. That's an indicator and it's a weakness and I don't like weakness, so I'm not going to allow it. And then, yeah, take a breath.

Speaker 2:          02:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:57          I like to say, know what? Here's a good one. You want to, you want to get through that, that moment. Nod your head slowly in the affirmative, right? So, so when someone's telling me something that's making me mad, I'll just slowly nod my head. Like, I understand this is the way things are. I accept this and this is calculating what my next move is gonna be. Uh, and then, you know, you're seeing whatever, you know, guys will count to 10. You know, you tell you a little kids that tell you a little kids when they start losing their temper, you know what? You need to count to 10 count to 10 count to a hundred, counter thousand or whatever did you gotta do and get control. Because like I said, if you're losing control, it's not strike it's weakness.
