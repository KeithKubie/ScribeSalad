00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
Welcome back.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.935
At the end of the last
video, I left you

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:03.990
with a bit of a question.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.370
We had a situation where we
had a 1 kilogram object.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.890
This is the 1 kilogram object,
which I've drawn neater in

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.955
this video.

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:15.910
That is 1 kilogram.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.110
And we're on earth, and I need
to mention that because

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.380
gravity is different from
planet to planet.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.670
But as I mentioned,
I'm holding it.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.200
Let's say I'm holding it 10
meters above the ground.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.590
So this distance or this
height is 10 meters.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.600
And we're assuming the
acceleration of gravity, which

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.480
we also write as just g, let's
assume it's just 10 meters per

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.680
second squared just for the
simplicity of the math instead

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.880
of the 9.8.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.560
So what we learned in the last
video is that the potential

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.690
energy in this situation, the
potential energy, which equals

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.740
m times g times h is equal to
the mass is 1 kilogram times

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.300
the acceleration of gravity,
which is 10

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.490
meters per second squared.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.349
I'm not going to write the units
down just to save space,

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.890
although you should do this when
you do it on your test.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.920
And then the height
is 10 meters.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.910
And the units, if you work them
all out, it's in newton

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.960
meters or joules and so it's
equal to 100 joules.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.400
That's the potential energy when
I'm holding it up there.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.290
And I asked you, well when
I let go, what happens?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.490
Well the block obviously
will start falling.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.370
And not only falling, it will
start accelerating to the

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.870
ground at 10 meters per second
squared roughly.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.940
And right before it hits the
ground-- let me draw that in

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.640
brown for ground-- right before
the object hits the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.130
ground or actually right when it
hits the ground, what will

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.490
be the potential energy
of the object?

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.070
Well it has no height, right?

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.790
Potential energy is mgh.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.810
The mass and the acceleration of
gravity stay the same, but

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.470
the height is 0.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.460
So they're all multiplied
by each other.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.540
So down here, the potential
energy is going

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.360
to be equal to 0.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.120
And I told you in the last video
that we have the law of

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.160
conservation of energy.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.950
That energy is conserved.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.510
It cannot be created
or destroyed.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.920
It can just be converted from
one form to another.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.919
But I'm just showing you, this
object had 100 joules of

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.010
energy or, in this case,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.920
gravitational potential energy.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.820
And down here, it
has no energy.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.780
Or at least it has no
gravitational potential

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.130
energy, and that's the key.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.800
That gravitational potential
energy was converted into

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.920
something else.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.480
And that something else
it was converted

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.070
into is kinetic energy.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.800
And in this case, since it has
no potential energy, all of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.580
that previous potential energy,
all of this 100 joules

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.880
that it has up here is now going
to be converted into

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.800
kinetic energy.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.620
And we can use that information
to figure out its

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.980
velocity right before
it hits the ground.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.760
So how do we do that?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.770
Well what's the formula
for kinetic energy?

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.615
And we solved it two videos
ago, and hopefully it

00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:53.677
shouldn't be too much
of a mystery to you.

00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:55.840
It's something good to memorize,
but it's also good

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.870
to know how we got it and go
back two videos if you forgot.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.440
So first we know that all the
potential energy was converted

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.450
into kinetic energy.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.330
We had 100 joules of potential
energy, so we're still going

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.210
to have 100 joules, but now
all of it's going to be

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.350
kinetic energy.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.810
And kinetic energy is
1/2 mv squared.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.080
So we know that 1/2 mv squared,
or the kinetic

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.990
energy, is now going to
equal 100 joules.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.710
What's the mass?

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.960
The mass is 1.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.930
And we can solve for v now.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.910
1/2 v squared equals
100 joules, and v

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.050
squared is equal to 200.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.310
And then we get v is equal to
square root of 200, which is

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.560
something over 14.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.860
We can get the exact number.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.725
Let's see, 200 square
root, 14.1 roughly.

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:51.360
The velocity is going to
be 14.1 meters per

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.870
second squared downwards.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.500
Right before the object
touches the ground.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.930
Right before it touches
the ground.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.180
And you might say, well Sal
that's nice and everything.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.170
We learned a little
bit about energy.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.890
I could have solved that or
hopefully you could have

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.990
solved that problem just using
your kinematics formula.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.550
So what's the whole point
of introducing

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.590
these concepts of energy?

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.280
And I will now show you.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.640
So let's say they have the same
1 kilogram object up here

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.529
and it's 10 meters in the air,
but I'm going to change things

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.779
a little bit.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.970
Let me see if I can competently
erase all of this.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.940
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.900
OK, there you go.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.150
I'm trying my best to erase
this, all of this stuff.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.570
OK.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.770
So I have the same object.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.025
It's still 10 meters
in the air and I'll

00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:45.390
write that in a second.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.160
And I'm just holding it there
and I'm still going to drop

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.130
it, but something interesting
is going to happen.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.880
Instead of it going straight
down, it's actually going to

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.610
drop on this ramp of ice.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.710
The ice has lumps on it.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.660
And then this is the bottom.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.510
This is the ground down here.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.310
This is the ground.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.070
So what's going to
happen this time?

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.130
I'm still 10 meters in the
air, so let me draw that.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.130
That's still 10 meters.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.360
I should switch colors just
so not everything is ice.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.190
So that's still 10 meters, but
instead of the object going

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.090
straight down now, it's going to
go down here and then start

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.840
sliding, right?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.080
It's going to go sliding
along this hill.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.870
And then at this point it's
going to be going really fast

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.010
in the horizontal direction.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.760
And right now we don't
know how fast.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.630
And just using our kinematics
formula, this would have been

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.880
a really tough formula.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.630
This would have been
difficult.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.400
I mean you could have attempted
it and it actually

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.990
would have taken calculus
because the angle of the slope

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.150
changes continuously.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.990
We don't even know the formula
for the angle of the slope.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.410
You would have had to break
it out into vectors.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.690
You would have to do all sorts
of complicated things.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.050
This would have been a nearly
impossible problem.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.050
But using energy, we can
actually figure out what the

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.680
velocity of this object
is at this point.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.880
And we use the same idea.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.330
Here we have 100 joules
of potential energy.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.070
We just figured that out.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.190
Down here, what's the height
above the ground?

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.570
Well the height is 0.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.580
So all the potential energy
has disappeared.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.270
And just like in the previous
situation, all of the

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.530
potential energy is now
converted into kinetic energy.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.520
And so what is that kinetic
energy going to equal?

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.440
It's going to be equal to the
initial potential energy.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.150
So here the kinetic energy
is equal to 100 joules.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.090
And that equals 1/2
mv squared, just

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.300
like we just solved.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.380
And if you solve for v, the
mass is 1 kilogram.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.690
So the velocity in the
horizontal direction will be,

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.400
if you solve for it, 14.1
meters per second.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.070
Instead of going straight down,
now it's going to be

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.300
going in the horizontal
to the right.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.270
And the reason why I said it
was ice is because I wanted

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.360
this to be frictionless and I
didn't want any energy lost to

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.760
heat or anything like that.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.320
And you might say OK Sal, that's
kind of interesting.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.990
And you kind of got the same
number for the velocity than

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.870
if I just dropped the object
straight down.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.660
And that's interesting.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.910
But what else can
this do for me?

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.100
And this is where it's
really cool.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.080
Not only can I figure out the
velocity when all of the

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.100
potential energy has
disappeared, but I can figure

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.180
out the velocity of any
point-- and this is

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.460
fascinating-- along
this slide.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.200
So let's say when the box is
sliding down here, so let's

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.600
say the box is at this point.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.630
It changes colors
too as it falls.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.510
So this is the 1 kilogram
box, right?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.840
It falls and it slides
down here.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.480
And let's say at this point it's
height above the ground

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.750
is 5 meters.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.860
So what's its potential
energy here?

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.770
So let's just write something.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.810
All of the energy is
conserved, right?

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.080
So the initial potential
energy plus the initial

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.360
kinetic energy is equal to the
final potential energy plus

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.960
the final kinetic energy.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.100
I'm just saying energy
is conserved here.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.580
Up here, what's the initial
total energy in the system?

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.400
Well the potential energy is 100
and the kinetic energy is

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.420
0 because it's stationary.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:11.880
I haven't dropped it.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.090
I haven't let go of it yet.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.360
It's just stationary.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.530
So the initial energy is going
to be equal to 100 joules.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.830
That's cause this is
0 and this is 100.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.840
So the initial energy
is 100 joules.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.500
At this point right here, what's
the potential energy?

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:32.270
Well we're 5 meters
up, so mass times

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:32.990
gravity times height.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.900
Mass is 1, times gravity, 10
meters per second squared.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.049
Times height, times 5.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:40.630
So it's 50 joules.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.409
That's our potential energy
at this point.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.130
And then we must have some
kinetic energy with the

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.250
velocity going roughly
in that direction.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.950
Plus our kinetic energy
at this point.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.560
And we know that no energy
was destroyed.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.330
It's just converted.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.080
So we know the total energy
still has to be 100 joules.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.410
So essentially what happened,
and if we solve for this--

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.430
it's very easy, subtract 50 from
both sides-- we know that

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.120
the kinetic energy is
now also going to

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.100
be equal to 50 joules.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.890
So what happened?

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.370
Halfway down, essentially half
of the potential energy got

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.120
converted to kinetic energy.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.120
And we can use this information
that the kinetic

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.230
energy is 50 joules
to figure out the

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.170
velocity at this point.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.840
1/2 mv squared is equal to 50.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.080
The mass is 1.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.530
Multiply both sides by 2.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.370
You get v squared
is equal to 100.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.570
The velocity is 10 meters
per second along

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.390
this crazy, icy slide.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.970
And that is something that I
would have challenged you to

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.670
solve using traditional
kinematics formulas,

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.500
especially considering that we
don't know really much about

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.490
the surface of this slide.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.930
And even if we did, that would
have been a million times

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.440
harder than just using the law
of conservation of energy and

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.380
realizing that at this point,
half the potential energy is

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.620
now kinetic energy and
it's going along the

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.620
direction of the slide.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.870
I will see you in
the next video.
