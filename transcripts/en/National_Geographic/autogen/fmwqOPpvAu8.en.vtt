of craters we saw really great craters

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
of craters we saw really great craters
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.750
of craters we saw really great craters
of 70 kilometers size they are like a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
of 70 kilometers size they are like a
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.109
of 70 kilometers size they are like a
boat they are so large so huge and they

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
boat they are so large so huge and they
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.420
boat they are so large so huge and they
are covered soon most of them of the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
are covered soon most of them of the
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.940
are covered soon most of them of the
larger craters they have a very round

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
larger craters they have a very round
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.999
larger craters they have a very round
rim so they are very very old traders so

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
rim so they are very very old traders so
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249
rim so they are very very old traders so
it's well it's discovery so we have a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
it's well it's discovery so we have a
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.010
it's well it's discovery so we have a
lot of large craters tons of all the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
lot of large craters tons of all the
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140
lot of large craters tons of all the
traitors tons of small craters even

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
traitors tons of small craters even
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240
traitors tons of small craters even
smaller innocently and the large craters

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
smaller innocently and the large craters
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.210
smaller innocently and the large craters
so it's a lot of topography a lot of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
so it's a lot of topography a lot of
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.300
so it's a lot of topography a lot of
excitement we don't understand right now

excitement we don't understand right now
and that will keep us busy for months

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
and that will keep us busy for months
