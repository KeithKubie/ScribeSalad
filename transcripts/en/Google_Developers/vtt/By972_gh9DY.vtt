[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.130
VALERIE NYGAARD: Hello, hello.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.630
Welcome.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.070
For those of you that are here
live, it has been a long day.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.090
And you are like the endurance
athletes of I/O attendees.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.000
I am very impressed that you
are still here and still going.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.687
Like, let's go.

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:20.270
Let's hear it.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.492
It's awesome.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.170
All right.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.060
So if you didn't attend
the earlier session

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.394
that is basically about
building assistant apps,

00:00:32.394 --> 00:00:33.810
or if you haven't
experienced one,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.910
here's the 30 second overview.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.100
So this is something that
the developer community

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.980
builds to extend the
assistant, and basically

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.350
connect with users directly
through the assistant

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.640
on the platforms where
the assistant exists.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.510
So this is a representation
of an eyes-free one

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.810
that you might interact
with on Google Home.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.700
And this is a
representation of one

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.220
that you might interact
with on the phone.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.090
All right.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.460
That's assistant
apps in 20 seconds.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.287
If you haven't built an
assistant app, or even if have,

00:01:02.287 --> 00:01:05.459
if you haven't watched the
build and assistant app talk,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.110
it's fantastic.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.610
You'll be really
impressed to see

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.040
building one that's
transactional even in, like,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.670
10 minutes.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.170
So go do that.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.950
If you are watching on a
stream, go do that now.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.650
If you are here,
don't-- like, stay here.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.370
We'll keep going.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.090
OK, so we have had a ton of fun
interacting with the developer

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.000
community building these
first assistant apps

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.990
in the ecosystem.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.980
It's just been great to see
how creative people have been,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.780
how they're trying to
push the boundaries

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.610
of this early system.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.590
We get submissions
that are funny,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.840
and submissions that are
useful, and submissions

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.420
that are like a little naughty.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.720
A really big variety,
and it's been great.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.210
But this session
is going to focus

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.440
on a very particular
aspect of assistant apps,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.840
and that is discovery.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.120
And specifically, that's
a user thing, right?

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.150
So you want users to be able
to discover the hard work

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.210
that you've been doing.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.570
And so we're going
to start today

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.449
from the user perspective.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:10.979
This is Jane.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.106
She is our user.

00:02:13.106 --> 00:02:14.730
While I'm introducing
people, I thought

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.400
I would mention
that I am Valerie.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.149
I am one of your speakers.

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:20.190
I'm on the product team
for the Google Assistant.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.814
And this is Rob, one
of our engineering

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:24.590
leaders on the Assistant.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.280
Back to Jane.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.830
All right.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.469
Jane wants to know what she can
do with the Google Assistant.

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.260
Of course, she wants
to know all the things

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.660
that Google can help her with.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.970
But she very much wants to
know about all the stuff

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.250
that you can help
her with, right?

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.600
And we want that, too.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.040
What we all want is
easy discovery for Jane.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.470
We are in this together.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.152
Like you and us and Jane, all
like swimming in the same--

00:02:56.152 --> 00:02:57.610
I didn't have a
good analogy there.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.151
But, like, we're all trying the
same thing, on the same page,

00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:01.505
going to the same goal.

00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:02.380
We're in it together.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.100
We all want the same thing.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.950
OK, so let's help
Jane discover you.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.840
We're going to frame
this in three sections.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.520
We're going to listen to what
Jane is explicitly asking for.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.440
We're going to infer a
little bit about what

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.750
she wants when she just
says what she wants to do,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.872
expresses an intent.

00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:21.330
And then sometimes
we're just going

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.082
to do something
delightful for Jane.

00:03:24.082 --> 00:03:25.790
And to talk about
these first two is Rob.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.900
ROB STETS: Well,
thanks a lot, Valerie.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.330
Yes, what I'm
going to begin with

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.390
is the most basic
form of discovery.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.530
We call this
explicit triggering.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.900
It's whenever a user invokes an
app directly through its name.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.760
So let me shift over
to the phone view

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.780
and show you an example.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.240
Talk to Fitstar.

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:01.190
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Sure, here's Fitstar.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.480
ROB STETS: So this talk to app--

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.510
app name pattern,
it's a special.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.870
We apply this to every
single app automatically.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.500
And we-- and by default
when the user uses

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.269
this particular
pattern, we connect

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.490
right to that particular app.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.730
So as a developer,
this is the phrase

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.500
you want to use in
your advertisements

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.860
when you're instructing users
how to start up your app.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.440
It's, however, pretty
basic though, right?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.170
Mostly whenever users
start up your app,

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.640
they want to jump
right into an activity.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.180
So let me show you another
example of an explicit trigger.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.930
Ask Fitstar to start a workout.

00:04:49.632 --> 00:04:52.530
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Sure, here's Fitstar.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.420
Let's start with
seven-minute workout.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.762
Up next--

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:57.720
ROB STETS: OK, let's
switch back to the slides.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.950
And what I showed here was an
action phrase, start a workout.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.820
You can add an action phrase
to an explicit invocation,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.970
and it kind of streamlines
the user's actions.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.650
They're able to
start up your app

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.527
and jump right into the system,
jump right into an activity.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.110
Now one thing to be
careful about here

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.640
is there can be many different
versions of this action phrase.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.650
And so you're not always
guaranteed to trigger on here.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.299
When you set up action phrases,
be sure to test them out

00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:33.590
and make sure that they do
trigger all the way through.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.370
So I can show you how to
set up an action phrase.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.450
Now if you're a developer
that works directly

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.940
in the action packages,
what you want to do

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.090
is find the intent that
you want to connect

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.730
the particular action
phrase to and then

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.310
go to the trigger stanza.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.710
Inside the trigger
stanza query patterns

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.980
you can list out all of the
different action phrases

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.310
that you want.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.800
So for instance, you see
start a workout is there.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.590
If you're a developer
that works with API.AI,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.720
it's a very simple
two-step process

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.210
to set up an action phrase.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.700
Similar to the action package,
you go to your intents,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.360
your intent-- the
target intents page,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.150
and then you list out the
action phrases in the user

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.460
says examples.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.380
That is step one.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.050
And then in step two,
you go to the Actions

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.220
on Google Integration page,
and you add your target intent

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.020
as an additional
triggering intent.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.560
This will set up the
action phrase for API.AI.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.050
OK, another thing to note about
setting up explicit triggers,

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.800
whether using action
packages or API.AI,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.210
your final step will be to
go to your console page,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.030
and then list out of the five
example invocations, you know,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.792
using your explicit
triggering patterns.

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:02.750
Now be sure to check that
all these patterns do

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.660
trigger your action.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.520
But this is really important
because we take these five

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.950
sample invocations
and we actually

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.580
put them on your app,
your app's directory page.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.970
So here I have pictured the
directory page for Fitstar.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.250
And if you see down
towards the bottom,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.820
there's the ask your
assistant section.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.390
This lists out all of the
different sample invocations

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.590
that you provided.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.020
And it's really
important for discovery

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.980
because users are going
to be browsing for apps

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.720
inside of the directory.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.210
They could direct-- they
could immediately try

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.640
the app via the Try It button.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.170
But moreover, we want them to
see how to invoke this sometime

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.445
in the future when they're
away from the directory.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.950
So that's all very
nice for whenever

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:02.540
the user remembers your app's
name or knows about your app.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.080
But let's go back to a case
where Jane doesn't even

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.070
know about your app or
can't remember the name.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.620
This is the portion of
discovery that we really

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.710
want to make well because we
think this can make a real--

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:16.750
this will make all the
difference in the world

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.850
as far as getting
exposure for apps.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.080
So what we're doing is we're
building new algorithms

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.860
so that users can just
express their intent.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.960
They don't have to use
an app name or anything.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.450
They can just express
what they want to do.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.200
And partnering with you--

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.789
I'll talk a little bit in
a few slides about the ways

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.960
you can help us--

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.970
partnering with you,
we'll be able to just take

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:45.610
their general intent and match
it to the most relevant app.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.270
We call this
implicit triggering.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.530
And let's go ahead and--

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.740
actually, let me show you
one example first here still.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.510
Here's an example.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.920
Jane wants to do a workout, so
she says, give me a workout.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.880
And we actually do a little bit
of implicit triggering today.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.970
It looks like what I have
pictured on the screen here.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.040
We'll look at that intent, and
then we'll find a matching app

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.530
and just ask Jane if she
wants to connect to that app.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.570
So here you see we said, do
you want to talk to Fitstar?

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.920
And Jane can say yes or no.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.257
Let's now go to the phone view.

00:09:26.257 --> 00:09:28.340
And I want to show you
something we're working on.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.230
Give me a workout.

00:09:34.735 --> 00:09:35.610
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.770
I have a couple of
options for that.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.827
Fitstar in five-minute plan.

00:09:39.827 --> 00:09:41.160
Which one would you like to try?

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.890
ROB STETS: OK, it's a
subtle difference here.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.260
What we're doing is we're
working on algorithms

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.200
to find the high
quality matching apps

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.090
for a particular
intent, and then we

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.750
want to display them in a nice
visual manner that gives users

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.170
some cues about what the
app does and allows the user

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.780
to select it very easily.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.430
You know, this I
think we can really

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.000
use to increase the exposure
of apps to the user,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.630
and also satisfy users needs
much better because they're

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.165
just able to start off
with a general intent.

00:10:15.165 --> 00:10:16.415
Can you go back to the slides?

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:26.460
So seeing this, probably a
natural question you have is,

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.410
how does my app
get into this list,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.770
and how is this list ordered?

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.670
So what we have to do
here is a ranking problem

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.210
very similar to what
we've done in web search.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.610
Many of the principles
apply, but this

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:43.210
is a brand new ecosystem.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.467
And so we need to figure out new
ways to apply these principles.

00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:49.050
We need to figure
out what signals are

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.220
important in this ecosystem.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.210
So this is still very
much a work in progress.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.830
But I can give you a little hint
about how we think about this.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.110
We think about our users.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.150
We think about
what has Jane done

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.670
in this context in the past.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.460
We also think about, what do
all of our Assistant users

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.070
do in this type of context?

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.560
We also take advantage
of Google's reach

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.010
and we also look at what
users in other properties,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.890
like Google Search
or Google Maps,

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.290
do in this particular context.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.000
You know, and
together this gives us

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.460
a set of signals that we
can then weave together

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.500
into our ranking
algorithms, you know,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.360
to find the most relevant
apps for the user's intent.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.360
Now how can you help us here?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.720
Remember this action package
with the action phrases I

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.060
showed a couple of minutes ago?

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.080
It's good to pay attention here.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.250
Write out useful action
phrases that describe

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.812
what happens in your app.

00:11:49.812 --> 00:11:51.270
You know, if you
think about these,

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.320
these are just natural
language expressions

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.940
of your app's capability.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.310
We can use this
information in our matching

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.610
and our ranking algorithms.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.160
Another thing that is helpful
to help with your discovery

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.770
is go ahead and if you have
an associated website or soon

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.030
an associated Android app, go
through the brand verification

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.940
step in your app console.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.060
This lets us establish a
link between your Assistant

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.370
app and your web page, and
in the near future, also

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.220
any of your Android apps.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.400
And as I mentioned, you know,
part of our ranking algorithms

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.170
will look at some of
our other properties,

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.470
like Google Search and
Google Maps and such.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.570
This will allow us to
establish the connection

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.810
between the signals.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.980
You know, so together working
on the action phrases,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.600
giving us some of
this information

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.510
about your connected
sites, this can all

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.013
help with your discovery.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.510
So that's a quick
overview of what

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.480
we're trying to do to make
it much easier for Jane

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.640
to express in a
natural way that they

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.750
want to use a particular app
or just do a particular intent.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.880
We want to go way beyond this.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.030
And we actually are working
on other discovery means that

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.850
will help Jane even figure
out things she didn't know

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.287
could be done on our platform.

00:13:14.287 --> 00:13:16.120
I'm going to hand this
back to Valerie right

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.470
now so she can go over these.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.100
VALERIE NYGAARD: Thanks.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.290
OK, so I'm a huge fan of
the implicit triggering

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.550
that Rob was talking about.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:34.970
But what we want to talk about
next is some kind of juicy,

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.220
like, on the front
lines, it's coming,

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.140
it's in development
kind of stuff, right?

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.352
So most of what you'll
see next is directional.

00:13:42.352 --> 00:13:44.060
But we really wanted
to share it with you

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:47.570
so you have an idea about how
we're thinking about things

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.600
and what we expect to come next.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.870
All right, so
serendipitous discovery.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.230
We're going to talk about
this in a couple of ways.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.730
We're going to talk about it
both in the conversation stage,

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.517
so like in dialogue when
Jane is already interacting

00:13:59.517 --> 00:14:01.100
through the Assistant,
and we're going

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.230
to talk about it off
the conversation stage.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.800
So on the conversation
stage first.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.550
All right, so let's say
Jane has a request in mind.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.240
And let's say that it's a very
typical request for someone

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.420
to ask Google about, right?

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.014
So for example, Jane wants to
know about The Red Cat, which

00:14:19.014 --> 00:14:20.180
is a restaurant in New York.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.147
So she says, you know,
tell me about The Red Cat.

00:14:23.147 --> 00:14:24.980
Of course, the first
thing we're going to do

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.355
is we're going to give her
the information she asked for.

00:14:27.355 --> 00:14:30.020
Like, that's, of course, the
first thing we want to do.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:34.190
But she might also be delighted
if we give her some other ways

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.000
to continue the conversation,
especially some ways

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.920
to take action that's
super relevant.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.920
So what you'll see here is some
suggestion chips on the bottom

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.746
about booking a table,
about getting some pictures,

00:14:45.746 --> 00:14:47.120
you might in
another scenario see

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.260
menus or directions,
other similar restaurants,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.260
things like that, right?

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.360
This is, actually, you may have
seen this in production today.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.480
This happens to be
Google going to Google,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.860
but we want this to extend to
developer-created features.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.160
So if you were
watching the keynote

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.900
and you were really
paying attention

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.490
to this really cool demo
using Google Lens, right?

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.260
So my colleague
Ebrahim, he pointed

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.570
the camera via the Assistant
at a marquee and the Assistant

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.150
understood, right,
that this was a band

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.300
and offered some nice follow
on actions, right, about,

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.980
like, hearing the
music from the band

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.440
or adding this to
their calendar.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.170
Right in the middle
there is getting tickets

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.330
from Ticketmaster, which
is one of our partners

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.950
on Actions on google
this is the kind of thing

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.440
we want to do, right?

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.510
So again, Jane has
something in mind, right?

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.190
She's trying to save this or
hear their music or whatever,

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:47.356
whatever she's trying to do.

00:15:47.356 --> 00:15:50.290
Well, we're saying, OK,
did you want buy tickets?

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.880
This is not intrusive.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.990
This is not invasive.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.210
This is not insistent.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.520
It's just assistive
and there for Jane

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.110
if she wants it, right?

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.440
And so we really want
to be able to understand

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.690
what are the actions that
your Assistant app can

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.560
do so that we can offer it
up in situations like these

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.730
and see how it goes.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.620
We even, of course,
want to combine this

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.620
with what Rob was talking
about earlier about giving you

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.720
a provider selection, right?

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.360
So let's get to the
beginning of this video

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.330
and we'll walk through it.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.120
OK, so let's say Jane, she
wants some pizza delivery.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.620
Again, pretty common query.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.930
She chooses a restaurant.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.030
She decides to place order.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.630
That was the first suggestion.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.540
And then she's got a
couple of providers.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.899
So in Jane's mind, she's
basically like, oh,

00:16:42.899 --> 00:16:44.190
I can actually place the order.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.580
Oh, I have a choice
of providers.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.704
Like, this is what we want.

00:16:46.704 --> 00:16:47.820
It's not forced discovery.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:49.830
It's just contextual.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.950
All right, how do
you get into that?

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.350
Before I go on, how
do you get into that?

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.320
It's the same
basic stuff, right,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.910
that Rob was talking about.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.450
Give us some clues about
what your app can do

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.530
and we'll try to help
take it from there.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.869
OK, so that's in the
conversation stage.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:12.819
When Jane is
elsewhere, for example,

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:18.030
you may have seen the new
Explore tab in the Assistant,

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.252
in the Assistant experience.

00:17:19.252 --> 00:17:20.460
So if we can go to the phone.

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:25.270
All right, so in the
upper right hand corner,

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.440
I'm going to tap there and
get into this experience.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.560
And this is just a
nice browse experience

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.930
that lets our user see some
things that she can do, right?

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.270
So there's our Fitstar.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.544
And she can just
browse around and see

00:17:41.544 --> 00:17:43.460
some things that are her
favorite, some things

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.335
some that are recent.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.920
And if she goes
into Fitstar again,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.057
one of the things
that you saw Rob show

00:17:51.057 --> 00:17:53.390
is these guys that are right
in the center of the screen

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.660
here, these sample invocations
that will appear for her.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.435
Of course, this is something
that our approvers do test.

00:17:59.435 --> 00:18:02.240
So you want to make sure,
again, that these work.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.660
But these will invoke directly.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.076
So if I tap on
this, it'll take us

00:18:05.076 --> 00:18:06.791
right into that
Fitstar experience.

00:18:06.791 --> 00:18:08.540
I'm not going to do
that right this second

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.380
because I want to just talk
about one more thing here.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.800
Having an attractive
and appealing

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.670
and concise, both picture
and especially the text,

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.210
explanation here is not
just for the purposes

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.250
necessarily of a user
browsing on this surface.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.020
This is also a signal
that is the kind of signal

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.920
that Google likes to understand
what your app does, right?

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.211
So think about what
you're going to put here.

00:18:36.211 --> 00:18:38.210
Think about something
that's going to make sense

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.616
to users right off the bat.

00:18:39.616 --> 00:18:41.990
Think about something that we
might be able to understand

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.300
is something that your
app can fulfill, right?

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.810
Just have a think about
what goes in here.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.290
OK, great.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.050
And I think we can go
back to the slides.

00:18:56.918 --> 00:18:59.764
Great.

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:00.264
All right.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.550
Marketing.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.300
Sometimes we showcase you, OK?

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.377
We are looking for
people to showcase.

00:19:11.377 --> 00:19:12.960
We are looking for
experiences that we

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.780
think our users will be
attracted to and want to do,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.310
and we want to shout about them.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:20.070
We want-- again, we want
you discovered, right?

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.770
So newsletters and
blog posts and tweets

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.820
and all of the above the
line marketing that we have,

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.880
right, we want to be able
to feature your experiences.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.620
And so what I'm going to tell
you next is one of the ways

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.480
that we figure out, like, how
can we decide who to feature.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.290
OK.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.560
It is absolutely true that
Google does all the things

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.000
that Google is known for, right?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.010
We are looking at all
of the user signals

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.020
we see in the wild.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.830
We are looking at repeat usage.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.630
We are looking at
daily active users.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.610
We are looking at if someone
goes into your experience,

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.550
do they appear to have
a good experience?

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.140
Do they appear to leave early?

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.600
All of these things are, of
course, things we're observing.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.490
But I just wanted
to let you know

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.400
that we are early
in this ecosystem,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.100
and we're also making
somewhat qualitative judgments

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.420
about deciding this as well.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.960
So you all know that
we have approvers

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.580
that are in our
queue, and we have,

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.940
of course, a lot of product
people and engineers

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.690
and the whole team
thinking about what are

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.630
the fantastic experiences here.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:26.050
These are the questions
that we ask ourselves, OK?

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.020
When I go through an
experience, I think--

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.000
I know, I see all
those cameras going up.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.010
Good.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.710
OK.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.751
So like, these are the
things that I think about.

00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:35.820
Like, did I smile?

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.124
Did I laugh?

00:20:37.124 --> 00:20:38.040
Did I learn something?

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.590
Did I learn something
interesting?

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.510
Would I tell someone?

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.220
Would I tell someone,
like, right now?

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.510
Would I call them over
and be, like, oh my gosh,

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.593
you got to check this out?

00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:48.390
Would I use it again?

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.090
Would I use it every day?

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.810
Did it get better
for me over time?

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:58.090
Can it pick up where I left off?

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.460
Like, did it do what I expected?

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.890
Did it act as advertised?

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.280
Right?

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.980
All of these kind
of things are things

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.200
that we're thinking about when
we're thinking-- so I'm not

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.360
saying that, like, we're
marking this down and then

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.830
feeding into ranking directly.

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.140
What I'm talking about here
is really about featuring.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.280
But when you think
about your experience

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.240
and before you hit
Submit, OK, you

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.770
should be asking
yourself these questions.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.890
And if you have anyone
that can dog food for you,

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.780
whether you work at
a big organization

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.840
where you have a big, you know,
trial and testing or dog food

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.590
program, or you've got
a buddy that can try out

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.530
your app for you,
ask these questions

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.060
to them and to yourself.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.890
If you went through
your entire experience

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.880
and it did not make you
smile, or it did not

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.900
do something useful for you,
or you did not learn anything,

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.410
you may have a little ways to
go before this is going to be,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.520
like, taking the world by storm.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.410
What you see in
gray or black down

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.390
at the bottom is also
some things that we

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.180
look at in terms of
conversational hygiene, right?

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.440
So was I, as a user, just
confused at any point?

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.590
Especially when you're talking
about a voice driven product,

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.940
if you don't know what to
say, it's really difficult

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.080
to recover, right?

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.889
So when you do--

00:22:14.889 --> 00:22:16.680
when you are building
for the phones, like,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.350
those suggestion tips
are just really critical.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.760
Like, help the user out.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.900
You know, when you're talking
about the eyes-free experience,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.090
get them to a place
where they kind of know

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.870
how they should be responding.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.530
Did I have to repeat myself?

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:33.630
Did it feel slow?

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.700
And I'm not talking about,
like, system slowness.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.200
Like, of course,
you know, everybody

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.850
wants everything to be faster.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.600
But really, did it feel like
your app responded slowly?

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.069
Really think about that.

00:22:44.069 --> 00:22:46.110
And then finally, there
are two pieces of hygiene

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.350
that if you went to any
of the VUI design talks,

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.630
I'm positive that you heard.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.710
And we refer to them as
no match and no input OK?

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.990
No match is when the
user says something

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.570
that your app didn't expect.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:01.530
What did you do?

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.574
Did you, like,
reframe the question

00:23:03.574 --> 00:23:05.490
so that they felt like
they had another chance

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.630
to answer nicely?

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:11.220
Or did you just repeat rote
exactly what you said before?

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.580
That has a really big
impact in how your app feels

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.200
conversationally.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.030
When the user either
didn't respond fast enough,

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.240
and so there's a time out,
or just you misheard them

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.364
for whatever reason, right?

00:23:22.364 --> 00:23:23.880
So you didn't--
you got a no input.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.580
You did not hear their response.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.010
Did you have a good
conversation-only appropriate

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.150
recovery from that?

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.090
So please, please think
about those things

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.450
before you're thinking about,
like, how many action phrases

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.760
can I load into
my action package

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.965
that I trigger all the time?

00:23:41.965 --> 00:23:44.340
That's, like, not the right
way to think about it, right?

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.680
The right way to think
about it is, give us

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.040
some things that you think
are really, really salient,

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.680
we will notice if you give us
a bunch of things that are not

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.106
really salient, right, and
make your app something

00:23:56.106 --> 00:23:57.980
that people really want
to come back and use.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.020
There are a ton of
design resources.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.130
Absolutely a ton.

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.892
And some great talks
here that you can find.

00:24:06.892 --> 00:24:09.350
And there are also a ton of
resources on generally building

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.190
assistant apps.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.730
And so I really, I look forward
to seeing what you all do.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.600
I'm not going to leave you
with a basic checklist, right?

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.190
So four items, four calls
to action for you to do.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:27.309
To be more discoverable, do
that branded verification.

00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:28.850
I know that kind of
sounds like we're

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.100
just checking on who you
are, but really, we're

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.680
talking about connecting
your other properties if you

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.110
have them so that
we can get some more

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.520
information from that, right?

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.230
So get some signal from that.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.100
Number two, just create a really
nice informative directory

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.810
listing.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:45.920
Make it relevant.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.400
Give it actionable language.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.860
These are actions.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.447
Number three, I know
you're all going

00:24:51.447 --> 00:24:52.530
to add the action phrases.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:56.160
Like, I am 100% sure.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.750
Do add relevant ones.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.280
We observe things like,
well, this triggered

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.060
and it flopped,
or this triggered

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.960
and it was really
successful, right?

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.917
And as the ecosystem
matures, we'll

00:25:06.917 --> 00:25:08.500
get better and better
at that as well.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.190
So please be
thoughtful in these,

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.800
but really, really pay
some attention here.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.765
And finally, like,
make something awesome.

00:25:17.765 --> 00:25:19.390
Make something that
people want to use.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.430
And that when you do that,
like, qualitative evaluation

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.920
for yourself, you're
like, this was hilarious,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.810
or this was essential.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.810
This is something I need
to do every day, right?

00:25:32.999 --> 00:25:34.290
Create something that you love.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.370
That's it.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:38.870
Thank you.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.620
