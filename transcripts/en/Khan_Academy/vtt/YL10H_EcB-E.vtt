00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.660
Welcome back.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.960
I'm now going to take a slight
tangent and cover a topic

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.910
that, I think, this is probably
the single most

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.860
important video that really
anyone can watch.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.080
I go to all of these parties
where I go see family.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.980
And my wife and I right now,
we live in Northern

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.570
California.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.000
And we're renting.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.120
And I like to point
out, by choice.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.360
And I have family members,
why don't you buy?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.300
You're at that stage in
life, that's a major

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.150
milestone, all of this.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.380
There's a lot of pressure
to buy.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.180
And when I tell friends,
I tell them I'm

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.720
not going to buy.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.450
Because I think I'm pretty
convinced, almost 100%

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.170
convinced, that housing prices
are going to revert back.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.100
And I'm going to do a bunch
of presentations to

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.690
justify why they will.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.810
But then my friends, they'll
just throw out the statement

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.870
that I hear from them, that
you hear from real estate

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.030
agents, because obviously
they want you to buy.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.850
Well, isn't buying always
better than renting?

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.530
And I think that kind of common
wisdom comes out of the

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.270
notion of, when you have a
mortgage or when you borrow

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.490
money to live in a house, every
month that money that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.580
you give to the bank is kind
of going into savings.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.760
That's the perception.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.590
While when you rent,
that money's just

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.160
disappearing into a vacuum.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.410
In this video I'm going to work
through that assumption,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.360
and see if that actually
is the case.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.050
So let's say I have a choice.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.300
Let's say there are
two houses.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.940
This is house number one.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.870
And this is house number two.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.670
And let's say that they're
identical houses.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.910
These are three bedroom, two
bath, townhouses some place in

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.960
Silicon Valley, which
is where I live.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.090
And I want to live in
one of these houses.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.970
I'm indifferent as to which
house I live in, because they

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.770
are identical.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.300
So living in them is the
identical experience.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:54.320
I can rent this house
for $3,000 a month.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.890
Or I could buy this house
for $1 million.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.100
And let's say that in my bank
account right now, let's say I

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.970
have $250,000 cash.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.979
So let's see what happens
in either scenario.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.470
Let's see how much money
is being burned.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.760
So in this scenario
what happens?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.400
I'm renting.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.060
So in a given year, let's just
see how much money comes out

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.910
of my pocket.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.790
So in a given year
I pay $3,000.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.455
$3,000 times 12 months,
so I lose $36,000.

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:30.270
So I'll put a negative
there, because that's

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.460
what I spend in rent.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.550
$36,000 per year in rent.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.640
And then of course I
have that $250,000.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.240
I'm going to put that into the
bank, because I have nothing

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.930
else to do with it.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.640
I didn't buy a house with it.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.480
And let's say that I can,
in the bank, let's say

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.210
I put it in a CD.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.800
And I get 4% on that.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.942
So let's see, 250, that's
what? $10,000, I think.

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:58.600
That's 0.04.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.800
Right, I get $10,000 in interest
a year on that.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.890
So I get $10,000.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.840
So plus $10,000 a year
in interest.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.890
So out of my pocket, for the
privilege of living in this

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.120
house, in Silicon Valley, with
beautiful weather, out of my

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.970
pocket every year
goes $26,000.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.780
So that's scenario one.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.210
So what happens if I give in
to the peer pressure of

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.890
family, and realtors, and the
mortgage industry, and I buy

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.230
this house for $1 million?

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.180
Well I only have $250,000, which
is more, frankly, than

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.110
most people who buy $1 million
houses have. But I have

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.330
$250,000 cash.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.550
So I need to borrow $750,000.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:57.970
So I take out a mortgage
for $750,000.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.630
And I'm going to do a slight
simplification.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.820
And maybe in a future
presentation, I'll do kind of

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.070
a more complicated one.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.830
In a lot of mortgages, when you
pay your monthly payment,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.930
most of your monthly payment,
at least initially, is the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.600
interest on the amount that
you're borrowing.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.800
And you pay a little bit
extra on that, to

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.080
bring this value down.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.850
That's called paying
off the principal.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.850
You can also take an
interest-only loan, but the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.779
component of the interest
is the same.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.710
Essentially, when you take a
traditional mortgage, kind of

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.640
a 30-year fixed, every month
you're paying a little bit

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.530
more than the interest, just
to take down the balance.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.750
But for the simplicity of this
argument, I'm just going to

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.110
say that we're doing an
interest-only mortgage.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.970
And then maybe with any
extra savings, I can

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.190
pay down the principal.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.440
And that's the same notion.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.090
And right now, if I do 25%
down, and I'm buying a $1

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.020
million house, I'll have to
take a $750,000 mortgage.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.450
I don't know what a
good rate is, 6%?

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:55.040
So let's say at 6% interest. So
to live in this house, how

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.350
much am I paying just
in interest?

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.830
Well I'm paying $750,000
times 6% a year.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:18.510
So $750,000 times 0.06 is equal
to $45,000 in interest.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.810
That's coming out
of my pocket.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.240
And of course, on a monthly
basis, that means in interest

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.870
per month, I'm paying,
just to get an idea.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.570
I'm paying about $3,700, $3,800
in interest a month.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.180
My mortgage actually might be
something like $4,000 a month.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.150
So I pay the interest. And then
I pay a little bit to

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.480
chip away at the whole
value of the loan.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.540
It takes 30 years to chip
away at the whole thing.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.670
And over time, the interest
component becomes less, and

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.540
the principal becomes more.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.440
But for simplicity, this is the
interest that I'm paying.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.420
$45,000 a year.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.570
And then of course at a party,
when I start to explain this,

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.740
it's like, ah-ha.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.220
But interest on a mortgage
is tax deductible.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.750
And what tax deductible means,
is that this amount of money

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.400
that I spend on interest
on my mortgage, I can

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.870
deduct from my taxes.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.890
I can tell the IRS that
I make $45,000 less

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.860
than I actually did.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.700
So if I'm getting taxed at,
let's say 30%, what is the

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.060
actual cash savings?

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.940
Well I'll save 30% of this.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.030
I'll have to pay $15,000
less in taxes.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.080
How does that work?

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.720
Well, think about it.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.070
Let's say I earned $100,000
in a year.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.980
And I normally have
to pay 30%.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.610
So I normally pay $30,000
in taxes.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:31.290
Right?

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.800
This is, if I didn't
have this great tax

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.410
shelter with this house.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.720
Now I have this interest
deduction.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.910
So now I tell the IRS
that I'm actually

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:46.800
making $55,000 a year.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.990
And let's say my tax
rate is still 30%.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.420
it actually will probably go
down since I'm -- but let's,

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.280
just for simplicity, assume my
tax rate is still $30,000.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:02.710
So now I'm going to pay $16,500
in taxes to the IRS.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.170
So how much did I
save in taxes?

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.640
So I saved $13,500 from taxes,
from being able to deduct this

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.030
$45,000 from my income.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:33.090
So let's say tax savings,
plus $13,500.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.410
Now what else goes into
this equation?

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.290
Do I get any interest
on my $250,000?

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.650
Well, no.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.880
I had to use that as part of the
down payment on my house.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.730
So I'm not getting
interest there.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.390
But what I do have to
do is, I have to

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.160
pay taxes on my property.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.340
In California, out here we have
to pay 1.25% in taxes, of

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.890
the value of the house.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.910
So what's 1.25%?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.270
So, taxes, this is
property tax.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.030
And that's actually tax
deductible too, so it actually

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.750
becomes more like 0.75% or 1%.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.540
So let's just say 1% just
for simplicity.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.610
Property taxes.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.200
So 1% times $1 million.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.930
That equals what?

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.100
1% of $1 million is
another $10,000 a

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.730
year in property taxes.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.310
And notice, I'm not talking
about what percent of my

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.490
mortgage goes to
pay principal.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.980
I'm just talking about money
that's being burned by owning

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.210
this house.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.460
So what is the net effect?

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:33.080
I have a $13,500 tax savings.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.049
I have to pay $10,000 --
actually I have to pay a

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.080
little bit more than that, but
we're getting a little bit of

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.960
income tax savings on
the deduction on

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.900
the property taxes.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.170
And then I actually have to pay
the $45,000 of interest

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.270
that just goes out the door.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:52.320
So I'm paying $41,500.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.140
Notice, none of this $41,500
is building equity.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.560
None of it is getting saved.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.010
This is money that is
just being burned.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.680
So this is a completely
comparable

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.970
value to this $26,000.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.400
So in this example -- this
example is not that far off

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.590
from real values.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.950
Out here in the Bay area, I can
rent a $1 million house

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.700
for about $3,000.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.020
But in this situation I am
burning, every year $41,500,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.110
where I could just rent the same
house for $26,000 out of

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.360
my pocket, when I adjust
for everything.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.140
And then people a couple of
years ago said, oh, but houses

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.750
appreciate.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.000
And that's what would
make it up.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.940
But now you know, very recently
-- we know that

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.410
that's not the case.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.540
And in the next video, I'll
delve into this, and

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.480
a little bit more.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.080
I'll see you soon.
