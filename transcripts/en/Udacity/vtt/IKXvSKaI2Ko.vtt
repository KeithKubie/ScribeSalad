00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.630
So, that idea for how to rank webpages is

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.670
the same idea as how we measure popularity of people.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.820
But instead of thinking about friendships as the way

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.420
to measure popularity, what we're measuring is links on the

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.230
web. When one page has a link to another

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.030
page, well that indicates it's more likely that this other

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.560
page is popular, just like when someone is a friend,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.550
it indicates that the person they are friends with is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.920
more likely to be popular. So, the goal in ranking web

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.030
pages is to get a measure of how popular are pages,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.810
based on the other pages that link to it but we

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.150
have the same issue with popularity then not all links are

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.940
the same. That a link from a page that's really important

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.710
counts for a lot more than a link from a page

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.950
that is not important. So, if the New York Times has

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.950
a link to your page, that counts for a lot more than

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.690
if your mom sets up a web page and puts a

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.160
link to your page in it. Unless your mom is Lady

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.460
Gaga, in which case her link probably counts for more. So,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.630
another way of thinking about this is what we're trying to model

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.080
is a random web surfer. So, our random web surfer has

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.170
some set of pages that they know about. And those pages

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.720
have links to other pages. Some pages might have a lot

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.170
of links. Some pages might just have one link. Some pages might

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.010
have no links. So, one way to think about this

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.140
is that we're trying to model a random web surfer. The

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.720
web surfer starts knowing about some pages. And she picks

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.060
one page at random, let's say she picks this page. And

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.360
then, when she's on that page, she picks a random

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.950
link and follows that links. Whoops, this was a bad starting

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700
page. It actually has no out links. So, then, she picks

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.590
another random page. Let's say she picks this one. She follows

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.870
the link from that page, and now she got to the

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.270
page with no links again. Let's say she picked a better starting

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.150
point. Let's say she randomly picked this one. Now she's got

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.460
two links to follow. She randomly picks one of those. She follows

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.510
it. She gets to a new page. She randomly picks a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.640
link from that page, in this case, it only had one, and

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.300
in this case, it seems we have a bit of a

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.400
problem, because all of the starting pages eventually lead into this one,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.050
which has no outgoing links. So, we'll think about how to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.700
solve that problem later, but we can think of what our

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.180
random web surfer is doing, is picking random pages, following links,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.570
and what we want to measure is the popularity of a page.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.690
And that's the probability that she reaches that given page, starting

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.170
from these random pages. So, if you did this over and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.440
over again, and you counted the number of times you reached

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.290
each page, that would give you a measure of that page's popularity.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.020
So, this is very similar to the popularity function. We're

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.150
going to define a function that we'll call the rank of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.930
the page. And, like the way we defined the popularity

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.060
function, it's going to have two inputs. It's going to have a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.010
time stamp, and it's going to have the page which we'll

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.980
use a URL for. And the output of rank will

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.030
be some number. Except for we'll define for time step

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.370
zero. This is our base case, and we're going to find all

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.680
the ranks have value one. We'll actually change

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.090
that shortly, but we'll start out think of it,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.780
all the ranks having value one, like we

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.400
did with the popularity scores. And then we'll define

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.230
the value of the rank at time step t for any given URL. Just like we defined

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.200
the popularity score. It's going to be the sum of

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.420
all the pages that are friends with this page,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.200
and what it means for our webpage to be friends

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.660
with another page is that it has a link to it.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.940
So, this is going to be for all the pages that

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.150
exist that have some link to that URL, or its friends.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.670
And so, we're going to go through each of those pages.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.390
We'll call them inlinks instead of friends. We're going to go through

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.170
those and we're going to sum up the ranks that we got

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.460
for those pages at time t minus one. So, this is

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.820
our first model of popularity on, of webpages. This is exactly

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.380
the same as the model we had of popularity for people.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.460
It's not going to work that well yet and one of the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.980
reasons it's not going to work that well is some pages

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.530
might have lots of links. And if a page has lots

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.090
of links, the value of each one of its links should

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.090
be diminished. It shouldn't have the same value as the page

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.510
that only has one link that links to this URL. Maybe that

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.850
should be the same case for a friend's popularity, if

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.670
someone has lots of friends, each friend is less valuable.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.459
Whereas someone who only has a small number of friends

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.850
has lots of time for each friend. So this is the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.330
way we're going to model web popularity. We don't want

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.090
to just give the same score to each link. We're

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.860
going to change this by dividing by the number of outlinks.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.700
So, if a page has many outgoing links, the value to

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.880
the pages that it links to is less for each page. So,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.700
a page that's just a long list of lots of links won't

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.710
have that much influence on the rankings. If a page only has

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.430
a few outgoing links, well then, they are worth more. So, what we are

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.290
going to do, is divide this by the number of out links from

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.550
p. So, each of the p pages, right? These will be the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.329
values of p, as they go through the inlinks of URL. We

00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:02.779
are going to sum up the rank that we got on the previous time

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.840
step and divide that by the number of out links.
