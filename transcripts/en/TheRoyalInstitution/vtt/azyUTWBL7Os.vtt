00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.730
 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.920
We'll just waft it under your
nose and you give me--

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.620
Oh, sweat.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.660
Smells awful.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.580
Musky.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.370
Not good.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.900
Not good.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.795
Another go.

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:27.760
No.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.100
Most people think that their
senses are quite reliable and

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.520
objective, so you would expect
that the same substance should

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.860
smell the same to different
people.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.430
It smells like flowers.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.750
Some people don't
smell anything.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.930
It smells good.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.180
This isn't always the case.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.090
For example, this stuff called
androstenone to some people

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.750
smells like vanilla or floral.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.530
Kind of foral.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.420
Vanilla.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.930
Vanilla.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.930
I think the men are all saying
vanilla, aren't they?

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.137
Hibiscus flower.

00:00:57.137 --> 00:00:57.634
Flower.

00:00:57.634 --> 00:00:58.630
Hibiscus.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.520
That's very specific.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.980
Thank you.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.150
I got it now, it's vanilla.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.170
Vanilla for you as well.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.630
OK.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.550
It's sweet vanilla.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.470
Really?

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.810
But to me it smells like
stale urine or

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.460
stale sweat or something.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.710
Unpleasant.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.548
 

00:01:16.548 --> 00:01:17.798
It's unpleasant.

00:01:17.798 --> 00:01:19.936
 

00:01:19.936 --> 00:01:21.186
Men's urinals.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:23.490
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.260
In fact, this does occur
naturally in human sweat.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.850
It also occurs in other
animals where it's a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.080
pheromone, so it attracts
members of the opposite sex.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.600
And the difference in perception
of this chemical is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.440
down to small variations
in the DNA of a gene on

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.506
chromosome 17.

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:43.210
That gene is OR7D4.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.930
 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.060
And this is just one example
of those tiny genetic

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.900
differences that change the
way we are and how we

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.650
perceive the world.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.830
OK so hands up if this
smells sweaty to you.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.080
And floral.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:20.317
