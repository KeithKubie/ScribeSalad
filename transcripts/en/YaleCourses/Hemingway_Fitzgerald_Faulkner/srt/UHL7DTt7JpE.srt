1
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,400
Um, so I was able to, um, uh,

2
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,260
come to an intersection,
uh,

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,140
last week and I really enjoy
the discussion very much.

4
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:23,880
So I look forward to coming
to all the sections and just,

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,840
um,
you know,

6
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:29,841
managing the faces to the names and
just hearing your voice and your ideas.

7
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:34,460
So it was a, it was a great
experience last masters there. Um,

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,620
and um,
uh,

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,720
once again just can't stress enough how
important it is to take advantage of the

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,520
writing center. Um, so today
we're going to go back, uh,

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,770
and I just want to refresh your memory
about some of the things that we've been

12
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,830
seeing about for whom the bell tolls.
Um,

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,760
those kinds of seven permutation
that we're looking at. In fact,

14
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:58,060
pretty much all semester.

15
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,090
So individual entitled voluntary versus
involuntary foreign was just not foreign

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,600
literate or not literate.
Um,

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,470
and on Thursday we were talking about,
um,

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,470
the distant home versus
the onsite environment.

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,660
And it turns out that,
um, they really are,

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,720
are two very distant homes and maybe
just two homes for rather when there's

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,060
Paris, uh, which isn't really a real home,

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,900
but it is a home in the sand.
The stat is something that he can,

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,130
he has the luxury of taking
completely for granted. Um,

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,510
and um, so that's one definition of
home, the place where you can work.

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,880
Unselfconsciously.
Um,

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,890
and the other home is a
more complicated place, um,

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,950
in the sense that maybe it's not even
a geographical locale where the kind of

28
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:56,970
emotional shelter that is given to him,
um,

29
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,690
bestowed upon him and
really by his grandfathers,

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,340
very heroic, um, presence
in his civil war.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,700
So it's 19th century home for him and he
needs that very much because of the non

32
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:16,900
home that is the 20th century.
Um,

33
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,580
I think that is really a
very sad fact about Robert.

34
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,220
And maybe it's true of some people,
you know,

35
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:26,260
sometimes it's true or some authors,
um,

36
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,370
that they really should have
that I've loved that, you know,

37
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:33,120
I feel that they really should
have existed in different
century and then things

38
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:36,470
would have been so much
easier for them. Um, rubber,

39
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:38,160
there's an exactly that kind of person,

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,130
but there is a sense that the
20th century has been very,

41
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:46,131
very hard on him and it's especially
hard on him because of the fact of his

42
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:52,011
father and really there's no more
central fact then what your parent was.

43
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,200
So this is the moment that
clears up a lot of things for us.

44
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:02,680
Why his own home is in some
sense a non home for him.

45
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,960
Um, so he got this gun by
that he, his pistol, uh,

46
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,240
there was his grandfather's
pissed off from the civil war, um,

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,790
that was misused by his own father.

48
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,280
And this is what Robert
does with that pistol.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,880
He climbed out on a rock and leaned over
and saw his face in the Stillwater and

50
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:26,140
saw himself holding the gun and then he
dropped it, holding it by the muscle.

51
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:31,141
And so I'd go down making bubbles until
it was just as big as a watch charm in

52
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,140
that clear water.
And then it was out of sight.

53
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,830
This is the best that he can do for his
father is to make his father disappear.

54
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,550
The extent of the contamination that his
father has brought upon the memory of

55
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:52,951
his grandfather can be wash
clean only when he becomes,

56
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,300
um,
no more than the bubble.

57
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,440
And then now even the bubble
anymore in that clear water.

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,730
Um,

59
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,730
it clearly goes back to
Hemingway's conception of
clan in of how one clears out

60
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:12,010
one's life and in our time
and, uh, the big 200 river.

61
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,370
Um, but I think that it also, uh,

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,500
within for whom the bell tolls,
it also looks forward to the moment,

63
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,260
a traumatic moment,
uh,

64
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,150
when someone else is looking at something
like a mirror and seeing his own

65
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:32,890
reflection and they just want to call your
attention to the very, uh, deliberate,

66
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,770
uh, composition of this
particular visual. Tableau.

67
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,720
Robert isn't just dropping the gun.
He has to go up there.

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,850
He used to see his own face.
He has to see himself holding the gun.

69
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,950
And it's that kind of, um,
almost narcissistic, uh,

70
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,480
observation of himself that Hemingway
is really fascinated by and the

71
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:59,860
psychological meaning of that. So we
can read all kinds of meaning, um,

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,900
into this particular scene and we'll
see it repeated by another person, um,

73
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,850
in equally traumatic moment. But here, um,

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,190
it seems that Robert Really has no parent.
Um,

75
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:18,270
he looks at the world and the only thing
that he can see his himself is almost

76
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:24,870
as if he's really an often has always
been an often all the time, uh,

77
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,560
because his father is really
can really be a father to him.

78
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,800
And so the act of dropping the gun,
um,

79
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,450
is in some sense only a real description
of what has long been a psychological

80
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:41,730
fact for Robin. Um, so all of this, um,

81
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,210
highlights the fact of how
important it is to die.

82
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,430
Well not just for yourself,

83
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:53,431
but also for other people for whom you're
deaf would also be consequential in

84
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,730
here. The biography of Hemingway
really becomes quite important.

85
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,420
Hemingway's on father Doctor Clarence
Hemingway died by his own hand.

86
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,500
Um,

87
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,240
and we know that Hemingway himself
also died by his own hands.

88
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,980
So in many ways for whom that belt hose
is because of the meditation head of

89
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:20,981
time to that moment when Hemingway would
have to decide what to do with his own

90
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:26,360
life. Um, and so this was a front
page news in the New York Times,

91
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,300
June 3rd,

92
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,280
1961 front page news Chicago should be in,
um,

93
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,240
and on July,
but 1961,

94
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,670
the interpretation of the death of
Hemingway was that it was accidental.

95
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,320
There was cleaning his gun
and the gun just went off. Um,

96
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,380
and this fiction lasted for five
years until 1966 when his widow,

97
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:57,690
Mary Hemingway, finally admitted
that no, actually the heat,

98
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:02,150
it just put the gun into his own
mouth and blew out his own brains. Um,

99
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,600
so it took five years for
their truth to come out.

100
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:09,980
And now they're are all kinds of, um,
theory. And that just last summer, um,

101
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,970
I think it was July,

102
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:15,440
there was a lot of speculation that
Hemingway might have died because he was

103
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:18,420
under such close surveillance by the FBI.
Um,

104
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,270
so that's just a new theory that
would be still be coming up, uh, in,

105
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,460
uh, 2011, um, so many
years after the death, um,

106
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,330
people will still continue to have
conjectures about why it was bad Hemingway

107
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:36,420
killed himself. But I think that
once the WHO has been the Asian, um,

108
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,300
is that he was just in very, very poor
health and he was not able to write.

109
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,380
Um, and I think that for rather department
is nothing more painful than that.

110
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,950
Something that would make life more
meaningless than not being able to write.

111
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,520
So this is a picture of him,
uh, fairly close to the end.

112
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:56,570
And this was a public appearance,
so he wasn't looking too bad,

113
00:07:56,571 --> 00:08:00,530
but we can sort of see that he really
wasn't looking well. And he was there.

114
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:04,220
It was a fishing competition in Castro.
Apparently one,

115
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:08,600
lots of trophies that Hemingway was
there to give him the trophies. Um,

116
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,010
but he really wasn't looking well.

117
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:15,011
So I think that that probably is the
simplest explanation that he no longer is

118
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:17,450
with he once was.

119
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,850
And he simply couldn't accept the fact
that there is this kind of a sharp

120
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:27,350
decline in, in, in, in his mental
abilities and physical abilities.

121
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,490
Um,

122
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,490
so this is the last image that I like
to show you of Hemingway is just we used

123
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,680
to write, um, and that is
the most important, uh,

124
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,600
place for him really in the
WHO. Well, um, and today, uh,

125
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:48,890
we'll talk about, um, thinking about
that, about how he ended his life.

126
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,490
We think about the varieties of dying,
um,

127
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,570
and then numerous ways by which people
and what's useful not to end the lives.

128
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:02,880
So Hemingway actually
covers the entire spectrum.

129
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,190
People who choose to die as well as
people who choose not to die, um,

130
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,400
and seeing what it means in each case.

131
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,690
So we'll begin by looking at,
um,

132
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,460
the central event in about hose,

133
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,790
the execution of the fascist.
Um,

134
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,420
and then we'll look at the
personal and or non and, uh,

135
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,830
various individuals beginning with the
neato whose name obviously is upon.

136
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,420
Um, and then the all women in the
Madrid market and then bombing,

137
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:37,430
which is a new phenomenon, um,
in the early 20th century. Um,

138
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,580
and then Robert's father again and
then Pablo, someone who refuses to die.

139
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,070
Um, but first of all, the
execution of the fascist. Um,

140
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:47,920
this,

141
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,920
we should remember this whole very
long episode is narrated by Palazzo.

142
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,040
Um, I hope that you guys will
talk about this in section,

143
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,050
what it means for a woman who's on the
Republican side to the recounting this

144
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:06,560
story, the execution of
her political enemies. Um,

145
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,780
and how she feels about us and why it is
the having chooses to have a woman tell

146
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:17,770
this story. So anyway, this is
[inaudible] speaking. Um, and how, um,

147
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,810
they are the, the gorillas, a
Republican gorillas have, um,

148
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,720
taken the town so they are going
to execute all the fascist.

149
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,720
And this is all engineered by Pablo.

150
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,920
He placed them in two lines as you would
place men for rope pulling contest or

151
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:41,451
as they stand in this city to watch the
ending of a bicycle road race with just

152
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:47,361
room for the cyclist to pass between or
as many as two to allow the passage of a

153
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,370
holy image in the procession.

154
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:56,150
Two meters was left between the lines
and they extended from the door of the

155
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,710
[inaudible] to mental clear across
the plaza to the edge of the cliff.

156
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:07,470
So that from the doorway of the unit
to Manto looking across the plaza,

157
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,220
one coming out with C,

158
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,680
two solid lines of people waiting for PLR.

159
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,720
This formation,

160
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:20,721
this particular visual tableau and was
against highly visual is emphasizing what

161
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:25,440
one would see coming out of
our unit to me until, um,

162
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,890
is two solid lines that
people vary all the way, um,

163
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,690
not inflamed by passion,
just doing what needs to be done.

164
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,310
And so all the metaphors
that Hemingway uses, um, uh,

165
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:42,870
actually rich ritualistic metaphors,
um,

166
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,520
something that is extremely well defined
were very well defined rules of the

167
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:47,850
game,

168
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,850
like rope pulling contests
or better yet a bicycle race.

169
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,310
Uh, not consider the violent
event, either of those,

170
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,590
um, or better, still more intensive.

171
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,720
Find a degree of ceremonious. Snus. Um,

172
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,660
is the procession with the whole
image of an icon going through.

173
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,230
So the three metaphors highlight the fact
that there is the equivalent of those

174
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,990
rituals,

175
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,180
a civic and religious rituals that would
be a political ritual of execution at

176
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:26,770
his most utopian,

177
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,820
the execution of your opponents,

178
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,880
which is a necessary thing.
In some cases,

179
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,150
the execution of your political
opponents should be as ritualistic as

180
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,900
ceremonious,

181
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,310
as free of passion as all
those other ritualistic events.

182
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,580
So this is very utopian moment in for
whom the bell tolls and if it could be

183
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:57,410
held at this level, then the
Spanish civil war willing to Calavo,

184
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,370
they in fact be a good
war or beautiful war.

185
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,440
And she tends to think of those terms.

186
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,100
And sometimes in alums we'll
talk about that. But in any case,

187
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,340
this is [inaudible] very
utopian description of what
a war could be and what you

188
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,370
could do to your enemies without
debasing them, without abusing them,

189
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,040
even though you do kill them.
Um,

190
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,100
and I try to find an image of the two
lines of people with the people who have

191
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,640
been executed passing of group. Um,
and I just couldn't find an image.

192
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,570
I guess it's not surprising new having
nobody will be taking pictures at that

193
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:33,850
moment. Um, but as it turns out,

194
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,090
one major art is actually
has numerous paintings. Um,

195
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,390
they seem to be alluding to that kind of
information. And is Robert Motherwell,

196
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,050
um, major 20th century artists.
And not only does he want,

197
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,340
he actually has numerous,
from the fifties to the seventies,

198
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,280
he produced numerous paintings all
call Lsu to the Spanish with her,

199
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,280
like with his two low inflammation.

200
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,040
So this is an early one that was
done in I think it was 1954. Um,

201
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,020
and this one is much later.
He numbers of them.

202
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,640
This one is in the Metropolitan
Museum. Um, and uh,

203
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,880
this one is one or two and I
don't remember what date it was,

204
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:17,650
but obviously later. Um, and this
one is quite late in the 70s,

205
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,210
um, one 10 now in the series
and is in the Guggenheim Museum.

206
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,620
So, uh, clearly, um,

207
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,610
Hemingway's talking about something
that is also recognized by other people.

208
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,410
Um, as in many ways the kind
of the Utopian moment, uh,

209
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,000
of the war when violence
is both a executed, uh,

210
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:44,950
but not allow to go to get out of hand.
But um,

211
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,900
having way also shows us that in
fact that that is not a sustainable,

212
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,960
you told here that that
violence kept within limits.

213
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:59,420
Violence kept within bonds,
um,

214
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,410
is not likely to last for the
whole duration of the war.

215
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,180
So,
um,

216
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,340
PLR refers to this as drunken
this coming into allies,

217
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,220
the people of this time
aura as kind as they are,

218
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,000
as they can be cruel and
they have a natural tendency,

219
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,140
they have natural sense of justice and
a desire to do that, which is right.

220
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,540
But cruelty had entered into the lines
and also in drunken is what the beginning

221
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:34,541
of drunkenness and the lines were not
as they were when Donald Benito had come

222
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:39,020
out in Spain.
Drunken is when reduced,

223
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,840
but other elements than wine.

224
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,810
It's a thing of great ugliness.

225
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,610
So already we're beginning to see the
language of beauty and ugliness coming

226
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:54,611
into the situation where it seems
that moral judgment is in play.

227
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,610
So polite is referring to real drunk
people who asked for people who are drunk

228
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,530
drunks in the,
in that episode.

229
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,320
But she was also referring to
another kind of drunk in is, um,

230
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,780
which is to be drawn with maybe
in the desire vendors, um,

231
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,290
drunk with your own
sense of momentary power,

232
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,180
absolute power over someone drunk.

233
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,150
Would you ability to bring about absolute
deep basement, um, in your opponent.

234
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,330
All those things can make
people in new created.

235
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,340
And so Hemingway is
really talking about him.

236
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,140
[inaudible] he's taught me about
different forms of inebriation, um,

237
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,200
and how they can all work to
break down this stability,

238
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,370
all otherness as their loneliest lists
of work. Really odd to be, you know,

239
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:45,170
more than the ritual. So, you know,

240
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:50,171
this is a breakdown of ritual that for
Pella marks the beginning of the chaos

241
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:55,130
and the modifier thems, um,
that takes over the scene. And,

242
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,800
um, so it just, because
we're talking so much about,

243
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,110
she just talks about early news.
Um,

244
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,350
and in many ways she's
inviting us to think about the,

245
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,300
both the ethics but also the
aesthetics and killing, um,

246
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,390
a book that is a person into that kind
of thinking is still scariest book on

247
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:18,581
beauty and being just in her argument is
that beauty is actually very important

248
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,480
consideration. Justice, um,
that the sense of proportion,

249
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,060
the sense of balance,
the sense of symmetry,

250
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,950
all those ideas that
we associate with you.

251
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,950
They should also be concepts that we
consider when we think about crime and

252
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:37,460
punishment, whether the punishment
is commensurate with the time.

253
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:41,830
So it's very interesting argument. Um,
and not really just about, you know,

254
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,420
not just about execution
of political prisoners,

255
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,380
but thinking about justice in general.
Um,

256
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,470
so just keep that in mind
as we go with a laugh. Um,

257
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,320
to talk more about the
breakdown of the line.

258
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,380
There's some drunken yeah.

259
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,630
Guillermo from the Lions imitating
the high cracked boys of his wife.

260
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,050
And Dawn Guillermo rushed to what the man,

261
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,070
the blindingly with tears now running
down his cheeks and the man hit him hard

262
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:15,330
and tries to phase,
which is Flowjo.

263
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,460
And Angelia Mo sat down from the force
of the blow and sat there crying,

264
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,500
but not from fear while they're drunk,

265
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:27,501
had speed and when drunk had jumped on
top of him Australia shoulders and beaten

266
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:30,670
with the bottle. Um, I,

267
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,370
my reading is not even doing justice to
just how horrendous the scene is. Um,

268
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,430
and I think that the reason that Hemingway
released singles out this moment,

269
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,970
um,

270
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,800
is in fact that incommensurability
between the punishment and the prime.

271
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,960
We know in fact and philosophy,

272
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,940
very careful to tell us that Guillermo
is not the worst or the fascist. In fact,

273
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:58,650
he is not rich. He doesn't own
anything he owns within those shop.

274
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,540
Um, he's, um,

275
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,690
he is a fascist because of
his wife because his wife
is religious and so he just

276
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,090
comes a fast as to humor
her. Um, so he really is,

277
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,550
is the last person who ought to be
executed under those circumstances.

278
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,380
And these also the last person who are
today in Malawi in this particular way,

279
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,910
um, this various kinds of execution that
doesn't have to be this kind of very

280
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,950
brutal, um, kind of, uh,

281
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,910
debasement of the person that
just very groovy mockery.

282
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,680
This is really one pillar means that
these people are naturally kind,

283
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:38,020
but they also capable of great crows.
Hey,

284
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:43,310
and this is the moment when we see
that crow to dramatize. So it's,

285
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,250
it's not even the killing of Guillermo
is the making fun of him. Um,

286
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,530
and um, and just the
whole treatise, the, Eh,

287
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,710
the scenario engineer,
um,

288
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,490
in such a way as to bring about the
maximum degradation on the part of glory,

289
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:05,280
Yam or this is what makes
this thing so unbearable.

290
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,300
And so for Pella, this is
the absolute vote point, um,

291
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,620
of the, of, of the whole, uh, maybe
over the whole Spanish that will,

292
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:18,260
up to that point. Although she
doesn't, she can look into infusion.

293
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,220
She doesn't know it's the
come, uh, but in any case, um,

294
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:27,350
this is the moment when all of a sudden
everything seems to be going the wrong

295
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:32,700
way and it is a turning
point for the worst for Hila.

296
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,010
I myself have felt much emotion
at the shooting of the Guardia,

297
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,540
so they'll buy Pablo polasse.

298
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,170
It was a thing of great ugliness,

299
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,160
but I had thought if
this is how it must be,

300
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,580
this is how it must be.
And at least there was no cruelty,

301
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,490
only the depriving of life,

302
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,520
which as we all have learned in this
year as is the thing of ugliness,

303
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,190
but also a necessity to do if we are
to win and to preserve the republic.

304
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,730
So it's a very complex bit of reasoning
here and it seems that a lot is actually

305
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:17,080
disagreeing with scary,
so scary things.

306
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:21,520
Then there's almost a kind of a perfect
match between Billy and justice, um,

307
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,940
that work. We, you know, mine's,
I not so much in the physical eye,

308
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,830
but in our minds eye in our mind.
Um,

309
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,990
what we recognize now Myers ISB beautiful
would also be just that there's that

310
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:39,670
kind of balance and symmetry but is making
a distinction between something that

311
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:44,671
is ugly and something that is morally
represent heritable and something that is

312
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,980
pooled. Are they calling necessary.
So those are the three clans,

313
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:51,160
concepts that are in play
in her head and for her,

314
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,890
something that is political,

315
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:58,710
politically necessary can also be ugly.
And Dennis,

316
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,050
okay,
so she can take ugliness.

317
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,760
She doesn't welcome, she doesn't
love it, but she can take it.

318
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,230
It is the quality as she can take.
Um,

319
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,870
and so based on bad distinction,

320
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,880
it is the fact that the
[inaudible] had entered the lines,

321
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:23,140
um, that cruise he had
enter into a vice for her.

322
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,530
That is the measure of just how much
the Spanish civil war has been corrupted

323
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,690
from within that
basically it has gone bad.

324
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,670
And that is a phrase that had been way
uses quite a bit as well in foamed about

325
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:44,671
hose Pablo is someone who has gone
bad and the Spanish civil war,

326
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:48,940
the Republican cause is
something that has gone back.

327
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,760
So the final reflection,
uh, from PLR bill,

328
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,240
I could not sleep that night.

329
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,740
And I got up and sat in a chair and
looked out the window and I could see the

330
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:05,440
square in the moonlight where the
lines had been and across the square,

331
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,150
the tuition money in the moonlight and
the darkness of the shadows and the

332
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:13,610
benches bright too in the
moonlight and the scandal bar,

333
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:18,070
those shining and beyond the edge of
the cliff where they had all been thrown

334
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,720
and there was no song, the splashing
of the water and the fountain.

335
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,070
And I sat there and I thought,
you have the gun badly.

336
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,110
So she's arriving at that work,

337
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,800
which for her is to Altoona where
the judgment, not ugly but bad,

338
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:41,110
um, that this is her
verdict on her own psi. Um,

339
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,380
so hello, of course is not
speaking for Hemingway. Um,

340
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,560
but I think that she has a lot
of authority. Um, and so, um,

341
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,380
somebody who pin is something that,
um, we should take very seriously,

342
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,390
um, at work. Um, those cruelty in any war,

343
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,350
you know, not just suspend this a whirl,
but first of all, war, second world war,

344
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:06,450
especially as a warm
up. I agree. Cruisy um,

345
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,030
at what point does cruelty
rented that side not justifiable,

346
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:15,500
and it actually isn't winning side,
maybe not justifiable. So, uh,

347
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,180
from there,
um,

348
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,590
from this kind of large scale
meditation on the Justice of war,

349
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:25,980
whether there could be a just
war or at what point, uh,

350
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,300
this ball was become unjust,
um,

351
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,560
from that Nasco macro, uh, meditation.

352
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,130
Um, let's move on now to
thinking about dying, um,

353
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,280
as a much more personal, uh,
phenomenon. Uh, and also, uh,

354
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,230
choice quite often.
Um,

355
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:50,090
having ways for interested in both
in people dying in voluntarily, uh,

356
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,460
but also in people.
Um,

357
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:57,490
choosing to live on voluntarily even
though living on might not be a very

358
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:03,590
beautiful thing, uh, might not
even be actually an ethical thing.

359
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,090
Whether that is a kind of a
funny thing to say. Uh, but, um,

360
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,410
the,

361
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:14,410
he's only seems to be really thinking
about looking forward to his own and all

362
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,000
this, uh, episodes, but beginning
with the ball, Fido, uh,

363
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,680
finito so this is someone who is already,
um,

364
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,800
his career is over at this
point. He's gone. His last car,

365
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,100
the last bull fight, and
this is the ceremony, uh,

366
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,670
celebrating the end of his career and
his retirement and his glorious career.

367
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:41,210
Up to this point,

368
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,620
finito did not eat much because here we
see if Apollo taxo a blow from the flat

369
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:54,671
of the Horn when he had gone in to kill
in this last corridor of the year is our

370
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,740
hoser.
So the president of the club,

371
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,850
which at the end of the speech
and then everybody cheering him,

372
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:05,930
he stood on a chair and
reached up and anti the court,

373
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,320
the bound purple shroud over the head
and the head of the ball was as though he

374
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,610
were alive,
his far,

375
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:19,611
it was curly as Enlive and his nostrils
were open and his eyes were bright and

376
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:23,910
he was there looking straight as finito.

377
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,130
Everyone shouted and applauded and
Finito some further back in the chair in.

378
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,320
And everyone was quiet and
looking at him and he said, oh no,

379
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,240
and looking at the ball and pull
further back. And then he said, no,

380
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,420
very loudly and if big blob of blood
came out and he didn't even put up the

381
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:52,281
Napkin and a slit down his chin
and he was still looking at a goal.

382
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,130
There's a lot of looking in Hemingway,
we can write up,

383
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,370
you guys can write a great paper just
by looking at the dynamics of looking,

384
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,680
the, the soothing, the gaze
that we cast upon someone else.

385
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,550
And sometimes the gaze that
they cast back at us. Um,

386
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:13,610
quite often there's a kind of a
reciprocal process and here it is indeed a

387
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:19,161
reciprocal process for NATO is looking
at the ball and the ball is looking at

388
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:21,930
him. Um, even though was a dead,

389
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:27,050
it doesn't matter that boom walk and look
back at Youtube and it seems that here

390
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:31,020
Ashley, um, it is not with the Ido.

391
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:33,780
This thing is not a mirror image.

392
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:36,420
And that's what's so
heartbreaking about it.

393
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,870
It would have been great if it had been
a mirror image because what he sees in a

394
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:47,670
ball, it's actually a board
and a full vigor of life.

395
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,030
This ball, even though it's dead, um,

396
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:56,100
he's more alive than when he
was alive, it seems, um, his,

397
00:27:56,101 --> 00:28:00,750
for his curly hair, um, his nostrils
are open, his eyes are bright.

398
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,370
He's just a great spectacle. Um,
and more than that, his element,

399
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:09,550
he seems to be in doubt
with live even after death.

400
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,460
And so if this were a mirror image,

401
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,650
this ought to have been through needle
in his prime with life when he was a

402
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,070
great the door when he
wouldn't be coughing glove,

403
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,450
when he will be able to eat instead of
now and he can eat anything because of

404
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:32,430
the damage that's been done to this.
So if this were a mirror image,

405
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,560
vanilla would have been young again.

406
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:37,140
But we all know that
that's not going to happen.

407
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,800
And so Hemingway is clearly
punning on the worth and you know,

408
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,500
this is a man who was finished when the
man is finished in this particular way.

409
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,813
Um,

410
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,820
is it better or worse for him to be
still alive when it have been better?

411
00:28:56,761 --> 00:29:00,120
If he had been killed earlier,
just like the ball,

412
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,900
then he would have been preserved
and at the maximum height,

413
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,540
high point of his life.

414
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,430
So I mean I think that is not the kind
of thinking that actually we want to

415
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:12,540
intelligent all the
time. Um, but it is, um,

416
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,350
something that I think that Hemingway
has to, it takes very serious seriously,

417
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,820
obviously.
Um,

418
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,880
and so for him this was a kind of a
comic tragic comic moment of survival.

419
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,640
Yes.
I mean Nathan Ito is hanging on there.

420
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,060
He's not about to this fashion itself
voluntarily. It's going to hang on. Um,

421
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,280
but it's a very dubious
kind of hanging on.

422
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,810
And the only redeeming thing that we
can say about it is that it's funny.

423
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,600
It's conical. So once again, the
only way that we can take this,

424
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:48,120
we can swallow their stomach. It is
by saying it is a comical moment. Um,

425
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,330
and for whom and about hose.

426
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:53,380
And there's another equally tragic comic,

427
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,890
I would say mostly comic moment,
um, in formed about those,

428
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,810
about something hanging on with using
the die even though they had finished as

429
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:04,440
Finito is awesome finish.
Um,

430
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,230
this is PLR talking to um,
to uh,

431
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,290
Robin about some old about the smell of
death and then he doesn't know what that

432
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:18,291
smells like and she tells him to go to
the market and you must go down the hill

433
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,670
imagery to the planting the two lado
early in the morning to method era and

434
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:29,950
stand there on the web paving where
there's a fog for the mercenaries and wait

435
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:34,750
for the old women who go before they
like to drink the blood of the bees that

436
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:35,584
are slaughter.

437
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,220
When such an old woman comes out of the
two Darrow holding her shawl around her

438
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,781
with her face,

439
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:48,781
gray and an eyes hollow and the whiskers
of age on a Chin and on her cheeks sat

440
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:55,690
in a Wetson wider foo phase as the
Sprouse grow from the seed of the bean,

441
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:00,910
not bristles, but pails, routes,
sprouts in a death of a phase.

442
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,040
Put your arms ties around her English
and holder to you and kiss her on the

443
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:09,160
mouth.
And you will know the second part,

444
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,790
that voter isn't made up.
Um,

445
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,720
I definitely think this is in this quite
a bit of he ain't going on. I mean,

446
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:21,400
you know, oh, people, male and
female kind of look bad. Um,

447
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:24,850
but Hemingway seems completely fixated.
Um,

448
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:28,480
how bad or women look.
Um,

449
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:33,100
and especially the bean
sprouts growing on the face.

450
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,650
Um, it's sort of, you know,

451
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,570
and I think that that's why it sort of
comic and it's okay because of that,

452
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,760
um, that, um,

453
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:49,050
that actually lots of very well known
all the women have this kind of whiskers

454
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,520
on the phases. Um, and it's,
you know, it's just a fact.

455
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,540
And,

456
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,340
but for Hemingway it seems to be kind
of a reproach on the go women that they

457
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:04,220
should have this rove
on, on the faces, um,

458
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,050
and that in many ways, um,
are going against nature.

459
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,090
Then suddenly they have come men rather
than women who have whiskers on the

460
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,600
phases and so on. Um, and so they
really ought to have died earlier. Um,

461
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,610
instead of allowing this unnatural
phenomenon to happen to them. Um, I mean,

462
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,620
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's really
very small incident, but nonetheless,

463
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,360
the count of female counterpart
to the Finito story.

464
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,680
Um,

465
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,360
and it just wanted to stop here for a
moment and talk a little bit about in the

466
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:39,650
connections between Hemingway and Fisher,
because in fact,

467
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,490
used seeing this phenomenon before,
uh,

468
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,160
of a kind of unnatural grove that
is almost a parody of nature.

469
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,340
So we've just had this tragic,
um,

470
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,640
calming being Sprouse on a human face.
And,

471
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,760
um, actually in Fitzgerald, uh,

472
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,820
we have a kind of non comic version of
that in the great Gatsby in the Valley of

473
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:04,520
the ashes with the ashes growing.

474
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,550
Like we've now you the
passage of the moment. Um,

475
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:12,580
but Hemingway also has the kind of non
comic hello to the Fitzgerald version,

476
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,000
which is also kind of the preparer
they have nation that we'll look at.

477
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,390
But first,
um,

478
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,470
something that is almost like the Marcus
thing of the bean sprouts in the great

479
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:26,840
gas Gatsby.
This is a valley of ashes,

480
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:32,310
a fantastic farm where ashes grow like
wheat into ridges and hills and quote has

481
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,803
gotten right.

482
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:41,480
So if his Gerald's was talking about
some kind of grotesque vegetation that is

483
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,180
made up of the animate and inanimate.

484
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:47,560
And in many ways Hemingway is talking
about exactly the same thing that bean

485
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:50,080
sprouts. Um, the women
are almost inanimate.

486
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:55,070
They really ought to be in that mood is
a, uh, is a caricature of the animal.

487
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,970
They are animate.
Um,

488
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,120
but in any case it is the two will
couldn't mingling of the elements and the

489
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:06,500
inanimate they he's talking about and
that Fitzgerald is also talking about.

490
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:11,501
So I'm just really curious
that the organic inorganic
mixed in this way for both

491
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:18,130
authors, um, for, I would say
that for, for Fitzgerald is, is,

492
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,250
is very hard to see this as comic
and all on me didn't try very hard,

493
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:26,360
but this is just not that funny is,
is um,

494
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,470
is dominance is, was to a tragedy. Um,

495
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:34,100
but Hemingway also has,
um,

496
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,070
a completely non comic,
uh,

497
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:42,130
parallel to that of something
that is almost a parody of nature.

498
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:47,741
Except that it doesn't take the form
of bean sprouts in is a human invention

499
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:53,930
that looks like the work of nature.
That's something else.

500
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,140
So this is about the bombing of the
El Sordo band on the top of the hill.

501
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,170
They'd been a chase to the top of the
hill and they basically kept their bio

502
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,050
firing power the enemy,
and they on the top of the hill.

503
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:13,460
So there being just being bombed,
the maximum,

504
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,530
one of the efficiency for the bonds.
Then through the hemorrhaging of the gun,

505
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,700
there was the whistle of
the air splitting of the,

506
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:27,190
and then the red black roar to Irv rode
under his knees and then waste up to hit

507
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,160
him in the face and then do it and bits
of rock with falling all over and the

508
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,580
nausea was lying on him and
the gun was lying on him.

509
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,860
But he was not bad because the whistle
came again and to go of wrote on the him

510
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,933
with the roar.

511
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,920
Then they came again and earth lodge
under his valley and one side of the

512
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:54,820
hilltop grows into the air and fell
slowly over them. Why did they,

513
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,210
supposedly it is bombs dropped by
all those bombers that we saw, right?

514
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,460
The Hind Co's and the fear
that's the German hung clothes,

515
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,110
Italian and dropping the
bombs. Um, in this case,

516
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,990
I think there's just the Italian bombers.
Um,

517
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,020
but the way that this moment of bombing
is described three times in this passage

518
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:21,620
is that to earth is wising up and
hitting the gorilla band who are,

519
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,010
uh, everyone from miss
killed in this bombing. Um,

520
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,170
it is the fact that the earth seems
to be conspiring with the bombers and

521
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:39,411
hitting the human beings that
it has nurtured artist's time.

522
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,400
That is the outlet in so, and
as the ultimate injury, um,

523
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,100
that the Spanish Patterson's,

524
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,370
they live on the Earth Day thing that
earth is on their side and to have the

525
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,040
earth suddenly joining
the side of the enemy.

526
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,370
It's about the worst thing
that could happen. Um,

527
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,170
and so this is the cruelty of
the description of that study.

528
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,750
Included is very much coming
from Hemingway himself.

529
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,950
He didn't have to describe the
bombing as the action of the earth,

530
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:13,590
the earth rising up and
hitting all these human being.

531
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,210
He doesn't have to
describe them in his way.

532
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,540
He's describing the incident in this way
deliberately to highlight the fact that

533
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,210
in which nature has been
perverted by human action,

534
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,720
the modern technology has proved really
nature so that nature is no longer a

535
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:35,290
place where human beings can be
[inaudible] is that nature is something of

536
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,330
itself, is a weapon that can
be used against human beings.

537
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,530
Um,

538
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:45,530
and what is also true
about this particular who
realignment of the Earth with

539
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:52,641
the anime is that it reaches back and
retrospectively and retro actively we rice

540
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:00,090
and ionizers and earlier moment because
this is not the first time that we hear

541
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:03,960
about earth rolling or moving up.
In fact,

542
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:07,430
one of their most famous
little detail from, um,

543
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,250
the phone about houses that
when you have good stats,

544
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:13,790
supposedly the earth move under your,
um,

545
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:17,550
and this is what Pella wants to get the
information that allows us to get from

546
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:22,200
Maria to make sure that, um, that
everything is fine. Um, that this,

547
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,880
that this in fact happened over move.
Maria said, not looking at a woman,

548
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,440
truly it was a thing I cannot
tell the for you in glaze.

549
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,100
The law looked at Robert
Jordan. Don't lie. Yes,

550
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:38,980
he said truly good.
[inaudible] good.

551
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,333
That's downtime.

552
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:45,630
So this is back in page one 74,
um,

553
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,330
the earth moving,
it's all on the human side.

554
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,470
And for someone who is a very short life,

555
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,080
everyone seems to know that Robin Meyers,
we have a very short life.

556
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,290
For someone who's going
to have a furniture life,

557
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:02,560
having that experience is very important.
So on one 74,

558
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,090
[inaudible] 74,
um,

559
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:10,170
the earth moving has one connotation
and the cruelty of what happens on page

560
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,680
three 21 is that it completely,

561
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,040
we rice that earlier scene and the
size of a completely different,

562
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,550
in fact the opposite meaning to the movie.

563
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,830
So this is worth having ways of,

564
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,940
that's quite brutal narrative,
um,

565
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,860
can do is that even something
that seems to be safely concluded,

566
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,300
um, you know, that earth moving for, um,

567
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:45,040
Robert and uh,
Maria,

568
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,840
even though that is safely
conclude it in the past,

569
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,890
it is actually not safe from a
subsequent where you're writing and a

570
00:39:55,601 --> 00:40:00,010
reassignment of meaning. Um, so, um, that,

571
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,690
that the meaning of the earth
moving clearly is in flux. Maybe,

572
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,980
uh, maybe it's, it could be
either way or maybe later event.

573
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:11,680
Ashley can completely erased early.

574
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:15,300
Meaning I think we have to decide
for ourselves to what extent page,

575
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,290
truthfully one can undo that
earlier, uh, Utopian moment,

576
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,550
uh,

577
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:26,550
but want to talk about now talk about
two other things that are associated with

578
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,850
dying and not dying.
Um,

579
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,860
both hinting on the work
called body Howard. Um,

580
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,870
the first actually goes
back to Robert's father. Um,

581
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,180
and for a long time, I
mean, not for a long time,

582
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:47,740
but when we're looking at the sea
with is just dropping the pistol, um,

583
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,050
in the, in the water, um,

584
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,450
this node scription of how he
feels about his father. Right?

585
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,230
It's just that he wants
to get rid of the gun.

586
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:58,630
He never wants to see the gun again.
That's it.

587
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,200
It's managed to get rid of the gun.
Um, but actually there is, um, uh,

588
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:08,250
upfront description of how Robert
feels about his father and also a

589
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,150
clarification of what he
needs his grandfather, uh,

590
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,560
how I wish grandfather are hell,
I wish my father was here.

591
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,420
He thought for about an hour anyway,

592
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:24,900
maybe he said the low I have through
the other one that misused the gun.

593
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,010
Maybe that is a bit lonely, the
communication that we have, but damn it,

594
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,860
I'll never forget how sick it made.

595
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,970
The first time I knew he was a cold body.
Go on.

596
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,560
Say it in English.

597
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:44,810
Coward is easier when you have a set and
there's never any point in referring to

598
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:48,140
a son of a bitch by some foreign term.

599
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,000
He wasn't in his son of a bitch though
he was just a coward and that was the

600
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:57,470
worst luck. And then, um, it's actually,

601
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:01,840
if it is interesting for multiple reasons,
um,

602
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,820
one is that, um, Robert really hosted,

603
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,770
he's the grandson of his grandfather.
Rather than the son of his father.

604
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:13,640
And that's really clear. And because
both at the, uh, describe him,

605
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,530
he has both his grandfathers
when's on and his father's son, um,

606
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,440
if he had the choice in
much rather be the phone.

607
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,810
So he's certainly hoping for the basket,

608
00:42:22,811 --> 00:42:27,280
which is that his father
would just disappear and that
one link will be invalid,

609
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:29,780
would be an invalid like,
um,

610
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,880
but the way that he thinks
about his father, um,

611
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,360
is first of all that this is a moment
when Spanish tends to come in handy.

612
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,470
That maybe it's easy just to ease your
way into that way you're thinking about

613
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:44,660
your father.
So you go by way of a foreign language,

614
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,530
but then you really have to say
it in your, in your own town. Um,

615
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,300
but then the way that he thinks
about that where there's actually,

616
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:54,823
um,

617
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,230
two f emptied of any moral judgment,

618
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,860
I think they will use the word coward.

619
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,020
We'd had to attach a lot of moral
significance to that term, right?

620
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:09,860
It lack of bravery, um, is a kind
of moral failing or the polio,

621
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,060
the person, um, who you know,
who is lacking in that quality.

622
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,080
Um,

623
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:20,080
but finally Robert is just emptying
that have that moral judgment and the

624
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,330
saying,
there's some people were just unlucky.

625
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:27,890
Some people would just born not
very brave and it's not up to them.

626
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,950
If they are born author engrave it is
too much to expect absolute bravery from

627
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:37,220
them. They just, they're
not meant to be brave.

628
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,460
And when they try it on a certain thing
is when they can meet that test of

629
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,920
bravery, then they go into break. Um,

630
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,980
so this is his way of accounting for
the fact that his father can live on

631
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:57,470
stubbornly, um, doesn't have the
will to live, to keep them going.

632
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,370
Just to make sense of
that in his own mind.

633
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,890
So in this incident, um,
how was the decision to die?

634
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:10,250
Is rendered acceptable?

635
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:15,170
Is not still not a great thing,
but he can wrap his mind around it.

636
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,060
And that's really one who wants to do,

637
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:21,500
is to be able to wrap his mind around
the fact of his father's suicide.

638
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,760
Um, but I think that
Hemingway actually, um,

639
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,060
and this really speaks to how far he is
able to imagine a position that in the

640
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:34,710
end we know that will be
the opposite of his own.

641
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,040
How far is able to imagine,
um,

642
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:42,870
and give all dignity, uh, or
maybe a kind of emigration,

643
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:47,880
um,
to someone's decision not to die.

644
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:51,780
The stubborn decided to
hang on and not just to be,

645
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,680
not just to go right now.
Um,

646
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,590
and so parallel to that's the
method symmetrical to this,

647
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,180
but also antithetical to
his father's action, um,

648
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,150
is the cold bothers will to survive.
Um,

649
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,650
and the person who embodies
that will to survive is Pablo,

650
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:13,080
who might argue is actually one of
the most interesting characters,

651
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,730
arguably more interesting than
Robert, um, in this novel. Um,

652
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,750
because he's,

653
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,610
he's so much goes on inside his head and
also through him that we actually don't

654
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:25,770
see represented represented in the novel.

655
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,220
So this is one area where Hemingway even

656
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,670
versus the fact that this
is some information not
getting and that information,

657
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,180
that lack of information or that
nondisclosure of information.

658
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:44,040
Ashley Mix a problem with the fair
and steal his person that he is.

659
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,400
Anyway,
Pablo is close to being killed at Esmo.

660
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,070
One [inaudible] hit him again,

661
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:54,870
hot in the mouth and Harlow laughed at
and showing the Yellow Bat broken chief

662
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,500
in the red line and the smell
of leave it alone. Pablo said,

663
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:01,320
and rich the cup to scoop
some wide from the boat.

664
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:06,120
Nobody here has Kohona is to
kill me and this head is silly.

665
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,920
Khobar the Augustan said no,
no words either.

666
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:15,120
Pablo said and made a swishing noise.
Rinsing the one in his mouth.

667
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,210
He spat on the floor.
I'm fat,

668
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,300
I'm far pass was Goossens stood there
looking down at him and cursed and

669
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,950
speaking slowly,
clearly,

670
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:31,190
physically and contemptuous late and
cursing as steadily as though he were

671
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,060
dumping the newer on their field,

672
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:38,390
lifting it with a Dung for our wedding
and Dow and doubt against turn from a

673
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:42,750
door and spoke to him putting
all his contempt into this thing.

674
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:46,620
Go to yes,
me set Pablo.

675
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,920
I will lead a life when you are dead.

676
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:55,370
So Augustan is trying his best to get
into a fight so he could do killed right

677
00:46:57,271 --> 00:46:58,104
then and there.

678
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,500
And Pablo is doing everything he can
to stay alive and he's succeeded.

679
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,740
So no question about
it is an absolute how.

680
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:12,741
And you know he's going to be stand there
and bacon salad maybe for as long as

681
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:17,730
as boosting his breath and south
and he's not going to be great.
