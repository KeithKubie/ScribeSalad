00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.320
This always blows my mind that this is true.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.740
If you take any four-sided shape at all,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.540
make it as awkward and as ridiculous as you want.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.320
Four-sided shape, any.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:24.460
If you take the middles of the sides... and connect them...

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.500
it always makes a parallelogram. Always.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.040
In other words, these two lines are always in the same direction,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.244
and these two are always in the same direction.

00:00:33.244 --> 00:00:36.584
No matter what crazy, kooky thing you started with.

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:41.180
That's scary, to me! That's a conspiracy.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.720
That's amazing. That's completely unexpected.

00:00:44.724 --> 00:00:48.184
I would've expected you make some crazy blob and connect the middles,

00:00:48.184 --> 00:00:50.824
it's gonna be another crazy blob. But it isn't.

00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:56.100
It's always a slanted box, beautifully parallel.

00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:59.620
WHY is it that?

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.620
That's not a scientific question.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.140
The scientific question would be about ink and distances roughly approximate, da da da,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.280
test tubes and all that.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.260
The mathematical question is "why?", its always "why?".

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.620
And the only way we know how to answer

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.340
such questions is to come up, from scratch,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.400
with these... narrative arguments that explain.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.240
And you can have more than one explanation.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.280
You can compare them, you can critique them, you can contrast them.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.040
Just like you can poems.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.300
And so for mathematicians our aesthetic is:

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.780
your argument, your explanation, your discovery,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.720
your deduction: it needs to make sense.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.500
It can't be wishful thinking, it can't be pie-in-the-sky,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.320
it can't just be what you want.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.140
It has to follow logically. Which is a tough demand.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.440
So your reasoning needs to be tight and correct.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.514
But, more importantly, really, is that your argument has to be beautiful.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.680
It has to be astounding. It has to be revelatory.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.760
It has to be charming. That's really hard to do.

00:02:07.763 --> 00:02:10.560
So, what I want to do with this book is open up this

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.060
world of mathematical reality, the creatures that we build there,

00:02:15.063 --> 00:02:21.860
the questions that we ask there, the ways in which we poke and prod...

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.137
known as problems.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.740
And, how we can possibly... craft these elegant reason poems

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.460
to get at what we want to get at.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.920
And it may not be everyone's cup of tea. 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.260
Certainly I'm not suggesting, or even necessarily wanting it to be

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.980
that everyone becomes a mathematician.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.234
Just like I don't think everyone wants to be a photographer or a ballet dancer.

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:57.674
But I think it IS important that everyone understand that there IS an art of photography,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.120
there IS an art of ballet, there IS an art of mathematics,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.760
and those things have their own challenges, frustrations, joys, etc.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.340
And that one can then choose to integrate such arts into one's life to the extent that one wishes to.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.680
There's nothing deeper than this mathematical act.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.860
There's nothing that comes even close.
