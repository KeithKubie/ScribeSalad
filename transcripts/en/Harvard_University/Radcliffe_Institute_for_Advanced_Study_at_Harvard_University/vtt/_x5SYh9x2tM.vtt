[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.036
-I want to thank you, Judy,
for doing my presentation.

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:12.847
I have nothing to add.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.620
I want to say thank
you to Radcliffe.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.270
It has been so far a
wonderful experience.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.610
And it has been great to be
with all the other fellows

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.950
and understanding how we're all
helping in one way or another

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.980
to make everything better.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.915
Today, I am going to experiment.

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.040
This is a new presentation.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.780
Let's see how it goes.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.863
It might be a little long.

00:00:35.863 --> 00:00:37.640
Let's see.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.600
Get ready.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.040
So I want to start with a
quote by Jacques Ranciere where

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.980
he talks about aesthetics.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.100
"Aesthetics doesn't
designate the discipline

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.450
dedicated to the study
of art or the beautiful.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.320
It designates a regime
of experiences."

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.880
For a long time,
I've been interested

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.530
in the idea of aesthetics.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.710
But maybe because my
English is not very good,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.160
I realized one day that if you
change the H of "aesthetics,"

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.110
you have the word "ethics."

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.800
And then I started
thinking maybe I

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.000
should be doing aes-ethics
work instead of aesthetic work.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.110
Then, of course, there
is a language situation.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.416
And in Spanish,
it says estetica.

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:30.790
I realized they
are very similar.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.240
So maybe if you take
the A out of it,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.450
it's est-ethics, which
means, "it is ethics."

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.310
And this is exactly what I
would like my work as an artist

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.540
to be experimenting
with and researching.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.040
Is there aesthetics
in the ethics?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.410
And what does that mean?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.730
John Cage, many, many,
many decades ago,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.400
predicted that "Ethics is the
aesthetics of the future."

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.600
But really, my work as
an artist has always

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.030
been questioning,
what is art for.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.490
I never take for granted
the function of art

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.550
and what it does for people.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.520
So I want to start with
the reference, in 1917,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.510
Marcel Duchamp did a piece
called "The Fountain"

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.440
where he presented a urinary
on a pedestal in a gallery.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.240
It actually was a
competition for art.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.870
And it was dismissed
as an offensive object.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.340
But today, of course,
this is the objects

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.050
through which we can look at
reality in an augmented way.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.490
So yes, after this piece,
of course, in some way,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.170
we decided that art is
a way to look at reality

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.640
and a mental reality.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.370
But actually, I think it
caused also a problem.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.370
I think when it was first
started, it was great.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.300
But now I think it has
caused a problem, which

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.420
is that from the 20th century
until today, the least

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.730
disputed artistic
strategy is just to remove

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.720
the use value of an object.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.800
And therefore, that
becomes automatically art.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.450
For me, this is
extremely dangerous

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.750
because it is, first of all,
very automatic, and secondly,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.430
do not address a lot of
other issues that art can do

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.710
and other things art can do.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.380
And of course, the one thing
I really like about this

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.500
is that art is gesture.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.380
It's not only an object,
but it is a gesture.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.540
And that's how I see art.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.070
Also in 1917, there were, of
course, the Soviet revolution.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.860
And with it, there was
exactly a different parameter

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.700
for understanding
art, which is art

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.940
that will be like a
kind of [INAUDIBLE] pop

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.660
or a propaganda tool
for the government.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.110
But at the same time, it
created the possibility

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.390
to have a very
distinctive relationship

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.980
with the function of art.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.250
One, while the urinary was
bringing the life inside

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.610
of the museum, for
example, the cinema

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.630
train that they had was bringing
art out into people's life.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.990
I think this is a--
it kind of parallels

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.330
the binary situation
that happens very

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.276
often in the discussion
in the art world,

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:39.650
where people are
like no, no, no,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.070
artists should be
looking at something.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.070
Or art is a way by which you
just are aware of something,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.420
you look at something.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.980
But there is another group of
people, or another tendency,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.370
where people want to use
art for something else.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.310
Of course, what
happened in those

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.090
very heated discussions
is one group

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.160
told the other that
that kind of work

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.589
is not good because it's
too market oriented.

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.630
And the other group say
to the other group, yeah,

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.050
but yours is just propaganda.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.320
So in a way, I am very
related to this discussion.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.580
And this is part of
my recent research.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.220
And also, I'm very related
with the ideas of utopia.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.400
For me, as a Cuban artist
coming out of a revolution,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.520
utopia is not something
that will never be achieved,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.240
but is actually something
that you construct.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.850
And of course, here we
have-- I want to show you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.400
the context in which my
work has been influenced.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.250
Here, he says "To fight for
something that is impossible

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.520
and to conquer it."

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.420
That's the kind of ideology
that I was growing up with.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.415
Of course, later, you
realize it's all crap.

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:14.080
But in the moment, you're
young and listening too much.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.040
And of course, one thing
that was very interesting

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.480
is that in that time in Cuba,
we were extremely related

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.942
in a very-- they
call it [SPANISH].

00:06:26.942 --> 00:06:30.690
So we were very international
with the different causes.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.250
And we even think, at
the time, that religion

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.120
is another tool for fight.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.190
Of course, the
artists were supposed

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:47.350
to be the warriors for this
ideology and art a tool.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.550
So politics in Cuba has been
always used as affect, as fear.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.970
It's very important
the way we always

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.360
understand in Cuba,
politics through emotions.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.210
But what I mean
to say in my work

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.590
is to see if we can
transform affect

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.870
into political effectiveness.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.590
So I want to show you
different examples of my work.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.030
And in between,
I'm going to show

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.160
you more than what
the work is about,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.240
the overall methodology
of work that I've

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.120
been trying to create.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:31.640
So I started in 1985 a
series of works called Homage

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.180
to Ana Mendieta.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.310
And what I did was very basic.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.520
I just reproduced all
the work of Ana Mendieta

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.540
when I learned that she
died and that we will never

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.040
meet in person.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.390
So I decided to just do
exactly the same performances

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.830
for 10 years.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:00.132
Of course, this bring
a lot of interest.

00:08:00.132 --> 00:08:02.090
I discovered through this
piece a lot of things

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:07.094
that I actually after have
been continual investigation

00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:08.510
in my work, which
is, for example,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.972
the ideas of authorship.

00:08:10.972 --> 00:08:12.847
The fact that a lot
of people are like,

00:08:12.847 --> 00:08:13.930
but this is not your work.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.200
It's somebody else's work.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.000
So I was always claiming
that my work was a gesture

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.370
to try to rescue another artist
from their cultural memory

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.010
of a country where
actually people who left

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.620
were erased from the history.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.240
So what happened is
that in the process,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.090
I learned that even
when you try to do

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.900
something personal and an homage
in the context of Cuba, which

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.090
is highly politically
charged, the work will always

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.990
have a political implication.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.365
So in a way, I was,
OK, I can escape it,

00:08:51.365 --> 00:08:53.465
so let's get into it.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.810
Another example of
things I'm interested in

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.850
is this piece where it's
called Destierro, Displacement.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.440
And it is an Nkisi
Nkonde icon, African icon

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.390
that is used usually to
venerate by the people.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:17.690
And also, you can use
it to ask for something.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.160
And if you don't give the icon
what you promised in return,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.390
they might go after
you and do some harm.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.290
Here, I did the performance
on Fidel Castro's birthday,

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.020
by chance, in Cuba.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.570
And of course, the work
was about this idea

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.840
of all the promises
that have been

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.090
made, all the social promises
that had not been accomplished.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.690
What I learned through
doing this piece

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.120
and what I was trying
to do is, how can I do

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.830
art that speaks to everybody.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.680
How can I do art, not only
because it's in the street

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.560
and outside the museum,
but has a language that can

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.290
be understood by most people?

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.510
Because the issues that
I'm talking about are

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.210
issues that concern everybody.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:06.790
And in between these
people I want to talk to,

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.240
I also want to talk
to people in power.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.870
I also want to talk
to politicians.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:16.359
So something very weird happened
when I doing this performance.

00:10:16.359 --> 00:10:18.650
Because it was Fidel Castro's
birthday, a lot of police

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.840
came to see what's going on.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.810
Why are people spontaneously
having like a demonstration

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.100
style, following this person?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.000
And a kid say, no, no,
this is an artwork.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.060
And the police, who was
not trained probably

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:38.840
for such a situation,
thinks, OK, then it's fine.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.400
Continue.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.910
Proceed.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.460
So I think that was a moment
of big realization for me

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.880
because they say, oh, so
if this is art, is this OK.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.410
And I decided that I
want to work with that.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.770
Therefore, after that, I
have used the context of art

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.790
and the privileges, let's
say, that art gives you,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.050
to say things that in
another way, I cannot say,

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.620
almost asked, is art the
language of the citizens

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.490
in places where
they cannot speak?

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.920
But also, something happened.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.590
I think I realized
that if I want

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.670
to talk to people
who are in power

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:20.310
positions like that police,
maybe the symbolic strategy

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.540
will not work anymore.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.240
And then I decided I
wanted to change symbolism

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.100
for direct experience.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:34.550
Another piece I did in '93
and '94 was a newspaper.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.410
Of course, in Cuba, even today,
printed newspaper is forbidden.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:40.730
It's illegal.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.300
But of course, I'm
using art, right?

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.890
So I did the newspaper.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.522
It didn't go that well.

00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:52.480
But I had my first
interrogation by police.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.580
But one thing I was
very interested at

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.950
is the fact that I was
trying to use the strategy

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.670
of hyper-realism to do art.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.170
What I mean by that
is I wanted the work

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.430
not to be like a
newspaper, but look

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.650
like a newspaper,
circulated like a newspaper,

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.480
being experienced
as a newspaper.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.250
So I really wanted the
distance between representation

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.810
and presentation to
be completely crashed.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.780
So the other thing
I did is I realized

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.010
that if I want to talk to power
and if I want to talk to people

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.200
who make decision-making, I
will appropriate the resources

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.740
of power to do my work.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.130
So from this moment on,
the materials of my work

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:39.050
would not be any more
like, oh, an icon

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.380
from-- some representation.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.920
It will be a newspaper, a
school, a political speech,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.420
and so on.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.400
So I'm going to appropriate
the ways power talks

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.010
to do my own work.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.650
And also, of course, I realized
that my work, in general,

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.890
is a test to propaganda.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:04.230
What I do is I don't say, what
you're saying is not true.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:09.480
My attitude, my performativity
is, I believe you completely.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.200
And I'm going to behave as
if the propaganda was real.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.740
And then, of course, you realize
that everything is not real.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.500
And this is when
the work happens.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.570
Another aspect of my
work is the performance.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.300
I studied performance.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:31.540
And this is a piece I did
where I get with a friend.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.820
His name is Jota Castro.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.760
No political work.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.720
It was just a coincidence.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.890
We got together.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.520
And we decided to
sign a contract

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.400
where the first of
the two who died

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.120
will give the body to the
other to do a performance.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.880
We don't want to
do the piece soon.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.670
We're trying to--

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.900
But one thing happened
in this piece.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.430
The first thing is I realized
that as a performance artist,

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.080
I didn't want to work anymore
with the limits of the body.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.020
I didn't want to know
if I can be-- which

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.350
I did-- hanging for whatever
hours in the ceiling

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.790
or cutting myself and see
how much blood I can--

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.550
I was not interested in
that because the reason was,

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.000
not because it's not a
legitimate art practice,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.120
because I realized in
the political context,

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.060
it is very easy
to people in power

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.740
to say, oh, that's her
psychological damage, whatever,

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.887
artwork she needs to do.

00:14:29.887 --> 00:14:31.470
And I was like, no,
it's not about me.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.580
It's about us.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.440
So I realized that I needed
to get away from that

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.030
and start working the
limits of society.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.560
And then, of
course, I say, OK, I

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.560
don't do performance
art anymore.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.640
I don't want to belong
to that tradition.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.525
I want to belong to
Arte de Conducta, which

00:14:46.525 --> 00:14:48.470
is a name I came up with.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:54.250
And it means art that
is using social behavior

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.720
as artistic material.

00:14:58.035 --> 00:14:59.410
And of course,
another thing that

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.493
happened with this piece
that was very interesting

00:15:01.493 --> 00:15:04.790
is that when we told people
about it, people were like,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.460
but what is the art.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.650
Is the art the idea
the artist had?

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.740
Is the art the actual
paper, like the document

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.700
that you have?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.850
Or is the art not yet there?

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.560
And you're going to do it in
a few years when you died?

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.570
I never answered
those questions.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.380
But I'm very
interested in the fact

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.930
that I want my projects to
be a moment in which people

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.620
don't take for granted their
artistic condition of it.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.120
Why?

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.520
Because I think that way, people
can relate even more to it.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.900
Another thing is that when you
start being a political artist,

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.770
there are a lot of
things that happen.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.500
And one of them is
you realize you want

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.050
to look for sustainable change.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.620
You don't want to just
complain and use art

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.070
to say things you can
read in the newspaper

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.230
or on the internet.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.720
You want to use all
the tools that art

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.560
has to change something.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.800
But you understand very quickly
that the changes you can

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.830
do as an artist is very small.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.300
It can be mostly
like a small example

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.340
to maybe excite somebody
else do something else.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.550
So I understood that
I needed to look

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.540
for ways by which that
change could be sustainable.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.630
In this case, I
was invited to be

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.090
part of a group of
experts to do repertoire

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:34.790
on the field of cultural
rights for the first Artistic

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.780
Freedom of Expression and
Cultural Rights document that

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.492
was actually signed and
voted by the UN members.

00:16:45.492 --> 00:16:47.700
That's another story, what
happened with those things

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.280
in the UN.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.930
But at the moment,
I was very excited.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.320
OK.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.480
So in my work, I have
several guidelines.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.390
One is that I work with
the political imaginary.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.170
What I mean by
that is that I like

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.089
to work with what people
imagine places are.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.839
For example, this is a piece I
did in Cuba in the year 2000.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:17.930
The year 2000 was very
important because we were always

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:22.366
promised that by the year
2000, it'll be all perfect.

00:17:22.366 --> 00:17:23.490
Everything will be perfect.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.369
And we'll be in
Communism and so on.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:26.819
And then the year 2000 arrives.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.140
And we were like, uh-huh.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:34.350
And then I did this piece,
which was completely dark-- this

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.610
is only for you to see
the elements-- Completely

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.030
dark with this sugarcane.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.980
And then you enter.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.820
And you see a little
video of Fidel

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:44.780
opening his military
vest to show

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.570
that he has no bullet-proof.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.250
But for the piece, what
the piece was saying

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.370
is that the real vulnerable
people is not the person on TV.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.760
It's the people who
are there taking

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.440
care of the person on TV.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.455
So you had this naked Cuban
people who were passing,

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.560
the audience who was
passing through it.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.230
Another thing I'm
interested in terms

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:11.690
of the strategy of my work
is I don't work with actors,

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.650
or I don't train people
to look like something.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.510
I always work with people,
professional experience.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:23.600
An example is this piece I did
with Bernardine Dohrn and Bill

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.130
Ayers, the members of
Weather Underground,

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.960
who actually now are
professors, legit professors,

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.210
of university.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.250
And in this piece, I asked them.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:40.150
It was at the very month, I
think, where Obama was elected.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.930
And I said, what do we do
when the person you are

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.830
in the same ideas is elected?

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:47.330
No?

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.250
So you are not
opposition anymore.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.270
And they start talking.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.770
Right?

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.790
And they're very good speakers.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.720
And then, of course, I had
planted-- like politicians do,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.490
I had planted people
in the audience

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.030
to interrupt them all the time.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.670
So what happened is
they couldn't speak.

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.447
There was no way they can speak.

00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:09.030
I have to say, after
I did this piece,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.447
I'm always afraid that somebody
will do that to me too.

00:19:11.447 --> 00:19:12.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.750
But it's fine.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.250
So I wanted to
create this situation

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.830
where you lose the
power that is given

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.590
in this position where you are.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.950
Another example is the horses.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.120
This is called
Tatlin's Whisper #5.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.190
And what I did is talk
to the mounted police.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.600
And I say, can you use the
crowd control technique

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.250
in the audience
of the exhibition?

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.760
What was very
interesting in this piece

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.870
was that-- one side
of it is that I wanted

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.720
to take things
that aren't on TV,

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.900
that you don't experience
yourself, and bring it

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.630
to real life.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.540
So maybe next time you see it,
you will know how to react.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.520
You have tested yourself
in certain situations.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.250
The sadness of this is how
quickly people follow orders.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.710
And I have to say that nobody
knew this was an art piece.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.790
The artwork was not announced.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.370
My name was not
anywhere in the museum.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:17.410
So that just happened
that they just arrived.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.320
And it was a surprise.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.386
Another thing I work
with is political memory,

00:20:23.386 --> 00:20:26.050
which you also would be
surprised how quickly it goes,

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:27.470
it fades.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:32.500
So this is a piece
I did in Russia.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.460
Of course, you could
see through a peephole.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.366
Or you could enter.

00:20:35.366 --> 00:20:36.990
You, always in my
work, have the option

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.850
to participate or just
miss it, let's say.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.270
So what I did for this is I had
there were these photographers

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:51.520
in Revolution Square,
Red Square taking photos

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.990
of these very cute animals
dressed like people, not

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.990
to miss the irony of markets.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.790
And what I did is I said,
come to the exhibition.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:09.470
And we were going to take family
pictures with these animals.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.770
So in a way, kind of
the way politicians

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.330
do is very spectacular.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.790
So you see only what
they want you to see.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:18.470
They give you the
photo right there.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.400
And then this is
a family portrait.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.470
What they discover
after the photo is given

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:28.110
is this is the photo of the
person who created the KGB.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.926
So their family portrait
is taken with the KGB.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.610
It was interesting
that a lot of people

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:37.470
did not know who
that person was.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:42.370
They thought it was just
a random, heroic photo.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.780
Only two people decided
not to have the photo taken

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.390
when they saw the image.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:53.920
Also, because I'm a
Cuban artist and I

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.670
did a lot of my work
inside Cuba, but then

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.440
I started to be invited outside.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.990
I had to rethink what
does it mean to do

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:01.610
the work in other contexts.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:06.820
So I was invited to redo
this piece in Germany,

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:07.741
but differently.

00:22:07.741 --> 00:22:09.990
The creators said, do the
same piece, but differently.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.670
I said, whoa, how can I do
a piece about the perception

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:15.170
of a place?

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:20.670
So I decided to go and
work with the history.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.530
Of course, when you say
Germany, back then-- now,

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:25.470
maybe it's refugees.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.800
But back then, it was
about the Nazi history.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.220
So I went back.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.970
And I decided to
put a lot of lights.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.470
So actually, you
don't see anything.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:40.030
And there was the sound of
people marching and cocking

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.090
a gun.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.880
What is interesting is if you
are in the right position,

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.870
you realize that
these are not sounds,

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:51.110
but these are actual people
with actual guns in the space.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.360
And of course, it is a
metaphor of how power always

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.730
serves you better, that
you can observe them.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.040
Then, of course, another
thing I do, or I hope to do,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.000
is see if I can integrate
art into people's

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.690
everyday political life.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.230
This is one of the
reasons I go so often

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.886
outside of art institutions.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.610
This is a project I did in
Mexico during the election,

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:19.880
the last election.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.950
And one thing was
interesting, the research,

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:26.400
that while every
election in Mexico

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.720
talks about immigration
issues, they

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.700
do not talk in terms of
the people they receive.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.350
But they talk about the
Mexicans who are left,

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.250
who are here in
the United States.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.290
And what we did
with this project

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:45.570
is to find the elements of
demand of these immigrants

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.050
who arrived to Mexico
and are treated

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.860
even worse than the Mexicans
are treated here, ironically.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.880
And we wanted that to
appear for the first time

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.720
in the public debate
of the candidates.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.080
So that means I was
talking nonstop, forever,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.620
in every newspaper
and everything

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.640
because we were trying to
put the message across.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.530
And of course, we did
a lot of research.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.960
But for the first time
in the last debate,

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.850
not exactly how we
said, but very similar.

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.645
The candidate that was going
to lose because everybody knew

00:24:20.645 --> 00:24:24.960
he was in the last--
said and talked

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.410
for the first time
in a Mexican election

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:32.120
about the situation of
immigrants in Mexico.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.750
Some of the ways by which we
made this completely public

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.800
was also to rescue a tradition
in Mexico and Latin America

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.020
in general, which is los
voceros, the voice people,

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.790
meaning the people who
shout the news when

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.140
you buy the newspaper.

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.090
So we had 100 of them walking
the most important streets

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.870
of Mexico, next to
the palace of Congress

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.800
and the presidential
palace, to shout

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.430
the rights for immigrants.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.820
But I think I wanted the
documentation of this piece

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.580
not to be a talk or a photo.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.300
But I wanted to embed this
project in the actual system,

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.750
electoral system, in Mexico.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.980
So what we did is
every six years

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.180
there is a little moment
where people can actually

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:21.330
propose a new party.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.950
And we are number
45 in the list.

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:27.340
Unfortunately, art
institutions do not always

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.650
have the capacity to
continue these projects.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.650
So I had to stop.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.990
But at least we
arrived so far as that.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.260
So as you can see,
a lot of my work

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:46.260
is a collective production,
is a collective construction.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.310
So in a way, I cannot say
I'm an artist and claim sole

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.430
authorship of everything.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.280
So I have come up with
this idea of initiator.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.190
So basically, what
I do with my work

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.920
is I create
conditions for people

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.630
to behave socially
in different ways.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.080
So I have to give half of
the credit to the audience.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.430
In this case, I put the podium
like this one inside an art

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.210
institution and told people they
could say whatever they wanted

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.700
for one minute, of
course, without offending

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.606
anybody or calling to violence.

00:26:18.606 --> 00:26:22.720
And it was kind of
a reconstruction

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.510
of the first speech
Fidel gave where

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:32.150
there was a big myth because
all these doves were in him.

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.060
And for 50 years,
people were like,

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.650
do you think that's
a sign of God,

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.490
or do you think
that was strained?

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.390
So I decided to
solve this solution

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:46.300
by training doves and having
that guy putting it on people.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.840
But for me, it was
very interesting

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.870
because it was the
first time a lot

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.670
of that people could see
themselves in the leadership

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:53.777
position in Cuba.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.460
But of course, I always
say I'm a political artist.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.620
So if I'm an initiator, I
cannot call myself anything else

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.830
but political initiator.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.210
Also, the work I do
is very different.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.670
I mean, the impact
that you can have

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.980
on people in a 45-minute
performance in a museum

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.490
doesn't work sometimes when
you want to do other changes.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.430
So I have come up with
two ways of working.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:28.280
One is short-term projects,
the one that works for the art

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.430
exhibition demands, let's say,
and the long-term projects.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.510
These projects can take from
a few months to 10 years.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.730
And these are
projects that I want

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:43.970
to believe and want to test if
I can change something socially.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.010
And therefore, you have to work
in the temporality of society,

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.810
not the temporality of the quick
people in the arts exhibition

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.120
having drinks.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:55.390
So how do I do this?

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.320
I do Autocritica Instituciona.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.710
For the socialists, this
might mean something

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:04.890
because we had self-criticism
in the meetings in Cuba.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.400
So I wanted the
institution to do the same.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.360
So institutions
of self-critique.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.990
What it means is that
instead of me criticizing

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.160
what exists, what the
government has done

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.310
or an institution
has done, what I

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.260
do is I create my
own institution,

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.490
my own institution
with the ways I

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:25.310
hope I will like for it
to function in reality.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:31.760
So this is kind of, again, a
way to also say that things are

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.826
possible because
at least in Cuba,

00:28:33.826 --> 00:28:37.150
a lot of justification
is that you cannot do it.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.850
OK, I'm a single
artist with no budget .

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:40.530
And I did it.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.570
How can you, as a
government, cannot do it?

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:46.950
So it's a very clear
way to show them that.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.150
It's a lot of trouble.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.630
But it is worth it.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.090
So in this case, I
created am art school,

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.230
an alternative art
school to study

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.390
political and
social performances

00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:01.040
and to redirect the
conversation about what

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.840
is art for and for whom.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.130
So we wanted to create work
for the people in a moment

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.230
where the Cuban government
was using the art

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.510
market to derail
the conversation

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.560
to social responsibility
for artists

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.760
and just acquire some money
and some houses and be quiet.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.680
So I wanted to rescue
this conversation that

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.150
at the moment, looked
very [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:31.510
But we proceed, and we did it.

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:36.560
So this is some of the
works also of the students.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.570
This is a machine for
the Fidel you want.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:43.590
And I did all the
other pieces like,

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.030
for example, Immigrant
Movement International where

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.580
I wanted to talk about
the political condition

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.160
of immigrants, which is
the first condition that is

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.390
lost when you cross a border.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:58.070
And this is the other thing.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.790
All of these projects
look almost exactly

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.170
as the real projects.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.830
I don't want to make
something weird.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.930
I want to make something
that people feel comfortable

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:09.982
and make an easy entrance
to this process instead

00:30:09.982 --> 00:30:12.190
of the being, oh, this art
and I don't understand it.

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.490
No, no, this is just
a store front for you.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.760
And then once you enter,
let's have a conversation.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.790
So in this case,
we did something

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:30.160
that looks very much like
a grassroots organization.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.250
And I'm very proud of this.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.600
We did the Migrant Manifesto.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.500
And why I'm proud of this is
because for the first time,

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.160
I guess-- I don't know.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.850
But we put together
people like Saskia Sassen,

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.730
like a reporter from the UN
on immigration with the mom

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:51.781
next door who has a sixth
grade education together

00:30:51.781 --> 00:30:54.280
with this guy who is one of the
experts in the United States

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.100
about the economy of immigrants,
all of these people together.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.620
And together, we generated
this Migrant Manifesto.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.590
Of course, the pin.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.240
We also created a pin.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.916
So actually, during
this piece, we

00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:11.290
realized that
every time you talk

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:13.930
about the law with immigration,
people get freaked out.

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.540
So I said, OK, let's
leave that aside.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.000
And let's just respect
immigrants first.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.130
So we did this campaign
that-- if you want one,

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.290
I can give you one.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.060
And we actually did
international gatherings.

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.860
We also did postcards
for immigrants

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.135
to send their friends.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:37.120
We did also
billboards for Europe

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.780
when we were invited
to festivals.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.980
And a flag, we made a flag.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.070
Here it is with the text.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:47.790
But the flag is
just the drawing.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.690
And of course, Immigrant
Movement International

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:53.460
is not only the work that
has been done in Queens.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:59.280
But it is also every time we
are addressing immigrant issues

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.440
because it's happening the
same everywhere and forever.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.830
Like after 15 years
working on this,

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.930
we have the same problems,
the same unanswered questions,

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:13.590
and the same racism
and discrimination

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.220
towards immigrants.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.010
So I did this campaign, a
political campaign called

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.230
Dignity Has No Nationality.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.629
It was a postcard.

00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:23.670
So you sign the postcard.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:27.900
And actually, it is project when
I asked Pope Francis to please

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:33.610
give Vatican City citizenship to
all immigrants in the world who

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.000
have no papers.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.610
If somebody has
a contact, let me

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.390
know because I'm trying to
bring him all the postcards,

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:45.140
around 20,000.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.330
Another thing I do is
what I said before,

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.410
behavior art or conduct art.

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.270
And the reason for that is
because in Spanish, "conducta"

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.530
means the behavior, but
it also means something

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.950
that travels from one place to
another, the conductor of one.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:02.010
So I want art to
be that as well.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.370
And this is an example of a
piece I did of behavior art

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.210
where I wanted to work with
the reaction of people.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:11.640
In Colombia-- of course,
you say Colombia,

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.320
and you first think "drug."

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.120
Now, you think peace.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:21.890
I'm glad my work is getting
dated for better reasons.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:25.640
But in this case,
I came to Colombia.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:30.050
And we did a very boring
panel with all the actors

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:34.090
of the Colombian
situation, like a family

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.480
of a missing person of the
[INAUDIBLE] leadership,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.190
so a FARC person and
a paramilitary person.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:43.670
And people were like,
this is so boring.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.810
We know this.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:49.080
What is this artist coming to
do this-- and then five minutes

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:53.190
or so into it, a person
with a tray of real cocaine

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.480
was passing through the
audience of the event.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.830
Of course, that is behavior
art because what happened

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:02.760
after that was the peace.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:09.020
So a big discussion, and yeah.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.230
So another aspect of
my work is what I call

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.330
political-timing specificity.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:17.650
It means that I'm not always
conscious of the place

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:18.370
and the people.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.230
But also, what is the
political state of the place?

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.270
What are the actors?

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:24.560
What are the laws?

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.199
What are the discussion,
the political emotions

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.310
that we have at that moment?

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:36.612
And in this case, I did one
piece that is called Yo Tambien

00:34:36.612 --> 00:34:38.469
Exijo, I Also Demand.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.190
And for this piece--
this is not egocentric,

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:45.150
but I self-cited myself, quoted
myself with another piece.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:48.139
So I took the piece
of the microphones

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.250
and I said, I'm
going to do it again.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.489
But instead of the safety
of an art institution,

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:55.239
I'm going to do it in the
Revolution Square, which

00:34:55.239 --> 00:35:00.130
is the place where
power has the power.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:04.930
And of course, it
didn't very well at all.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.940
Many things happened.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.160
I was detained, interrogated,
and so on and so on.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.190
But I think the
work was a success

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:18.990
because it showed the way
in which power operates.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.100
It showed to everybody.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.690
And I talked to
people in the left

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.500
and also people in
social justice groups.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.514
And this is a very
hard conversation

00:35:29.514 --> 00:35:31.680
when you talk about Cuba
because these people do not

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:33.549
want to see the new Cuba.

00:35:33.549 --> 00:35:35.090
They're still thinking
about the Cuba

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.770
from the '70s who was
good to Angela Davies, who

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.500
was good to Angola.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.210
This is not anymore the
Cuba you have today.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.030
And it's very hard for me
to have this conversation.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.790
So I'm very happy that
through this work,

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:54.240
I could have some of
that conversation.

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:58.380
Right now, I think
the excitement--

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.220
which I am in favor of
the relation of Cuba-Us.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:05.510
And Obama was amazing
when he was there.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.390
I always say that he
was not a president.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:10.230
He talked to Cubans as
a community organizer.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.570
And that was the most
beautiful thing to see there.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:19.980
So what happened
with this piece is

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.160
in the midst of all of this
tension that lasted eight

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.770
months, I was extremely
satisfied that in a way,

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:33.720
government performed for me.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.070
So after being so
many years trying

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.470
to talk to power, to have
a dialogue with them,

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.670
they finally talked back.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.650
Unfortunately, the
way they talked back

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:46.080
was that during my
reading of Hannah Arendt's

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:49.650
The Origins of Totalitarianism
with the speakers to the street

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.530
so every Cuban could hear
it in Spanish, of course.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:58.170
They sent a brigade of
jackhammers for the street

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:00.080
in front of my house.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.810
They were already
fixing Old Havana.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:05.975
But my house was far from where
it was supposed to happen.

00:37:05.975 --> 00:37:07.100
And I even talked to a guy.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:08.450
I said, this is no good.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.700
This is not-- it's going to
be-- no, they are orders.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.550
I say, OK, orders
have to be done.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:20.050
So of course, I
think for me what

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:26.090
you see today is a
fracture of Cubans

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:31.980
hope for change, not for
institutional, economic change

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.280
or Americans going in
and traveling there,

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.090
but for their own personal
achievement of change.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:43.460
But what I want to do is
I want to use art again

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.970
to try to see if we can
start a new dialogue.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.680
I don't want to talk about
what happens in Cuba five,

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.380
10 years from now when all
the decisions are made,

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:56.760
where all the contracts are
made with the big corporations,

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.250
and nobody can change
anything for real.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.580
Now, there is a moment
of a lot of instability.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.060
So maybe one voice
of a person can

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.500
change a deal that's
going to be made

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.830
that would not help the Cubans.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.520
So what I want to do is I
want to start an institute.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.600
We are already working on the
Institute Artivism, Hannah

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.750
Arendt.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.920
And what we based this is on
the fact that yes, in Cuba

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.270
in the '60s, we had
a literacy campaign

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:28.420
that I'm very proud of where
almost everybody in Cuba

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.140
learned how to write and read.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.290
The problem is you cannot
read what you want.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.520
And you cannot say
what you think.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.660
So what I want
with the team-- we

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.420
are a group of people working.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:44.500
And how can we bring a civic
rights literacy campaign

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.980
to Cuba so people learn not
only their rights, but how can

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.430
they defend that and they
identify when they are not

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.030
being respected.

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:56.530
Of course, very quickly
say, three of the elements--

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:57.920
we're going use a wish tank.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.456
We want to see what people want.

00:38:59.456 --> 00:39:02.860
We want to do think tanks, where
we bring people from hopefully

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.880
all over the place, experts to
meet with them the same way we

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.880
did with the
Immigrant Manifesto,

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.280
to bring ideas of
what in the world

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.300
have been done in
this same situations.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.540
And hopefully, do tank
will be the way which

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.750
we're going to show this in the
street or to all the people.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:21.440
It's very tough.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.270
But we're going to do it.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:28.240
So of course, as
you can see, by now

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.750
I'm trying to talk in my work
about what are the uses of art.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.160
Can art be a tool?

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.810
Can art be a tool
for social change?

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:41.200
Can art be a tool
for empowerment?

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:44.580
And of course, we also
need to think, not only

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.040
what are the uses
of art, but what

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.410
are the uses of art institutions
today and rethink that.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:55.000
My answer to that is
going back to the urinary.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.210
And my proposal is there is time
to put Dechamp's urinal back

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.250
into the restroom and use it.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.160
Thank you very much.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.690
[APPLAUSE]
