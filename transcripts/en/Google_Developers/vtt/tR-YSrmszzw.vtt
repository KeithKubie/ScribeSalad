00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
ERIC KOLEDA: I'm going to
be talking now about the

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.390
TrafficEstimatorService,
specifically the new

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.710
TrafficEstimatorService that was
launched in v201008, and a

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.890
little bit about how it's the
same and different from the

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.380
v13 version that you
may be using.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.940
It was originally released in
v12, so it's been out there

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.920
for a little while.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.050
And it basically takes the
same functionality as the

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.750
TrafficEstimator UI, figuring
out for a given keyword, and a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.390
given bid, and a given set of
targeting, essentially, how

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.300
many clicks can I
expect to get?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.930
So it differs it a little
slightly from the

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.860
TargetingIdeaService with a
keyword pool, which is more

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.670
about how much traffic is there
on this keyword, how

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.050
many searches take place?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.644
This one's taking it a little
further with, given a bid,

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:45.682
given how competitive that
keyword is, how many clicks

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:46.664
could I expect?

00:00:46.664 --> 00:00:48.628
And the nice thing about it,
too, is it can use contextual

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:49.119
information.

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:52.020
You can kind of pass it in with
these proposed keywords.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.282
So if I were to add this keyword
in some hypothetical

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.620
ad group, in some hypothetical
campaign, how would it do?

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.965
But what's great about this
service is it can also take,

00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:01.980
if you pass in the IDs of your
existing ad campaigns and ad

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.940
groups, it can use the
historical information about

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.410
how well your particular
campaigns and ad groups

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.860
perform to kind of shape
the results.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.074
So a v13 request had a format
kind of like this.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.466
There's different ways
you could do it.

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.620
And I'll talk about it later.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.653
But, essentially, you start
with a campaign request.

00:01:18.653 --> 00:01:20.625
This is kind of emulating
the campaign-level

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:21.857
details of your request.

00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:23.583
It's got things like
geo-targeting,

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.062
language-targeting.

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:28.513
So in the context of a campaign
that had this

00:01:28.513 --> 00:01:30.485
targeting, how would
the rest do?

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:32.960
And then inside of that is a
series of ad group requests.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.930
And each ad group request
has a max CPC.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.459
If I had an ad group, and I set
the max CPC to this, how

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:41.110
will the keywords perform?

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.290
And then, finally, inside an ad
group request was a keyword

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.240
request, which was the actual
keyword that we're trying to

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.500
get traffic estimates on.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.170
The key point about the
TrafficEstimator, in general,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.372
is that it always does
keyword estimates.

00:01:53.372 --> 00:01:55.832
It's not going to give you an
estimate on a whole campaign,

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:58.046
like this campaign will be this
successful, or this ad

00:01:58.046 --> 00:01:59.225
group will be this successful.

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:01.550
It's always giving you per
keyword estimates.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.720
But there's the ability to add
campaign and ad group-level

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.362
data to shape those estimates
to be more accurate.

00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:11.130
And what you got back was a set
of information like this.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.440
Look at the lower and upper.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.080
You can see average position in
this case was between one

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.050
and three--

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.280
kind of a range of where your ad
might fall-- and then some

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.014
clicks and CPC data.

00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:26.140
So how this has changed in
v201008 is not too radically.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.780
You'll see it's got

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.140
essentially the same structure.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.515
A series of campaign estimate
requests, ad group estimate

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:32.890
requests, keyword estimate
requests nested inside each

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.128
other providing contextual
information.

00:02:35.128 --> 00:02:37.120
The same keyword
data is there.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.750
You have the micro amount bid
for your ad group and then

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.698
targeting options like English,
the United States,

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:47.380
under your targets inside
your campaign request.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.926
So the actual XML has
changed slightly.

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:51.360
But the idea is very,
very similar.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.272
Now, what you get back is data
in a slightly different format

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:55.670
and, actually, some
new data, too.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.410
So you get back, as you
had before, average

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.676
CPC, position, clicks.

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:04.350
You also get a total cost now,
which wasn't returned before.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.800
And you can see there's also
a change in position.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.012
So now average position is
kind of reported in a

00:03:10.012 --> 00:03:11.470
fractional amount.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.350
It's a little more detailed.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.935
And the other thing you'll
notice too is it split up the

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:18.990
minimum and the maximum values
into two separate objects.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.436
So before, your uppers and
lowers were together.

00:03:21.436 --> 00:03:24.292
And now they're these two
separate objects that hold

00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:28.100
your min and your max, but
they're actually the exact

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.590
same format.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.785
So there are some other
important changes to talk

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:32.770
about I'll touch on quickly.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.207
In v13 there were four different
methods to the

00:03:36.207 --> 00:03:37.490
TrafficEstimatorService.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.468
What I demonstrated before in
the v13 request that I showed

00:03:40.468 --> 00:03:42.236
you was estimate
campaign list.

00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:44.861
This is where you're passing
in a series of campaigns

00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:47.066
wrapped in ad groups wrapped
in keywords.

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:49.420
You're getting the whole
contextual information.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.513
v13 includes shortcuts, where
you can say, I don't want to

00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:55.658
provide campaign targeting
information.

00:03:55.658 --> 00:03:58.380
I don't want to provide ad
group bid information.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.230
Just give me the most generic,
raw data about how this

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.145
keyword performed.

00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:06.355
And so you could call estimate
keyword list without having to

00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:08.620
pass in all those extra lapping
layers and just

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.320
passing in keywords directly.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.725
So in v201008, those top three
had been combined to just one

00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:16.488
get method.

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:18.550
What it means is that you're
always going to have to create

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.220
a campaign in an
ad group layer.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.470
You can't skip right to
the keywords per se.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.698
But we think that overall it's
a benefit, because thinking

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:26.759
about setting campaign
information, thinking about

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.080
setting ad group information
is going to give you better

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.505
traffic estimates.

00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:34.920
And then the fourth method
there, check keyword traffic.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.860
This was a very simple method of
the old service that, for a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.938
given keyword, it just said true
or false, basically, does

00:04:41.938 --> 00:04:42.426
it have traffic?

00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:44.380
Does it get enough traffic
that it would

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.410
even serve at all?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.900
It's been deprecating in the
TrafficEstimatorService,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.892
because the same basic
information can be retrieved

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:52.210
from the targeting
idea service.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.850
And so some other
changes here.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.560
One is that in v13 you'd always
assumed you had a

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.090
budget of $50.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.590
So if you are setting very high
max CPC on a very popular

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.630
keyword, it was just cutting
you off at a certain point,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.394
saying, don't expect more clicks
than this, because I

00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:10.630
assume you have a $50 budget.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.037
In v201008, the budgets--
the sky is the limit.

00:05:13.037 --> 00:05:16.279
It's going to tell you, if you
have infinite money, this is

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.400
how many clicks you
can expect to get.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.142
And the other thing, which I
pointed out before, is that

00:05:21.142 --> 00:05:24.115
the average ad position has
changed from being-- in v13 it

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:25.155
was a fixed range.

00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:27.805
You either fell in one to
three or four to six.

00:05:27.805 --> 00:05:32.602
Versus now, in v201008, the
ranges are more dynamic with

00:05:32.602 --> 00:05:36.780
decimal values and more accurate
about where in the

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.274
range you're going to be.

00:05:38.274 --> 00:05:40.990
And the last one there is that
average cost, which is

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.640
something that wasn't available
in v13, is now

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.440
available in v201008.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.840
And then the last one here
is there is a slight

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.740
change in unit cost.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.840
We've made it five units
cheaper, so if that's

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.840
important for you, then it's now
cheaper than ever to use.
