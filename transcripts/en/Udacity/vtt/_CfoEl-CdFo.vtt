00:00:00.585 --> 00:00:04.380
We'll take the four levels from the simplest to the most powerful.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.450
The simplest form of contract that Boniyar calls level one

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.940
guarantee is a syntactic or signature contract, in which the names and

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.670
arguments of the component operations are specified.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.210
Thus guaranteeing it is possible to link components into an application.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.660
Can't really imagine using components in which you don't have this,

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.590
this level of guarantee.
