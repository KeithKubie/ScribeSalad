Speaker 1:          00:02          You're full

Speaker 2:          00:03          all day,

Speaker 1:          00:05          ladies and gentlemen coming at you live from paradise. I'm in Hawaii right now and uh, I was gonna, I was gonna watch the Bisping fight, the Bisbing Kelvin guest him fight live and uh, do like sort of a breakdown of it while it was happening. But the shit was going on at like two o'clock in the morning out here and it wasn't happening. I have been eating like a pig and drinking. I've been doing vacation type shit. I'm a strong believer in that. You need to do vacation time. Like vacation time is important. You can't just be working all the time. Occasionally you have to just fuck off. And so that's what I've been doing. I just been fucking off. So I, I was tired and I decided I am not going to stay up late. And so I watched it in the morning. I watched it this morning and I've got a couple of thoughts on it.

Speaker 1:          01:04          First of all, um, Brennan Chub said this on his Instagram and I could not agree more. I don't think you should be allowed to fight three weeks after you have a brutal fight like Michael Bisping did with GSP. He got rocked, he got choked unconscious, and then three weeks later he's fighting a really dangerous young and up and coming Kelvin gasoline and Kelvin is a beast. He's gotten nasty boxing and that is what he showed in that fight. He hit him with a, a beautiful straight right jab and a right hand behind it and Oh my goodness, it was just the kid is just on fire. He's, he's just on another level right now. I'm, I'm super, super impressed with Calvin. Kelvin has got lightning fast hands and he's, he's an interesting guy because he's what I would call a tweener. And what that means is that I don't, I mean I think Kelvin

Speaker 2:          02:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:09          in the best, best of times, like if Kelvin has the best camp and the, the best performance, it's entirely possible that he could beat anybody at 185 pounds. But should he be at 185 pounds? Boy, I don't know, because Chris Weidman is that 185 pounds. And when Chris Weidman got Calvin to the ground, it really did look like you're talking about two completely different weight classes. And Chris Weidman was able to choke Kelvin out. And obviously Weidman is a former champion and there's absolutely no shame in losing to Chris Weidman, but it's just the way, um, it looked when you were watching the fight, to me it looked like two different weight classes and, um, there's a lot of people that think that really Calvin should be fighting at 170 pounds if he got the proper diet. And he doing that for a while. Uh, it w at one point in time he was, uh, I know Dolce was working with him for awhile and, uh, he had his diet in line and he looked fantastic and then, you know, just things happen and he didn't want to pay the Dolce money.

Speaker 1:          03:18          And, uh, I dunno who he's working with right now as a nutritionist, but I just, uh, I think he's a phenomenal fighter. I just don't know if 185 pounds is, is the right way class for them. It could be. I mean, it could be that maybe what he really needs to do is just lose some body fat, put on some muscle and maybe 185 pounds will be his weight class. It's just that constant debate of whether or not you should weaken your body and drop down to the minimum weight you can or whether or not you should fight at a natural way and have a healthy body. It's a real good argument. And I'm pausing right now because I'm pulling something up. Uh, there's a girl that just died in Australia. Uh, she died, um, very recently. Uh, she was preparing for a Moitai fight and it's just, it's just part of what this sport is about. Unfortunately. It really bothers the fucking shit out of me. I think it's the scariest thing. Uh, I think, um, yeah. Here it is. Teenager dies training.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Here it is. Um, the, the girl's name, she was 18 years old and her name was Jessica Lindsey and she died while she was cutting weight. She was an amateur kickboxer in Australia. Um, I cut weight a bunch of times when I was doing TaeKwonDo tournaments. And, uh, it is brutal. It's, it's terrible. I'm, I was bad at it too. I didn't do it correctly. I just worked out real hard the night before and wore rubber suits and the whole deal and dehydrated myself. And I did rehydrate myself well either. So I felt like shit the next day when I was fighting. And a lot of wrestlers back in the day used to do the same thing. Um, my weight cut though was nowhere near as extreme as some of the MMA fighters do. Some MMA fighters. I mean, they're getting on death's door and, um, I just, I just think it's one of the most disturbing and, uh, most unfortunate aspects of MMA.

Speaker 1:          05:35          Uh, Kevin Lee said before his last fight with Tony Ferguson that, you know, he felt like he was, he was dying when he was cutting weight and he made the weight Habib number go mid off, who's the, if not the best, one of the very best lightweights in the world. Um, undefeated had his body shut down last time. He tried to make the and couldn't make the Tony Ferguson fight. They pulled them out and took him to the hospital. I mean I'm, I'm beating a dead horse here cause it's something that everybody knows. Everybody's aware that it's a terrible, terrible aspect of our sport. And in my mind it's contrary to what martial arts are supposed to be about. So in that sense, I encourage Calvin to stay at 185 pounds because obviously the guy's knocked out. Vito Belfort at one 85 it just knocked out a former champion, Michael Bisping at 185 pounds.

Speaker 1:          06:29          I mean he could knock out anybody at one 85 but a guy like Chris Weidman who is very smart about cutting weight, he cuts a lot of weight, but he does it the right way. Rehydrates the right way and he's just a fucking beast. He's just so much bigger. And when he got Kelvin to the ground and submitted him with a head and arm choke boy, it just really seems like that's the wrong way class for Calvin. And then you see Calvin next fight, fight Bisbing and just fucking lights him up in the first round. Now would he have been able to do that if he fought the Bisping? That was training for George Saint Pierre. I mean, if Bisping did not have the George st Pierre fight and just went right into the Calvin gasoline fight with the same result of happen, it could very well have the way Calvin hits, he's fast as fuck.

Speaker 1:          07:18          His hands are beautiful. He throws really crisp straight punches. And in this sport there's not a whole lot of guys who have crisper, sharper hands at 185 pounds than Calvin. I mean he just has beautiful head movement and boxing and when he moves in for the kill with those hands, Whoa. I mean you saw the Vito Belfort fight. I mean he just fucked be tore up. But those straight punches and he throws them efficiently and they have snap to them. And just, and on top of that, he's a very good wrestler. I mean, a lot of people forget how good his wrestling skills are on top of all that. He's just a real threat at 185 pounds. Fascinating thing because it's just such a wide open division. He just called out, um, Robert Whittaker, who's the interim champion of course, and uh, call that Whitaker and wants Whitaker to, uh, to fight him next.

Speaker 1:          08:17          But of course Robert Whittaker is, uh, waiting for the big pay day. I would too if I was him to fight George Saint Pierre. So it's a, it's a wide open division now that st Pierre choked out. Michael Bisbing and then gelt Calvin just lights up. Bisping and of course you've got to think that Weidman is still in the mix. I mean, even though Waiban lost to Yoel Romero and then lost to gig, Arden was saucy. He's still in the mix. Uh, he was winning that Yoel Romero fight in my opinion, until he got caught with that wicked flying knee. But that's the danger of fighting Gol Meryl, you all Ramiro could do that to anybody in the world. He's just such a fucking freak athlete. Uh, so really, really wide open division to get back to that fight. Uh, I agree entirely with a, to get back to the Bisbing and Calvin gasoline fight.

Speaker 1:          09:12          I agree 100% with what Brendan Schaub said, that you really have to protect a fighter from themselves. You really can't be letting a guy fight three weeks after an absolutely brutal fight like that. It just does not make sense. It just does not make sense. Um, I don't think it's smart. I mean I understand that UFC needed someone to fill in and short notice because Anderson Silva tested positive for performance enhancing drugs and they did not want to lose the, uh, Shanghai main event. So it turns into an even bigger fight when you've got the former middleweight champion right off of his loss three weeks later fighting again. But it's just not smart. I know Bisbing wanted to do it. I know Bisping would probably do it again if you asked him to do it. If you ask Bisping to fight in a couple of weeks and probably probably do it again.

Speaker 1:          10:03          And, and um, someone was talking about him fighting in England, I believe in March, which boy, I mean that's less crazy, but still crazy, right? Cause uh, we're basically in into December. So you've got December, January, February, three months off really, and then March. But of course during that time he's going to be sparring and you know, you know, Bisbing he's a fucking animal. He's not going to train easy. He's not going to take much time off. And, uh, there's a lot of debate as to how much time a fighter should be forced to take off after they get knocked out. And here's the thing about that. You're, you're seeing guys when they're fighting, fighting

Speaker 3:          10:49          and you're seeing them getting knocked out and you're seeing them fighting, you know, X amount of months later. So you saw Bisping, he didn't get knocked out by George Saint Pierre, but he certainly got rocked with that left hook. And then, uh, he got choked out when he was on the ground out. Now, for people who don't know a lot about MMA, getting choked out is not nearly as bad as getting knocked out. It's, there's almost nothing to it. The way to look at it is if you look at a garden hose and you know how you can bend the garden hose, crimp it down, and it stops the water from coming out, that's exactly what happens to your fucking brain when you get choked out. When you get choked out, it's basically cutting off the blood. Your brain, you wake up and you're fine. You don't have memory issues, you don't have balance issues for the most part, especially if you've only been out for a couple of seconds.

Speaker 3:          11:37          Um, it happens all of the time in training. Uh, I've seen many, many guys get choked unconscious. I've choked people unconscious. They come back and they're fine. It's not that big of a deal, but you've got to realize before he got choked, he got hit with a big fucking left-hand and hurt. And it was a great fight. Before that, uh, both guys were, were giving and tanking fighters need time off after fights. So you're seeing that, right? You're seeing the actual competition between George Saint Pierre, Michael Bisping. Well, where are you not seeing is how many times he got hit during training? Did he get rock Devore did he get clipped and dropped? Uh, did he get dropped in hurt and take a couple of days off and then get back to training again? Only he knows only his camp knows. And most of the times they're not talking. But you hear about it all the time.

Speaker 3:          12:28          And matter of fact, I was talking to Forrest Griffin wants, and Forrest was telling me that before he fought Anderson Silva, he was knocked unconscious twice in training. That's fucking crazy. I mean, here he is about to fight the greatest pound for pound fighter of all time. Next to, I mean there's, there's, there's three guys in that debate, right? My, my number one guy right now is mighty mouse. I think just, he, he represents the highest skill level. But does he represent the highest competition level in terms of like the guys he's faced? I don't think so. I think number one competition level is Jon Jones. Jon Jones has choked out Liotta Machida rampage Jackson. He's beat Rashad Evans. He beat Alexander Gustafson, he beat Glover to Shera. He beat Vitor Belfort. He beat Daniel Cormier twice. I mean fuck, he's beaten everybody. I think you look at competition wise, John Jones is a very strong argument for the greatest of all time, but Anderson Silva's fucking right there.

Speaker 3:          13:38          Two men, Anderson Silva in his prime. I think when you look at the way he knocked out Vito Belfort with that front kick to the face, when you look at the way he fought, Forrest Griffin in that fight we were just talking about, andK owed him like a magician the way he fought Stephan Bonner and literally put his back up against the cage. And again, Stephan Bonner and Forrest Griffin, they're just, no disrespect. They're not at the same level as the Liotta Machida or glow over to Shera or some of the guys that Jon Jones has phased. But it's the way Anderson beat them. I mean, Anderson was just in his prime. He was off fucking master, like a real master. Uh, so Forrest Griffin fighting Anderson Silva after being Kao twice in training camp is just insane. But these are the things that fighters do when they have to do them. You know, you're talking about a giant pay day, you're talking about a big fight.

Speaker 3:          14:37          You give the guy a chance like, do you want to fight? Do you think you could fight? Yeah, I, yeah, I could do it. I could do it and they'd go out there and they're compromise and they get clipped and you see it immediately. Sometimes. Sometimes you see guys, they get clipped and you don't know why. I mean they get hit with something and look at any deal anytime when a person is throwing a punch or kick at you and it connects, it can put you out, but there's no doubt at all, no doubt about it, that the resiliency of a fighter after they'd been code is compromised. There's just no doubt about it. When you see a guy who has been code and then you see them get hit weeks, months later, they cannot take a shot at the same way. Their brain is still recovering.

Speaker 3:          15:21          Their body is still recovering from the concussion. And you have to figure out a way to balance being a risk taker and seizing an opportunity, which is a huge opportunity versus concentrating on having a long and healthy career. Now that said, for Michael Bisping, he's kind of at the end of his career. I mean, he said essentially that he wants a fight one more time in England, which would be beautiful for him. And I hope they give him a, you know, a good match up. So it'll be a good fight for the fans. And I hope they give Michael some time off. You know, give the man some time to really relax and then go through a real nice three, four month training camp, getting excellent shape and give his best effort for one more. Go at it. I would like to see that, but it might be the hardest shit in the world to talk a fighter into retiring.
