and we can get past problems of

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179
and we can get past problems of
 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.120
and we can get past problems of
visualization and even the problems of

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130
visualization and even the problems of
 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.460
