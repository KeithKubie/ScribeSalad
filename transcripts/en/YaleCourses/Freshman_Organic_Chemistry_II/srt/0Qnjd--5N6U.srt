1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,350
Okay. So we're gonna finish up
talking about aromatic city,

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,680
uh,

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,680
talking then about reactions as well
as molecules that are unusually stable,

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,670
that is transition states that
are stabilized. Uh, that's deals,

5
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:21,720
alder reactions, which are
Cyclo additions and also, uh,

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,920
other Perry cyclic reactions
like electrocycle like reactions.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,270
Then we'll go onto a spectroscopy.
Okay.

8
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:33,810
So we're generalizing the
concept of [inaudible]. Uh,

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,120
we saw last time that
hook all thought it would,

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,180
there would be unusual stability when
you had four n plus two Pi electrons in a

11
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:43,944
ring.

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,340
That is when you have an odd number of
electron pairs because every odd numbered

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,430
orbital goes down in energy
when you form a ring.

14
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:57,600
So if there's an odd number in total,
there are more going down that up.

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,220
And then we'll go on to see, as I said
about transition state era anticipate.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,631
So first,

17
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:08,190
just one slide that'll be on the exam
on Monday or is fair game anyhow,

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,160
which is,
uh,

19
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,760
some things that are not bins
annoyed but are still aromatic.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,030
Like Cyclo,
Penta dying of course is a ring,

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,500
but it's not a ring of
conjugated p orbitals because
there's one intervening one.

22
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,730
So the terminal P orbitals
of the dying don't interact,

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,340
don't overlap with one another,
right?

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,180
But if you pull off the proton
with a base, then they interact.

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,700
So now you have five electrons in this,
an ion in the Pi system,

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,650
and it's unusually stable.

27
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:45,450
You can pull off that hydrogen
from a carbon with hydroxide.

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,510
It's p,

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,420
the PKA of this compound is 15
it's more acidic than water is.

30
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,650
It's better to pull a hydrogen off
that carbon than to pull a hydrogen off

31
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:58,140
oxygen. Now what, what, um,

32
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,540
what's the normal pka for pulling a carbon
fully in the hydrogen off the carbon?

33
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,130
Do you remember if it's just
normal, right? Pardon me?

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,650
It's about 50 right? Of course.
This is Alec. So you might say,

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,070
and in fact it's doubly Allah late.
So you might say that helps out.

36
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,050
No doubt it does help out.
But notice that it has six Pi electrons,

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,190
same as benzene.

38
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:27,090
And we would expect on the basis of our
theory for it to be unusually stable.

39
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,550
But if it's just that,
it's Alec,

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,300
think about doing the same thing
with the seven membered ring.

41
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,440
If you pulled the hydrogen off the
ch two here of a seven member during,

42
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:41,490
you get this anti on, which would be
stabilized by that resident structure,

43
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,560
that one, that one, that
one, that one, that one,

44
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,780
and an enormous number
of resonance structures,

45
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,130
but the PKA is 39 right?

46
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,810
It's 20 what?

47
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:56,811
24 powers of 10 less acidic than
the one on the five membered ring.

48
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,900
Even though you can draw many fewer only
five resonance structures in that case.

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,510
So it's not a question
of resonance structures.

50
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:09,100
It's a question of how many electron
pairs there are in that ring.

51
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,390
And if it's an odd number, it's stable,
and if it's an even number of payers,

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,820
then it's not stable.
Okay,

53
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,850
so that one has eight Pi electrons for
N it's anti aromatic instead of being

54
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,570
aromatic.
Right.

55
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,790
Another interesting
analog is a [inaudible].

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,420
So here's a case of psych low-protein
reacting with an unusually stable cad ion.

57
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,480
Try Fennel methyl cad ion.

58
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,030
Notice that that cat eye
and is triply Ben Zelig.

59
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:44,650
There are three benzene rings that helps
stabilize the positive charge or to

60
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,880
speak more accurately,

61
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,510
who's electrons are stabilized
by the vacant orbital on carbon.

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,570
Still it's,

63
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,670
it's exothermic to transfer the hydride
notice it's a hydride not a proton.

64
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:04,090
It's pulling off h minus this
time onto the fennel ch three,

65
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,530
uh, to get to generate this
sick click conjugated cad.

66
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:13,531
I am so that one is even more stable
than the unusually stable triply Benzyl

67
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,950
lequon. Now what, what's the uh,

68
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,900
accounting of that one? Uh,
the counting of Pi electrons.

69
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,480
Roy, can you tell me how many Pi electrons
in a ring of that, of that cat eye and

70
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,950
is it going to conform
to foreign plus two.

71
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,290
Okay. We had a double
bond. That's two electrons.

72
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,010
And what do we get from that
center when we pull off h minus

73
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,210
in the p orbital

74
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,630
zero. So how, how many do we have too?

75
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:53,060
Is that four n plus two
where n is an Integer,

76
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,220
that's one and a zero. So that one
you expect to be unusually stable.

77
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:02,150
It's just got the one pair that goes
down in energy. When you form a ring,

78
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,030
two Pi electrons is four n plus two.

79
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,540
And notice that now if
you go to see seven here,

80
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:13,541
we went in the anti and to see seven h
eight here we go to s to c seven pardon

81
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:19,691
me to see seven h seven and I am here
to see seven h seven cat I and right.

82
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,090
If we do the same trick with that react,

83
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,430
this hydrocarbon with that Trifecta,
methyl cad ion.

84
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,450
But that is also, it's the same that's
also downhill. It's favorable to make.

85
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:37,400
This is, does that conform to
four n plus two what did he say?

86
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,233
Or whole

87
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,890
how many Pi electrons
and c seven h seven plus

88
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,190
say US foreign plus two.
Same as benzene. Okay,

89
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,020
so here are some really weird compounds
that you wouldn't expect to be so

90
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,110
unusually stable that are,
because it's a generalization,

91
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,540
the idea of air Medicity but it
applies not only to ground states,

92
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,700
but also to transition states.

93
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:09,701
When you get a ring that has a conjugation
among a bunch of orbitals that are

94
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,180
uh, where the number of electrons is
foreign plus two. So in this case,

95
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,610
the transition states aromatic,

96
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,960
even though the starting material
and the products are not aromatic,

97
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,340
that that means is that they're special
stability only in the transition state.

98
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,780
And therefore the reactions
will be unusually easy. Okay,

99
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:31,610
so let's see if we have
some examples of that.

100
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:35,900
We'll look at cyclo auditions in
particular the deals, alder reaction,

101
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,310
and also at electrocycle leak reactions.
We'll start with the cyclo additions.

102
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,330
So the deals, all the reaction was
the subject of, of a Nobel Prize,

103
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:48,530
surprisingly enough to deals and older.
Okay.

104
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:52,070
It involved a dying
reacting with an alkene.

105
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,100
So an EAD and a dying and they react
with one another with three pairs of

106
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:01,130
electrons shifting to
form a ring. So it, it,

107
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,460
it has four sigma electrons that are
involved in this and two Pi electrons in

108
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,650
the product.
In the starting material,

109
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,180
it's four Pi electrons and two
Pi electrons. It's six electrons,

110
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:18,560
three pairs that are being involved.
And we can write curved arrows like that,

111
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,020
but we might want to think of
it a little more carefully.

112
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,380
Suppose we just draw the two approaching
one another homo to Lumo like that.

113
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,260
Now there are two problems here.
Uh,

114
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:34,670
one is that we've got the Lumo
drawn upside down. In fact,

115
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:38,690
there are three problems, okay. That we
can just write the signs the other way.

116
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,530
That's no problem.

117
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,570
Another problem is that the hydrogens
which we haven't shown the sigma hydrogens

118
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:48,050
are going to be running into one
another when we do that. Right?

119
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,890
And there's also another problem somehow
Pi electrons have to become sigma

120
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:57,590
electrons here and here.

121
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,100
It has to be an end on not a Pi
interaction in order to do that,

122
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,990
how could we get around these problems?

123
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,703
Yeah.

124
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,850
Okay. We can rotate the 180 degrees.
That'll make the signs correct.

125
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
How do we get around the other problems
of say the hydrogens running into one

126
00:08:19,361 --> 00:08:20,194
another?

127
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,700
If we rotated at 90
degrees that that's true,

128
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,120
but you don't get the best overlap
that way for forming and do bond.

129
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,450
Anybody else got an idea,
Brandon?

130
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,310
Okay.

131
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,850
Put it under. So approach,
make the approach,

132
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,880
not make the approach where
the PA parallel to the
direction of the Px is right.

133
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:43,144
Like this.

134
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,940
Right now we got around all those
problems so we can form this new,

135
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:52,450
but notice the transition state
is folded because of this,

136
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:54,310
because they're not coming
together in a plane,

137
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,210
so to the product and
we have to unfold it.

138
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,160
We have to grab that bottom black line
and pull it up into the plane. Okay,

139
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:05,670
so the product is then going to look like
that once we flattened it and you can

140
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,230
see the new bonds that are formed.

141
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,370
Now let's take just a little bit about
what we would predict in in connection

142
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:15,630
with Stereo chemistry of this.
Suppose the starting a Alkene,

143
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,560
we're of a z configurations.
Suppose it had two methyl groups on it.

144
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,870
Okay. Then a few form those
two bonds at once. The,

145
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,560
they'll still be [inaudible] here. Right.
And there'll be sis in the product.

146
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:32,490
That methyl groups. Okay.
How about the dying?

147
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,520
Suppose the dying had
the e z configuration,

148
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:40,680
so methyls that sits here and trans here.
Okay.

149
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,840
Then if we look at the transition state,

150
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:46,920
it'll be still sis here and trans here.
Right?

151
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:50,310
And if we flatten that out,
where will the methyls be in the product?

152
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,210
How about there's going to be
a methyl here on that carbon.

153
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,140
Is it going to be pointing toward you
or away when you flatten the ring out,

154
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
if this is the way it's in the transition
state, try to think of it mechanically.

155
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:06,030
We break this bond, right?
Is that going to be,

156
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,030
when we flatten this, why don't we
pull this up and flatten it out?

157
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:13,560
Is that methyl going to be coming
up toward us or back into the board?

158
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,793
Yeah.

159
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,870
This is a kind of mechanical thinking
that that may be. It may be, it's usually,

160
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:28,290
you know, they, they're, they're used.
We used to require people to buy models.

161
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:28,741
You know,
these,

162
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:33,300
you've seen those that you may and that
probably helped with this mechanical, uh,

163
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,160
perception. How many think it when you,
when you flat and when you pull this up,

164
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,860
the methyl there is going
to be pointing towards you.

165
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,900
How many think it's going
to be pointed away? Ah,

166
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:50,350
that's reassuring that the vast
majority are right in this.

167
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:55,480
It's coming towards you. Okay? So you
can look at this in the privacy or room.

168
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,680
Maybe use toothpicks and grapes or
something to make a bottle and see how it

169
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:03,340
twists like that. Okay.
Now, how about this one?

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,320
When you fold this up, what's it going
to be at the bottom? Carbon is it?

171
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,420
How many think it's going
to be pointing towards? You

172
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,080
have the courage of your conviction.
Okay.

173
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,350
How many think it's going
to be pointing in a way?

174
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,280
The ways have it democracy wins again,

175
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:27,330
that'd be okay. It's a
way in that case. Okay,

176
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:30,960
so you'd have a little practice to
think about, about how such things work.

177
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,810
And there'll be more of these
as you go as we go along here.

178
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,270
So those two methyls will
be trans preserving the
kind of relation they had in

179
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:43,200
the starting material through that
particular transition state. Okay.

180
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:47,430
Now is that true? Okay,
so here we take a muscle.

181
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,620
First we'll look at Riggio chemistry,

182
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,700
and then we're going to look at Stereo
Chemistry. So Riggio chemistry. Okay.

183
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,140
So now we could imagine this dye
in the methyl substituted dying,

184
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,850
uh, to be either approaching
this way or to be upside down.

185
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:05,650
It could be either way.
Okay,

186
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,820
so we're going to slide it over the top
of the other one like that and make the

187
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,370
new bonds.
And notice in this case,

188
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,720
once we unfolded to unfold it,
we're going to have to grab this bond.

189
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,890
It's in the form of a you when it
makes those new bonds on the left,

190
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,100
you see like that one's
on top ones on the bottom.

191
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,880
They've made these new bonds here and
we're going to have to unfold it like that

192
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,420
to draw a normal picture of it,
right?

193
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,070
And when we do that, this methyl
group is going to come over here.

194
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,830
That is the new blue double
bond is here on the right.

195
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:42,820
But when we grab it and fold it out to
the left, it's going to be there. Okay.

196
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,860
So spatial perception is entering
into the, is raising its ugly head.

197
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:51,580
Now, and in this case, when we folded out,

198
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:55,210
the methyls obviously going
to be down right now. In fact,

199
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:57,150
those two products form,
right?

200
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,140
9% of this and 45% of this. Okay. Now,

201
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:06,370
why is there so much more of
this transition state than
if that transition state,

202
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,910
incidentally,
notice that the dying,

203
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,900
that the dying is not only
over this double bond,

204
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,310
it's also over the, as close as
it can be to the COO double bond.

205
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,330
There's a secondary interaction to the
orbitals that makes it go that way.

206
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:26,530
That's called Endo orientation.
But don't worry about that. Uh,

207
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,630
I struggled here how to do
this to make it look realistic.

208
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,990
That's the way it really does.
Most people wouldn't draw it that way.

209
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:37,320
They'd draw to approaching just,
uh,

210
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,630
just the die in here and
the alkene on the right.

211
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,200
And this would come in and that would come
in and they draw the new bonds. Right?

212
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,980
But really it approaches above. And
that's, I think that's interesting.

213
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:51,910
So that's why I took the trouble to
draw it that way. But when you do that,

214
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,410
you notice that the dying could be either
such that it's close to the CEO to,

215
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:59,290
or it could be out here so that
if you look at it from the top,

216
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:04,291
it can either be you or
it could be an s right.

217
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,900
And it prefers to be a you to have
the dye in closer to the carbon eel.

218
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,560
Okay.
So given that that's true,

219
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,270
why might you expect to get rather little
of this and more of the bottom stuff?

220
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,960
Any ideas?
I Aisha.

221
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,500
Yeah. Even though the dying is
attractive to that group on the bottom,

222
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,400
which is why it's formed into
a you rather than an s, right.

223
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,690
You would also have it close in this case,
but in the case on top,

224
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,900
you have those two methyls
on top of one another.

225
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,470
So it looks like steric hindrance
could explain this. Okay.

226
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,120
But there's another possibility as well.
Perhaps there's an intermediate,

227
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,420
perhaps one bond forms first in the rate
determining step and then a second bond

228
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,800
forms.
And you have this intermediate,

229
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,640
which on this side is an anti
and adjacent to a carbonyl group.

230
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,740
So that's an anal eight
and on the left it's Alec,

231
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,090
right? Cause we can draw a resonance
structure of that. Now, if that were true,

232
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,400
if you had this intermediate,

233
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,790
why might you predict getting more of
this than have this more of the stuff on

234
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:23,180
the bottom? Why is the one on the bottom
of better? Al Lily Kinzer immediate

235
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,820
Mary,
do you have any idea?

236
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,870
The only difference between the alley on
the top and the alley on the bottom is

237
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:38,420
where the methyl is in the top.

238
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:41,720
It's on the middle carbon in the bottom.

239
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,060
It's on a terminal carbon
on the double bond.

240
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,780
Let's think about the residents structure.
You would draw Mary,

241
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,650
were you about to say something?
Huh?

242
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,510
In that resonance structure, this methyl
is stabilizing that cat ion, right?

243
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,100
Not In this case when it's on the middle
carbon because the AL Lilly charges on

244
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,270
one end or the other.

245
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,740
So one could say that this
is a more stable intermediate
and therefore you'd get

246
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:12,740
that.
Or it could just be that at the train.

247
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,020
The transition state is
a little unsymmetrical.

248
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,720
The way we showed in other
cases where a bridge thing,

249
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:21,830
like mercury wasn't in the middle,
but a little toward one side. Okay.

250
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:25,160
So it could just be that
both bonds form at once,

251
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,330
but not precisely in step with one
another one a little more than the other.

252
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,880
Now if it went through an intermediate,

253
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,810
there's a test for it to see
whether there's an intermediate.

254
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,150
Because if you have an intermediate,

255
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,340
then you would imagine that
that could rotate here, right?

256
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,330
So you could, this could move over
here before it form the new bond,

257
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,670
or indeed this one could rotate,

258
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,660
could rotate around this bond and bring
that instead of on the top where it is

259
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:56,780
now on the bottom as
it approaches this one.

260
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,890
So we could have these rotations that
would change the stereochemistry of the

261
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:03,260
product.
So we can test that.

262
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,730
So let's look at the
stereo chemistry of the,

263
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,210
now we've put two of these groups on
and their sis to one another, right?

264
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,660
And if we put that on top and make
the new bonds and then fold it back,

265
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,060
grabbed this new double bond,
the one here and fold it back.

266
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,540
We see that these two groups will
be adjacent to one another sis.

267
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,530
So we'd expect to assist product, right?
And when we form those new red bonds,

268
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,023
okay,

269
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:37,150
so assists alkene should give us cis
cyclohexene and that in fact forms in 68%

270
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:43,130
yield. Okay? If you take the other, uh,

271
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,100
stereo isomer of the Alkene,
the Trans one

272
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,030
and do the same trick,
right?

273
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,470
You get the Trans cyclohexene
and that went in 84% yield,

274
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,910
right? And they don't give, they
don't know what El, what isn't here.

275
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:04,080
This is what you actually isolate and
can sell to your neighbor, right? The,

276
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,800
the uh,
uh,

277
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,380
that you don't form the wrong
isomers so it doesn't rotate.

278
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,020
So there's not an intermediate,
okay.

279
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,200
So the dying just sits
down on the Ian at forms,

280
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:21,201
the two sigma bonds simultaneously from
the same phase right from the top here,

281
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,520
right? So there's no rotatable
intermediate with only one new sigma bond.

282
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,990
So you didn't have this situation
where you could rotate day.

283
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,030
So it's a concerted reaction. You
form both bonds at once. Okay.

284
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,290
Now how about with respect to
the dye in Stereo Chemistry? He,

285
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:44,160
here we have II and III, the
Trans arrangements around
those two double bonds.

286
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,940
So we put those on top for him,
the new bonds.

287
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,840
And you see that now as a drawn here,

288
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:56,100
the product in [inaudible]
81% yield has everything sis,

289
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,340
this carbon, this carbon,
this carbon and this carbon.

290
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,900
Now these two carbons in the ring being
cis to one another, or not surprising,

291
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,390
you couldn't make those trans,
it would be too strange,

292
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,960
but that their cysts to these

293
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,540
right says that this had
to be in the u form here,

294
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,680
not the s form.

295
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,430
And that these are both up shows that you
formed the both bonds at once as shown

296
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:25,900
here.
And if you,

297
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:30,570
this is another place for you to sit
in your room and think about how these

298
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,540
things will unfold and what
four points in what direction.

299
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,960
Now if you take this, uh, EEZ,

300
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,030
so e,
z isomer and,

301
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,470
and do the same trick,

302
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,610
then in 15 hours and hundred 50 degrees,

303
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:54,180
you get this to be trans instead of cysts.
Okay?

304
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
But notice the difference in conditions.

305
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,360
This one happens in five
minutes at 120 degrees.

306
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,190
This one takes 15 hours at a,
at a much higher temperature,

307
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:09,360
30 degrees Celsius, hotter,
right? So there's something wrong.

308
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:13,740
Something's slow about
this reaction right now.

309
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:16,740
Can we figure out what might
be slow about that reaction?

310
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,070
Why might it be bad to
come in and do this?

311
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,450
Notice that that hydrogen and a methyl
are near one another when we have the

312
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:34,590
rotation around this single bond,
so that these are adjacent to one another,

313
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,023
right?

314
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,980
So it would prefer the
s trans con formation,

315
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,990
s beans, the single bond in a
dying between two double bonds.

316
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,440
So it can be as or trans,
right?

317
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,800
So this prefers to be as trans,
but to do the deals,

318
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,690
alder reaction to it has to be CIS.

319
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:59,860
So those terminal carbons can
be near the same Ian. Right?

320
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,580
So because it prefers to be this way,
it's much harder.

321
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:07,960
You have to put in an extra energy to
make it [inaudible] as well as to do the

322
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:12,560
reaction. Okay. Now,

323
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:15,800
just to show you some of the variety
of the deals, all the reaction.

324
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:18,500
It's not just simple compounds
like the ones we showed here.

325
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,120
You can use the settling.

326
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,110
So if we do that trick in
this one at 150 degrees,

327
00:21:24,111 --> 00:21:28,100
you get a dying Cyclo Hex,
a dying product,

328
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:32,510
because the subtlety and when it loses
one of its bonds becomes an eed Nada,

329
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,820
not a single bond. Okay. Or, or you
can have a ring involved like this,

330
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,010
right? And notice that that's
the product and it's it,

331
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,300
it happens very fast.
That one molar concentrations,

332
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:51,830
the half life or the equivalent of a
half life is a second right at 20 at room

333
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:56,780
temperature. Okay. Actually
below room temperature. So, uh,

334
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,470
have you ever seen a
skeleton like that before?

335
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,570
Let me draw it a little differently.
Row. Yeah. Rebel. See where

336
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,910
you got. It's two names.
Metathesis. All right. Right.

337
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,820
This is, this is the starting with Joe.
Wanted to add hydrogens there for the,

338
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,810
for the metathesis polymerization,
the ring opening metathesis.

339
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,620
That's actually absolutely true. But I
was thinking of an earlier example of it.

340
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,483
Yeah.

341
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,280
The Bartlett and knocks of skeleton
could be made that way, right?

342
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,360
So you could make by cyclic compounds,
by a deals all the reaction.

343
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,280
Or look at this one, this
molecule, this, uh, uh,

344
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,970
unsaturated Aldehyde is called a Kirlian.
Right?

345
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,680
And you can take two molecules
of that and dimerize them.

346
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,680
What's special about this one?
How is it different from the other ones?

347
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,990
What's special about
the six membered ring?

348
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,570
It has an oxygen in it. It's not just
carbons that could do this trick, right?

349
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,840
So what they all have in common is they
form a six membered ring with a double

350
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:11,990
bond in it. Although if he used an
acetylene, it could be two double bonds.

351
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,130
But when you want to do a synthesis
project and you see that there's a six

352
00:23:16,131 --> 00:23:21,020
membered ring with a double bond in that
you think deals alder reaction, right?

353
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:25,010
So you'll see if you can take it apart
into an Ian and a die in that would do

354
00:23:25,011 --> 00:23:25,850
that kind of thing.

355
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,390
Uh,
okay.

356
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,350
So, uh, the deals,

357
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:39,000
all the reaction has this cyclical
six electron transition state.

358
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,420
The one we look at here, and we
could actually, uh, look at the,

359
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,850
at what the transition
state looks like and the,

360
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,680
and motion at the time the two
bonds are being formed in parallel.

361
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,970
So we have the homo in
front and the Lubo behind,

362
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,110
right. Or actually on top. Right.

363
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,940
And those will interact to give a
homeowner, not the homo, but the home. Oh,

364
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,400
minus one.
It turns out in the transition state,

365
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,590
but it has this node right down the middle
that both of the starting pieces had.

366
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,490
Okay. And if you look at the, uh,

367
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,970
at the Lumo on the bottom
and the home on the top,

368
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,990
then that they give the homo
in the transition state,

369
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:24,260
which doesn't have the node
down the middle. Right?

370
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,310
So that's how they go together and
the transition state. And here we see,

371
00:24:28,311 --> 00:24:31,790
I think the emotion that's
involved in doing the,

372
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,410
going through the transition state,

373
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,610
it's curious that the hydrogen stay
more or less in place on the carbons,

374
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:40,640
do most of the moving
and forming the bonds.

375
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,590
Okay. Now can we do the
same thing with two alkenes?

376
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,470
Could we take to al key and said, have
them come together to form a cyclo butane?

377
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,333
What do you think?

378
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,043
Any

379
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,200
thoughts on this one?

380
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,660
How many electrons involved in
this ring that we're making?

381
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,260
The transition state when we're bringing
these together and make them overlap?

382
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,370
How many electrons are
changing in this process?

383
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,623
Ayesha?

384
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,880
Yeah, there are two po,
there's pie here and pie here.

385
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,930
That's four electrons and they
become these two bonds here.

386
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,080
Two sigma bonds. So there
are four electrons, not four,

387
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,670
so it's four n where n is one not four.
N Plus two is in the deals.

388
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:39,110
All the reaction. So this one would
have an anti aromatic transition state.

389
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,600
Right? Of course. It
also is strained here,

390
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:44,270
so the reaction might be
expected to go the other way,

391
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,220
but that doesn't work either.

392
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,110
It's the same transition state with four
Pi electrons for electrons involved.

393
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,250
So it doesn't work in either
direction. On the other hand, if you,

394
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:59,480
because another way of looking at is is
the whole bowl of one is orthogonal to

395
00:25:59,481 --> 00:26:04,190
the Lumo of the other. That's the same
analysis we did and showing why h two cat,

396
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:05,024
they had to an hour.

397
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,423
Okay.

398
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,030
But if we shine light on it,

399
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,570
then we take an electron out of the Homo
and put it into the Lubo and now you

400
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:21,650
can get stabilization because you've
changed the symmetry of what the orbitals

401
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:24,380
are.
So now in the excited state,

402
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,300
the Homo can interact with the Lumo of
the other one because you've changed it

403
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:33,080
from Pi to Pi Star in Put in light in,
right?

404
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:36,470
So that it's when you shift an
electron from the homo to the Lumo,

405
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,930
then you can get the reaction to occur.

406
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,230
And it's an important reaction
for most people, right?

407
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,550
Because this is a DNA double
helix. On the right is a t, t, g,

408
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:52,320
and on the left is Taa c, right? But
if we look right here in the middle,

409
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:56,400
we see two t's, right?
So if we zoom in on that,

410
00:26:56,401 --> 00:27:00,990
we're looking on the air, this flat,
we're looking in the plane of that thing.

411
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,670
Let's rotate it out toward you. So he
looked down on those two tees, right?

412
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,400
We'll look at that,
just that bit of it and rotate it up.

413
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,320
And that's what it looks like,
right?

414
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,590
And we could see what's in front
and what's it back this way.

415
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,030
And notice there's a double bond here
and a double bond here that is a double

416
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:20,370
bond here and a double bond here.
Well,

417
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:24,570
they react with one another
to make a cycle of butane. No,

418
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,660
because it's four Pi electrons
that are involved, right?

419
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:29,460
It's not an aromatic transition state.

420
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,840
How could you make them react
with one another? Pardon me?

421
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,020
With light.
Right?

422
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,740
So if you use UVB and
don't put on Sunscreen,

423
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,840
then you get that reaction happening,
right? And it forms a cycle of butane,

424
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,490
right?

425
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,490
And this thei mean photo dimerization
to do that makes the chain kink of that

426
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,250
chain where the two dimerized.
Right?

427
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,080
And that inhibits DNA replication and
transcription and is believed to be the

428
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:04,470
main source of the mutations
that give rise to melanomas.

429
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,510
So that's why you put your sunscreen on
that takes out UVB. It's to stop that,

430
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,250
stop that photo.
Dimerization a thymine. Okay.

431
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,520
Uh,
now we've been looking at cyclo additions,

432
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:21,540
which is one class of these things where
the para cyclic reactions where you can

433
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:25,920
have aromatic transition states. And now
we're going to look at the other kind,

434
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:30,921
which is electro cyclic reactions where
you start with a conjugated chain and

435
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:33,780
curl it around to make a ring.

436
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,680
So you could start with Cyclo with a hex,

437
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:42,681
the trying and make a new bond at the
bottom and shift the Pi bonds to make a

438
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:44,010
cyclic compound.

439
00:28:44,011 --> 00:28:49,011
Cyclo hexidine right now of course you
have groups that are substituted on the

440
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:54,180
ends here, maybe just hydrogens that are
in the plane, in the starting material,

441
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,550
but in and out of the
plane and the product.

442
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,840
So you're going to have to twist those
carbons to make those things that are in

443
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,040
plane out of plane.

444
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,510
So changing the pie to the sigma bond
requires a twist in one of two ways,

445
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,670
right?

446
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:16,670
You can either twist it this way where
this comes up and that goes down,

447
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,770
right? And that's called con rotation
because as we look at it here,

448
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:27,060
both of them are going counterclockwise
in the same direction, right?

449
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,700
Or we could go through this other
geometry and rotate this one counter

450
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:35,340
clockwise, but the one on
the left clockwise, right?

451
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,210
And that's called dis rotation there.
Rotate in opposite directions.

452
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:43,750
Either way would take these four groups
here and make them in and out of the

453
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:46,270
plane as they need to
be to form a sigma bond.

454
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,910
Is there a preference between these?

455
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,360
Okay,

456
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,080
well the Lotus, if you
do it this way, that the,

457
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,590
that the p orbitals that are on top and
the starting material are bending in

458
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:00,820
toward one another.

459
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,590
The top of one end touches the top of
the other end as they rotate in opposite

460
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:06,950
directions,
right?

461
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,840
So that among these orbitals
there's always going to be
an even number of nodes,

462
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,210
right? This has no nodes. But if you
change the sign here to make this a,

463
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,330
to make a note here, you'd have to
have a node someplace else as well.

464
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:27,880
So you have to have an even
number of nodes. We saw that
in in benzene too, right?

465
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,380
So that's like these things that were
involved in the hookup rule where you have

466
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,750
where you ever ring and
they all touch one another.

467
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,240
On the top you have an
even number of nodes,

468
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,940
but if you twist in
the opposite direction,

469
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,330
then the top on the right
touches the bottom on the left.

470
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,500
And now as you go around,
do you have an odd number of nodes?

471
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:50,590
There's a node here between these
two as they're beginning to touch,

472
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,400
but no other nodes, right?
So an odd number of nodes.

473
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,460
So it's just the opposite
of what hook hole is.

474
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,980
Now what name shall we
associate with that?

475
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:02,440
Yeah.

476
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,730
Have you ever seen something that
looks like that? What's funny about it,

477
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,880
you notice if you trace the top of it,

478
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,420
you get a node where,
where it has to change from red to blue.

479
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:19,410
If red is one sign and blue as
the other side of a p orbital,

480
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,150
right? It had the twist. So one place
there's a node as you go around this,

481
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:27,240
if you drew a bunch of p orbitals on that,
right?

482
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,200
So you have to have an odd number of
nodes if you have that connectivity.

483
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:34,410
And I heard you say that,
that's called a mobius strip.

484
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,680
So the opposite of vocal is Mobius.

485
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,640
Two different ways of doing this rotation
to form the Sigma Bond Hook all the

486
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:44,490
Mobius,
okay?

487
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,150
Now here's the transition state.
That would,

488
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,290
that would do the hook will right where
the top is touching the top to form a

489
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:52,650
sigma

490
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,270
bond,
okay?

491
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,350
And notice that as you do that
you preserve a mirror of symmetry,

492
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,630
okay?

493
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,550
On the left there's not a mirror. Do you
see what symmetry there is on the left?

494
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:11,230
What will change the left hand side of
the molecule into the right hand side?

495
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,360
What does it look like?

496
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,150
Things like this. It's
like a propeller, right?

497
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,450
If I could do it here.
All right,

498
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,350
so it has an axis of symmetry that that
happens all the way from the starting

499
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:31,550
material of the product. So this has a
mirror and this has an axis of symmetry.

500
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,860
Now let's see what that does.

501
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,990
Let's follow each orbital in the starting
material as it becomes an orbital in

502
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,460
product and see which one B, which
starting material or but when it comes,

503
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,310
which product orbital for
these two different ways,

504
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:51,230
the hookah whole connectivity where you
always have a mirror of symmetry and the

505
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:54,080
mobius where you always
have an axis of symmetry.

506
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,280
So of these six, uh, the six,

507
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,690
you have six atomic orbitals
here at p orbital here,
here, here, here, here, here,

508
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:07,130
six. We have six molecular orbitals, no
nodes, one node to node, three nodes,

509
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:11,630
four nodes, five nodes of which three
are occupied by the three electron pairs,

510
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,270
the same starting material
over on the right.

511
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,850
And in the product we have four P
orbitals in the conjugated system.

512
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:24,470
So sky one, two, three, four, no
nodes, one node to node three nodes.

513
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,370
But we have a sigma and the sigma
star in the product in both cases.

514
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,890
But we have the question of where do the
electrons that start here end up in the

515
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:37,910
product? Okay, that's our
question to track the Mos.

516
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,171
Okay,

517
00:33:39,171 --> 00:33:44,171
so let's look first at Psi one and we'll
use as a model the the aromatic analog

518
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,860
hook, all connectivity where we're
making, not not doing this reaction,

519
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,860
but just looking at a benzene.
This is what we did last time.

520
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,950
Remember when we can,
if we bring these two ends together,

521
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,590
they'll touch here and
that'll become more stable.

522
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,340
So this one here goes down in the product.

523
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,760
We looked at that last time.
Okay,

524
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,840
so that will happen here.

525
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:13,610
Here is at the transition state and you
see that when you have the mirror that's

526
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:14,060
happening,

527
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,710
the ones that are red on
top are overlapping here and
it's going to build as it

528
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:19,940
goes on toward product.

529
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:23,060
This will get bigger and bigger
because that's an important overlap.

530
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,530
These pi over this,

531
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:29,000
the Pi bonds back here get smaller and
smaller and this orbital of the starting

532
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:29,834
material,

533
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:34,930
this one smoothly converts into
Sigma through that transition state.

534
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,340
Okay? So cy one becomes sigma.
Now think about it on the left,

535
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:45,410
right as you begin to do it,
as you rotate them in opposite directions,

536
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,960
the bottom here touches the top here.

537
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:52,790
That's going toward a sigma
star Anti Bond, right?

538
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:57,500
Not toward a bond. In fact, how it
avoids going way, way up and energy.

539
00:34:57,501 --> 00:35:02,501
That electron pair is to decrease the
size in front and increase it in back,

540
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,530
right? But what it increases
in back, it doesn't, uh,

541
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,300
it, it forms psy one, right?

542
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:15,680
It makes the node lists set of four here,

543
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,590
right? So this one doesn't go to sigma
the way it did here it goes to cy one.

544
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,790
Now let's look at there are three
pairs of electrons we're talking about.

545
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,940
That's the lowest one of
the starting material. Let's
look at the next one, right?

546
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:33,350
As we've brought, brought it
together in the, in the, uh,

547
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,130
to make a ring in the aromatic case,
right?

548
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,500
That was unfavorable anti-bonding.
So in fact,

549
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:45,450
this pair of electrons went up in
energy, okay? And if we look here,

550
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,150
we see the same thing, right? This,

551
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,560
the society to where we're
starting is ending up in a Pi.

552
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,420
Orbital notice it's decreasing
in front and increasing in back,

553
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,840
but with the node because of that mirror.

554
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,900
So it's not psy one the lowest,

555
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:07,920
the one where all the p's are in phase
is the one that has a node in the middle.

556
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,690
So it goes to the side two of the product,
but over on this side,

557
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,830
it goes to sigma, right?
Cause that that ones,

558
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:19,980
if it had a node here in the beginning,
right now,

559
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:22,800
the red on the bottom and red on
the top are touching one another.

560
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:25,530
So that's good to make sigma.
Okay?

561
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,140
Now let's look at the third electron pair.

562
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,360
And we saw that in the aromatic
system, it went down in energy, right?

563
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,060
And in this case,
here it is.

564
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:40,140
It's the transition state and it's
going down in energy. And in fact,

565
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:44,820
it's going to form psy one. It's not so
easy to see that here, but you can, uh,

566
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,140
uh, but you can see that it's
decreasing in front at least. Okay?

567
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:53,370
I admit that. That's hard to see
on the other side. Over here.

568
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,140
It's going to,

569
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,550
it's going to decrease in front because
that's an anti-bonding interaction.

570
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,930
But the thing it's getting
in back is blue, red and red.

571
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:08,760
It's got two nodes.
So it's not going to sigh one,

572
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:12,210
we've already done that. It's not going
to decide to which has only one node.

573
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,980
It's going to cy three,

574
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,960
which has two nodes and that is terrible,
right?

575
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,710
Those electrons are head.
These sort of cancel one another,

576
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,020
but these are going way upstairs.

577
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,050
Whereas over here these two
sort of canceled one another,

578
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,670
but this is going downstairs.

579
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,510
So it's much easier to do the
hook hole than it is Mobius.

580
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,910
If you have three electron pairs,

581
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,300
notice that if you had
only two electron pairs,

582
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,510
you'd have this which more
or less cancels versus uh,

583
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,570
if you had only two electron pairs,
this one goes up more so the, so,

584
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,240
so it goes the other way.
Okay.

585
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,530
We can also look at what would happen
with the other orbitals. Right?

586
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,810
And notice that if we took an electron
from here and put it into here,

587
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,180
then it's going to go down in energy.

588
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:08,181
So photo chemically we could make it
prefer the left path with six electrons.

589
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,033
Okay.

590
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,770
So again,

591
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,970
that's what actually happens thermally
in the normal reaction is that it's the

592
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,760
hookup with six electrons,
not mobius.

593
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,603
Okay.

594
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,080
So dis rotation is preferred for a
six electron shift so that if you have

595
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:31,490
methyls like that, the two methyls
will end up on the same side.

596
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,680
Say if this one rotates up,
this one also rotates up.

597
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,760
That is if it's my little fingers,
they go like that.

598
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:43,060
They rotate in opposite directions.
Right?

599
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:47,320
Not In the same direction where one
would go up in the other down. Okay.

600
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:52,000
So stereochemistry shows you
that it formed and notice
that the cyst is the less

601
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:55,540
stable isomer. It's not forming
that because it's more stable.

602
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,100
It's forming it despite the fact that
it's less stable because it prefers to do

603
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:02,110
that.
That's foreign plus two.

604
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,650
So how could you study whether the
opposite con rotation would occur?

605
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,460
Like, like, like uh, like this, right.

606
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,060
If it were four and electrons,
what system would you look at?

607
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,500
How would you get four
electrons rather than six?

608
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:25,180
What starting material would you use?
Any ideas

609
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,320
here?
You start with hexa trying.

610
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,930
So what are you going to use Nathan?
The dying.

611
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,150
Beauty. Dying. Okay. So we'll do this.

612
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:40,330
We'll start with the beauty die
in that has methyl substituted.

613
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:45,331
So we know Stereo Chemistry and we
expect that then to do if it does,

614
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,530
let's see. So we got a methyl on
the right here and on the left here,

615
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,430
right?
And if they go do con rotation,

616
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:00,290
they'll call them out on the same side.
Okay?

617
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,300
So that's what we'll do. But there's
a problem. And the problem is this,

618
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,400
this reaction is exothermic
by 16 kilocalories cause
you're converting a Pi bond

619
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:11,450
into a sigma bond.

620
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,190
But up above it's not so great
because you're forming a cyclo butane,

621
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:20,540
which is strained and that is
uphill 11 kilocalories per mole.

622
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:21,890
The reaction won't work.

623
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,540
Yeah,

624
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,380
that's not so great. So we
can't do that reaction. Right?

625
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,220
We can't study it with
that system. Right. Wrong.

626
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,250
We can run it the other direction.

627
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,930
Start with the dive methyl Cyclo,
butane and s and C, which, which, uh,

628
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,690
Buda dying at forums because it's the
same transition state when you run one way

629
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:50,360
and the other. If you have a
certain transition state that's low,

630
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,310
you can access it not only coming in this
direction but also that same low wind

631
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:55,940
coming back.
Right?

632
00:40:55,941 --> 00:41:00,230
So we can do the same test starting with
the sick leave form and coming back.

633
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,040
Okay.

634
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,040
And that was done by Brown and Archie
in 1972 and it's interesting to see how

635
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:09,230
they made the compound. This
is what they needed, right?

636
00:41:09,231 --> 00:41:13,190
That cis dive methyl psycholo butane.
How did they make it?

637
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:18,410
They made it starting with
a cyclo audition where an
acetylene adds to a double

638
00:41:18,411 --> 00:41:21,800
bond to give us Cyclo beauty.
Right.

639
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:25,160
And it had these carbons attached to it,
which then they reduced off.

640
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,930
We'll talk about that reaction later.

641
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,100
And they made the Oah is a good leaving
group with Atossa late and then they

642
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:35,240
used h minus to do the displacement,
convert that into methyl. Okay.

643
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:37,790
But the Greek crucial reaction
was this cyclo edition.

644
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,710
How does that look to you to add a triple
bond to a double bond to make a four

645
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:47,240
membered ring? Good or bad?
Bad. It's foreign electrons.

646
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,710
Two Pi bonds coming together.
Right? But what do you notice?

647
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,720
How did they make it work? They
wanted to do that. What was special?

648
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,840
It's a four electron cyclo edition.
That should be bad,

649
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,260
but they used light to do it.

650
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,100
So they've put the electron into the
orbital of opposite symmetry and now it

651
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,530
will work. Okay, so this is,

652
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,420
so we already saw that that forms the less
site stabilize summer, but in their x,

653
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,420
so it's dis rotation with six electrons.

654
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,770
But this is the experiment they did right?
At 280 degrees.

655
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:27,530
It's not an easy reaction.
The reaction,

656
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,040
the ring opened up and they
got this isomer as expected.

657
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,280
So this rotated in to the right
and this rotated out to the right.

658
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,960
It's con rotation, right? Like that.

659
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,380
So it's a dis rotation with six
electrons con rotation with four.

660
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,500
And then what was special about them was
not only did they measure that that was

661
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:55,940
99.9% they measured how much
of the other one there was.

662
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,350
There was about point
double o 5% this was really,

663
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:03,320
really careful work they did.
It's an interesting paper to read.

664
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,720
So that says that and notice that
this is the less stable isomer, right?

665
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:12,140
Because it has a bond where
these are both trans, right?

666
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,410
So there's the bias that favors,

667
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,470
that's 99.92 point double o five
is 11 kilocalories per mole.

668
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,150
But the bias in favor of this kind of
rotation must be even higher because it's

669
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:30,530
being, it's being hurt by the
fact that this one is strained.

670
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:36,190
So it's something greater
than 11 kilocalories per
mole favoring the transition

671
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:39,380
state for con rotation in the,

672
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:43,040
in that which supports what
we predicted by theory.

673
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,120
And if you have an eight membered
ring with four double bonds in it,

674
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:52,490
that reaction happens at minus 10
degrees. And again, and it's, it's uh,

675
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,010
it rotates like that.
It's a con rotation.

676
00:43:55,310 --> 00:44:00,310
So it's con rotation for four n electrons
here or here and is zero and is one,

677
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,120
but it's dis rotation
for four n plus two here.

678
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,270
So it's what we expected for
these electro cyclic reactions.

679
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,230
And we can look at the, uh,
at the transition states for
the two and see that, uh,

680
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,130
that, that uh, uh, that's,

681
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,220
that's what would happen if you
could run it forwards. Okay.

682
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:24,740
And there's a transition state. This is
the same kind of thing we did before.

683
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:28,430
I'm not going to dwell
on this now. Okay. Now,

684
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:33,270
but a particular example of that kind
of thing is opening dewar Benzie do you

685
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,290
remember last semester we talked about
doer who sent to calculate these models

686
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:41,730
of all the different possible structures
for benzene? And one of them was this,

687
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,620
which came to be called dewar benzene,

688
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,690
even though he didn't advocate
that as a structure of benzene,

689
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,990
he thought it was this the
same way other people did.

690
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,500
But he said it's a conceivable
structure of benzene. Right?

691
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,190
But notice that this one would be
strained and that one would be stable.

692
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,490
So if you could go from this to this,
if you could get this,

693
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,490
it would be way downhill and energy,
right?

694
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,160
Because this is unusually
stable being aerobatic,

695
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,670
this is unusually stay disciplined,
unstable, because it has two,

696
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:12,630
four membered rings, right? So
it would really help to do that.

697
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,270
So it should be a really easy reaction.
It really wants to open up how does it,

698
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,800
well, in 2004, there was a paper
where they calculated the energy,

699
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,470
four isomers of benzene,
and they had all these isomers of benzene.

700
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:32,460
There's benzene, and there were
218 isomers. Right? And in fact,

701
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,640
84 of them are calculated to be within
a hundred kilo benzenes the lowest one.

702
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,200
But there are many within the
strength of a bond above it, right?

703
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,150
And in fact, six of
them have been prepared,

704
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,980
right? And, but they,

705
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:55,100
they don't go to benzene because
breaking a single bond, they have, uh,

706
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,380
uh, these are more than a
hundred kilocalories above.

707
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:02,010
So if you could go to benzine by breaking
a bond, it would be very favorable.

708
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,820
But you can't because if you look at
these structures, breaking of bond,

709
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,600
single bond won't take you to benzine.
You'd have to break more bonds than that,

710
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,490
okay. However, dewar benzene,

711
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,640
which is this one here,
right,

712
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,090
is 74 kilocalories of Bev benzene.

713
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,260
And you only have to break one bond
to make it change into benzene,

714
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,940
right? But it lasts for two
days at room temperature.

715
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,830
Why doesn't it go away down
hill? Okay. How was it prepared?

716
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:39,330
It was prepared by Van tab one and
Papa's in 1963 and they did it,

717
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:40,590
you notice by a site,

718
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:44,940
by an electro cyclic reaction where they
take a dying and make it into a cycle

719
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:49,710
of beauty, right? And it's,
it had Davey dis rotation,

720
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:55,170
so they used light to do it
again. Another example, okay.

721
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,210
But it has a half life of two days at
room temperature, whereas this one,

722
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:05,580
which is only 11 kilocalories exothermic,
right?

723
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,410
And this one and this,

724
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,520
remember that was the one that had to
be heated to 280 degrees in order to go,

725
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:16,770
right? So that one has a barrier of 33
kilocalories from all. But this one,

726
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:21,771
only 25 not what you would
expect on a simple analysis.

727
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:27,000
So it's 66 kilocalories more exothermic,
but only eight kilocalories per mole.

728
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:30,670
Faster. It is faster,
but not very much faster.

729
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,820
Okay, so this one notice opens
con rotatory we talked about that.

730
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:41,470
That's what Brownman showed. But, and
that's what you expect for for eh,

731
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,360
for an electronics where add a zero
for where, uh, we're in, is to,

732
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,200
to make to the two double
bonds. Okay. But in this case

733
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,280
and that the homos and Lumos work there,
but in this case,

734
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:00,430
if you want to open it up to make benzene,
this has to go that way.

735
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:02,710
And that has to go that
way to become planer.

736
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,000
If one of them went the other direction,
you'd have really weird bond angles.

737
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,060
Benzine would look like this.
Instead of being a hexagon,

738
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,440
it would look like this if
you rotated the wrong way.

739
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,210
So you have to rotate it in the wrong
way to do that. But wait a second,

740
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,110
how many electrons here? There's going
to be one of that p orbital one there.

741
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,300
One here, one here, one here. That's six,

742
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:30,610
six Pi electrons is supposed
to be dissertation. Right?

743
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:35,170
Shouldn't that work? No. It looks like
there's something more fundamental.

744
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,250
It's more fundamental that when
you're breaking the sickness,

745
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,280
this bond here and making sigma star,

746
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:47,380
it doesn't overlap with the homos
here and here. Right. To stabilize.

747
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,020
So even though it's the
right number of electrons,

748
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:54,250
the homos of Lumos aren't right.
Relining up. Right. So it's not,

749
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,700
it's not numerology we're
fundamentally interested in.

750
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,300
It's whether homos at lumos
matched to get stability.

751
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,840
Okay. And, uh,

752
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:09,760
the next topic is going to be spectroscopy
and we'll get to that next Wednesday

753
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:11,080
after the exam on Monday.
