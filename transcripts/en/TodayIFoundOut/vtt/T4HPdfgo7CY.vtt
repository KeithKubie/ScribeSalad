00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.540
The Colosseums Big Brother, The Circus Maximus

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.099
The Colosseum is one of the most iconic landmarks
in Rome and incredibly popular with tourists.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.120
Movies would have you think that chariot races,
gladiator shows, and battle simulations always

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.840
took place there, but that isn’t true.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.320
The Colosseum was finished relatively recently
in 80 AD.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.250
Before its completion, a more popular venue
for such things was the much more massive

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.850
Circus Maximus.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.930
The Circus Maximus was arguably the largest
structure in ancient Rome, with the capacity

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.510
to seat 250,000 people according to Pliny
(roughly a quarter of Rome’s population

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.680
at the time; some historians today think the
number might have been a tad smaller than

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.600
Pliny said, around 150,000 rather than 250,000.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.739
But either way, it was really, really big.)

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.130
It was built around the 6th century B.C.—well
before the Colosseum was even a thought.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.290
The fifth king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus,
created the track which would later be used

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.700
for chariot races, positioning it between
the Palatine and Aventine Hills.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.170
Historically, the area is known as the possible
location of the famous Rape of the Sabine

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.170
Women.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.030
If you’re unfamiliar, it’s a Roman legend
that Romulus, the founder of Rome, negotiated

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.200
with the Sabines who lived in the area to
let him and his followers (who were mostly

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.780
male) marry their women.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.140
When they refused, Romulus hosted chariot
races which distracted the men and allowed

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.520
the Romans to kidnap the Sabine women.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.020
The Roman historian Livy assures us that no
sexual assault took place; rather, Romulus

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.580
reasoned with the women and offered them citizenship
and the ability to give birth to free men

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.450
if they married the Roman men.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.120
Whether true or not, what better place to
set up the race track for subsequent chariot

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.120
races?

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.470
The main purpose of the Circus Maximus was
indeed to hold chariot races as well as provide

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.770
a venue for the Ludi Romani, or “Roman Games”.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.670
The games were often sponsored by rich, powerful
Romans, and were used to honour the gods.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.150
Ludi could be full-day or half-day events
and included all manner of entertainment.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.670
From chariot racing, gladiatorial displays,
plays, parades, religious ceremonies, and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.210
feasts, there was something for everyone at
the Circus Maximus.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.119
The space was also used to celebrate triumphs,
or successes on the battle field.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.979
For instance, Tarquin the Proud celebrated
his triumph there as a sort of homage to the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.000
god Jupiter for his victory over the Pometia.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.980
The Circus underwent numerous improvements
over the many centuries it was in use.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.819
The first Etruscan king created a raised wooden
platform to seat Rome’s rich and famous,

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.010
while his grandson added additional seating
for the commoners.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.319
Around 50 BC, Caesar ordered that the seating
be extended around the track, which resulted

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.980
in the largest seating capacity the Circus
Maximus had yet seen.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.349
However, it proved to be prone to damages.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.060
In 31 BC, a fire swept through the stadium,
destroying many of the seats that Caesar had

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.660
so recently built.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.290
It was rebuilt, but another fire during Emperor
Nero’s time saw further destruction.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.630
In addition, the area was notorious for flooding
as a stream had to be redirected to provide

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.010
enough room for the Circus’ construction.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.819
It was rebuilt out of stone around the end
of the first century AD, likely to avoid further

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.660
fire and water damage.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.440
Initially, the Ludi were held annually or
a couple of times each year.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.310
However, Rome was constantly expanding.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.110
Soon, Ludi became something of a status symbol
for those hosting them.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.190
The need to impress combined with the popularity
of the shows and games resulted in more and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.739
more games being held.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.750
By the second century BC, the number of games
had grown considerably—around 57 days were

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.840
dedicated to Ludi, or over one every week!

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.790
The Emperors of Rome were pressured to build
specialized venues to host a variety of different

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.920
events at once.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.140
So at this point while the Circus remained
a popular place to host chariot races, many

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.569
of the other games moved location.

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.000
This brings us to the Colosseum, originally
called the Flavian Amphitheatre, with construction

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.760
beginning around 72 AD, under the reign of
Emperor Vespasian.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.450
The Colosseum was well-designed; in the shape
of an ellipse, allowing for seating all around

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.519
as well as for sound from the ground level
to be relatively easily heard throughout the

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:53.519
amphitheater.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.781
It also had significantly smaller capacity
than the Circus Maximus, able to seat only

00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.409
around 55,000 viewers.

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.910
Nevertheless, the Colosseum replaced the Circus
as the prime space for gladiatorial shows

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.909
and staged animal hunts, called venatio.

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.069
There are even reports that simulated sea
battles took place there at one time, but

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.150
it’s unclear today how exactly that worked.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.419
Needless to say, the games remained extremely
popular throughout the years.

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.650
The Colosseum was actually kept in use until
the 1300s, when an earthquake left part of

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.909
it in shambles.

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.639
The stone that fell was used on other buildings,
and a religious order moved in.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.419
The Church continued to have a hold on the
Colosseum well into the 1800s.

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.750
The Circus Maximus didn’t fall out of use
until the 6th century AD, having been used

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.330
for over one thousand years at that point.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.469
The stones in the structure were also gradually
taken away to use on other buildings, while

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.830
the actual chariot track was buried under
water and soil.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.300
It was excavated starting in the 19th century.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.099
Today, the Circus is a park used for gatherings,
concerts, and celebrations—a modern twist

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.330
on an ancient venue.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.819
The Colosseum is, of course, a popular tourist
attraction, with millions of people visiting

00:04:58.819 --> 00:04:59.819
every year.

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.999
It’s also been used as a venue for Roman
Catholic religious ceremonies in recent years,

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.909
though large spectacles are no longer an option
due to the fragile state of the monument and

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.099
the minimal seating that survives.

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.219
Bonus Facts:
• Building such huge monuments takes a lot

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:14.219
of money.

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:17.439
The Colosseum was largely funded by money
taken from the Jewish Temple at the Siege

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:20.080
of Jerusalem.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.229
• The site of the Colosseum was actually
heavily populated originally.

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.129
However, when the famous 64 AD fire spread
through the city (started, some people believe,

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:33.439
at the Circus Maximus), Emperor Nero snatched
up the ruined land and built the Domus Aurea,

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.059
his grandiose palace, on top of the charred
land.

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.889
However, his palace was later torn down.

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.460
• The chariots that raced at the Circus
Maximus were color-coded, and could be pulled

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.839
by teams that consisted of between 4 and 12
horses.

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.349
The horses that won became famous throughout
Rome.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.280
The charioteers also saw a lot of fame—and
riches.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:06:03.740
The most famous charioteer of his time was
Scorpus, who reportedly won a whopping 2000

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.970
races.
