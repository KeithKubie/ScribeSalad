1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,310
The Joe Rogan experience. Do you watch
sports? I watch football. That's it. Yup.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,500
Do you worry about brain damage? Uh,
well yeah cause it's gonna ruin the NFL.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,500
Do you look at it differently?
We away?

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,890
Do you look at it differently than you
did like before that concussion movie? Uh,

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,500
well I played high school football.
I've,

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,860
I've got hit so hard that I've
seen stars and that kind of stuff.

7
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,130
But I think that can happen.
I don't look at it differently.

8
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:28,890
To answer your question. No, no.
I think that it, it, you know,

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,460
they might change the helmets and
they've tried that over the years.

10
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:35,280
Do you remember it?
Like it was just leather helmets.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,020
There was less concussions because you
would not lead with your head. Exactly.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,090
Now you have a weapon on your head and
people have used this such and so I would

13
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,730
love, you know how they do throwback
uniforms? Let's see. I mean,

14
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:50,910
let's go throw back equipment.
Let's put the helmet back on.

15
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:54,210
Tick that tick tat stupid face mask off.
You really should.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,840
But you'd have to change so much. You
have to change so much in the way people,

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,520
there's so many different factors. The
way that practice where they set up plays.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,160
Yeah, we would have to be a new game.
I don't think it's going to happen.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,640
I think the perception of the helmet
being safer, fuck the game up.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,910
I really think it did well,
but you know, all right.

21
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,500
I used to think that a
bare knuckle boxing I like,

22
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,130
they should have bare knuckles in the UFC.

23
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,610
But then I've been watching this bare
knuckle boxing stuff and people get caught

24
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:25,320
up so bad. Now I'm thinking,
you know what? It's better
to have padded and uncles.

25
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,190
It's better. Yeah, it's better
for the fighters that helps.

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,320
The leather helmets were padded.
They just weren't like a hard shell.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,580
And the Shell is what made it,
uh, you know, used it as a weapon.

28
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,910
So that's literally the only way you're
going to be able to stop some of this

29
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:41,190
brain damage.
And you're still not going to stop at all.

30
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:42,540
There's still colliding into each other.

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,090
They say these guys are
getting brain damage from
getting hit in the chest. Yeah,

32
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,390
they're getting hit in the chest and
the head snapped back and the brain

33
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:53,550
swashing around inside their skull.
Well, they're, they're changing. I think,

34
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,190
um,
maybe like a younger,

35
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,730
like little league now it's like you
can't do tackle football until a certain

36
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:03,660
age. So now that everyone's, you know,
it's all flag football til a certain age.

37
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:08,520
I think that that'll probably
happen. And Yeah. And then,

38
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:13,440
uh, the practices will be different
where we only do pads once a week.

39
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,970
Save it for the real game will be amazing
if the ever came up with something

40
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,440
that definitively fixed it, like some stem
cell treatment or something like that,

41
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:25,800
that regenerate brain tissue and bring
you back to your normal state. Right.

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,990
If they do that, then we don't have
to worry about it anymore. Right.

43
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,740
But until that man, oh, that's gotta
be around the corner, that's close.

44
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,010
I think that's a very complex question
of how to regenerate neural tissue,

45
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,090
brain tissue,

46
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,260
how to get rid of all those abscesses
and all those things you see in those

47
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:46,950
people's brains. And FCT, they developed
these like holes in their brain. Yeah.

48
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,660
It's serious shit. Yeah. It's,
um, while that sport though,

49
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,970
did you play football or no?
No, no. I wrestled in high
school. I was a little man.

50
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:57,870
It wasn't that I wrestled 134 pounds.

51
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,060
[inaudible] been a run of bad
fucked up fuck out of here.

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,220
There was another dude show. The fastest
guys are small and just, you know,

53
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,950
it was that facet runner. I was a
fast kicking and punching and stuff,

54
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:12,610
but I wasn't really that faster runner
been doing a lot of running. But um,

55
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,640
when I was, uh, in high
school when I was wrestling,

56
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,130
they were trying to tell
me to like the coach,

57
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,350
coach Murphy who is also
the wrestling coach,

58
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:24,370
he was also the football coach and he's
like, oh, come on, you're a sick fuck.

59
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,070
You should, you should play
football. Yeah. And I was like, dude,

60
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,700
that guy plays football. We are this
heavyweight. His name is Bobby Baker,

61
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,700
who's 300 pounds. He was enormous.
You're so big. I was like,

62
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,040
he's not squashing me
the fuck out of here.

63
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,090
The hardest I've ever been hit was
by a little dead and practice. Um,

64
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,900
probably like five, seven,
and he just, he was a,

65
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,880
a db and it was a practice.

66
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,160
I was like third string
running back and they're like,

67
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,900
I was just running up the gut and I
was falling into the end zone. Right.

68
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,890
It was over. And this case, he had
a run start like 20 yard head start.

69
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,740
And it was like he came up from
out of the ground and went, wow.

70
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,680
Didn't lock me back up. Whoa. And
that's the hardest I've ever been here.

71
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:07,500
It was by a little guy.
So you know,

72
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,980
think about you momentum
pito yeah, torpedo. Yeah.

73
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,320
With a hard helmet.
That's what he led with that helmet.

74
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,720
But you know how fast I go,

75
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:21,721
really good athlete can run and just think
of all that mass behind them and just

76
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,890
cock crash. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,700
That's the way those guys get hit and
the amount of force behind them getting

78
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,820
hit. It's probably unlike anything in
sports other than a car accident. Right.

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,170
Other than like the white car.
Yeah.
