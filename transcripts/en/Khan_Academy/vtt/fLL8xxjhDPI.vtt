00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:01.985
- [Voiceover] In this video,
we're going to be talking about

00:00:01.985 --> 00:00:05.305
how you can find the units
for your rate constant k.

00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:08.321
So the two things you should
know before we get started

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:12.945
are that, one, rate constant k has units.

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:18.419
So this isn't always true
of constants in chemistry,

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.159
but it is true of k.

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.435
The second thing to remember is that

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:28.639
your rate constant, the units of k depend

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:31.843
on your rate law.

00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:36.348
And so we're going to
use this second point

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:40.317
to use the rate law to
derive the units of k.

00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:42.129
And this is really
handy because that means

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.077
you don't have to memorize
what the units of k are

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:47.773
for different orders of reactions.

00:00:47.773 --> 00:00:51.625
So we're going to focus on the
three most common rate laws

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.925
that you see in chemistry class.

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:55.551
So we're going to talk about

00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:59.175
zeroth, first, and second

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:01.355
order reactions.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:05.559
And we will derive their units.

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.482
So first, let's look at zeroth order.

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:14.100
So zeroth order reactions

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.002
have a rate law that look like this.

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.554
So the rate is equal to k times

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:25.270
the concentration of your reactant A

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.193
to the zeroth power.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.838
And anything to the
zeroth power is just one.

00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:37.834
So our rate is equal
to the rate constant k.

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:40.622
The units of rate are
always going to be the same.

00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:43.406
So the units of rate are
always molar per second

00:01:43.406 --> 00:01:46.217
and you can also just think
of units almost like numbers.

00:01:46.217 --> 00:01:48.280
If you have an equal sign,
the units on both sides

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.696
of your equal sign have to be the same

00:01:50.696 --> 00:01:52.484
and they have to match.

00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:55.896
So here, since we have rate equal to k,

00:01:55.896 --> 00:01:59.588
that means k must also have
units of molars per second.

00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:03.328
So this tell us that the units
for a zeroth order reaction

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:05.508
are molar per second.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.552
We can use that same idea
to figure out the units of k

00:02:08.552 --> 00:02:11.060
for first and second order reactions, too.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.424
So for a first order reaction,

00:02:14.424 --> 00:02:16.790
so for first order,

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:20.368
a first order reaction rate law is

00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:23.572
rate is equal to our rate constant k

00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:26.408
times the concentration of our reactant

00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:27.940
raised to the first power.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.588
Units of rate are molar per second,

00:02:30.588 --> 00:02:32.584
and the units of concentration are always

00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:33.952
going to be molar.

00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:37.320
So now we know that the
units of k times molar

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.509
equals molar per second.

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.091
So we have molar on both sides,

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:43.391
so we don't have to worry about that,

00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:45.643
but we're missing a
one over a second term.

00:02:45.643 --> 00:02:49.861
So that tells us that the units
of k are one over seconds.

00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:54.109
The other way that we can try
to figure out the units here,

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.733
if you're not comfortable
with back-calculating

00:02:56.733 --> 00:02:58.545
what the units are, is we can actually

00:02:58.545 --> 00:03:00.541
rearrange this rate law,

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:03.005
So if we just put k on one side

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:04.953
and everything else on the other side,

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:07.905
we get that k is equal to rate

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:11.409
divided by the concentration of A.

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.733
So all I did was divide both sides here

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:15.913
by the concentration of A.

00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:18.445
And since we know that the units

00:03:18.445 --> 00:03:20.861
on both sides of the equal
sign have to be the same,

00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.345
then we can figure out the units of k

00:03:23.345 --> 00:03:25.177
by dividing the units of rate

00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:27.085
by the units of our concentration.

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:31.261
So that's just molar per
second, for the rate,

00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:33.841
divided by molar,

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:35.489
for the concentration.

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.161
And then the molar cancels out,

00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:40.413
and we're left with one over seconds.

00:03:40.413 --> 00:03:42.617
So that's an even more
straight-forward way

00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:44.661
to find the units of k.

00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:45.961
But the idea is the same.

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:48.121
You can treat units the
same way you treat numbers,

00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:49.513
and you just have to make sure they match

00:03:49.513 --> 00:03:51.045
on both sides of your equal sign.

00:03:51.045 --> 00:03:52.741
The last example we're going to go through

00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:56.057
is going to be for second order reactions.

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.998
So second order reactions,

00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:02.264
or second order rate laws

00:04:02.264 --> 00:04:04.004
have the form

00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:06.840
rate is equal to our rate constant k

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.624
times the concentration of our reactant

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:10.856
to the second power.

00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:13.872
So on one side, we have
molar per second for the rate

00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:15.848
and on the other side, now,

00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:18.820
since our concentration is squared,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.932
we have molar squared.

00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:23.396
So molar squared times something

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:25.258
is equal to molar per second.

00:04:27.304 --> 00:04:30.092
We need to add a one over seconds

00:04:30.092 --> 00:04:33.064
in our units for k because
we need to make sure

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:36.316
when we multiple these, we
get the seconds on the bottom,

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:39.148
and we need to cancel out one
of these concentration terms,

00:04:39.148 --> 00:04:42.748
so we need to put molar in
the denominator as well.

00:04:42.748 --> 00:04:46.344
So the units of k for
a second order reaction

00:04:46.344 --> 00:04:49.644
are one over molar,

00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:51.756
molar-seconds.

00:04:51.756 --> 00:04:54.960
so these are the three
most common molecularities

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.328
that you might see in a chemistry class.

00:04:57.328 --> 00:04:59.140
And sometimes, you have reactions

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.044
that aren't zeroth,
first, or second order,

00:05:02.044 --> 00:05:03.528
and whenever that happens,

00:05:03.528 --> 00:05:05.340
you can always use the rate law

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.036
to find the units of the rate constant k.
