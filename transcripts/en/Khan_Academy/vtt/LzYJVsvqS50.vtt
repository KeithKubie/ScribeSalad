00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.246
Voiceover:Create a list
of steps, in order,

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:05.433
that will solve the following equation.

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.439
It gives the equation here

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.850
then they have a bunch of steps

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.298
that they want us to put in order.

00:00:09.298 --> 00:00:11.642
Let's just work it out
on this scratch pad.

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:12.864
You might be able to work this out

00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:13.770
in your head eventually

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.661
but I'll do it on this scratch pad first.

00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:17.739
First, I'm just going to solve this

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.602
the way that I might try to solve it.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:24.624
Let's say we have 5x
minus 11 is equal to 42

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.487
and as we've seen before

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:28.060
whenever I like to solve something,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.474
I like to isolate the variable

00:00:29.474 --> 00:00:30.786
that I'm trying to solve for.

00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:33.228
I want to isolate this 5x on one side

00:00:33.228 --> 00:00:34.743
and then eventually I'm
going to try to get that

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:35.812
to being an x.

00:00:35.812 --> 00:00:38.023
The best way to isolate it

00:00:38.023 --> 00:00:40.004
is to get rid of this minus 11.

00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:41.639
The best way to get this minus,

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:43.933
get rid of that minus
11 on the left hand side

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.310
is to add 11 to the left hand side

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.050
but I can't just do it
only to the left hand side,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.262
then these two things
won't be equal anymore.

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:52.072
In order for them to both be equal,

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:54.916
I have to do the same thing to both sides.

00:00:54.916 --> 00:01:00.102
Then I would be left with
well, negative 11 plus 11

00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:01.181
is going to be zero.

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:06.329
I'm going to be left
with 5x is equal to 53.

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:09.928
What was the first step that I just did?

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:12.140
Well I added 11 to both sides,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.891
so this is going to be my first step.

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:19.222
Now what do I do to solve this.

00:01:19.222 --> 00:01:21.301
Once again I want this to be on the form

00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:22.464
of x equals something

00:01:22.464 --> 00:01:23.998
that I know what x is.

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:26.060
What's the best way to just have an x here

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.489
on the left hand side?

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:29.721
I could divide 5x by five

00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:30.874
that would give me x.

00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:32.714
Once again if I want these two things

00:01:32.714 --> 00:01:34.527
to be equal to each other,

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.804
I have to do the same thing to both sides.

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:38.992
I have to divide 53 by five as well

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:40.639
and then I'll be left with,

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:47.414
I'll be left with x is
equal to 53 over five

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:49.096
and I am done.

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:51.597
I have solved for the x that
satisfies this equation.

00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:53.209
What's the next thing that I did?

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.017
I divided both sides by five,

00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:56.619
so this right over here is step two.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.860
I added 11 to both sides

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.582
then divide both sides by five.

00:01:59.582 --> 00:02:00.734
Let's fill that in.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:04.374
I'm going to add 11 to both sides,

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.572
adding 11 to both sides

00:02:05.572 --> 00:02:08.027
then I'm just left with 5x is equal to 53

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.806
and then I divide both sides by five.

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:14.434
Got it right.
