00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:05.923
- So seriously, how fun was last night?

00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:08.924
- I never thought I'd say these words,

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:11.840
but yes, that one woman
show, was fun last night.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.226
(chuckles)

00:00:13.226 --> 00:00:14.416
= It was.

00:00:14.416 --> 00:00:16.476
- Good morning.

00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:17.519
- Yay.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.528
(clapping)

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:21.151
- Okay, okay, I'll give you that.

00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:22.433
- Thank you.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.260
Oh my God, your house is incredible.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.417
This place is amazing.

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:27.931
Thank you for letting me stay here.

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:30.795
- You were so incredible last night.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:31.628
- Shut up.

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:33.420
- So good, Mindy.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.253
- Thank you.

00:00:34.253 --> 00:00:35.661
I don't know, well I've
been working on it.

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.232
You know, but I was just thinking,

00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:38.985
I was thinking, I wonder what Veronica

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:40.316
would say about this place, you know?

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:43.410
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.827
- Who's Veronica?

00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:47.318
- She's one of the main characters

00:00:47.318 --> 00:00:48.553
in the one woman show.

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:49.386
- Remember?

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:50.494
I think she'd be like,

00:00:50.494 --> 00:00:54.865
um, thanks for lettin' me
hang me hat in your flat, sir.

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:55.849
Bing!

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:56.733
(laughs)

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.949
- Oh my God, I love that.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.532
I can't do it, this is
why you're on stage.

00:01:01.532 --> 00:01:04.501
- Uh oh, look at this man,

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:06.164
this manly man,

00:01:06.164 --> 00:01:07.978
what are those?

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:12.508
Those are muscles, those
are big, big muscles.

00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:14.173
How'd you get those muscles, lad?

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.097
How'd you get those muscles?

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:17.614
I think he plays with his dick.

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.573
(laughs)

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:21.661
I think it's from playing
with his dick a lot.

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:22.680
I think he goes in the loo

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.974
and he goes, aw, aw, aw, aw, aw.

00:01:25.974 --> 00:01:27.582
Aw, aw, aw.

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:29.632
Is that how you got those muscles?

00:01:29.632 --> 00:01:30.549
- Uh, yeah.

00:01:31.837 --> 00:01:34.031
- I think it's my favorite character

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:35.495
in the whole show.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.328
I love it so much.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:37.441
- [Mindy] She's my favorite character too,

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.617
she's just fun you know, she's just fun.

00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:41.502
- That's what she'd say,

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.669
if she were a real person.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.347
- Well, speaking of real people,

00:01:46.347 --> 00:01:48.620
oh my God Jason, you look amazing.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.450
Seriously though, how do you keep

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.555
your hands off this guy?

00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:56.111
- Well, you know, he
doesn't make any money so

00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:57.202
it's not hard.

00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.317
- Oh, that is the only
thing that is not hard.

00:02:00.317 --> 00:02:03.313
Hello, oh my God, you are amazing.

00:02:03.313 --> 00:02:04.498
- What are you doin' there?

00:02:04.498 --> 00:02:05.390
- What do you do?

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.751
- I mean, I work out a little bit.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.615
- Obviously, well obviously, hello, yeah.

00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:10.743
- I, you know, I take,

00:02:10.743 --> 00:02:13.493
I take Treadmill Blast with Lars.

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:16.148
- I don't know what that is.

00:02:16.148 --> 00:02:17.525
- It's a class at the gym.

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:19.422
- [Jason] Yeah, but you wouldn't know it,

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:20.813
you're in New York but yeah.

00:02:20.813 --> 00:02:23.578
- Well you know, while I'm here,

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:25.018
maybe one night we'll, you know,

00:02:25.018 --> 00:02:27.451
we'll have some chardonnay,

00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:29.864
maybe all get in the Jacuzzi together

00:02:29.864 --> 00:02:31.282
or something, while I'm here.

00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:32.115
- Oh Mindy.

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:32.963
- [Mindy] What?

00:02:32.963 --> 00:02:34.347
- I know where you are going with this.

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:36.256
- [Mindy] Well come with
me, uh, uh, come on.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.423
Let's do this.

00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:40.300
- You are so bad, stop it.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.133
- [Mindy] Come on.

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:42.467
- No, Jason and I,
that's not, we don't ...

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:46.217
Mmm we're not going to
sleep together, Mindy.

00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:49.184
- I'm not talking about sleeping.

00:02:49.184 --> 00:02:50.390
Bam!

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.593
Bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:02:52.593 --> 00:02:54.106
(laughs)

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:56.482
Come on, don't answer now.

00:02:56.482 --> 00:02:58.551
- [Wife] You are..

00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:00.580
- What, we're grown adults.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.433
We can touch each other's naked parts.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.306
- [Wife] What?

00:03:04.306 --> 00:03:05.139
- What?

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.516
We can get in a Jacuzzi,
we can undress each other

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:09.680
and we can, you know, sort of tickle

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.513
and just see what happens.

00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:12.004
We don't have to commit
to anything right now.

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:13.329
- Oh my God, you know.

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.162
- Come on.

00:03:14.162 --> 00:03:15.407
- I don't think, I mean Jason and I,

00:03:15.407 --> 00:03:18.517
it's not how we roll in our marriage.

00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:19.600
Right, Jason?

00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:21.524
Jason?

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:25.012
- What?

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:27.869
What'd you say?

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.530
(laughs)

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:31.499
- [Mindy] You don't have
to decide right now.

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:33.020
- No, no, that's, yeah.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.901
- But I mean, just think about it.

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.096
- No, we're not into that.

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:36.221
We don't, we don't like
that, we don't like that.

00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.735
- But you know, you don't
know who you are necessarily.

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:41.068
Oh my God, ahhh.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.320
- You know, you guys, if you guys want to,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.874
I mean, well I would
be interested in that.

00:03:47.874 --> 00:03:49.027
(laughter)

00:03:49.027 --> 00:03:49.927
- But we want to.

00:03:49.927 --> 00:03:51.987
- Who would vote for okay?

00:03:51.987 --> 00:03:53.374
- Yes, okay.

00:03:53.374 --> 00:03:55.234
- Well I guess I'm out-voted.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:57.054
So I guess we have to do it.

00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:59.637
So when do you want to do this?

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.818
- Oh no, what are you doing up?

00:04:03.818 --> 00:04:04.871
Oh my God.

00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:08.521
- Oh, there's the guy
that we're looking for.

00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:11.346
Let's get drunk tonight.

00:04:11.346 --> 00:04:13.596
(laughter)

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.175
- Let's do, let's do it, let's get in.

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:19.008
- Really?

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:19.964
- Splish splash.

00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:22.128
â™« I was takin a bath'

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:24.378
(laughter)

00:04:27.313 --> 00:04:29.924
- I'm gonna go get my suit,
do you want to borrow one?

00:04:29.924 --> 00:04:30.953
- Not really.

00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:32.847
(screams and giggles)

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:34.801
I'll put one on.

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:37.051
(clapping)

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:43.678
- She's always had smooth skin.

00:04:43.678 --> 00:04:44.715
- It's that dry brush I use,

00:04:44.715 --> 00:04:45.882
you know, that dry brush.

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:47.897
Um, is this weird, I
feel like this is weird.

00:04:47.897 --> 00:04:50.231
- No, this is not weird at all.

00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:52.848
- I'm getting un-drunk and I
feel like maybe it's weird.

00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:53.681
- This is the right thing to do,

00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:55.527
this feels good, for everybody.

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:59.875
- You know what, I'm gonna
get us some more drinks.

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:00.923
- I will have a drink.

00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:01.775
- Okay.

00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:02.741
- More drinks.

00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:04.126
- More drinks, more drinks.

00:05:04.126 --> 00:05:07.459
- Awkward situation, I'll be right back.

00:05:08.883 --> 00:05:10.875
- [Jason] There's nothing to
worry about, this is really...

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.513
- God, she's got a great ass.

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:15.138
- Yeah, she does, she really does.

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:16.322
Thank you for noticing that.

00:05:16.322 --> 00:05:17.926
Cause she really, she works out.

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:19.496
- Well we all have to, you do.

00:05:19.496 --> 00:05:21.057
- She tries, you know, she tries so hard.

00:05:21.057 --> 00:05:22.367
I said, you don't even
have to work out that hard,

00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:24.017
you look great, I don't care, you know.

00:05:24.017 --> 00:05:26.852
- Come sit a little
closer, I can't hear you.

00:05:26.852 --> 00:05:27.752
- Oh.

00:05:27.752 --> 00:05:29.512
- Loud, you know.

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:30.679
That's better.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:34.549
You do look great.

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:36.801
- You look really good too.

00:05:36.801 --> 00:05:40.583
- You know what Veronica
would say if she was here?

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:42.158
- Who?

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:45.563
- Can I dip my toe in your bubbly?

00:05:45.563 --> 00:05:47.751
(laughs)

00:05:47.751 --> 00:05:48.584
- Oh yeah.

00:05:49.897 --> 00:05:53.201
- Tip my toe in the
bubbly, that's the Jacuzzi.

00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:54.284
- You're doing.

00:05:54.284 --> 00:05:55.384
- You call it a Jacuzzi.

00:05:55.384 --> 00:05:57.364
- You're doing Veronica
again, from the show.

00:05:57.364 --> 00:06:00.624
- Hello gov'ner, hello gov'ner.

00:06:00.624 --> 00:06:01.605
A knock, knock.

00:06:01.605 --> 00:06:02.438
- Yeah.

00:06:02.438 --> 00:06:03.271
- Who's there?

00:06:03.271 --> 00:06:04.104
- Who's there?

00:06:04.104 --> 00:06:04.937
- Gov'ner.

00:06:04.937 --> 00:06:06.074
- Gov'ner's there, all right.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.307
- Gov'ner's there.

00:06:07.307 --> 00:06:08.140
- Who's there.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.997
- [Both] Gov'ner.

00:06:08.997 --> 00:06:10.156
(laughs)

00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:12.100
- You know what, Veronica is um,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.097
Veronica's great.

00:06:13.097 --> 00:06:15.171
- Thank ya, thank ya so much.

00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:16.152
- You know who I like even better?

00:06:16.152 --> 00:06:16.985
- Who?

00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:17.828
- I like Mindy.

00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:18.949
So maybe.

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:20.343
- Well Mindy's not here,

00:06:20.343 --> 00:06:24.070
you're talking to Veronica right now.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.987
Boop, boop.

00:06:26.638 --> 00:06:27.531
- Mindy's not in there?

00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:30.504
- No 'fraid notsie's, 'fraid notsie's.

00:06:30.504 --> 00:06:31.754
Notsie, notsie.

00:06:33.054 --> 00:06:34.589
- Okay, cause I would love,

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:38.449
I would, Bizzy too, we'd
love to have Mindy here.

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:40.481
- Well Mindy's not here.

00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:41.801
But you know who is here?

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:42.884

00:07:40.278 --> 00:07:43.195
