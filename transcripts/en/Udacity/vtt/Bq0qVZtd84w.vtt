00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.300
We will now dig deeper into what needs to be done in the systems software stack

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.130
to support virtualization of the hardware resources for use by the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.220
many operating systems living on top of

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.420
the hardware simultaneously. As you've seen in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.480
the earlier course module, on operating system

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.460
extensibility. The question boils down to how

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.649
to be flexible while being performance conscious and safe. You'll

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.840
see that a bulk of our discussion on virtualization centers around

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.150
memory systems. The reason is quite simple, namely, memory hierarchy

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.980
is crucial to performance. Even efficient handling of

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.000
device virtualization is heavily reliant on how

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.700
memory system is virtualized and made available

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.380
to the operating systems running on top of

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.940
the hypervisor. So let's start with techniques for

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.046
virtualizing the memory management in a performance-conscious manner.
