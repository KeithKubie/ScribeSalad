JESSICA BRILLHART:
Hey, how's it going?

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.620
Good.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.510
Welcome to day two.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.524
Check out my cool shirt.

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:10.900
Woo!

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.250
Feeling pretty good about this.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.031
I should introduce myself
before I talk about my clothes

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:15.530
I guess.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.040
I'm Jessica Brillhart,
the principal filmmaker

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.960
for Google VR.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.960
And so why am I here?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.824
I'm not an engineer.

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:31.490
I'm a filmmaker.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.770
I've been a filmmaker at
Google for 6 and 1/2 years now.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.790
And for the past six
years or so, the engineers

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.450
and the filmmakers, we kind
of work in different groups.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.030
But about a year ago, a group
of engineers gave me this.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.240
And this is one of the first
prototypes of the Jump rig.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.930
Jump, for those of
you who don't know,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.471
is an ecosystem
we've been working on

00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:59.140
for 360 degree stereoscopic
content creation.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.369
It consists of three parts.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:01.660
The first is what you see here.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.680
It's a rig of 16
GoPros in an array.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.670
The second is the assembler that
uses computer vision and cloud

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.990
computing algorithmically to
stitch the stuff together.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.690
This is one of the
earliest stitches

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.610
to come out of the
Jump ecosystem.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.440
It's the engineers filming
themselves in Seattle.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.440
And it remains one
of my favorite things

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.640
I've seen in VR.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.620
And stitching has always
been a really annoying time

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.310
suck for VR creators, right?

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.910
And being able to
film and not have

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.750
to worry about that process
is a really big deal.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.610
And the last is playback, making
it available to an audience.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.670
So I'm going to show you
a lot of footage today.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.990
And because of the
nature of the stuff,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.740
you're going to have
to see it on a screen

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.014
by sitting out there.

00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:46.430
But you have to trust me that
in VR this stuff is actually

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.211
pretty great.

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:48.210
It might still be great.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.390
I don't know.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.432
But thankfully, we've got
this really great new platform

00:01:53.432 --> 00:01:55.510
that I'm happy to
announce today.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.780
And we're calling it YouTube.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.090
And YouTube plays
VR, which is crazy.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.730
So not immediately
after this, because I've

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.980
been kind of running around,
but end of the day today,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.100
I'm going have a
playlist that's going

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.580
to have all of the
stitches that you see here

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.580
during the presentation.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.590
You can watch it on
your Android device.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.150
And then recently we have now
Cardboard support on YouTube

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.950
for the iPhone.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.575
So you guys will all
be able to see it.

00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:23.820
So I've used the rig
and the assembler

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.310
to film over 750 shots
over the course of a year.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.300
Or, as my engineers like
to say, 3,176,020 frames.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.800
And no one has film this much
live action VR in the time

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.149
that I have, as far as we know.

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.940
And if you know
differently, don't tell me.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.290
I like to live in my delusion.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.110
So why am I here?

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.670
Basically this sums up
the past year for me.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.420
I was handed a new
piece of technology,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.610
and then I used
it to make stuff.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.140
And here's where
we are right now.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.600
Because I was able
to film so much

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.350
and be able to see the
results so quickly,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.162
I've been able to establish
for myself mostly, but also

00:03:05.162 --> 00:03:06.620
for other folks
who are interested,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.810
a kind of language for making
virtual reality content,

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.870
so seeing what works
and what doesn't, what

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.850
ways as a filmmaker I
need to rewire myself

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.290
in order to make
this stuff work.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.680
And because it's important
for technology and art,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.570
I think, to be in
constant conversation,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.800
I think it's important
that I share with you guys

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.883
some of the stuff I've
learned over the past year.

00:03:24.883 --> 00:03:27.010
So I'm going to talk
about these four things.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.676
The first is what
every traditional film

00:03:28.676 --> 00:03:31.620
person faces, which is a
loss of a frame as a device.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.704
The second is what
that means for editing

00:03:33.704 --> 00:03:35.120
and how something
like editing can

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.910
be reworked to suit what we
want to accomplish in VR.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.080
The third is the realization
that even though it's a camera,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.900
the camera actually represents
a human the entire way through.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.330
And the fourth is the
question on everyone's mind,

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.850
storytelling, and how
to do story in VR.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.500
So let's talk about the frame.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.570
The frame is a precious
thing for a filmmaker.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.810
It's our medium.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.280
So we aspire to be masters at
crafting this kind of window

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.163
into another world.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.520
But a frame doesn't
mean jack when

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.010
someone can do this, right?

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.640
And the whole point of film
is that your audience never

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.079
does this.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.010
But in VR you do this,
because if you don't do this,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.337
you're doing it wrong, right?

00:04:23.337 --> 00:04:25.170
So in traditional cinema,
we use the concept

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.740
of the frame to make sure
people pay attention to what we

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.080
want them to pay attention to.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.150
We think if we lose the frame,
we lose complete control.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.160
And this makes
filmmakers-- a lot of them

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.040
are credible ones that have
been around for a while-- makes

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.390
them freak out, like this is
horrible, this is dangerous,

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.060
and so on.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.300
But let's just
breathe for a second.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.420
Have we lost complete control?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.420
Or maybe it just lives
somewhere else in this.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.020
Us humans have a
knack for following

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.010
what calls attention to
itself, no matter where

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.257
it is, no matter where it goes.

00:05:00.257 --> 00:05:02.090
And in VR, we've been
calling these elements

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.610
points of interest or POIs.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.110
And it's important to note,
this does not just mean visuals.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.800
We tend to hear things
before we see them.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.320
So spatial audio plays a
big role in this as well.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.680
So let's take this
glacier climber.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.580
That's one point of interest.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.775
He's the only human.

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:19.150
He's the only one
making a sound.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.660
And although we can't be
100% sure, because we never

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.570
can in VR, we can make
a pretty solid bet

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.400
that someone will focus on him.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.280
That's one POI.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.510
It can become very
complex rather quickly,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.510
because life is
very complex, too.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.805
So if you take this tram scene,
it doesn't present just one.

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:39.790
But it presents four
or more possible POIs.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.305
Or something like rocks,
which is utter chaos.

00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:46.680
But to be honest,
that just means

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.880
that potentially everything
is interesting to someone.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.970
I just can't take any bets
or place any bets on them.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.100
So our control as creators
is in this understanding

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.200
of the potential experiences a
world contains so that we can

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.570
prepare for this,
prepare for how someone

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.111
might engage with the space.

00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:05.110
And our craft is really
more about, as creators,

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.220
how do we respond to the
potential experiences

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.270
that someone has, if at all?

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.510
Which brings me to this.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.260
So when filmmakers
talk about editing,

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.710
we talk about putting frames
or shots in a linear construct,

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.285
right?

00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:21.660
There's nuance
and there's craft,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.720
but generally that's
where we're going.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.330
And that's what we talk about
when we talk about editing.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.630
It's shot to shot
and frame to frame.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.630
Now when we try this in VR, the
cuts felt jarring and weird,

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.930
and we pretty quickly
knew that it did not work.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.171
So what happened?

00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:39.670
Well, for one, when we think
about representation of editing

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.340
in VR, we think about
a predetermined frame

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.396
to frame visual.

00:06:43.396 --> 00:06:45.300
And that's probably
the wrong approach,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.050
especially when the potential
of the frame could be anywhere.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.810
And so VR needs a
different visual

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.941
for understanding
this potential.

00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:54.190
And in trying to figure out
what that visual could be,

00:06:54.190 --> 00:07:00.804
I started drawing lots of
circles, and lots more circles.

00:07:00.804 --> 00:07:02.470
And each of these
circles was an attempt

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.240
at mapping out the
world of a given shot,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.654
basically taking this
and thinking of this.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:20.160
So each shot is an experiential
world, the fundamentals

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:31.440
being the visitor, the visitor's
abilities, and the world.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.150
Now I've actually
been using this graph

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.240
as a way of kind of getting
through all my crazy thinking.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.890
And my colleagues now call them
my crazy blue damn circles.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.020
And I accept that.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.260
It's mine.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.840
I'll take it.

00:07:49.656 --> 00:07:52.280
But that also means that editing
in VR can't be frame to frame,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.510
right?

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.680
So instead of frame to frame, we
think of it as world to world.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.000
And now I can see the
potential for everything,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.019
where the frame is everywhere.

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:05.810
Which is to say our
jobs as creators is not

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.976
to preciously craft something
that someone may never

00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:09.650
look at and then
forget the rest of it,

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.024
but instead to guide visitors
through a crafted universe.

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.370
And at the forefront
of every new medium,

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.634
we get the benefit of
coming up with terms.

00:08:19.634 --> 00:08:22.050
And this is one of those terms,
probabilistic experiential

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.650
editing.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.756
It has a really
unfortunate acronym.

00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:28.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.200
I mean, I can't do
anything about that.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.830
So let me explain
what I mean by this.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.372
Probabilistic experiential
editing, at its core,

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:40.580
is about understanding a
visitor's likely interaction

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.990
with the world around them.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.114
So first, let's get back
to this idea of attention.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.110
If I make a solid bet
on a particular POI,

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.570
like this glacier
climber, then I

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.140
can make something
or do something

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.500
much like matching-- I call
it matching on attention.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.189
We do match on action
in editing, too.

00:08:59.189 --> 00:08:59.980
Something's moving.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.790
We cut to something
else that's moving.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.660
With this, it's about
attention, cutting

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.840
from someone's attention
point to another thing

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.420
that I may want them to see.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.890
So taking something
like this where

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.815
I can gauge where someone
might be, determine where

00:09:11.815 --> 00:09:13.480
our visitor's attention
will most likely land,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.870
and then align the following
world so that attention

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.150
point matches with
something else

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.601
I'd want a visitor
to pay attention to.

00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:23.990
It could go from an attention
point to something else

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.312
that I want a visitor
to see, much like this.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.850
Or it could just
be a spatial thing.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.910
I just want you to feel
specially comfortable.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.057
So keep things spatially similar
to reinforce an engagement

00:09:39.057 --> 00:09:40.140
in a particular direction.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.119
And the visitor rarely starts
and ends at the same place.

00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:48.160
If you do your job right,
they're looking around.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.280
So as their attention
shifts, our attention

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.054
needs to shift with it.

00:09:54.054 --> 00:09:56.220
And then you start to get
this kind of weird editing

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.700
flow, kind of a
bit like how we've

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.030
thought about it in outpoints.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.850
Except now it's not where I
think you should start and end.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.602
It's me understanding where you
would like to start and end,

00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:07.189
and then responding to it.

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:09.730
And by doing this we start to
lay the foundation of a pathway

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.605
through the overall
experience, like creating

00:10:11.605 --> 00:10:13.160
a conversation or
a dance of sorts

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.680
with experiences of a visitor
and the potential experiences

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.890
of the worlds we create,
kind of like unlocking

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.315
an intricate cipher.

00:10:21.315 --> 00:10:23.581
And I've been calling it,
and consequently we've

00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.080
been calling it,
the hero's journey.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.680
And this is a potential journey
we can craft for a visitor.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.130
There is no guarantee a
visitor is going to do this.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.740
In fact, what's
been really fun is

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.590
when the visitor
starts doing that,

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.770
and then goes away,
and then comes back.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.777
And I can see that based
upon their orientation

00:10:37.777 --> 00:10:39.860
of how they're turning
during an experience, which

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.650
is pretty cool.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.030
And it gives the
universe coherence.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.940
It feels like it's all
part of the same thing.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.080
Even if someone's not
going down that path,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.380
there is this vibe that
people feel like it's actually

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.160
one long experience.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.001
And there's more to this,
but I can't go through it

00:10:58.001 --> 00:10:59.250
because it would take forever.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.425
So consider this a primer.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.090
So we as filmmakers consider
the camera to be this tool.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.640
And we move a tool
around a lot, and kind

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.880
of frantically sometimes.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.040
And we put in
precarious situations.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.390
But in VR, whatever
happens to that rig

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.380
happens to a human being.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.700
So you can't just move the rig.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.572
That's like OK,
I'm like, I mean--

00:11:20.572 --> 00:11:22.030
that goes into a
whole other thing.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.060
But if I'm standing
and I'm looking out

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.950
at a really beautiful
thing, and then

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.480
suddenly I get picked up
and then put somewhere else,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.450
I would hate that.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.790
Most people would hate that.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.472
So we have to actually
think about what

00:11:34.472 --> 00:11:36.930
a human being will feel like
if we do anything to that rig.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.680
Like OK, I'm going to
do this to this rig.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.174
How would I feel like if
I had that happen to me?

00:11:42.174 --> 00:11:44.590
So a visitor doesn't show up
when she puts on her headset.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.781
She shows up as soon as you
press the Record button.

00:11:46.781 --> 00:11:48.530
I think that's a really
huge thing that we

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.635
need to accept as part of this.

00:11:50.635 --> 00:11:53.010
So last year when we came back
from a pretty intense film

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:57.170
shoot, we drew up a
very high tech chart

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.060
to analyze the
impact of everything

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.170
we captured because we need some
way to call down these shots.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.080
I had to make it a little
bit more PG rated because

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.990
of the conference.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:10.870
But you can see "looks awesome,"
"looks not so awesome" there.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.660
"Sounds awesome," "sounds
not so awesome" there.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.900
What we called the "vortex
of confusion" where

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.240
no one knows what's going on.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.310
And then the "I feel
awesome" or the impact.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.736
And it turns out that horses
is the experience to beat.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.760
So what is "I feel awesome"?

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.800
If the power of the frame
is what we're after,

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.008
and a frame is determined
by where the visitor looks,

00:12:35.008 --> 00:12:36.651
then we need to
champion the visitor.

00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:39.150
We need to care about how this
experience makes people feel.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.100
So again, it gets complex.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.391
And there's many ways to do it.

00:12:41.391 --> 00:12:44.540
But for the sake of time,
here are three examples.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.050
The first is having an identity.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.382
A rig in a space is always
regarded as something.

00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:50.840
But when a person
puts on a headset

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.381
and they're in the
space, they expect

00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:54.480
to be regarded as someone.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.010
So how do we do that?

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.790
So the height of the rig,
which we cannot see here,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.320
but imagine if you were a
rig and you were my height,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.360
that would feel fine.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.040
You relate to me.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.630
Oh, this is fun.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.630
But if we were a young kid--
but if I wanted to actually

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.700
sit with you guys in
the audience right now,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.230
and I sat down, I would
be one of you versus me.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.700
So I think none of these work.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.520
OK, let's just think about
this space right now.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.157
If I was a rig and
I wanted someone

00:13:25.157 --> 00:13:27.740
to be the presenter, which would
be terrifying because you can

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.698
imagine being a presenter
is pretty terrifying,

00:13:29.698 --> 00:13:32.420
I would actually have a rig
here at a level of mine.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.430
And it's authoritative.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.721
I look down on you guys and
I'm like I'm the presenter.

00:13:35.721 --> 00:13:38.240
But if I wanted the person
that is in the experience

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.440
to feel like you, I would
actually have the rig

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.570
at your height, below.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.010
And that actually
makes me relate

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.630
to the audience instead of me.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.330
Now granted, what
people end up doing is

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.950
they'll put the rig here.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.570
And the presenter will be here.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.900
And the people will be here.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.240
And then who the heck are you?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.060
Who am I?

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.870
Like, I'm not the presenter
because there's a presenter.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.410
And I'm not you because
I'm taller than you.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.170
So what am I?

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.140
So that's a question you
really have to ask yourself.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.750
We think of cameras
as just capturing.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.970
But if we're
capturing an identity,

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.440
we really need to
think about what

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.470
that identity is, what
the positioning is,

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.080
what the height is.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.860
And eye contact.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.160
So this is actually a
scene from something

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.161
that released recently
for the Montreal Canadiens

00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:20.410
called "Go Habs Go," which
we're really excited about.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.390
It's a new Jump film.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:25.510
And there was a moment
that I saw on this.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.510
And I'm like OK, I know
that people are probably

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.510
going to be looking at
the torch ceremony folks,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.900
so I got to put this in.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.295
So I'm going to talk about
eye contact for a second.

00:14:33.295 --> 00:14:35.420
You can connect with someone
in a very profound way

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.441
through eye contact.

00:14:36.441 --> 00:14:38.190
You probably shouldn't
do it all the time,

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.410
because that makes you
feel kind of weird.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:40.860
Like if someone kept
kind of staring at you,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.400
would you feel cool with that?

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.740
Probably not.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.330
But if you nuance
it and do it right,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.000
it actually ends up being
a really intimate moment.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.970
It's basically a close-up.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.010
So let's see it play here.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.760
Oh, no.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.920
Can we go back a slide?

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.790
I really want people
to see that one.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.464
Thank you.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.620
Wait a second.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.467
Is it not playing?

00:15:11.897 --> 00:15:13.730
Guess you have to watch
the film on YouTube.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.360
Sorry, guys.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.392
So we love discovering things.

00:15:17.392 --> 00:15:18.850
It gives us validation
in the space

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.040
and some sense of purpose.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.980
So ownership of
these experiences,

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.880
where you say to yourself,
OK, I found this.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.990
And because I found
this, this has value.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.920
And I have value.

00:15:30.965 --> 00:15:33.090
So like the need to present
everything to a visitor

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.830
is a bit old school, and
honestly kind of boring,

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.670
and especially when
all someone has to do

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.950
is turn away from that
presentation of something

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.580
for it to be ineffective.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.080
So I tend to try to place things
more in the corner of someone's

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.580
eyes so that the moments are
discoverable by a visitor

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.244
so she can own those
experiences more.

00:15:51.244 --> 00:15:53.368
So here's an example of
how you can play with this.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.800
Notice if you don't catch
me falling on my butt,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.350
I know I'm going to
be fine with that.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.090
But if you do accidentally get
to that point and you see it,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.830
you get motivation
for understanding

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.810
where I cut at the end.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.562
When Nick grabs my
hand, we go to black.

00:16:12.562 --> 00:16:14.770
So if you see that and you
see Nick grabbing my hand,

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.910
that's the cut.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.610
If you miss it, it's fine.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.669
But if you catch it,
it's your moment.

00:16:20.669 --> 00:16:22.460
And I think that's a
really important thing

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.380
to do for someone
who's in the space.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.220
When I saw WEVR's
"TheBlue," which

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.970
is an experience
made for the Vive--

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.590
it's about being underwater.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.110
And it's a beautiful experience.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.609
And there's all
this life everywhere

00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:34.735
because you're under water.

00:16:34.735 --> 00:16:36.234
But what's great
about it is they've

00:16:36.234 --> 00:16:38.170
actually planted
experiences around you

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.010
that they hope that
you actually discover.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.430
It's not just chaos.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.710
There's some intricately
laid out chaos,

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.050
or intricately laid out
moments within that chaos

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.006
that they hope that you see.

00:16:49.006 --> 00:16:50.630
My next thing comes
from a conversation

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.260
with these two guys.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.610
It's Rand and Robyn Miller.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:57.155
And they're the co-creators
of the game called "Myst."

00:16:57.155 --> 00:16:59.280
Seeing Atrus in VR, for
those who've played "Myst,"

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.390
is pretty awesome, and weird.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.160
But one of the most-- it's
an amazing computer game.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.739
If you haven't played it, you
should definitely play it.

00:17:07.739 --> 00:17:09.280
And Robyn said
something interesting.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.329
He says what he does in a VR
experience is that he actively

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:16.369
identifies what a creator
wants him to look at.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:20.780
And then he looks in the
completely different direction.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.140
And I started to do this.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.660
And you'd be shocked by
how little people plan

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.690
for that space.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.040
So what do we do
with that space?

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.690
How do we craft that?

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.860
What's there?

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.060
So here's a scene
from a film we made

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.090
with Jump called "Resonance."

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:41.280
And we have a young girl,
Kennedy, playing the violin.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.140
And behind her are her parents.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.810
And you know, you'd
get a fine experience

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.392
by watching Kennedy
play the violin.

00:17:49.392 --> 00:17:50.600
Like you don't lose anything.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.100
That's the whole
point of the scene.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.386
But the fact that the
parents are there,

00:17:54.386 --> 00:17:56.010
and if you turn and
you see the parents

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.593
and you hear the
audio of her playing,

00:17:57.593 --> 00:17:59.944
there's something really
beautiful about that moment.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.540
So maybe the rebellion
isn't so much

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.980
looking at the
opposite direction,

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.640
it's looking the
easiest direction,

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.014
and then I spike
you in the face.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.300
Gentle spikes, they're
like happy spikes.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.800
So the nature of an experiential
world-- and the people in it

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.174
can have a profound
effect on us.

00:18:26.174 --> 00:18:27.840
When we go into a
room of people that we

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.250
know versus when we go
into a room of people

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.644
that we don't know,
it's different.

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:34.810
We meet someone for the
first time, it's how you do.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:35.600
You shake hands.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.160
You move on.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.270
But if you meet someone
for the second time,

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.420
you don't have to do that.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.128
That's different.

00:18:40.128 --> 00:18:42.311
Energy shifts and changes
as we build relationships.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:46.500
So meet my family.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.400
Even though the rig is a strange
and weird thing for them,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.535
it's part of me.

00:18:54.535 --> 00:18:56.410
And because they-- I
hope they love me-- they

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.679
love me and care about
me, they goof around

00:18:58.679 --> 00:18:59.720
with it as if it were me.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.420
It feels very natural.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.170
It's, again, hard to
read from a screen,

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.819
but in VR, it's welcome
to my house, which

00:19:06.819 --> 00:19:07.860
is for me kind of creepy.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:08.792
But let's be honest.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.470
And this is Google I/O in 2015.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.260
I mean, let's just
ponder this for a second.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:33.380
And I just turned on the
rig right before the keynote

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.490
where Clay announced Jump.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.780
So all these people
were coming in.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:42.040
And it's a very
different feeling.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.350
He doesn't have the
time to look at you.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.870
So I mean, that's very
different than a family.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.504
You have one group goofing off.

00:19:50.504 --> 00:19:51.920
And then you have
this other group

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.210
that's evaluating you and
seeing if you're even worth

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.330
their time and Instagram
moment, I guess.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.330
Now let's get back to the
clip that I showed you

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.430
at the beginning.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.050
And this is why I think I
fell in love with this medium

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.730
and why I fell in
love with this clip.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.220
It's because it's
a rig to them, too.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.270
But they created it.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.630
They're so happy that you work.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.950
They couldn't be more stoked.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.445
And there's this feeling of
joy that you just-- I mean,

00:20:17.445 --> 00:20:20.070
I've been making films here for
a long time, most of them about

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.610
engineers.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.620
And I tell you, the fact that
they set a camera up and just

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.490
did this is remarkable.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.581
And captured this is remarkable.

00:20:27.581 --> 00:20:28.080
All right.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.820
So let's talk about story.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.911
And I actually don't want to
talk about story yet because I

00:20:34.911 --> 00:20:35.910
want to talk about this.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.560
Lots of what's being made in
VR right now is mostly surface.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.200
It's mostly just about what
we see and what we hear.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.410
It's like the first
level of being somewhere.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.350
But being there
goes much deeper.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.676
There's significant
depth to what's possible.

00:20:52.676 --> 00:20:54.300
And we're starting
to see more and more

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.510
of this kind of exploration.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.990
So here are a few things
I'm thinking about.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.100
Generally it takes some
time to know someone.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.310
We talked about that
a little bit earlier,

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.440
to feel comfortable being
in a particular space.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.980
Yet in a lot of experiences,
we're thrown into it.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.650
And then we're expected to
relate to everybody there.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.036
But in life it's a process.

00:21:12.036 --> 00:21:12.910
You know that, right?

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.990
Like eventually we become
closer to someone else.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.797
Eventually we care.

00:21:16.797 --> 00:21:18.880
So what if we started
building these relationships

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.380
appropriately in VR too?

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:22.980
Start with someone
present but distant,

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.984
and gradually bring
them closer to us.

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.650
Now once we establish
that relationship,

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.540
is it eye contact
and direct address?

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.940
Is that the best way to connect?

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.980
Maybe not.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.821
We found that shared
experience is powerful stuff.

00:21:35.821 --> 00:21:37.695
This is as true for the
virtual reality space

00:21:37.695 --> 00:21:39.200
as it is for the real world.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.700
We go through
traumatic experiences.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.970
We go through great experiences.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.560
You can see it in
someone else's eyes

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.820
if they know that you've
gone through the same thing.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.850
We've all felt that.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.399
So I feel that VR can
provide some sort of outlet

00:21:51.399 --> 00:21:52.940
for that kind of
profound connection.

00:21:56.096 --> 00:21:57.970
And when I watched Oscar
Raby's "The Assent,"

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.000
I thought it was a
great example of this.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
As the visitor, you are Oscar's
father reliving a tragic event.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.110
But Oscar is there, too.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.560
And as a character, he's
patiently leading you

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.860
through this recreation.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.160
And I am not Oscar's father.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.785
He would laugh if he
heard me say that.

00:22:13.785 --> 00:22:15.993
But I feel connected with
him in a very profound way.

00:22:15.993 --> 00:22:17.790
I simply share this
experience with him,

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.051
and we're in this
thing together.

00:22:21.051 --> 00:22:23.050
So what's the dialogue
between the virtual space

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.304
and the real space?

00:22:24.304 --> 00:22:25.720
What's the potential
for something

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.190
that lives in that tension?

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.825
So right now, there's what
goes on in the headset, which

00:22:30.825 --> 00:22:31.450
you didn't see.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.190
And then there's also what
we do in the real world

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.254
for that experience to happen.

00:22:37.254 --> 00:22:39.420
And if movement in the real
world added to something

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:41.010
or meant something uniquely
narrative-- like how

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.430
do we potentially construct
experiences that ride

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.560
both worlds simultaneously?

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.360
Tyler Hurd did this really
great video, that maybe you

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.190
can't see, but we'll see now.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.910
All right.

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:58.794
Imagine someone was
dancing, or there's

00:22:58.794 --> 00:22:59.835
these dancing animations.

00:22:59.835 --> 00:23:00.910
And we'll show you that.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:01.336
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:01.336 --> 00:23:03.850
-So if you want to dance like
these guys, can you do that?

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.391
JESSICA BRILLHART:
This is Glen Keane

00:23:05.391 --> 00:23:08.420
with the Tilt Brush guys
dancing to the experience

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:10.350
that Tyler made.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.450
-This is a great workout.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.980
JESSICA BRILLHART:
And you can actually

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.146
see a little bit of the
experience there on the side

00:23:14.146 --> 00:23:16.080
screen there.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.670
But it's a simple thing.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.920
It's just like dancing, right?

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.570
I mean, I'm in the experience
and there's dancing.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.528
And now I'm compelled to
dance outside of that.

00:23:22.528 --> 00:23:24.032
Like what's the
performance there?

00:23:24.032 --> 00:23:25.740
What can we do with
the actual real world

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.540
that could be a result
of what we experience

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:28.415
in the virtual world?

00:23:28.415 --> 00:23:29.584
[END PLAYBACK]

00:23:29.584 --> 00:23:32.000
JESSICA BRILLHART: And how do
we experience things really?

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.510
In our lives, we know
ourselves and we are us.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.864
I mean, that's just how it is.

00:23:39.864 --> 00:23:42.030
But in VR we can experience
different ways of being.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.655
And we can experience the world
beyond ourselves and beyond how

00:23:44.655 --> 00:23:48.020
we have evolved to perceive it.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.610
"6x9" is a great
example of this.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.470
It's how does an inmate
in solitary confinement

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:54.030
perceive the world.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.100
How does a situation like
this truly affect him?

00:24:01.407 --> 00:24:03.240
Or how does it feel to
see the world the way

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.690
a computer algorithm
might see it?

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.560
This is DeepDream VR.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.390
We worked with the artificial
intelligence team on this.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.240
Pretty trippy, right?

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.590
But artificial
intelligence can actually

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.400
provide some really
beautiful insights

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.570
into our perceived world.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.360
And "Notes on Blindness"
is a remarkable piece.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.220
It's a VR piece based on the
account of a man going blind,

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.460
dealing with going blind.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.800
So this new form
that we've known,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.702
this physicalness,
this almost rigid world

00:24:36.702 --> 00:24:38.910
transforms into something
a little bit more beautiful

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:39.409
and true.

00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:40.396
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:40.396 --> 00:24:42.870
-As one goes deeper
into blindness,

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:47.253
the things which once one
took for granted and then

00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:51.485
mourned the loss of and then
tried in a way desperately

00:24:51.485 --> 00:24:56.886
to compensate for, in the
end, ceased to matter.

00:24:56.886 --> 00:24:58.420
They lose existential meaning.

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.140
They are removed
to the periphery

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.400
on one's consciousness.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.920
They become irrelevant.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.357

JESSICA BRILLHART:
And I had grown

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.790
to know these forms so well
that when the forms started

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.940
to actually break apart
and the cathedral started

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:31.360
to drift away, I sort of started
to understand that maybe I'm

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.811
not seeing things the way
that I should be seeing.

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:52.690
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.780
JESSICA BRILLHART: But
wait, there's more.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.450
I'm going to go through these
super fast, but onboarding.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.151
People don't really
understand VR 100% yet,

00:26:01.151 --> 00:26:02.650
so it's nice to
have a couple levels

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.066
in the beginning
of the experience

00:26:04.066 --> 00:26:06.907
so that you know that
they know that it's VR.

00:26:06.907 --> 00:26:09.240
Extend and respond, like how
they engage with the space?

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.656
How do you extend
that engagement?

00:26:10.656 --> 00:26:12.770
How do you respond to it?

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.570
Let's do entanglement,
social space.

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.110
Like, what if
there is some space

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:19.300
that you are in that is affected
by someone who came before you?

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.230
The weather changes.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.030
The colors change.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.860
The character shifts
and change and evolve.

00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:27.800
Maybe something like this--
[INAUDIBLE] Newsome actually

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.747
talks about this.

00:26:29.747 --> 00:26:31.830
She's been thinking about
this stuff too, the idea

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.940
that 360 space is
a lot of space.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.440
Can you then start
targeting things?

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.640
Can you then start
constructing spaces or worlds

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.960
where it's really just about
the 180 or the 270 or the 90,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.500
and different amounts of story
are revealed at that space?

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.490
Passive-active, world
function, reinforcement.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:47.750
Oh well, too late.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.590
Multiverse-- I'm going to
sound like a crazy person

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:56.560
if I don't already,
but the fact that time

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.617
is a linear construct too.

00:26:58.617 --> 00:27:00.950
What if all the different
worlds we could travel through

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.320
or tunnel through are
all the same worlds,

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.790
but different things
have happened in them?

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.240
The story has
emerged differently.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.520
There's a different character.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.320
There are supporting characters.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.660
She didn't end up with him.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.790
He became a monkey.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.415
I don't know, but basically you
have all these different worlds

00:27:15.415 --> 00:27:19.180
that exist, and you craft
something based on that.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.480
Flocking.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.140
OK, so story.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.190
Now we've got all that
stuff all the way-ish.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.315
I mean, there's a lot more.

00:27:27.315 --> 00:27:28.310
There's a ton more.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.840
But let's touch on the story.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.350
Let's think for a
moment of story and film

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.230
as a dense atom of stuff.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.340
And when you look at
this atom, you get it.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.270
You see everything.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.930
Now imagine that atom exploding.

00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:48.070
That color and that light and
the emotion in the characters,

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:49.570
it's all over the place.

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.100
And that's VR.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.530
And story has always been
a way of transporting you

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.760
to another place
or time or world.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.960
But the fundamental
nature of VR is presence.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.570
There's no once
upon a time anymore.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.130
There's no in a world.

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.780
You're there.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.530
And the story emerges
from when you do

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:06.910
or what you do
when you're there.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.230
And it's a result
of your existence.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.400
You as a visitor are
now the storyteller.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.340
And our job as creators is this.

00:28:22.946 --> 00:28:24.320
Now in order to
do this, we still

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.380
need a language so that
we can, at the very least,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.420
make sense of it all.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.570
And in retrospect, cinema
has had a hundred years

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.810
to deal with this, to be able
to come up with this language

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.722
where from story
sort of emerged.

00:28:39.722 --> 00:28:41.180
And there's a lot
of unknowns here,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:43.890
but we are pretty excited
about the language we've

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.030
been able to discover so far.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:49.220
And we think it's a really
great place to start.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.760
So what's next?

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.980
I don't know.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.180
But I do know that
as I start to come up

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.660
with more insights,
as we discover more

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.580
things about what's going on in
this medium, I want all of you

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.940
know about it, as crazy as they
may seem to me and to my team.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.760
But I'll publish them on
Medium, my channel on YouTube.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.960
Feel free to check that out.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.720
That has a lot of the
films I talked about today.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.260
I'll have a playlist for all
the content that I showed you.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.051
And I think overall
what I want to just say

00:29:23.051 --> 00:29:27.170
is it's a crazy
time to be in VR.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.180
We've been talking
very pragmatically.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.386
But I think it's time that we
hunker down and start really

00:29:32.386 --> 00:29:33.885
thinking about
what's going on here.

00:29:33.885 --> 00:29:36.820
And I can't wait to see what you
guys discover in the next year.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.092
So thank you.

00:29:38.092 --> 00:29:40.900
