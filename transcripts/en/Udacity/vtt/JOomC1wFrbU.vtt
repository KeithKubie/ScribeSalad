00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.220
A home router is a teeny
tiny example of a router.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.370
An ISP or a datacenter might have a
router that looks like a big chunky box

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.740
with a lot of cables going into it.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.670
In general, a router is a device that
connects two different IP networks.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.170
It acts as a gateway.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.380
Hosts on one network that want to
send traffic to the other one,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.920
forward that traffic through the router.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.480
While most hosts might
have only one interface

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.740
with an interesting IPv4 address on it,
a router will have two or more.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.500
The host on a local network
knows about a default gateway,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.710
which is a router that's connected
toward the rest of the Internet.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.830
Computers that are attached to the same
switch or WiFi access point or

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.680
other network hardware
are normally local to each other.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.180
They can directly send packets
to one another without

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.320
going through a different network.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.390
And as we saw before they have IP
addresses on the same net block.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.186
But here is Alice over
here at 192.0.2.104.

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:10.192
And here's Chandra over
here at 198.51.100.17.

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:12.280
Those aren't on the same local network.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.220
So if this host wants to
send traffic over here,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.580
it has to pass through this router.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.470
That default gateway may also
have a default gateway itself.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.720
But eventually as you go toward
the rest of the Internet,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.580
you'll eventually reach
the defaultless part.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.590
Where routers on major transit ISPs
know about the global routing table,

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.570
the directory of all public IP networks.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.380
Routers up there don't
have default gateways.
