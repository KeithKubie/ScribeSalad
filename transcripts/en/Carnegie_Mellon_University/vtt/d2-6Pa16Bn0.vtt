00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.240
In the coming weeks and months ahead,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.440
you're gonna hear a lot more
announcements happening on this site.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.279
About new users, new activities, and

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.409
things that will bring vitality
to the site and its neighborhood.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.427
And we're here today to
welcome those new neighbors,

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:17.950
to generate new economies, and to look
ahead to the rebirth of this place.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.770
&gt;&gt; This site has been vacant for
20 plus years and for

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.150
the neighborhood when you constantly
heard, we're coming, this is happening,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.440
this is happening, and nothing was really
happening, and we turn the momentum.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.980
We have new storefronts, we have a new
library, we have a new school and then

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.830
you get announcements on the side knowing
that, hey, something's gonna happen and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.950
it's not just for four or five people,
it's for our entire community.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.536
&gt;&gt; There's so much that I have
learned in this community.

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:47.780
And Hazelwood Green means a lot
in our vision going forward.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.868
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of excitement
about what could be in Hazelwood.

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:53.670
So we wanna make sure that
the people who have lived here for

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.852
years, are able to stay here and
benefit from all development that comes.

00:00:57.852 --> 00:01:01.710
&gt;&gt; I wanna see every person being able
to access the absolute highest level

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.480
of education, so
that they can compete around the world.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.803
&gt;&gt; This community is an opportunity
to create very positive

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.360
development experience.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.580
Now finally, some of those plans have
an opportunity to come to fruition.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.150
&gt;&gt; When you're looking at a new site with
all types of jobs that are going to be

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.440
happening, we have to ensure
that Hazelwood residents have

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.210
not only a stake at the table,
but also have a job.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.613
&gt;&gt; The conversation that we've had
from the very beginning is that

00:01:29.613 --> 00:01:33.781
the Hazelwood Green site not be isolated
from Hazelwood, but be integrated.

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:37.540
&gt;&gt; I want Hazelwood to be
a world class community.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.204
&gt;&gt; We're not saying this is the site and
that's the neighborhood, no,

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:41.390
this is all blended together.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.060
And everybody in the neighborhood
is welcome down here and

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.738
every business down here is
welcome in the neighborhood.

00:01:46.738 --> 00:01:56.738
