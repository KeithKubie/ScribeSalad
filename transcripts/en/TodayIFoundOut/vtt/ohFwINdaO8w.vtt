00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:15.369
Seaweed didn’t exactly come into play during
those “make your own ice cream” science

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.429
experiments you probably did in elementary
school, but it is sometimes used in the making

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.460
of commercial ice cream.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.460
No, it isn’t just in seaweed-flavoured ice
cream, either.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.060
Seaweed is actually used as a type of thickening
agent for ice cream.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.140
Technically, the substance usually used to
thicken the ice cream is called “agar”

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.569
or “agar-agar.”

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.119
The name comes from the Japanese word for
“red algae.”

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.820
It was discovered in 1658 by Minora Tarazaemon,
a Japanese innkeeper who supposedly left extra

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.890
seaweed soup outside overnight.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.830
It was winter, and the substance froze.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.410
Tarazaemon noticed in the morning that it
had turned into a sort of gel when it thawed

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.410
again.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.080
Whether that’s exactly how Tarazaemon discovered
it or not, it was later found that after first

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.300
boiling seaweed, repeated thawing and freezing
makes a pure, gelatinous substance perfect

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970
to use as a thickening agent.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.260
It’s likely that the process was picked
up by the Dutch in the 17th century and later

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.790
spread to other East Indies ports.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.299
Today, agar is used in a variety of processed
foods as an emulsifier or binding agent.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.509
Not every country or company uses it; some
use carrageenans instead, which is made from

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.149
certain red seaweeds.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.979
The use of different substances is based purely
on preference and availability of resources.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.040
For instance, during World War II the availability
of agar was low, so many companies switched

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.270
to using carrageenans instead and stuck with
it even after agar became more widely available

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.270
again.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.049
(A similar thing happened with Twinkies, where
during WWII bananas were in short supply,

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.399
so Hostess switched to using a vanilla cream
filling, rather than banana cream.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.990
The vanilla cream filling turned out to be
much more popular, so they never switched

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.450
back to banana cream filling, though kept
the banana-like look to the Twinkie anyways.)

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.869
But you make homemade ice cream with just
milk, sugar, and a bag full of ice and salt—so

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.289
why is a binding agent needed in the production
of commercial ice cream?

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.990
The basic components of ice cream are fat
(usually from milk), sweeteners, air, ice

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.950
crystals, and “other solids” which includes
non-fat milk solids and various flavours (like

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.009
bits of cookie).

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.290
When the ice cream liquid is prepared, often
an emulsifier and stabilizer must be added

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.680
to keep all the ingredients together and improve
the texture.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.170
That’s where the seaweed comes into play.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.520
Most commercial stabilizers these days are
vegetable gums—that means agar, carrageenan,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.720
or something like Xanthan gum (derived from
bacteria found in cabbage).

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.220
These stabilizers keep ice crystal growth
small by immobilizing the liquid in the ice

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.810
cream—sort of by acting like a sponge.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.150
Larger ice crystals, caused by too much liquid
in the ice cream, will make the ice cream

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.770
feel grainy if a stabilizer is not used.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.620
The stabilizers also help keep the ice cream
from melting too quickly so that you can enjoy

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.341
your ice cream for a longer amount of time
on a hot day.

00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:56.460
That said, more stabilizers do not equal higher
quality ice cream.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.840
Quality ice cream typically contains more
fat and less air, while lower quality ice

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:38.790
cream substitutes a higher quantity of 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:05:15.510
stabilizers 
for fat, and often contains more air molecules.
