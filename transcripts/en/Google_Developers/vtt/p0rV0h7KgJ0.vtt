JESSICA HARTHCOCK:
Utilize Health

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.039
is a platform that
matches patients

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.190
with neurological
disabilities to the therapies

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.507
and the facilities that patients
need so patients can maximize

00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:14.715
their potential for recovery.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.430
Finding the first 100
patients was really easy,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.080
because they all came to
us completely unexpectedly.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.220
And so when we had them, we
thought, oh, maybe they'll

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.360
just be patient and wait.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.859
Uh-uh.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.310
They wanted help now.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.530
They did not want to wait.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.250
They wanted it
right this second.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.340
And so Adam and I very
quickly devised a plan

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.594
since we didn't have the
technology up and running.

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:41.760
And we said, OK, how do we
best help these patients?

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.110
And that was through
matching them manually.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.690
It took a lot more
work on our team.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.370
It was a lot more work for us.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.220
But, in the long run, it
was absolutely worth it,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.270
and we learned so
much in the process.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.710
ADAM HARTHCOCK: From
that, we actually changed

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.550
a little bit of how we
structured our revenue.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.180
So now we have a premium
option for the patients, which

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.910
allows them to access
more of the services

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.790
that we can provide for them.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.500
Kind of a concierge
service, if you will.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.830
So it was really enlightening
to have that personalized

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.670
contact with them,
to learn their needs,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.045
and actually, in
the long run, it

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:28.230
will benefit both the patients
and our business in general.
