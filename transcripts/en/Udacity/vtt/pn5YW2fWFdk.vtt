00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.868
&gt;&gt; So well anyway, we do have some objects here today and how about this one

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:08.004
which is really cool coz it has moving parts, can you tell us about that? &gt;&gt; So

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:12.294
this is just a, its the basic claw sample and this actually, it's kind of funny,

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:16.716
this one comes with a machine when you buy it but the really cool thing about it

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:20.776
is. That when you design something like this, it used to be that you would

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:24.864
design something like this, send it overseas. Get a mold made and eventually

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:29.500
around three months in, send it back to you. It would cost you about $40,000 and

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.511
that's on the low scale. But now, I can design this in the afternoon, print it

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:37.045
that night on my at home 3D printer or take it to a service like Shapewaves or

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:40.835
any of those places. &gt;&gt; And have it back within a week for about you know,

00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:44.658
anywhere between fifty to a hundred dollars. And I can see if things fit

00:00:44.658 --> 00:00:48.544
together, I can see you know if there's thing that need slight adjustment before

00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:51.850
I go into some sort of mass production, or maybe I don't even need mass

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.520
production, you know, it could just be for our home use. &gt;&gt; Is it just printed

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.099
as a single thing or did you snap it together or how's that work? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so

00:00:59.099 --> 00:01:02.592
this one's really cool, it's actually printed as a single object. So what it

00:01:02.592 --> 00:01:07.008
does is if you will, it just sits in a bed and the bed, think of like an ink jet

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:11.080
printer where a pad's coming over it. When that pads comes over the first time,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.536
it puts little droplet's down to put that first layer. And on the way back it

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:18.364
hits it with an ultraviolet light which hardens that object, and then builds it

00:01:18.364 --> 00:01:22.434
up with support material on the inside. The support material is water soluable.

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:25.818
&gt;&gt; So at the end of it when it all comes out I can then take it and wash it off

00:01:25.818 --> 00:01:29.836
with a water pick and take all that support material out. Leaving me with a very

00:01:29.836 --> 00:01:33.838
functional object. &gt;&gt; So support material is so that doesn't sag or what's,

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:37.627
what's support material about. &gt;&gt; Support material is, is just that. It's there

00:01:37.627 --> 00:01:42.383
for moral support. It's there for to support the piece. So if you think about

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:45.923
inside of here, if you had to build something in space that was just going

00:01:45.923 --> 00:01:49.817
across this plane, there's no way you could really do it because you can't build

00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:53.530
on nothing. You can't just put something out into mid air, yet. And, but so

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.202
that's what we do is we actually put support material. Material in there for

00:01:57.202 --> 00:02:00.742
this to build on top of and then we can rinse that out, so we can have things

00:02:00.742 --> 00:02:04.518
with a giant cliff or you know, a weird angle at it, that you wouldn't normally

00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:07.023
be able to just work your way up to layer by layer.
