00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm just
waiting for the shot to finish.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.150
OK, there we are.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.900
So, I'm here with Daniel in
the Community Lounge, where

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.854
people from all over the world
are gathering at Google I/O.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.270
Can you tell us a little bit
about the activities going on

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.650
here, and what
people are saying?

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.150
DANIEL FRANC: Yeah,
the lounge, it's

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.740
pretty new on the
I/O. Like, we used

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.630
to have community
areas on the I/O,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.250
but nothing huge like this.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.270
I don't know if the
camera can capture it.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.180
But this is basically
like the whole tent--

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.890
like the front porch of it.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.810
And as you can
see, it's crowded.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.500
And people come here to chill,
to play, they play pool.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.340
We have some wooden
block building games.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.490
We've got some networking games.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.740
People chatting.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.990
You don't hear me saying
we have any gadgets here.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.170
It's completely unplugged.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.621
And, like, people
here maybe come

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.120
to relax a little bit from all
the technology, which happens

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.860
in the tents everywhere else.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.482
And they just sit back and
relax and talk to other people.

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:57.940
So we are the place,
sort of, maybe

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.220
to unplug from the
technology for a little bit.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.760
We also have some local meetups.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.497
So I'm with GDGs--

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:05.080
I'm in the communities
team in Google.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.780
So we help communities around
the world to do meetups.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.130
So we thought, why don't
we do meetups here.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.520
So we have about
25 small meetups.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.400
And it's anything for like,
people who did applications

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.510
for social good.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.360
Or just now, I think
there is some meetup

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.419
of Russian-speaking developers.

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:21.460
So we have the whole day.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.720
They come here, they meet.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.062
It's very unprogrammed,
very anarchistic in a way.

00:01:27.062 --> 00:01:29.020
So we have also a bunch
of Googlers coming here

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.090
to relax from the I/O madness.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.910
I love it.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.050
I hope we do it next year.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.260
And when you come next
year, make sure you drop by.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.280
Well, let's check out
some of the stuff.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.779
DANIEL FRANC: Awesome.

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:38.279
Let's go.

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:41.771
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.900
So this I/O '17
Hello World hashtag.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.060
#io17, #helloworld, you can
actually check in there right

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.490
now if you are
bored with my face.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.920
And what happens is that we
are building a bridge here.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.510
But communities,
they don't function

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.800
with a boss or a
blueprint, et cetera.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.010
So this experiment
is about what happens

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.500
if you want to construct,
maybe the next Golden Gate,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.007
without blueprints or managers.

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:11.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Uh--

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.720
DANIEL FRANC: You see,
it's pretty chaotic.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.490
Yeah.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.190
Timothy, I know, like, we are
not Golden Gate Bridge quality

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.750
yet.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.130
Maybe we will not be ever.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.750
As I said, this
is an experiment.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.999
We are on day 1.

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.040
So we'll see how it goes.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.850
We also ask people to--
if they are developers,

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.100
to write Hello World in their
first programming language.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.530
So I had mine here-- like 10
print Hello World in BASIC.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.770
I was very tempted
to say 20 go to 10,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.470
you know, see the wooden blocks
here being covered everywhere

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.580
here.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.920
So you can see plenty
of languages here.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.460
So yeah.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.156
Let's see-- let's
see what happens.

00:02:46.156 --> 00:02:50.124
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:52.604 --> 00:02:54.190
DANIEL FRANC: All
right, so Timothy,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.560
I know I said the
lounge is unplugged.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.030
But this is-- I was cheating.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.160
This is an exception.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.290
As you can see, this is
very much plugged in.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.276
But what we are playing
here is something

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:04.775
that I want to tell
you informally--

00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:06.310
we are not publishing.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.800
This is a YouTube playlist
of some of the greatest GDG

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.320
trailers and videos
from around the world.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.300
Google Developer Groups,
they organize meetups,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.780
events, activities.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.110
And they sometimes put
crazy videos online.

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.500
So we made, like, a two
hour playlist out of it.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.280
You can find this whole screen
on your own screen if you enter

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.214
the address bit.ly/loungetv.

00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:33.380
I'm not saying don't say
it to anyone because I just

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.370
said it to you.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.220
But you can be here
with us at least

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.600
virtually through this playlist.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.380
So enjoy it.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.296
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool.

00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:41.586
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.909
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So what is this?

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:45.700
DANIEL FRANC: Yeah.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.200
You have seen the movie
"Inception", right?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.460
And in the keynote
in the morning

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.168
today, you are talking
about "Inception."

00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:51.670
So this is a device.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.609
I don't know what for, I don't
know what it will do to you.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.650
I mean, if people want to
see more videos of you,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.632
I don't know if you
want to sit in it, but--

00:03:58.632 --> 00:03:59.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's try it.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.650
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.865
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
is a core workout.

00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:14.416
This is kind of like
planking, but better.

00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:16.240
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:20.130
DANIEL FRANC: You can
get a hangover from this.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.816
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:26.440
DANIEL FRANC: So let
me introduce Nina.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.300
Nina is from Georgia
and she is running

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.040
one of the meetups
I was talking about.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.662
And this meetup is--

00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:32.620
what is it about, Nina?

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.340
Who is it for?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.800
NINA: This meetup is
for developers, mostly.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.070
And that cover the topics of
how we can develop apps or use

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.110
current apps for social good--

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.400
so basically, the social
aspects that our apps can have.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.650
Because technologists have
so many opportunities,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.260
and it can really, you know, go
beyond just consumer reasons,

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.840
right?

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.510
Like it can serve so
much more purposes.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.300
So I'm going to be sharing
my own experience how

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.040
my teammates Elva
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.050
are helping to help people in
conflict and crisis situations

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.880
to better monitor situations.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.076
Or how you are helping
farmers with information,

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.950
and probably get some
more ideas from others.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.580
So it is very informal,
very improvised,

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.050
because everyone is in
the line for ice cream.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.410
So I hope that
some will join us.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.840
And it's going to be
just a friendly session.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.240
And thanks to Dan
for this opportunity.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.250
I think it's fun and cool, so--

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.430
do develop apps for social good.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.930
Thank you.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.490
NINA: So you're welcome to join.
