no all I'm doing here though this one
third comes from this and this one half

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770
third comes from this and this one half
 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.600
third comes from this and this one half
comes from that okay so where is this

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610
comes from that okay so where is this
 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.270
comes from that okay so where is this
where does this one third come from that

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:20.280
where does this one third come from that
 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.710
where does this one third come from that
one-third comes from 16 plus one-sixth

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720
one-third comes from 16 plus one-sixth
 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.650
one-third comes from 16 plus one-sixth
which is that when are the situations

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
which is that when are the situations
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810
which is that when are the situations
where one of the situations when we're

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
where one of the situations when we're
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.830
where one of the situations when we're
both event a and B have happened well if

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
both event a and B have happened well if
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.050
both event a and B have happened well if
I get a 1 both event a and B have

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060
I get a 1 both event a and B have
 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.540
I get a 1 both event a and B have
happened and if I get a 3 both event a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
happened and if I get a 3 both event a
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.410

and B na out of a total of six yeah yeah

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
and B na out of a total of six yeah yeah
 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.689
and B na out of a total of six yeah yeah
16 10 16 year exactly yeah yeah sorry I

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699
16 10 16 year exactly yeah yeah sorry I
 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:55.340
16 10 16 year exactly yeah yeah sorry I
misunderstood your question okay now in

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
misunderstood your question okay now in
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.099
misunderstood your question okay now in
a casual sense we think of two events

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
a casual sense we think of two events
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.279
a casual sense we think of two events
are independent if knowing that one

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
are independent if knowing that one
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.340
are independent if knowing that one
event has occurred doesn't affect the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
event has occurred doesn't affect the
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260
event has occurred doesn't affect the
probability of the other event right

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
probability of the other event right
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.530
probability of the other event right
that means if rain did not depend on the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
that means if rain did not depend on the
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.060
that means if rain did not depend on the
month of the year then you telling me

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
month of the year then you telling me
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.910
month of the year then you telling me
that it's April would have no impact on

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920
that it's April would have no impact on
 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.640
that it's April would have no impact on
my assessment of the probability of rain

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650
my assessment of the probability of rain
 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.140
my assessment of the probability of rain
right if they were independent then I

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
right if they were independent then I
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.819
right if they were independent then I
wouldn't care whether it's May or June

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
wouldn't care whether it's May or June
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.999
wouldn't care whether it's May or June
or July so the conditional probability

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009
 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.780
would in that case simply be equal to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
would in that case simply be equal to
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.289
would in that case simply be equal to
the unconditional probability that is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
the unconditional probability that is
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.780
the unconditional probability that is
the probability of a given B is just the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
the probability of a given B is just the
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.730
the probability of a given B is just the
probability of a the probability of a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
probability of a the probability of a
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.240
probability of a the probability of a
given B is not affected doesn't affect

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
given B is not affected doesn't affect
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.709
given B is not affected doesn't affect
the probability of it so that's the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
the probability of it so that's the
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.700
the probability of it so that's the
definition of Independence okay and so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
definition of Independence okay and so
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.520
definition of Independence okay and so
of course if you apply this

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530
of course if you apply this
 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.290
of course if you apply this
two independent events you get that if

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300
two independent events you get that if
 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.210
two independent events you get that if
two events are independent then the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220
two events are independent then the
 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.970
two events are independent then the
probability of their intersection is

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
probability of their intersection is
 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.650
probability of their intersection is
simply the product of the probabilities

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660
 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.870
okay so you could just you could use

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880
okay so you could just you could use
 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.759
okay so you could just you could use
this definition and this definition to

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769
this definition and this definition to
 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.400
this definition and this definition to
derive that okay okay let's talk about

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410
derive that okay okay let's talk about
 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.880
derive that okay okay let's talk about
Bayes theorem we have 15 minutes so

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890
Bayes theorem we have 15 minutes so
 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.440
Bayes theorem we have 15 minutes so
we'll have just enough time to do Bayes

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
we'll have just enough time to do Bayes
 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.110
we'll have just enough time to do Bayes
theorem and do an example of Bayes

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120
theorem and do an example of Bayes
 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.949
theorem and do an example of Bayes
theorem and maybe talk about probability

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959
theorem and maybe talk about probability
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.500
theorem and maybe talk about probability
density functions Oh probability

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510
density functions Oh probability
 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.380
density functions Oh probability
distribution functions okay so say you

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390
distribution functions okay so say you
 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.110
distribution functions okay so say you
have two events a and B obviously these

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120
have two events a and B obviously these
 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.270
have two events a and B obviously these
two events give rise to two other events

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280
two events give rise to two other events
 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.650
two events give rise to two other events
not a and not B and as you've seen

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660
not a and not B and as you've seen
 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.129
not a and not B and as you've seen
already there's a way of denoting that

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139
already there's a way of denoting that
 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.520
already there's a way of denoting that
this is a compliment or B compliment

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530
this is a compliment or B compliment
 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.550
this is a compliment or B compliment
that means not a not peak and this is

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560
that means not a not peak and this is
 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.750
that means not a not peak and this is
specifically not a not be same thing

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760
specifically not a not be same thing
 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.120
specifically not a not be same thing
okay so a and a compliment or a and not

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130
okay so a and a compliment or a and not
 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.699
okay so a and a compliment or a and not
a comprise a partition of the sample

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709
a comprise a partition of the sample
 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.300
a comprise a partition of the sample
space now so Bayes theorem is concerned

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310
space now so Bayes theorem is concerned
 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.840
space now so Bayes theorem is concerned
with how the probability how is

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850
with how the probability how is
 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.460
with how the probability how is
concerned with expressing the

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470
concerned with expressing the
 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.069
concerned with expressing the
conditional probability that is the

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079
conditional probability that is the
 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:01.750
conditional probability that is the
probability of B given a in terms of the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760
probability of B given a in terms of the
 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.949
probability of B given a in terms of the
probabilities of the compliments

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959
 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.379
okay so let me go back here this is the

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389
okay so let me go back here this is the
 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.009
okay so let me go back here this is the
definition of conditional probability

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
definition of conditional probability
 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.229
definition of conditional probability
sometimes it's not easy for us to

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239
sometimes it's not easy for us to
 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.810
sometimes it's not easy for us to
compute the intersection probability or

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820
compute the intersection probability or
 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.969
compute the intersection probability or
the unconditional probability Bayes

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979
the unconditional probability Bayes
 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.839
the unconditional probability Bayes
theorem simply restates this in terms of

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849
theorem simply restates this in terms of
 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.990
theorem simply restates this in terms of
the compliment probabilities okay and so

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000
the compliment probabilities okay and so
 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.120
the compliment probabilities okay and so
I'll tell you let's go to Bayes theorem

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
I'll tell you let's go to Bayes theorem
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.850
I'll tell you let's go to Bayes theorem
and sometimes those probabilities might

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860
and sometimes those probabilities might
 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.219
and sometimes those probabilities might
be easier to compute so here is a

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229
be easier to compute so here is a
 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.600
be easier to compute so here is a
statement of the Bayes theorem

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610
 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.310
probability of B given a this

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320
probability of B given a this
 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.400
probability of B given a this
probability of B times probability of a

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410
probability of B times probability of a
 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.230
probability of B times probability of a
given B the reverse okay so it's very

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240
given B the reverse okay so it's very
 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.150
given B the reverse okay so it's very
easy to confuse these two but these are

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160
easy to confuse these two but these are
 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.749
easy to confuse these two but these are
two different probabilities over the

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759
two different probabilities over the
 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.020
two different probabilities over the
probability of a and you could work this

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030
probability of a and you could work this
 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.240
probability of a and you could work this
out it's actually not very simple to

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250
out it's actually not very simple to
 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.219
out it's actually not very simple to
work out just a bit of algebra and

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229
work out just a bit of algebra and
 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.689
work out just a bit of algebra and
applying the definitions a couple of

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699
applying the definitions a couple of
 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.820
applying the definitions a couple of
times or it could also be expressed as

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830
times or it could also be expressed as
 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.620
times or it could also be expressed as
probability of B times probability of a

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630
probability of B times probability of a
 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.510
probability of B times probability of a
given B so the numerators here are the

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520
given B so the numerators here are the
 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.230
given B so the numerators here are the
same but the denominators are different

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240
same but the denominators are different
 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.719
same but the denominators are different
here instead of writing probability of a

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729
here instead of writing probability of a
 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.300
here instead of writing probability of a
I've simply expanded this out to include

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310
I've simply expanded this out to include
 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.010
I've simply expanded this out to include
the compliments and that's going to be

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020
the compliments and that's going to be
 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.260
the compliments and that's going to be
probability of B times a probability of

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270
probability of B times a probability of
 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.270
probability of B times a probability of
a given B plus the probability of not be

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280
a given B plus the probability of not be
 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.159
a given B plus the probability of not be
given at times the probability of a

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169
given at times the probability of a
 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.560
given at times the probability of a
given not be okay so just keep this in

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570
given not be okay so just keep this in
 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.550
given not be okay so just keep this in
mind and i'll show you how to use it

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560
mind and i'll show you how to use it
 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.310
mind and i'll show you how to use it
okay this without without an example

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320
okay this without without an example
 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.159
okay this without without an example
this seems just like expressing one

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169
this seems just like expressing one
 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.930
this seems just like expressing one
identity in a different way which which

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940
identity in a different way which which
 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:14.070
identity in a different way which which
it is but it's a useful identity okay so

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080
it is but it's a useful identity okay so
 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.010
it is but it's a useful identity okay so
suppose that you have a test all people

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020
suppose that you have a test all people
 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.170
suppose that you have a test all people
in the population are tested for some

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180
in the population are tested for some
 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.860
in the population are tested for some
medical condition

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870
medical condition
 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.450
medical condition
suppose the measles antibody somebody

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460
suppose the measles antibody somebody
 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.040
suppose the measles antibody somebody
here just said they couldn't register

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050
here just said they couldn't register
 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.860
here just said they couldn't register
for my class because they didn't have

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870
for my class because they didn't have
 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.350
for my class because they didn't have
proof that they had the measles antibody

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360
proof that they had the measles antibody
 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.900
proof that they had the measles antibody
right so suppose you have the following

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910
right so suppose you have the following
 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.520
right so suppose you have the following
information about this medical condition

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530
information about this medical condition
 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.430
information about this medical condition
and the laboratory tests for this

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440
and the laboratory tests for this
 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.680
and the laboratory tests for this
condition right so I think for measles

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690
condition right so I think for measles
 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.360
condition right so I think for measles
you can actually take a test or you can

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370
you can actually take a test or you can
 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.730
you can actually take a test or you can
show that you had measles in the past

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740
show that you had measles in the past
 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.360
show that you had measles in the past
right so the chance of a random draw

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370
right so the chance of a random draw
 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.420
right so the chance of a random draw
from the population having that medical

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430
from the population having that medical
 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.330
from the population having that medical
condition is point zero one so that's

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340
condition is point zero one so that's
 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.530
condition is point zero one so that's
one in a thousand chance of a false

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540
one in a thousand chance of a false
 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.350
one in a thousand chance of a false
positive test result is one in a hundred

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360
positive test result is one in a hundred
 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.150
positive test result is one in a hundred
and the chance of a false negative test

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160
and the chance of a false negative test
 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.020
and the chance of a false negative test
result is I think this is one over 500

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030
result is I think this is one over 500
 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:22.470
result is I think this is one over 500
right okay so without the test if you

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480
right okay so without the test if you
 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.790
right okay so without the test if you
don't take the test its rationale for

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800
don't take the test its rationale for
 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.100
don't take the test its rationale for
you to think that the probability that

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.110
you to think that the probability that
 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.860
you to think that the probability that
you have that condition that is you've

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:31.870
you have that condition that is you've
 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.000
you have that condition that is you've
had measles is one in a thousand right

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.010
had measles is one in a thousand right
 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:41.160
had measles is one in a thousand right
point 0 0 1 but if you take the test and

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.170
point 0 0 1 but if you take the test and
 

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.370
point 0 0 1 but if you take the test and
it comes back positive what are the

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:44.380
it comes back positive what are the
 

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.340
it comes back positive what are the
chances you have the medical condition

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.350
chances you have the medical condition
 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.890
chances you have the medical condition
ok well let's define the appropriate

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:49.900
ok well let's define the appropriate
 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.550
ok well let's define the appropriate
events we've got two events you have the

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560
events we've got two events you have the
 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.890
events we've got two events you have the
condition or you don't and you test

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:58.900
condition or you don't and you test
 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.370
condition or you don't and you test
positive or you don't ok these are two

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380
positive or you don't ok these are two
 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:10.440
positive or you don't ok these are two
different events that probably have some

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.450
different events that probably have some
 

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.220
different events that probably have some
intersection ok they're probably not

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:14.230
intersection ok they're probably not
 

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.440
intersection ok they're probably not
mutually exclusive if they were then the

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:16.450
mutually exclusive if they were then the
 

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.160
mutually exclusive if they were then the
test would be completely useless right

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.170
test would be completely useless right
 

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.620
test would be completely useless right
so there but they have some intersection

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:22.630
so there but they have some intersection
 

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:28.470
so there but they have some intersection
how large that intersection is is is a

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:28.480
how large that intersection is is is a
 

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.770
how large that intersection is is is a
measure of the power of the test ok the

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:31.780
measure of the power of the test ok the
 

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.649
measure of the power of the test ok the
power of the test is a casually use

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:34.659
power of the test is a casually use
 

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.439
power of the test is a casually use
to a concept but it is has a specific

00:08:37.439 --> 00:08:37.449
to a concept but it is has a specific
 

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:42.569
to a concept but it is has a specific
statistical meaning and it is related to

00:08:42.569 --> 00:08:42.579
statistical meaning and it is related to
 

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:46.019
statistical meaning and it is related to
the probability of the intersection okay

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:46.029
the probability of the intersection okay
 

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:47.430
the probability of the intersection okay
so the second event is you have a

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440
so the second event is you have a
 

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.069
so the second event is you have a
positive test result or you have a

00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:50.079
positive test result or you have a
 

00:08:50.079 --> 00:08:53.670
positive test result or you have a
negative test result be or not be okay

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680
negative test result be or not be okay
 

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.059
negative test result be or not be okay
so so let's just write down all the

00:08:57.059 --> 00:08:57.069
so so let's just write down all the
 

00:08:57.069 --> 00:09:01.949
so so let's just write down all the
probabilities we know okay so a was you

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959
probabilities we know okay so a was you
 

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:04.619
probabilities we know okay so a was you
have the medical condition that's one in

00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:04.629
have the medical condition that's one in
 

00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:08.910
have the medical condition that's one in
a thousand we're told that the false

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920
a thousand we're told that the false
 

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.340
a thousand we're told that the false
positive okay well what's the false

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.350
positive okay well what's the false
 

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.460
positive okay well what's the false
positive that means you test positive so

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:14.470
positive that means you test positive so
 

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.869
positive that means you test positive so
you have event B but you actually don't

00:09:18.869 --> 00:09:18.879
you have event B but you actually don't
 

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:21.600
you have event B but you actually don't
have the condition so it's given not a

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.610
have the condition so it's given not a
 

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.889
have the condition so it's given not a
so probability of B given not a is one

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:25.899
so probability of B given not a is one
 

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:30.179
so probability of B given not a is one
in a hundred and a false negative is you

00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:30.189
in a hundred and a false negative is you
 

00:09:30.189 --> 00:09:34.019
in a hundred and a false negative is you
test negative on the test okay so not be

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:34.029
test negative on the test okay so not be
 

00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:37.910
test negative on the test okay so not be
but you actually have the condition and

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920
but you actually have the condition and
 

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.740
but you actually have the condition and
we're told that's one in 500 okay now so

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:43.750
we're told that's one in 500 okay now so
 

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.980
we're told that's one in 500 okay now so
these are given to us by the the word

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:46.990
these are given to us by the the word
 

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:50.610
these are given to us by the the word
statement of the problem we can easily

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:50.620
statement of the problem we can easily
 

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.490
statement of the problem we can easily
compute the negatives or the the

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.500
compute the negatives or the the
 

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.040
compute the negatives or the the
compliments okay so probability of a is

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.050
compliments okay so probability of a is
 

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.069
compliments okay so probability of a is
that probability of not a is 1 minus

00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079
that probability of not a is 1 minus
 

00:09:59.079 --> 00:10:03.480
that probability of not a is 1 minus
that okay here you have to be a little

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.490
that okay here you have to be a little
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.069
that okay here you have to be a little
bit more careful the complement of B not

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079
bit more careful the complement of B not
 

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:15.170
bit more careful the complement of B not
be given not a is not be given not a

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.180
be given not a is not be given not a
 

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:19.920
be given not a is not be given not a
okay you keep the given the same and you

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:19.930
okay you keep the given the same and you
 

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:25.769
okay you keep the given the same and you
negate the the conditional they negate

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:25.779
negate the the conditional they negate
 

00:10:25.779 --> 00:10:28.799
negate the the conditional they negate
the numerator okay and that's going to

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:28.809
the numerator okay and that's going to
 

00:10:28.809 --> 00:10:32.939
the numerator okay and that's going to
be 1 minus this and similarly here you

00:10:32.939 --> 00:10:32.949
be 1 minus this and similarly here you
 

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:36.299
be 1 minus this and similarly here you
keep the given the same you had

00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:36.309
keep the given the same you had
 

00:10:36.309 --> 00:10:38.639
keep the given the same you had
probability not be given a so now you

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:38.649
probability not be given a so now you
 

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:40.949
probability not be given a so now you
have probably be given a and that's 1

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959
have probably be given a and that's 1
 

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:44.220
have probably be given a and that's 1
minus this thing okay so you've written

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:44.230
minus this thing okay so you've written
 

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.249
minus this thing okay so you've written
down all these probabilities now you can

00:10:47.249 --> 00:10:47.259
down all these probabilities now you can
 

00:10:47.259 --> 00:10:48.300
down all these probabilities now you can
just apply

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.310
just apply
 

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:55.110
just apply
I that bass theorem okay and I've

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120
I that bass theorem okay and I've
 

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.450
I that bass theorem okay and I've
restated it here with a given B as

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:57.460
restated it here with a given B as
 

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.720
restated it here with a given B as
opposed to be given a ash the statement

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:00.730
opposed to be given a ash the statement
 

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.000
opposed to be given a ash the statement
and then you just fill in okay I'm just

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.010
and then you just fill in okay I'm just
 

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.430
and then you just fill in okay I'm just
filling in and it turns out that it

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440
filling in and it turns out that it
 

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.730
filling in and it turns out that it
gives you point Oh 908 well what is this

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:08.740
gives you point Oh 908 well what is this
 

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.900
gives you point Oh 908 well what is this
this is the probability given that you

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:12.910
this is the probability given that you
 

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:16.140
this is the probability given that you
tested positive the probability that you

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.150
tested positive the probability that you
 

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.590
tested positive the probability that you
actually have the condition will get

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600
actually have the condition will get
 

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.780
actually have the condition will get
this in this case it's only nine percent

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.790
this in this case it's only nine percent
 

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.690
this in this case it's only nine percent
so you tested positive but there's only

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:27.700
so you tested positive but there's only
 

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.210
so you tested positive but there's only
a nine percent chance that you actually

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:30.220
a nine percent chance that you actually
 

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:36.450
a nine percent chance that you actually
have that medical condition okay so I

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:36.460
have that medical condition okay so I
 

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.370
have that medical condition okay so I
mean and this is not these numbers are

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:38.380
mean and this is not these numbers are
 

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:45.240
mean and this is not these numbers are
not a typical of many tests okay so keep

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:45.250
not a typical of many tests okay so keep
 

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.740
not a typical of many tests okay so keep
in mind what the power of a test you

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:49.750
in mind what the power of a test you
 

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.930
in mind what the power of a test you
know as an example I mean I can tell you

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:51.940
know as an example I mean I can tell you
 

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:59.520
know as an example I mean I can tell you
that you know we recently had to go

00:11:59.520 --> 00:11:59.530
that you know we recently had to go
 

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.990
that you know we recently had to go
through this test of where you you know

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000
through this test of where you you know
 

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.120
through this test of where you you know
if you if you're pregnant and you're

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.130
if you if you're pregnant and you're
 

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.870
if you if you're pregnant and you're
over 35 then you have to take some tests

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:09.880
over 35 then you have to take some tests
 

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.590
over 35 then you have to take some tests
I forget what it is but some tests that

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600
I forget what it is but some tests that
 

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.420
I forget what it is but some tests that
costs two thousand dollars that

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:15.430
costs two thousand dollars that
 

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.590
costs two thousand dollars that
insurance pays for which you know tells

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600
insurance pays for which you know tells
 

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.650
insurance pays for which you know tells
you whether or not there is a high

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660
you whether or not there is a high
 

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.620
you whether or not there is a high
probability of having down syndrome and

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:28.630
probability of having down syndrome and
 

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.660
probability of having down syndrome and
so on right and I the rule is i think

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:33.670
so on right and I the rule is i think
 

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.650
so on right and I the rule is i think
the rule of thumb that medical insurance

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660
the rule of thumb that medical insurance
 

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.690
the rule of thumb that medical insurance
uses or the medical practitioners uses

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:39.700
uses or the medical practitioners uses
 

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.760
uses or the medical practitioners uses
that if you're over 35 you have to take

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:41.770
that if you're over 35 you have to take
 

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.460
that if you're over 35 you have to take
that test if you're under 35 it's

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:44.470
that test if you're under 35 it's
 

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.530
that test if you're under 35 it's
optional whether you take the test or

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:46.540
optional whether you take the test or
 

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.610
optional whether you take the test or
not and the way that they came out with

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:50.620
not and the way that they came out with
 

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.000
not and the way that they came out with
that cutoff year 35 as i understand it

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.010
that cutoff year 35 as i understand it
 

00:12:54.010 --> 00:13:01.500
that cutoff year 35 as i understand it
is that they plotted on an axis age okay

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:01.510
is that they plotted on an axis age okay
 

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:14.250
is that they plotted on an axis age okay
so they plotted age and and they plotted

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:14.260
so they plotted age and and they plotted
 

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.980
so they plotted age and and they plotted
on this the probability of having a

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:16.990
on this the probability of having a
 

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.650
on this the probability of having a
miscarriage if you take the test and

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:19.660
miscarriage if you take the test and
 

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.950
miscarriage if you take the test and
that increases as your age increases and

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:24.960
that increases as your age increases and
 

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.180
that increases as your age increases and
then they prodded also the probability

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:30.190
then they prodded also the probability
 

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:36.320
then they prodded also the probability
of having down syndrome the

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:36.330
of having down syndrome the
 

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.760
of having down syndrome the
unconditional probability nothing to do

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:38.770
unconditional probability nothing to do
 

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.970
unconditional probability nothing to do
with the test and that also increases

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:41.980
with the test and that also increases
 

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.490
with the test and that also increases
and where they intersect happens to be

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:44.500
and where they intersect happens to be
 

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.840
and where they intersect happens to be
35 there is absolutely no scientific

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:48.850
35 there is absolutely no scientific
 

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.870
35 there is absolutely no scientific
basis for you to take the intersection

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880
basis for you to take the intersection
 

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.300
basis for you to take the intersection
of those two but nevertheless that's

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:54.310
of those two but nevertheless that's
 

00:13:54.310 --> 00:14:03.390
of those two but nevertheless that's
what's used okay you know it also has

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.400
what's used okay you know it also has
 

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.400
what's used okay you know it also has
the nice feature that lots of people

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:05.410
the nice feature that lots of people
 

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:07.530
the nice feature that lots of people
take the test even though it might not

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:07.540
take the test even though it might not
 

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.560
take the test even though it might not
be terribly powerful it might tell you

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:10.570
be terribly powerful it might tell you
 

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.420
be terribly powerful it might tell you

conditional probabilities will be quite
 

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:42.750
conditional probabilities will be quite
significant okay but anyway so that's

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:42.760
significant okay but anyway so that's
 

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.000

you will often face these trades

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:51.070
you will often face these trades
 

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.450
you will often face these trades
trade-offs of probabilities and you want

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:54.460
trade-offs of probabilities and you want
 

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.300
trade-offs of probabilities and you want
to do that in a scientific way instead

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:57.310
to do that in a scientific way instead
 

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.410
to do that in a scientific way instead
of in a rule of thumb way that doesn't

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:01.420
of in a rule of thumb way that doesn't
 

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:11.010
of in a rule of thumb way that doesn't
make sense okay okay in five minutes way

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.020
make sense okay okay in five minutes way
 

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.890
make sense okay okay in five minutes way
and we're going to talk about

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:12.900
and we're going to talk about
 

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.090
and we're going to talk about
probability distributions

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:15.100
probability distributions
 

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.280
probability distributions
a probability distribution i'm sure

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:17.290
a probability distribution i'm sure
 

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:21.090
a probability distribution i'm sure
you've probably met these before is

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:21.100
you've probably met these before is
 

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.210
you've probably met these before is
defined as follows a random variable is

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:24.220
defined as follows a random variable is
 

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:30.210
defined as follows a random variable is
a rule okay now remember we first

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:30.220
a rule okay now remember we first
 

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.060
a rule okay now remember we first
started this math camp by saying that a

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.070
started this math camp by saying that a
 

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.280
started this math camp by saying that a
function is what it's a rule that

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:35.290
function is what it's a rule that
 

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.390
function is what it's a rule that
assigns a number to an input so a random

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:39.400
assigns a number to an input so a random
 

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.540
assigns a number to an input so a random
variable is a rule or a function that

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:42.550
variable is a rule or a function that
 

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.150
variable is a rule or a function that
assigns a number to each possible

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160
assigns a number to each possible
 

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.040
assigns a number to each possible
outcome in a chance experiment okay so

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.050
outcome in a chance experiment okay so
 

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.990
outcome in a chance experiment okay so
suppose that the chance experiment is

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000
suppose that the chance experiment is
 

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.250
suppose that the chance experiment is
the role of two dice and the each

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:56.260
the role of two dice and the each
 

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.310
the role of two dice and the each
outcome that I care about is the sum of

00:15:59.310 --> 00:15:59.320
outcome that I care about is the sum of
 

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.690
outcome that I care about is the sum of
the two dice so it could be from 2 to 12

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:02.700
the two dice so it could be from 2 to 12
 

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.860
the two dice so it could be from 2 to 12
and if and I have some rule or function

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:07.870
and if and I have some rule or function
 

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:12.380
and if and I have some rule or function
that assigns a number to each of those

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:12.390
that assigns a number to each of those
 

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:17.490
that assigns a number to each of those
so I can get to in only one possible way

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:17.500
so I can get to in only one possible way
 

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.300
so I can get to in only one possible way
which is I get a 1 and a 1 and that has

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:21.310
which is I get a 1 and a 1 and that has
 

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.380
which is I get a 1 and a 1 and that has
a probability 1 over 36 and so on okay

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:25.390
a probability 1 over 36 and so on okay
 

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:28.410
a probability 1 over 36 and so on okay
and the number 7 has the highest

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:28.420
and the number 7 has the highest
 

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.100
and the number 7 has the highest
probability 6 over 36 ok so this table

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:32.110
probability 6 over 36 ok so this table
 

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.710
probability 6 over 36 ok so this table
remember that a function could be

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720
remember that a function could be
 

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.340
remember that a function could be
specified by a table this table is just

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:38.350
specified by a table this table is just
 

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.770
specified by a table this table is just
the specification of that function or

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:40.780
the specification of that function or
 

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.670
the specification of that function or
the specification of the random variable

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680
the specification of the random variable
 

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.890
the specification of the random variable
the probability distribution function P

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:46.900
the probability distribution function P
 

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.740
the probability distribution function P
of X is the function that assigns the

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:49.750
of X is the function that assigns the
 

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.500
of X is the function that assigns the
number to each possible outcome it's the

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:52.510
number to each possible outcome it's the
 

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.220
number to each possible outcome it's the
same as the random variable such that

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:55.230
same as the random variable such that
 

00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:00.690
same as the random variable such that
the sum of all probabilities over the

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:00.700
the sum of all probabilities over the
 

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:08.730
the sum of all probabilities over the
outcomes is one okay and there's some

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:08.740
outcomes is one okay and there's some
 

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.030

the continuous probability distribution

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880
the continuous probability distribution
 

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:56.110
the continuous probability distribution
is given by the indefinite integral from

is given by the indefinite integral from
 

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.600
is given by the indefinite integral from
minus infinity to infinity of the

00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:58.610
minus infinity to infinity of the
 

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:03.900

the probability for an interval around X

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:11.230
the probability for an interval around X
 

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.960
the probability for an interval around X
ok the probability for any particular

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:13.970
ok the probability for any particular
 

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:18.190
ok the probability for any particular
number is always going to be 0 but the

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200
number is always going to be 0 but the
 

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.500
number is always going to be 0 but the
probability for some small interval

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:20.510
probability for some small interval
 

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:28.020
probability for some small interval
around X will be some positive number ok

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.030
around X will be some positive number ok
 

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.980
around X will be some positive number ok
ok so that is the probability

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:32.990
ok so that is the probability
 

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.550
ok so that is the probability
distribution function and you've

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:36.560
distribution function and you've
 

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.990
distribution function and you've
probably met these for example this is

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000
probably met these for example this is
 

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.210
probably met these for example this is
the Gaussian probability distribution

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:43.220
the Gaussian probability distribution
 

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:51.850
the Gaussian probability distribution
function okay or the normal probability

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:51.860
function okay or the normal probability
 

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:56.070
function okay or the normal probability
distribution function okay the

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080
distribution function okay the
 

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.710
distribution function okay the
cumulative distribution function or the

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720
cumulative distribution function or the
 

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:04.660
cumulative distribution function or the
density function is the area under this

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:04.670
density function is the area under this
 

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:13.600
density function is the area under this
curve from minus infinity to X to a

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:13.610
curve from minus infinity to X to a
 

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.650
curve from minus infinity to X to a
particular value X ok so it's the

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:17.660
particular value X ok so it's the
 

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:24.850
particular value X ok so it's the
integral ok and so for a continuous

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:24.860
integral ok and so for a continuous
 

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:31.390
integral ok and so for a continuous
random variable this is I guess is the

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400
random variable this is I guess is the
 

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.310
random variable this is I guess is the
indefinite integral sorry so that's the

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320
indefinite integral sorry so that's the
 

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.530
indefinite integral sorry so that's the
entire area and I could take the

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:35.540
entire area and I could take the
 

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.780
entire area and I could take the
definite integral which would be from

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:37.790
definite integral which would be from
 

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.400
definite integral which would be from
minus infinity to some number

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:41.410
minus infinity to some number
 

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:49.750
minus infinity to some number
okay and for discrete random variables

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760
okay and for discrete random variables
 

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.040
okay and for discrete random variables
it's just the summation of all the

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.050
it's just the summation of all the
 

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.380
it's just the summation of all the
values that X of all the probabilities

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.390
values that X of all the probabilities
 

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:02.940
values that X of all the probabilities
for every value that X could take okay

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:02.950
for every value that X could take okay
 

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:07.780
for every value that X could take okay
that that was a little fast but where

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:07.790
that that was a little fast but where
 

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.540
that that was a little fast but where
we're going to meet these again when we

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:10.550
we're going to meet these again when we
 

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:16.150
we're going to meet these again when we
do some statistics any questions perfect

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:16.160
do some statistics any questions perfect
