00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.889
Hi! I'm Andre Meadows, and this is Crash Course Games. In this series, we're going

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.280
to look at everything from the ancient
games depicted on cave walls, to board games,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.560
to the rise of the arcade machine, to
home consoles, to virtual reality,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.380
to role playing games and, hey nerds, even sports
-- all games are created equal.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.500
Games are used in schools and to treat medical conditions. They were used to train warriors for combat.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900
Some games have international tournaments, some even have very real political consequences.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.760
There are games that you can play alone
(tear)

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.080
And there are games that millions of people at a time can play together.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.740
Some of these create a world -- some even have their own economics! Gaming affects millions of

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.960
players all over the world and makes an 
impact on popular culture and... "culture" culture!

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.480
I've got as many interesting game facts and stories for you as a Pokedex has  Pokemon.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.740
How many Pokemon are there now? Like 850-something? After 151 I am done.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.520
So sit back, hit the pause button on whatever you're playing and prepare for a multi pixel journey through

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.980
the history of games. And remember:
it's dangerous to go alone... take this!

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:10.220
[Theme Music]

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.160
Before we drop into all this like a
misplaced tetrad, tetrazoid, tetrazone, tetris piece

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.580
We need to orient ourselves. We should
answer a basic question: What is a game?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.760
The dictionary will tell you 'a game
is a construct that organizes play

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.920
through a series of rules for the purpose of
achieving a set of goals overcoming an

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.040
obstacle and/or attaining an objective'.
That's a decent definition. I would call

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.440
games "entertainment" but they're a very
specific kind of "entertainment".

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.460
Game designer Chris Crawford came up
with a really cool hierarchy to explain this.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.720
To start, Crawford characterizes any kind
of interactive entertainment as a play thing;

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.400
anything that you interact with to entertain yourself qualifies.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.260
But there are also two types of playthings:
a play thing without a goal like a slinky is a toy,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.820
but when there's a goal involved like trying to get the slinky down the stairs, Crawford calls that a challenge.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.240
Now if you're working to complete this challenge with no other active agent or person involved, it turns out you're working on a puzzle.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.000
But when there is some kind of second party involved, then you have a conflict.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.320
Ok, we're almost there. Crawford subdivides
conflicts into competitions and games.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.980
In a competition the participants don't
interact or interfere with each other.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.000
A good example of a competition is figure skating.
Everybody's skating to win but they

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.640
can't really affect each other's
performances.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.540
Well, except for that one time with Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan but, you know, look it up.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.800
Mario Kart though, now that's a game. Players interact continuously, blocking and passing, and there's no

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.220
clearer example of interference than when you're
in first place and one of your friends in 8th place

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.880
and they use a blue shell and take you out and take the leap. Why do you always do that to me, Katie?

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.960
It's not cool! And here's an
interesting thing to think about:

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.520
You don't have to be playing against a
person for something to be a game.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.480
Those soldiers blocking your path in Metal
Gear are artificial intelligence or AI

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.790
agents trying to stop you from
accomplishing your goal.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.070
The rules of solitaire can be
constructed as an agent working to stop you

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.320
from completing the game. So games have
goals like scoring points or saving the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.000
princess and we achieve those goals by
following the rules,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.280
like moving our game piece six places if we roll a six on the die or ending

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.820
our turn if we've spent all of our mana. Of course
none of this matters unless you want to play.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.740
Voluntary participation is essential, otherwise it's work.
I'd also like to get at why we play games,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.260
but that's a little harder. The short answer is,
there is no short answer. There is no

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.610
universal unified theory of why we play
games. There's no constitution of gaming,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.580
no ten commandments of gaming. Different
games work on our brains in different ways.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:49.120
Games like Tetris appeal to our desire to create order. Something like Animal Crossing lets us be the center of a whole tiny universe.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.220
Games like World of Warcraft or Destiny
let us live a remarkable life in another world.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.800
Games like Candy Crush lets us crush candy.
We play games for a lot of different reasons.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.160
Let's leave behind the mystery of why we
play for a while and talk about what can

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.460
a game be and what can a game do. Take
video games.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.480
Modern video games can be a bit
formulaic but recent technological

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.410
advances have made games available to a
wider audience and they've made the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.200
tools to create games widely available
and that's well... a game-changer! Get it?

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.110
A game-changer! You see cause we're talking
games. A larger audience and a larger pool

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.360
of creators means a wider variety of
games that get produced. Sure, you'll get

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.700
Call of Duty and the annual licensed NFL
game that cost millions to make and sells millions

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.590
of copies but more gamers and lower
production and distribution costs means

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.810
quirky games like Braid or Super Meat Boy
or Shovel Knight. Games that might have

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.780
relatively small audiences can be
profitable and sometimes those quirky

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.370
independent games can get so profitable
and so popular that soon they hit a wide

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.440
audience just as much as a Triple A title.
And when I say wide audience I mean WIDE audience.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.200
In the United States alone there are
around 145 million video game players.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.040
37% of those players are over the age
of 36 and 18% are under 18.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.180
That kind of breaks the gamers stereotype, doesn't it? And increasingly games are part of players' daily lives.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.160
According to video game academic Jane McGonigal by 2010 the average video game player in the US

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.389
played for 22 hours a week. That's like watching
all the Harry Potter movies in order,

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.860
and then watching Chamber of Secrets again every week! That's a dedicated Harry Potter fan.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.820
Clearly we're spending a lot of time playing video games so what's this doing to us?

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.920
We now have entire schools devoted to gaming and almost every major university offers classes and degrees related to games.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.260
The University of Southern California, University of Utah, and Savannah College

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.480
of Art and Design all have renowned programs
in game art, programming, and design.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.020
The gaming industry makes so much money. Even
more sometimes than movies and television!

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.610
There are even people right now on
YouTube

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.810
who are making a living playing video
games, on camera - that's a job! And it's not just

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.090
about learning how to make games or make
money off of games. Massively multiplayer

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.760
game worlds can provide insights across disciplines. Sociologists can study how people form groups.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.140
Economists can finally see if their models work.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.720
And in 2005 World of Warcraft became a legitimate
subject of study for epidemiologists.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.150
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. In 2005 a plague hit
World of Warcraft. The game's developers

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.730
introduced a new mission that called on
players to defeat a boss named Hakkar the

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.790
Soulflayer, blood god of the Gurubashi trolls. Is Gurubashi right? Whatever.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:39.680
When players attacked Hakkar, he cast a spell called Corrupted Blood, which drained the players hit points.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.540
The spell was intended to be contagious but it was only supposed to spread in that part of the game.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.770
Well, it turns out Corrupted Blood was kind
of like a real world pathogen and it got out of

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.680
the intended area and spread to the
entire game world. According to an

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.970
article from Reuters the major towns and
cities were abandoned by the population

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.280
as panic set in and players rushed to
evacuate to the relative safety of the

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.490
countryside, leaving urban areas filled
to the brim with corpses and the city

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.460
streets literally white with the bones of the dead.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.960
This is where science got interested. The Journal of Epidemiology compared Corrupted Blood to

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.260
real-life SARS and avian influenza outbreaks.
Terrorism experts also studied the event.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.640
They looked at the decision by
some gamers to intentionally infect

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.760
other players and this provided some insight
into how terrorist cells form in the real world.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.400
In the end game developers
had to invoke the nuclear option and

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.300
reset the game service to undo the havoc
wrought by Hakkar the Soulflayer, blood

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.480
god of the Gurubashi trolls and, apparently,
bio terrorist. Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.900
Games also make their way into
daily life through gamification.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.920
This grows out of achievement systems some
video games use to reward players in

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.040
addition to the normal game objectives.
These systems have proven to be very motivational,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.280
so why not try them out in real life?
Purdue is doing this.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.700
Some schools reward students with badges
when they pass tests or complete

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.440
homework assignments. Gamification is
also used in fitness. For example some

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.110
fitness apps award badges for walking
around and even let users compete with

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.610
friends for the highest step count. Oh, that reminds
me, hold on. This counts as steps, right?

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.700
Academic studies also seem to validate time spent
gaming.  Studies from China and Australia

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.880
indicate that expert-level video game
players have a measurable increase in

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.920
cognitive functions, perception, and motor
control. These players were found to have

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.500
increased gray matter and increased
connectivity in their brains!

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.040
So next time your mom says you're playing too much video games, you go "hey mom I'm increasing my

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.360
gray matter." A hospital in Florida
studied their surgeons who played video

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.620
games before performing surgery and
found that surgeons who played video

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.500
games for more than three hours in a
week made 37 percent fewer errors. They were 27

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.170
percent faster during surgery over those
surgeons who did not. Gaming also has

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.230
cool applications in medicine. An Oxford
University study indicated that playing

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.730
Tetris can reduce the after effects of
psychological trauma and might offer relief

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.210
of PTSD symptoms. There's this virtual
reality game called Snow World.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.380
It's played on the Oculus Rift and it's used for
pain management. Burn victims report

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.190
less pain during bandage removal and
reapplication while playing this game.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.010
Another example is the online game
Fold It. In this game thousands of

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:13.720
players help doctors an computers fold proteins and other structures to support drug research.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:21.480
In 2011 players helped scientists solve a decade old problem in under 10 days! That's the power of games!

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.280
So what we're saying here is that
games can be a positive force in the world.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.860
And that's why we're going to spend the next twenty weeks or so playing with these ideas.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.840
So press Start or set up the board or tee up the ball or whatever. Let's play! Thanks for watching.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:39.370
We'll see you next week. Now if you
excuse me, I got some roads to crossy.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.560
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey
Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.560
and it is made with the help of all
these nice people. If you'd like to keep Crash
