00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:01.363
Neal: The story of a loving dad

00:00:01.363 --> 00:00:03.236
from Northern California who happens

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:04.734
to be pretty good at math,

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:06.115
but who knew that when he was asked

00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:07.276
to help his nieces get through a

00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:09.442
few equations, he would end up providing

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.859
the answer for tens of thousands

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.477
of students everywhere.

00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:15.713
Neal Karlinsky with
our Person of the Week.

00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:18.360
Sal Kahn is a 33 year old stay-at-home dad

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.559
who spends his mornings

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.157
with his 18 month old, and the rest

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:25.092
of his day crammed inside a walk-in closet

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.770
running a school like no other.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.571
Sal: The exponent here is a
variable. It's not a constant.

00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:31.580
If it was just a constant,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.201
we would be able to use the power rule,

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.328
but we can't do that.

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:35.706
Neal: Why are you in a closet?

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:37.872
Sal: This location in our house is

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:39.956
as far away as you can get

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:44.656
from my son while he's
screaming is the simple answer.

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:46.292
Neal: The free videos are anything

00:00:46.292 --> 00:00:49.090
but flashy just a doodling electronic pen

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.920
on a blackboard and
Khan's enthusiastic voice,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.648
but they've grown into one of the world's

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:57.604
most popular educational websites,

00:00:57.604 --> 00:01:02.297
tutorials that are seen on
average 70,000 times a day.

00:01:02.297 --> 00:01:03.550
Sal: To start, one plus one,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.662
move at their own pace,

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:07.001
pause and repeat videos as necessary.

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.635
They can do exercises,
keep doing those exercises

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:12.237
until they are 100% proficient.

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:14.750
Neal: The thing is Kahn
was a hedge fund manager

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.995
until a year ago and these lessons were

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:18.754
just for his nieces.

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:20.657
They went viral by accident growing

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:23.049
so popular that Khan quit his job

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.492
to run the Khan Academy,

00:01:25.492 --> 00:01:29.170
a collection of 1800 mostly
nine minute tutorials.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.910
To say they've caught
on, is an understatement.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.579
Bill: There's a website that I've

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.074
just been using with my kids recently

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:36.462
called Khan Academy.

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:37.829
Neal: Bill Gates and his son are two

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.134
of Khan's most loyal students addicted

00:01:40.134 --> 00:01:42.939
to his easy to understand presentations

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.250
that can be repeated until
the student really gets it.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.877
Do you think he's a good teacher?

00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:49.721
Male: He's a really good teacher.

00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:50.883
Neal: After talking with students

00:01:50.883 --> 00:01:52.482
around the world on Skype,

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:56.222
I decided to try it with
my seven year old, Max.

00:01:56.222 --> 00:01:57.467
Does this make sense?

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:58.466
Max: Uh huh. (affirmative)

00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.875
Neal: Did you know that?

00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:01.732
Max: No, I didn't.

00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:04.385
Neal: What is it about the
way he talks that you like?

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:07.492
Max: I don't know. It's
just kind of a mathy talk.

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:08.727
Neal: It's a mathy talk?

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:09.123
Max: Yeah.

00:02:09.123 --> 00:02:10.721
Neal: That's good, and you understand him.

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:12.220
Max: Uh huh. (affirmative)

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.963
Sal: I get a sense that it's working

00:02:12.963 --> 00:02:15.336
because it is so basic
that people really feel

00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:17.236
like it's a human talking to a human.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.377
Neal: Bill Gates favorite teacher

00:02:18.377 --> 00:02:22.876
is available to anyone who wants him free.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.577
So we choose Sal Kahn.
He's received millions

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.136
of dollars in donations to keep

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:30.136
those simple lessons coming.
