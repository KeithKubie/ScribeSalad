00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.090
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.750
I'm Tomiko Brown-Nagin the
dean of the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.390
for Advanced Study here
at Harvard University.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.230
I'm delighted to see all of
you who are gathered here today

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.870
for this important conference.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.930
Disability rights, advocates,
scholars, practitioners,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.370
students and community
members, welcome to Radcliffe.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.470
I want to begin by thanking
today's distinguished guests

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.970
for participating in this event.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.980
Thanks as well to
Rebecca Wasserman, who

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.390
is the executive director
of academic ventures

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.160
here at Radcliffe, to Jessica
Vicklund, director of events,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.860
and to their outstanding teams.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.960
I'm especially grateful to
our moderators, Cheri Blauwet

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.440
and Michael Stein for
co-directing the planning

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.140
committee that conceptualized
this conference,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.840
and I'll introduce them
and turn things over

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.040
to them in just a minute.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.690
First, I want to start off with
some words about this really

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.690
important topic that
we're considering today.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.800
We will explore how ideas
of belonging, community,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.850
and citizenship interact
both with our understanding

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.450
of disability and with
important policy questions

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.550
related to disability.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.810
We know from research and from
abundant anecdotal evidence,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.650
that people with disabilities
often face multiple barriers

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.530
to full societal inclusion, and
to freely and fully exercising

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.750
their citizenship rights.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.940
These barriers include stigma,
and exclusionary social norms,

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.280
inaccessible built environments,
prejudice, overt discrimination

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.170
and more.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.960
People with disabilities,
also, are frequently

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.710
precluded from accessing
equal education, health care,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.310
and other critical benefits.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.920
This is both a civil rights
and a human rights issue.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.460
Here in the United States,
we've made some progress

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.740
in the realm of
legal protection.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.820
It was 28 years ago that
Congress passed the Americans

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.650
with Disabilities Act of 1990
with strong, bipartisan support

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.480
in Congress--

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.140
both the Senate and the House.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.500
The ADA prohibited disability
based discrimination

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.620
in all areas of
public life, including

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.780
at school and at work.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.450
But we have not
fully conceptualized,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.120
much less realized, equality for
individuals with disabilities.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.690
Anti-discrimination laws
like the ADA are necessary

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.520
and they're very important.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.060
But they're not sufficient to
ensure dignity and equality.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.300
This is partly because
we often fall short

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.260
when it comes to
implementation of the law.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.320
But more fundamentally, it's
because '80s discrimination

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.430
laws do exactly what you
think they do, and not more.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.330
They prohibit discrimination
and they demand equal treatment

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.250
before the law.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.850
But as Michael has so
compellingly argued,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.960
equal treatment before the law
can coincide with seriously

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.720
unequal opportunity.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.500
This is especially true
in the case of disability.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.340
To achieve true equality
and full inclusion,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.920
we need a much broader
set of policy measures

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.780
and other levers of
global and local change.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.000
Our speakers today will
highlight the breadth

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.270
and the complexity of these
and other critical issues

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.990
at the intersection of
disability and citizenship.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.540
And they'll explore
how we, as a society,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.480
can make meaningful progress
at the international level,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.700
at the national level,
and yes, here at Harvard.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.780
To kick things off we're going
to introduce to you Cheri

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.660
Blauwet and Michael Stein.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.100
I am delighted to
have both of them here

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.990
and you can read more
about them in our program.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.770
Cheri is an assistant
professor of Physical Medicine

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.500
and Rehabilitation at
Harvard Medical School,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.279
and she's a physician at Brigham
and Women's in the Spalding

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.560
rehabilitation hospital.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.890
Cheri, also, is a three
time Paralympic athlete

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.580
in wheelchair racing with
seven medals to her name.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.660
And she's a two time winner
of both the Boston and the New

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.480
York City marathons.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.906
Yes.

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:43.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.350
Michael, my law
school colleague,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.110
is the co-founder and
executive director

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.200
of the Harvard Law School
project on disability,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.460
and a visiting professor
at Harvard Law School.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.100
He is one of the world's leading
experts on disability law

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.360
and policy, and he helped
to draft the United Nations

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.200
Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.660
He regularly consults
with governments

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.880
and nongovernmental
organizations

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.960
across the world on
disability laws and policies.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.350
Please join me in warmly
welcoming Cheri Blauwet

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.617
and Michael Stein.

00:05:19.617 --> 00:05:29.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.010
- Thank you everyone
and good morning.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.330
And thank you, dean, for
the very kind introduction,

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.610
and for this truly
profound opportunity

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.340
to be here with you
today for our discussion

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.880
around disability
and citizenship

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.250
global and local perspectives.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.270
It's really incredible to look
out upon this audience, and so

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.340
many colleagues and
friends, both old and new,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.500
as well as knowing that
so many are tuning in

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.910
over the Livestream--

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.190
from literally
across the country

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.140
and from many corners
of the world--

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.420
gathered to join us for this
really timely and really

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.430
important discussion.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.460
We'd like to take a moment to
reflect upon how we got here

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.160
and to particularly thank
our hosts, the Radcliffe

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.920
Institute for Advanced Studies,
who have supported this journey

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.530
and served a really critical
role in bringing this

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.500
together, catalyzing
this event, convening

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.520
and sponsoring the initiative.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.580
So approximately a
year and a half ago,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.440
I had the opportunity to
meet with Becky Wasserman--

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.980
who is the Executive Director
for the Radcliffe Institute

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.330
for Advanced Study--

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.340
to learn more about
various ways that we

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.320
could engage with their work.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.570
And in that conversation
she shared with me

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.550
that the theme for
the coming year

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.775
would be based
around citizenship.

00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:41.150
And of course,
when I heard this,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.690
my interest was
initially very piqued,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.100
and my wheels started
turning in my head.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.780
And after a few
seconds we said, well,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.260
do you think we could do
something around disability

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.030
and citizenship?

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.160
And as I recall, I
think Becky paused,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.890
and a smile sort of
spread across her face,

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.290
and the idea was really
born in that moment,

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.900
in immediately realizing
that there's a conversation

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.650
to be had.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.640
A very important and timely
one that brings us all together

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.385
here today.

00:07:09.385 --> 00:07:10.760
So our journey
will explore a lot

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.620
of themes around
citizenship and disability

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.170
with particular focus on
things like cross generational

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.260
perspectives, thinking
about intersectionality,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.480
higher education, thinking about
cross-cultural perspectives.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.980
What this experience
is like and how

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.170
we think about disability
and citizenship

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.355
not only here in the US,
but around the world.

00:07:30.355 --> 00:07:31.730
We'll really think
about how this

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.890
can be translated into
policy and systems

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.890
change so that these
conversations can be taken out

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.710
of the walls of this room, or
even outside of the live stream

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.210
and really thinking
about how we can

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.140
impact what's going on in our
world in such a dynamic time.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.880
And we'll get to
ask hard questions,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.190
like what can really
be done to elevate

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.620
our voice as a
disability community,

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.410
and be taken seriously in this
national and international

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.400
discourse around
diversity and inclusion?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.560
And in a world where currently
topics around race, gender,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.890
sexual orientation,
other minority

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.860
based issues are really
at top of mind, how can we

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.589
come together to have our voices
heard in those conversations?

00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:13.130
Most importantly,
when we think about

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.350
the current political
context, what's

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.700
happening around disability?

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.676
Are people becoming more
engaged or more disenfranchised?

00:08:19.676 --> 00:08:21.050
These are all
difficult questions

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.630
and meaningful conversations
that we'll have the opportunity

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.460
to explore today.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.470
And I think that all
of us in this room

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.660
know that for the
one billion people

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.820
around the world with a
disability the time to act

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.110
is really now.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.510
And we really need to bring
recognition to the fact

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.270
that disability impacts
every single one of us,

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.400
indeed it's a ubiquitous
life experience.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.130
These conversations don't just
impact a small group of people,

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.180
but really every citizen of
our country and of our world.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.570
I was only 10 years old when
the ADA was passed in 1990

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.520
as the dean just described.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.620
And at that time I was
living on our family farm

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.480
and I had no idea
that a law had just

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.290
passed that would impact
my life so dramatically.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.720
Little did I know
that opportunities,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.000
like being able to
compete as an athlete,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
to go to medical school
and practice as a physician

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.660
here at Harvard, would be some
of the outcomes of that law

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.730
and all the advocacy
that came around

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:20.144
in enacting it and bringing it
to its impact across cultures.

00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:21.560
So I really am a
member of what we

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.000
would call that ADA generation.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.740
And we've had the
privilege of being

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.450
a beneficiary of that
groundwork in many ways.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.090
And particularly, a
beneficiary of the work

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.070
that's been ongoing
for so many decades

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.680
by people that will be
speaking here today,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.650
like Judy and Andy and
Tom and so many others

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.510
of our distinguished guests.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.430
So we're so profoundly
thankful for that,

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.500
but we know there's a
future ahead that we

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.600
need to think about critically.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.080
So before we begin, a
few housekeeping notes.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.910
If your social media
inclined, please

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.680
don't hesitate to use
the hashtag, which

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.600
is I believe around, its
hashtag disability citizenship.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.850
And we'd love for the
social media conversation

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.290
to really take
off and for people

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.010
to notice what we're doing
here today, so don't be shy.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.140
There's restrooms
on every floor,

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.114
and there will be a break
officially at 11:15,

00:10:12.114 --> 00:10:14.030
but of course, please
feel free to come and go

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.380
if you need to prior to that.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.440
And there's also an
address and a link

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.100
that's printed on the
front page of your program,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.110
if you would like to
access a Carte services

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.250
and if that would be helpful.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.510
So with that, I'm going to hand
it over to Professor Stein.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.400
- Thank you Dr. Blauwet.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.150
And before introducing our
keynote and discussant,

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.320
I just want to echo Cheri in
thanking Radcliffe and the dean

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.450
and Becky and Jessica
and everyone else

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.790
for convening this event.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.010
It's probably the
fourth or fifth event

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.860
that I've participated
in with Radcliffe,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.180
and it's a demonstration of
how Radcliffe situates itself

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.120
within the university
as a convening force

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.780
to pull together all kinds of
disciplines and perspectives,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.360
to focus on particular
issues, and to be inclusive.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.680
And so kudos to that.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.690
And to my colleague I wish
you a wonderful deanship.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.740
I will play with you as
often as you can tolerate me.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.860
It is a wonderful day today,
because not only do we

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.980
have a terrific subject that's
important and well listened to

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.490
and that will be transmitted,
but selfishly, Cheri and I

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.910
get to see our friends.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.820
And we very much
appreciate that as well,

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.370
and we thank you for
coming out and making time

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.990
from your enormously
busy schedules.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.630
Some of our speakers,
as you will hear,

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.360
literally, are around the
world and in between trips

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.430
around the world and
they've made the time

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.460
to be with us today.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:42.660
So thank you very
much to our speakers.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.120
My privilege is I get
to say nice things

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.460
about Judy Heumann and
Tom Hehir without them

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.350
getting too object.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.410
So our discussant, and
I will follow the dean

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.719
and noting that we have
the BIOS in your forms,

00:11:58.719 --> 00:12:00.510
and I'm not going to
read them because that

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.779
would be a waste of time.

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.570
I'd rather tell you
some of the things that

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.490
are not in the BIOS.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.700
Our discussant, Tom Hehir,
a professor at the Graduate

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.766
School of Education,
as you know,

00:12:10.766 --> 00:12:12.390
worked under the
Clinton administration

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.050
and helped to formulate the
regulations for the individuals

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.590
Disabilities Education Act
after its re-authorization.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.090
Things that are now
being challenged

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.476
by current governmental
objectives.

00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:26.100
But what you don't
have in your booklet

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.767
is that although he
claims to be retiring,

00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:32.100
and somehow I'm going to find
in my heart to forgive you

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.730
at some point, Tom is
the glue on disability

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.560
around the university.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.780
Students with
disabilities, those of us

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.150
who teach in the area of
disability, those of us who

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:46.110
have disabilities and are on
the professional side of it,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.010
Tom is the leading person.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.220
He's the one we
all connect with.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.290
And we enjoy our interaction
and we learn from him.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:57.120
Tom has used his knowledge as
a Chicago deputy supervisor

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.570
of schools, as a Boston
School supervisor,

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.690
as a person who has
assessed inclusive education

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.140
around the world, but also doing
particular studies in Boston

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.950
and New York to illuminate the
role of inclusive education

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.610
and how it's not only
possible, but it makes sense.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.580
He has used his scholarly
agenda to describe

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.120
how students with disabilities
got to Harvard, how

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.430
do you achieve the mountain,
and what things went

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.930
into achieving the
mountain and what

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.857
lessons we can learn from it.

00:13:26.857 --> 00:13:28.440
But for the students
with disabilities

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.550
who we have across
the university,

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.450
if they happen to be unfortunate
enough to have my class,

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:40.460
will tell me, you know,
I've had Tom Hehir's class.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.210
You are, you've been a
conspirator, a friend.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.240
I have enormously enjoyed so
much when we do home and away

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.780
visits in our classes, and
our regular conferences

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.390
between HPOD Harvard
Project on disability

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.060
and Harvard Graduate
School of Education,

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.790
and we're not going
to let you retire.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.760
We're not possibly
letting you retire.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.300
Our keynote, Dr. Judith Human
doesn't need an introduction,

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.440
but she'll get one anyway.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.540
One of the most
well-respected, well

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.040
traveled, well-known disability
rights advocates in the world,

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.680
literally, without exaggeration.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.480
If you wanted to look
at home and trace

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.000
the arc of the American
disability rights movement,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.120
you would begin with Berkeley
and the independent living

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.140
movement, the sit-ins
in San Francisco

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.220
to enact the 504 regulations
to have them released,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.990
the Americans with
Disabilities Act,

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.540
the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.080
is reauthorized, and by
the way, as undersecretary

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.020
for education the implementer
and the thinker around how

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.380
to put in those regulations, and
how to get the Supreme Court's

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:52.040
decision in Raleigh, which said
basically any old education is

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.840
fine.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.240
They actually mean, no, we want
to make sure that all kids have

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.710
their full potential.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.300
And move forward
to the convention

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.720
on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.860
where I was privileged
to sit-in the corner

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.760
in the back with Judy and
Charlotte and Cheri and others,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.740
where I learned
so much about her.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.290
What you don't have in
this booklet, is this

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:19.370
is the leader, den mother,
icon, example, talkless talker

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:23.900
for generations of disability
rights advocates and scholars.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.180
She has been the older
sister to most of us

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.060
in learning about disability
rights advocacy, and the person

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.370
who has set the
example for those of us

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.360
who spend our lives
reading, writing,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.670
and advocating on behalf of
persons with disabilities.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.860
Judy is respected and
adored around the world,

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.510
and I echo and include
Cheri and everyone else here

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.120
to say you are
appreciated and loved.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.300
So thank you so much
for all that you do.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.450
We'll please ask the
discussant and the keynote

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.177
to come forward.

00:15:56.177 --> 00:16:13.465
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:13.465 --> 00:16:14.090
- Good morning.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.702
We decided to make this
into a conversation.

00:16:21.702 --> 00:16:23.910
- I thought it would be more
interesting than my just

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.530
coming up and lecturing.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.885
Although, here we are at
Harvard, and how could

00:16:27.885 --> 00:16:28.944
I not want to lecture?

00:16:28.944 --> 00:16:31.110
And I said, I thought it'd
be more interesting if we

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.090
could get into a discussion.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.060
And so Tom is the
person who's going

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.090
to be leading the
questions, and I

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.340
think we're going to be
speaking for about 30 minutes,

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.430
and then opening this
up for discussion

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.110
for about 15 minutes.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.260
So I really hope
that you're thinking

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.390
about comments you want to
make, questions you want to ask,

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.790
so we can kick this off.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.980
Because the speakers for
the rest of the morning

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.734
are all dynamic
and really exciting

00:16:54.734 --> 00:16:55.900
you're going to learn a lot.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.880
And I would say, this really,
for me, is an opportunity

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.090
to really dig deeper
into what does it really

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:06.839
mean for Harvard
and universities

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.210
around the United States
and around the world

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.780
to really begin to get in
a more forthright way what

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.760
it is that we're talking about?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.680
And I just want to
add a little caveat.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.560
While the Americans
with Disabilities Act

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.760
came about in 1990, section
504 of the Rehabilitation act

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.730
came about in 1973.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.520
And let me just say that every
university in the United States

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.430
community college, college,
has had the obligation

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.880
to do what we're talking
about today since 1973.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.850
And so I think we need to
put that into perspective,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.930
that this is not a
28-year-old requirement,

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.060
it's something that's
much longer than that.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.550
- As a young person, when I
was in college one of the most

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.620
memorable events I had.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.640
I worked in a volunteer
program for the Worcester--

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.780
you've got to be from
Worcester to say Worcester--

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.100
Massachusetts of arc.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.390
And I was working with a
group of parents who had kids

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.670
who had multiple disabilities.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.790
And they were petitioning
the Worcester public schools

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.900
for a class for
their kids in 1970.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.320
And the Worcester
public schools said, no.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.910
And for me that brought up
a whole issue of belonging.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:31.130
I thought all kids
went to school.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.950
And for me, it was
a great epiphany

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:37.930
that actually not all kids went
to school as recently as 1970.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.400
So this issue of belonging rang
true to me as, at the time,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:48.520
being an emerging gay
identity person, closeted,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.710
but trying really
hard to get out.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.100
And so Judy and I have
discussed this quite--

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.900
this whole fundamental
question, when

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.090
you're talking about
citizenship, of who belongs.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.770
Your thoughts on that Judy?

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:06.300
- So Tom relates to
learning in the 1970s,

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.700
that not all children
were in school,

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.380
and I was a product of that.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.680
So I'm from Brooklyn, I lived
in Berkeley for about 18 years.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.130
But I have to say that if
I hadn't lived in Brooklyn

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.730
I wouldn't be the
advocate I am today.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:25.880
And when I was born in 1947,
my parents were immigrants.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.910
And my mother took me to
school when I was five.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.000
But there were no
laws in the 1950s

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.160
and the principal said
I was a fire hazard.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.250
And so was not allowed
to go to school.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.700
But told my mother not
to worry, because they

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.040
would send a teacher
to a house, and they

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.920
did for 2 and 1/2 hours a week.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.740
Not for kindergarten, for
the first, second, third

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.660
and a half of the fourth grade.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.830
And then I was
granted a screening

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.540
by the Board of
Education in New York.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.450
I had to go to a
school for a week,

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:04.640
be observed, have an evaluation,
come before a committee that

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.290
made the decision
as to whether or not

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.950
you got to go to a
segregated, second rate,

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.390
educational program.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.650
But I passed and I
got into this program.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.584
And one of the important
things about that was it

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.000
was the first time
that I was ever

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.110
meeting other disabled people.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.460
So while I had had my disability
since I was 18 months old,

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.500
and I had polio so I
was in the hospital

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.160
and I met people there.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.150
But I hadn't really been
with a group of peers,

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.620
other disabled individuals.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.490
I need to also say that
as a 9-year-old going

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:43.670
into segregated classes
in a regular school,

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:47.960
there were also children 16, 17,
and 18 years old in my class.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.350
So what I learned very
early on was, at that time

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.970
in New York City--

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:59.740
again no laws-- the children
in the special Ed classes

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.130
stayed there until they
were 21 years old, and then

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.650
were expected to go to
sheltered workshops.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.140
It was my mother organizing
with other mothers that

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.450
got the Board of
Education to make

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.850
high schools accessible
in New York City

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.040
so that I did, in
fact, not go back

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.300
onto home instruction
for high school,

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.644
but was able to go to school.

00:21:19.644 --> 00:21:22.060
I think one of the important
parts of the stories that Tom

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.480
and I are saying right now,
is the fact that outside

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.380
of families who had kids with
disabilities, who were working

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.660
on getting children
into school, there

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:37.187
was not a lot of
concern being expressed.

00:21:37.187 --> 00:21:39.520
The fact that disabled children
were not going to school

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.130
was really not a major issue.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.810
And for those children
who were in school,

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.020
there was not really
a lot of work going on

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.340
to determine whether or not we
were getting the same education

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.750
as children in the same school
that I finally got to go to.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.837
And I think that really speaks
to the low expectations.

00:21:59.837 --> 00:22:02.170
And the reason why I think
the issue of low expectations

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.620
is really important.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.860
And a lot of work that Tom
and I did in the Clinton

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.180
administration really was
and still is addressing

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.670
the issue of low expectations.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.280
Because you're not
able to really move

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.390
to a higher level of discussion
if the majority of people

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.470
in the world really have
not yet been convinced

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.547
that we as disabled people
have the same rights as others.

00:22:26.547 --> 00:22:28.630
And I think one of the
other really pivotal issues

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:33.390
about belonging is so many
disabled people do not identify

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.140
as having a disability.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.710
And they don't have identity
first images of themselves.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.900
We don't see ourselves
as a community in the US

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.600
and around the world
yet, as really being

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.700
a political and dynamic force.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.130
A lot of work is going
on in that regard,

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.740
but I think it's fair to
say that one out of four

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.140
people in the United
States have a disability,

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.500
and one out of four of
those disabled people

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.110
do not really come
forth with pride

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.320
to talk about who we are
as disabled individuals.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.080
Many people have
invisible disabilities.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:12.340
The stigma around invisible
disability is very significant.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.970
And I think regardless of
what university I speak at,

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.420
I hear the same stories
over and over again

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:22.940
about the difficulty of feeling
a part of the universities.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.300
Yes, progress is
being made, statements

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.080
that are being made by
faculty and others that really

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.740
push people against the
wall and make it difficult

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.520
for them to move forward.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.900
So I think the
issue of belonging.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.040
The issue of being able to
look more deeply at points

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.190
like lack of education,
which around the world

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.880
is still a major issue.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.530
And in the US, although
children are in school,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.950
there is still, as we
know, large percentages

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.280
of disabled children who are not
getting the level of education

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.700
they need, or not getting the
support they need and are still

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.720
highly stigmatized.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.000
- One of the things that one
of my wonderful experiences

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.410
teaching here at Harvard is
when I started, when I came here

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.260
as a faculty member,
I was teaching courses

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.120
on inclusive education.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.290
And I thought I'd be
teaching primarily

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.160
to non disabled teachers,
which is the case still,

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.540
about inclusive practice.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.290
But the wonderful thing that
I began to see in my classes

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.570
where there were so many
students with disabilities

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.920
who were in my classes.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:39.430
And when I was a student here
in the '80s they weren't here.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.890
And so one of the things that my
students who have disabilities,

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:45.900
and some who don't
have disabilities,

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.970
who are very much
interested in addressing

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.330
this intergenerational question
that this institute is going

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.630
to be talking about,
of situating themselves

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:58.690
in the world and how
do they make change?

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.000
I use you as an
example all the time.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.840
Because one of the things
that you have done,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.349
Judy, and I'd like you to
speak a little bit about this,

00:25:06.349 --> 00:25:07.890
is that you've worked
on the outside.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:09.790
You took over a
federal building,

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.880
remember secretary
Riley used to say that.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.640
My assistant secretary took
over a federal building

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.410
and now she's the Assistant
Secretary of Education.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:25.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.530
You've been on the outside,
you've been on the inside.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.680
I've only been on the inside,
really, you know that.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.460
And I'd like your thoughts
about that, outside, inside,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.410
and what advice
you'd give younger

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.010
people with disabilities about
how to situate themselves?

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.610
- So I worked 20 years
in nonprofit world,

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:51.140
and in 1993 when I went to work
for the Clinton administration,

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:56.890
I had to go in with the real
conscious effort knowing

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:01.880
that I was going into a world
of mainly non disabled people.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:08.050
And that was really something
that caused me a lot of thought

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:11.890
about whether I really wanted
to go work, not only in a--

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.590
I mean education was a
relatively small bureaucracy

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:18.550
at that point, with almost
5,000 staff around the country.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.820
It's unfortunately
smaller today.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.110
But what would that be like?

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.890
Because I had worked
in disability rights

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.110
organizations for 20 years.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.400
And it was a very important,
empowering experience for me

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.960
to be able to be a
part of the development

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.852
of the independent living
movement and the disability

00:26:40.852 --> 00:26:41.560
rights movements.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.350
First in New York, with
friends setting up a group

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.470
called disabled in action,
then going out to California

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.960
and being involved in
setting up the first center

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.240
for independent
living in Berkeley.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.790
And then going on with
friends to set up the world

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.620
Institute on Disability.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.190
And I'd been a number of
nonprofit boards and dealing

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.200
with disability, non disability.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.140
I also was on a board at that
point for the over '60s clinic.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.510
So from an intergenerational
perspective,

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.420
I was involved in issues
around aging and aging

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.030
and disability when
I was young myself.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.120
When I made the decision to
go work in the department,

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.860
I knew that one of the reasons I
was going to take this position

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.730
was because of my fervent
belief that government

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.370
needed to be responsible to
the disability community.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.970
And in the case of the
Office of Special Education

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.400
and rehabilitative
services, to parents who

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.360
had children with disabilities.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:36.970
And as some of
you the room know,

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:41.230
there's been a lot of contention
between the parent community

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.150
and the disability community.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:46.420
Some in the disability
community feeling

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:51.550
that the role of parents
needs to be held in check.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:57.130
And one of my big beliefs has
been that the role of parents

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.180
is really critical.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.430
It needs to be age
appropriate, et cetera.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:02.780
But parents are the
ones who are going

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.570
to be giving the first
messages to their children.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:10.960
So if parents can be exposed
to strong, disabled individuals

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.440
who have been able to fight
the battles and move forward,

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.900
that's a good role
model for parents.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.390
And so when I came
into the department

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.922
and was lucky to find
Tom and recommend him

00:28:22.922 --> 00:28:24.880
to the secretary and the
president to be hired,

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.110
and the Rehabilitation Services
Administration and the National

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.510
Institute on Disability and
Rehabilitation Research.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.470
It was important for me to
assemble a team of advocates

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.380
who were expert and
knowledgeable in their areas,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.530
but who were not afraid
of bucking the system.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.590
Because you know it'd be very
easy to come into government

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.490
and really play the game,
and not really remember

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.420
where we all came from, and why
we were coming into government.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.640
And I think we were very
privileged at that time

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.540
that the Clinton administration
really hired strong advocates

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.890
with disabilities who today's
administration wouldn't even

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.280
blink an eye at, let alone
consider for a position.

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.320
And quite frankly, the Bush
administration didn't either.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.800
I think the Obama
administration carried forward

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.040
what the Clinton administration
had been doing in many ways.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:24.420
But what I learned
early on was that when

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.110
we were dealing with
the re-authorization,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.540
my close friends
on the outside were

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.880
people from the disability
rights education and Defense

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.810
Fund.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.510
And they were doing great
work in their education

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.950
with disabled kids.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.600
And there was no
way that I was going

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.600
to be involved in working
on the re-authorization

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.810
without bringing in some of the
strongest advocates, including

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.561
people like Julie Landau
who's here in Massachusetts,

00:29:48.561 --> 00:29:50.685
and a very strong advocate
in the area of education

00:29:50.685 --> 00:29:52.500
with disabled kids.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.450
And we had meetings
and we had discussions.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.490
And one day, I got a call
from the Assistant Secretary

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:04.557
of civil rights, Judith Winston.

00:30:04.557 --> 00:30:05.640
- Oh Yeah, Judith Winston.

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.360
General counsel.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:07.830
- General counsel, sorry.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.930
Who said to me that
one of her staff

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.530
was concerned because I
had told them to please

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.590
call one of these lawyers
as we're moving forward

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.510
developing our proposals.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.180
Because I thought, OK, we
need to know what everybody

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.210
thinks not just the lobbyists.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.890
And I said, don't worry,
things will be fine.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.357
Everybody will learn to
work and play together.

00:30:28.357 --> 00:30:30.690
And at the end of the day,
that's exactly what happened.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.030
So what do I tell young people?

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.010
I tell, not necessarily
young people,

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:39.270
what do I tell people
who are thinking

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.030
about moving into government?

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.370
I believe it's really
important that when

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:47.940
you move into government, you
have a strong set of principles

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:49.410
of what you believe in.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.540
That you're knowledgeable
and that you

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:56.400
will learn in your job, but that
when you move into these jobs

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.960
if you have a disability,
it is really important

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.820
that you don't forget that.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.570
Just like as we
advance diversity

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:10.240
across the board for
gender, sexual orientation,

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.200
race, socioeconomic issues,
we as disabled individuals

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.330
who have cut across
all those groups

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.930
need to remember that one
of the reasons we are coming

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:24.246
to the table is because we need
to represent a group of people

00:31:24.246 --> 00:31:28.740
who in fact are currently
insignificantly represented.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.100
So we really have a
responsibility, in my view,

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.280
to make sure that happens.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.090
And when you come to a
university like Harvard,

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.300
where you're exposed to so
much, the issue of disability

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.110
being integrated, not just to
the students and faculty who

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.290
themselves have disabilities,
but really into the curricula

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.760
across the board.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.400
I mean in my view,
we should no longer

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.930
be having discussions about
requirements since 1973

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.310
on accessibility.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.280
We should be digging
deep into how

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:04.590
is disability supposed to be
integrated into the curricula?

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:06.420
And we are not there yet.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:11.250
And that's, for me, why this
meeting is so important.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.070
I want to expect
that the bathrooms

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:19.050
on every floor in a building are
accessible, which they're not.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.350
That a podium is accessible.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.160
Basic things for me
to feel like I belong,

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.220
is that we are
really integrated,

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.860
and these issues are
ones that are not just

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.940
being discussed in a
separate silo on disability,

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.160
that they are being
discussed across the board

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.780
when looking at diversity.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.210
And I think Tom and
I did it really,

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:46.440
we really worked hard on that
when we were at education.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.250
We went way beyond just
the mammoth amount of work

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.440
that we had to do on
the re-authorization,

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.800
but in the department
itself we worked really hard

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.710
on getting disability
integrated across efforts.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.950
So we worked hard with the
bilingual education office,

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.950
because the bilingual
education office,

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.360
there are a lot
of disabled kids.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.190
And they were not
getting served.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.680
We worked with the
vocational education office.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.930
We got those staff
and others to begin

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.030
to think about
how did disability

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.380
fit into their portfolio.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.980
And when they were
monitoring what was going on,

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.250
how were they looking at that?

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.450
And how could we do
collaborative monitoring

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.530
within the department.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.930
And we were going out
to states to address

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:29.380
many of these issues.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.690
So my message is, disability
is not yet a part of diversity

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.840
as it should be, that
is your obligation

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.760
to make sure that
universities in fact

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.070
live up to their obligations.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:44.580
And then it is your obligation,
in my view, when you leave here

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.060
whatever job you're getting, is
that if you have a disability

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.170
or if you believe
that disability

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.080
is a part of the
diversity agenda,

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:54.780
you need to not let that
fall off to the side.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.360
You need to identify
friends and colleagues who

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.080
you can go to and speak to like
I've done, to ask people am I

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.160
a Martian?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.140
Which I had a good friend who
unfortunately passed away,

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.930
but I would go
and speak with her

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.310
when weird things would happen.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.850
And I'd say, Katie
am I a Martian?

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:17.790
I kind of get back on the page
that I wasn't and move forward.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.650
- One of the things
that I think, I mean I'm

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.360
totally biased in
this assessment,

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:24.239
but you've been the most
effective assistant secretary

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.909
we've had period.

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:29.820
And when I look at the outside,
inside question and the advice

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.190
to younger people,
one of the things

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:39.010
that I think contributed to your
success was on the human level,

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.179
no pun intended.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.560
No, and I can
remember one anecdote

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.469
that crystallized it for me.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:49.199
We were having a meeting with
the Republicans on the Hill,

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.150
the Republicans were in charge.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.690
And all of a sudden, I see
Judy wheel over to the corner

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.740
and your mother had just passed,
and one of the staffers mothers

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.240
had just passed,
and the two of you

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.520
were having a cry
over in the corner.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.770
A conservative Republican.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:08.370
And I said, you know, Judy
can get anything done.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:12.040
Because on the human level,
you related to people.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.590
It wasn't just that this
was the right thing to do.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.700
It was you know,
how can you possibly

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.880
oppose me because of who, you
know, because of the person

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:21.790
you were?

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:25.320
And I think people
don't recognize

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.110
the importance of that.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.610
I mean, I think I'm an
extrovert, for those of you who

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.390
don't know me.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:37.490
On the Myers-Briggs,
I'm way off the charts.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:42.400
And so I love to talk to people.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.100
I love to learn from people
and hear people's stories.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:49.517
And when, I always
get emotional too.

00:35:49.517 --> 00:35:51.100
I was at a meeting
yesterday and there

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.940
was a woman, a student
here, who was getting

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.500
emotional about
something and I said,

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:59.050
I get emotional all the time
so don't worry about it.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.480
But I think stories
are very important.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.700
I think regardless of this
history you're telling,

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.280
people need to hear stories.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.030
They need to understand today
we're discussing disability.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.460
And again, disability
cuts across race,

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.270
socioeconomic status,
da da da da da da da.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:20.220
So we need to hear
people's stories

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.680
about good and bad things.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.990
People need to be
able to express

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.570
the pain that they're
feeling when not feeling

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:29.070
like they belong.

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.550
When asking for things
that should in fact not

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:36.000
have to even be asked for,
but are not being given,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.740
and having to figure out
how do you move forward

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.650
in asking those stories?

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:44.070
Why were the hearings,
well, I guess stepping back

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:47.220
to the Section 504.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.856
After that provision of the
Rehabilitation Act was passed,

00:36:51.856 --> 00:36:53.730
a gentleman named John
Wodash who some of you

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:58.610
may know who worked in the
Department of Justice, first

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:00.480
at health education and welfare.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.660
When 504 came out
it was a small piece

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.630
of legislation, 40 some words.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.510
And nobody knew
what it was going

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.970
to mean not to
allow discrimination

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.590
for an entity that
was receiving money

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.130
from the federal government.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.090
So they went around the
country and they held meetings

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.100
and they talked to
disabled people.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.680
Justin Dart did
the same thing when

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.180
the ADA was moving forward.

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.520
He went around the
country to every state

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.250
and had people
tell their stories.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.230
Because in the area
of discrimination,

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.280
not a lot of people believed
that discrimination was

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.890
pervasive in the United States.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:40.110
Maybe it happened here and
maybe it happened there,

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.870
but you know, nobody
really meant it.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.030
Nobody really meant to
say you are a fire hazard

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:46.410
and you couldn't go to school.

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.910
Nobody really meant
that you weren't

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.200
going to go to high school.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.840
Nobody really meant that you
weren't going to get a job.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.720
Well that was all bullshit.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:59.367
But I mean, let's
be real, maybe some

00:37:59.367 --> 00:38:01.200
of the issues around
discrimination and race

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.320
and disability are different
because if you're god fearing

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.530
and no one is supposed
to do anything

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:10.030
bad to a disabled person.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.600
So it wasn't
intentional or whatever.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:23.180
But the reality is, we need
to be able to assert ourselves

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:29.450
in a way which allows us
to give people permission

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.720
to tell their stories
and to listen and to do

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.370
more than just listen.

00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:36.860
So a lot of what every
one of the speakers

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:39.950
today will be talking
about, or if you

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.220
talk to them on the
side will tell you,

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.195
is that people call
and ask questions.

00:38:45.195 --> 00:38:46.320
People want to talk to you.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:48.269
They want to tell their story.

00:38:48.269 --> 00:38:50.060
And if it's something
great that's happened

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.390
they want to tell it.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.100
But if they're having a problem,
they want you to listen.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.630
They want you to
help find a solution.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.960
They may have the solution.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.030
And in many cases, they do.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:05.420
And in fact, what they need
is your moral encouragement

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.460
to enable them to go forward.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.810
It's the am I a martian?

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:11.390
No, you're not, go fight
for what you believe in.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.130
I'll be here for you to do that.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:14.810
We'll be here.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:18.110
Why is it important that we
have a strong disability rights

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.750
movement that's not only
in the United States,

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.880
but that's an
international movement?

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.840
It's because our
stories are so the same.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.740
The unfortunate truth is,
our stories are so the same.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.960
They may be different
because in the United States

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.290
we've had our laws longer
than in some other countries,

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:41.360
but the level of
discrimination, segregation,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.980
feeling of being not a part
of a community, not belonging

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.160
are across the board.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.870
It is important to say
that that is progressing.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.750
This convening would
not be happening today

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.470
if it weren't for the fact
that Michael and Cheri and Tom

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:03.580
and other people here at Harvard
and students and the Radcliffe

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:07.270
Institute didn't recognize
that this was important.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.060
But listen to people's stories.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:13.840
Allow people to feel that
they are a part of a movement.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.160
Encourage people
to feel that they

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.150
are and part of a movement,
that their voices are important.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.240
And I mentioned briefly
earlier the issue

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.740
of invisible disability,
because so many people have

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.960
invisible disabilities,
whether it's

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:32.080
a learning disability
or ADD or diabetes

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.320
or epilepsy or cancer
or a severe back problem

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.410
or whatever the hundreds
of labels might be,

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.870
those individuals need
to recognize that they

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.090
are protected by the law.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.930
And that in fact, their
voices are important.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.390
And getting people with
invisible disabilities

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:54.520
to disclose, to feel like it's
safe to disclose and discuss it

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.560
and to come together as a
group is very empowering.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.330
And it's something that
I think produces success

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:03.760
and I feel like I'm
one of the people,

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.550
like many in this room,
who really encourage

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.800
people to tell their stories.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.660
That we value their
stories, and we

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:14.170
value them being able
to overcome adversity

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:16.700
that they're dealing with
through story and support.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:26.710
[APPLAUSE] - We didn't
rehearse this one.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:33.830
Given the political
climate that exists today

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:36.690
and the laws we
have on the books,

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:44.210
you know, ADA, IDEA,
section 504, Rehab Act,

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.900
where do you think legal
enforcement or lawsuits fits

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.730
in in this particular time?

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:57.870
- I think we've always had to
be concerned about litigation.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.330
By that, I mean
one of the concerns

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:05.220
when 504 was first moving
into implementation

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:10.030
and the ADA is, we
wanted, and still want

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:14.950
to make sure that there is
an educated group of lawyers,

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:18.280
and that disabled people
and family members also

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.850
learn about the law because
it's important that we are

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.310
thoughtful and not frivolous.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:27.100
And I think I, like
everyone in this room,

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.390
is deeply concerned about
appointments to the Supreme

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:37.610
Court and about appointments to
the courts in general because

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.310
of the conservative nature.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.220
And I don't want to say
that being conservative

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.470
means you're anti disability
until proven otherwise,

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:52.910
but I am very
concerned that we need

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.410
to be more strategic than ever.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:57.710
And in order to be more
strategic than ever,

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:04.280
it really does mean that
faculty and students need

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.870
to really understand
disability rights laws,

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:11.960
need to understand what
the laws do and don't say,

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.450
need to understand
case law, need

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:17.030
to be able to look at
how to build forward

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:19.940
so that we don't lose things.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.530
And I think we should
also be at a point

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:31.400
where there are stronger
voices through academia that

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.600
understand these issues
and that are strongly

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:41.360
working to ensure that when
we are dealing with filing

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.090
complaints, mediation, going
to court, federal courts,

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:48.080
state courts
whatever, that we are

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.100
able to have some meaningful
discussions about what

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.460
some of the challenges are
so that we can be educating

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.770
not just those at
the universities,

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:00.260
but at law
conferences, et cetera.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.000
Because I think disabilities,
as we've been saying,

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.650
still much too absence of it,
discourse is really important.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.740
And looking at disability
as a civil rights issue,

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:13.310
we need to be working across the
board with other civil rights

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.856
communities in a more
in-depth meaningful way.

00:44:15.856 --> 00:44:17.480
And I think people
like Andy and Perata

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.944
will be able to speak about
some of that later today,

00:44:20.944 --> 00:44:22.610
but I think it's a
very important issue.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:27.670
When do we want to open this up?

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:30.090
Do we want to open this up now ?

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:32.280
We open this up now?

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.678
I think there are two people
apparently have microphones.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.150
So questions, comments?

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.379
- Judy, this
question is for you.

00:44:46.379 --> 00:44:47.420
My name is Gavin Chhabra.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:50.420
I am a person with
severe visual impairment.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:54.380
You mentioned a couple
of interesting points

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.310
about the fact that low societal
expectations and prejudicial

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.940
attitudes are much
more widespread,

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.560
and the experiences of
people with disabilities

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.440
worldwide are converged.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.260
So often, an antidote
to that, you also

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.460
mentioned that you have to have
positive images and stories

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.060
which are positive of people
fighting and overcoming

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.810
the disability.

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:22.010
How do you kind of
walk this tightrope

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.290
that the expectation
levels don't

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.910
get blown out of proportion?

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:29.900
For instance, you know, like
the media portrayal often

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.170
is of this super crip
person who has a--

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:35.930
who is quote, unquote this
inspirational [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:38.180
So how do we kind
of guide ourselves

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.350
from setting the right
discourse if I may say so?

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.637
And the reason why I ask this
is because in the case of India,

00:45:45.637 --> 00:45:47.720
which has one of the largest
population of persons

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:50.870
with disabilities, just
recently in 2015 the government

00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:53.960
was talking about accessibility
rights based discourse

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.640
on one hand, and
on the other hand

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:59.060
it kind of labeled
persons with disabilities

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.717
who were severely stigmatized
as devined bodied individuals.

00:46:03.717 --> 00:46:05.300
And the reason why
they said that they

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.940
are devined bodied
individuals is the idea

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:12.140
is to give them positive
connotation to disability.

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:16.670
To say that they are much
better than regular humans.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:20.480
So how do we do not blow
it out of proportion

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.442
and how do we humanize this
whole debate if I may say so?

00:46:23.442 --> 00:46:25.400
- I do you think we're
much better than others.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.330
It's a well-kept secret.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.010
Thank you very much
for your question.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:40.220
And let me say, that I feel it
is very important that people

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.040
dream big.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:53.140
And so I don't want to put a
lid on someone's belief of what

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.310
they could achieve because
they have a disability.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.200
So I think your
question for me really

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.310
provokes a couple of
different areas of thinking.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:08.470
When I did start going to
classes with disabled kids,

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:11.477
and then went to camps
with disabled kids,

00:47:11.477 --> 00:47:13.060
and in the future,
you're going to see

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:17.050
a film that's going to come
out probably in 2019 or 2020

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.720
called Crip Camp.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.610
And when it comes out,
Harvard will a great place

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:24.430
to come in and do a previewing.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.800
The reason I raise
this is because it

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.230
was a segregated camp.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.140
The reason it existed
was because those

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.620
of us with disabilities couldn't
go to the regular camps.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:42.220
But what was very valuable about
the well run disabled camps--

00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.010
and in this case
camp Jeanette-- was

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:49.870
run by 1960s hippies who were
progressive, drug smoking

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.510
guys and gals.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:53.860
None of whom had disabilities.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:48:00.290
But were in fact into
a free love approach.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:04.180
But it allowed us an
opportunity as disabled people

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.020
to really begin to come
together and think in a way

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.540
that we hadn't been
able to before.

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.570
I, like many other people,
have only one disabled person

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.340
in the family, it was me.

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:18.370
And my parents were
really fighting for me

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.480
to be able to become
included in society,

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.380
but they understood
discrimination.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.890
I mean they're Jewish, they
experienced anti-Semitism,

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.350
their families were
killed in the Holocaust.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:32.780
But disability is something
a little bit different.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.200
And so the ability
to come together

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.260
with other disabled
people and really

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.810
just to begin to talk
about how our lives were

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:45.960
different than our
brothers and our sisters

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.970
and our cousins
and our neighbors.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:52.080
How as we're getting older we
couldn't go across the street,

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.970
we couldn't get on a bus.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:59.970
We didn't have technology
or Braille or sign language

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.150
interpreters or
whatever it might be.

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.910
We were not able to
begin to really think

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:10.060
about becoming a part of the
quote, unquote, American dream.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:13.170
And so it was really
important for us

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:17.040
to do what many
people considered

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.810
beyond the realm of possibility.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:24.150
And so I want to encourage
people to think broadly.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:26.430
Not by themselves,
although everyone

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.970
has to have their own personal
vision of what they want

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:33.120
for their life, but
also to be able to work

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:37.260
with other people who have
disabilities and others who've

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.040
been a part of other movements
who've fought for equality

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.500
and are continuing to
fight for equality.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.150
How we can learn
from each other.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:51.330
And at the same time, I think
it's also very important

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.110
that we address,
I don't know, you

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:55.950
know the issue of
super crip, I know

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:59.400
we can have a very long
discussion about that.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:06.030
I think, Superman, before
Reeves acquired a disability,

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:08.040
people loved Superman.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.130
When Supergirl or superwoman
or whatever she was called

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:14.220
came forward, now Wonder
Woman, we love that.

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.850
So why can't a disabled
person be a Wonder Woman?

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.930
I mean, I think that's what
we're not wanting to say,

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:24.710
that all people,
disabled are not,

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:27.480
are super anything,
because we're not.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.210
But I want to make
sure that people really

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:34.830
can believe that we can
excel, we can be super.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:39.270
The issue of religion, I
think, is very important.

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:41.220
I think we need to
be doing a lot more

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.560
with the religious communities.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.600
And I think we see
in the United States

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.240
there is some more work
going on in that area

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.210
and around the world.

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:51.400
But I really think
it's important.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.380
It's important because we want
religious leaders to be looking

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:57.780
at what the role of
religion in their countries

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.110
can be playing in the
area of disability.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:03.840
That we are opening doors
so the disabled people

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.870
can become a part of whatever
the religious community is

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:07.950
offering.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:10.590
Not that we're a
curse of or blessed

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:13.410
by, but that we are part of.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.120
And that as religious
communities,

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.710
we need to be putting
our hands forth

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:23.940
to help ensure that all people
are able to make contributions.

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.570
So I think, obviously, the
issue of being from the divine

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:30.480
is not where we
want to be pursuing,

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.170
but we need to be able
to enter into a discourse

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:37.350
with the leaders who are putting
that forward to really allow

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:39.690
people to understand this.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:44.790
I was in Algeria once and I
was at a wheelchair basketball

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:45.570
game.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:48.090
And there was an
Imam in a wheelchair,

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:51.930
and someone introduced us
and we started talking.

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:55.230
And the media wanted to know
why was I speaking to him?

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.060
Well I was talking
to him because he

00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.200
was a religious leader
in the community.

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.390
He was also a basketball player.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.510
And he could play a
very important role.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:07.890
So reaching out into our
communities and learning more

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:11.220
and getting them
to be advocates.

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:16.500
To see us as members of the
community who can contribute.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.590
Not who only need
help, but who can

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:21.876
make meaningful
contributions I think

00:52:21.876 --> 00:52:23.250
is a part of where
we need to go.

00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.430
Question?

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:29.470
Comment?

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:30.664
- Hello

00:52:30.664 --> 00:52:31.830
- Can you give me your name?

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:32.350
- Yeah.

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:33.620
Hello, good afternoon.

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:35.890
My name is Claire
Burks Dresser and I

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:37.220
don't know if you remember me.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.270
We actually had a conversation
at Northern Arizona University

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:41.530
a few years ago.

00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:42.230
- OK, great.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.470
- And you gave me
some advice on how

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:47.320
to go into the
international community

00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.300
to advocate for
disability issues.

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.920
And I'm happy to say
that these days I

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.730
work in refugee resettlement
advocating for disability.

00:52:55.730 --> 00:53:00.010
So in that field I'm seeing
some resistance, some hesitancy,

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:02.530
and talking about disability
for resettled refugees

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.700
once they arrive to
the United States.

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.150
There's this closed
atmosphere where

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:10.150
talking about disability, maybe
in their world experiences,

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:14.800
maybe as someone who
has left a crisis,

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.260
it has been safer not
to talk about disability

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.120
or has been put on
the side as they've

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.370
been escaping persecution.

00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:26.350
So these days I'd like to have
more conversation with families

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:30.040
who are still struggling to
talk about disability now

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.260
that they're here in
the United States.

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.900
Do you have some thoughts on
how I can have those opening

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:38.290
conversations to folks who
might be a little resistant

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:42.340
to disclose disability
or really invite it

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:43.850
as a greater conversation?

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.840
- So let me ask you to
answer that question.

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:51.810
And I'm having to
jump in, but how would

00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:56.320
you like to pursue that?

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.150
- Well I think,
for me, as someone

00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:00.370
who has a physical disability
but only growing up

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:04.240
in the United States, the
trouble that I've faced so far

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.570
is trying to connect to
a different experience

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.220
across the globe.

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.860
But the thing that
connects us is

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:15.340
as you said, the challenges
that come with disability.

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:22.060
But I think what I'd like to do
is create an atmosphere where

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:24.490
they can talk freely and safely.

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:29.050
Where universal design is
an expectation upon coming

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:30.790
to the United States.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:32.650
But the issue that
I come across is

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:35.710
because we talk about
disability more than we

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:39.640
have in terms of inclusivity,
but it's still a long way

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.760
to go.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.170
There are still challenges
in creating spaces,

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:47.530
even amongst people who
work in nonprofit to have

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:49.400
those conversations.

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.540
So I would like to
have a space where

00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:56.990
folks can talk about disability
when they come as refugees.

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:59.140
But I'm still facing
the challenges

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.350
where even the United States
staff might put it off

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:05.650
to the side or it might not be
a priority because there are so

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:09.340
many intersectional issues and
things that are not exclusively

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.930
about disability, such
as refugee [INAUDIBLE]..

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:15.040
- So the reason I asked
you to answer the question

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.030
is because you experience
this on a day to day basis.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:22.480
And I think that's
very important.

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:24.632
And you are telling a story.

00:55:24.632 --> 00:55:25.840
And I think that's important.

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.530
And I really think
it's important to share

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:33.370
with the families that you're
working with your experiences.

00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:35.500
And to allow people
to understand

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.080
that there are opportunities
in the United States,

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.490
but there are also challenges.

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:42.340
And I think it's
important to try

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:46.300
to see which other organizations
in the communities,

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:50.290
like centers for independent
living or other parent groups,

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:54.160
or depending on the issues that
are going on with the families,

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.060
that they're also brought
in so that people, in fact,

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:04.720
can expand their universe to be
able to also meet other refugee

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.490
families who have
disabled people.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:09.820
And some organizations
around the United States

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.010
are doing a better job
than others on this.

00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:13.810
But I think what's
very important is

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:17.830
you've put a finger on
a very critical issue.

00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:23.370
And that is that people who
are coming from other countries

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:26.640
also may not have very
high expectations,

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:30.670
may have no expectations
about what can happen here.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.970
And so I think it really
is important to help

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:37.410
people learn about what
opportunities are here.

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:39.420
And to also be a part
of the discussion that's

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.940
going on that disabled
refugees coming here

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:43.569
are falling through the cracks.

00:56:43.569 --> 00:56:45.360
They're not learning
about the systems that

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.610
are out there for
them and identifying

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:51.120
other disabled refugees who've
been in the United States

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.970
for longer periods of time.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.720
And I'm happy to talk
with you about that.

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.760
I'm sure there are other
people in the room also,

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.260
but to give you
some names of people

00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.760
that you may want to speak to.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.840
But this is a very
important issue.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:04.560
And it's not just in the
refugee area, you know,

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.820
you can pick many
other subjects.

00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:13.180
So using your voice and your
knowledge I think is important.

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:16.310
And being a driver
within your organization,

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:20.780
within the refugee community
providers of services.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:24.050
And also looking at
opportunities where refugees

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:28.970
may be coming together in
religious organizations,

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:33.050
in schools, social
workers, really

00:57:33.050 --> 00:57:36.230
trying to give people
space and knowledge

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:38.660
and knowing that you're
there and that they can

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.610
speak to you when they need to.

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:43.590
If that's possible, I think,
is also very important.

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:47.000
And remember I think, in
my view, 100% of refugees

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.214
have disabilities.

00:57:48.214 --> 00:57:49.880
They've been fleeing
their country, that

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:54.080
get psychosocial disabilities,
they may not, in fact, even

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:54.590
know it.

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:57.200
And so I think there
are people like us who

00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.140
have more visible disabilities.

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:03.890
But even those of us with
more visible disabilities

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:05.580
also have other issues going on.

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:08.480
So I think it needs to be a part
of the bigger discourse that's

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.730
going on around
refugee settlement.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:13.669
And I want to see you,
I can't see you now,

00:58:13.669 --> 00:58:14.960
look forward to talking to you.

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.170
Oh, there you are.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.100
I see your hand.

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:16.899
OK.

00:58:16.899 --> 00:58:18.440
Congratulations on
what you're doing.

00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:21.910
Over here.

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:24.020
- Hi.

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:27.020
My name is Joanne
Daniels Fiengold.

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:30.230
I just want to put a
few things out there.

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:32.220
Even though I've lived
in one for 16 years,

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:36.860
I'm not in favor of senior
and disabled housing.

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.370
I don't like being
segregated that way.

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.020
There are far too
many people where

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.700
I grew up in New Jersey who
had survived the concentration

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.210
camps.

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:53.640
I don't like the idea of
being marginalized that way.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.890
I want to speak to you to.

00:58:55.890 --> 00:59:01.150
Go out into the community, seek
out organizations that work

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:03.670
with disabled people.

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:07.860
I work at GBLS, Greater
Boston Legal Services.

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:11.290
I volunteer with the children's
Disabilities Project.

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:13.780
And quite a few of the
parents who are refugees

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.820
don't want the
stigma of disability

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:18.400
attached to their child,
even though the child needs

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.230
services.

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:22.046
And this is a big problem.

00:59:22.046 --> 00:59:24.670
But that's one of the ways that
you can, that's two of the ways

00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:27.552
that you can get
involved and bring people

00:59:27.552 --> 00:59:28.510
into what you're doing.

00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.760
Again, some people
might recognize

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.570
my last name Daniels Feingold.

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.850
I was the first named
plaintiff in the T access case

00:59:39.850 --> 00:59:43.430
that was settled in 2006.

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:45.430
Things are better,
but not perfect

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:52.330
and we're still working
on things at the T.

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:56.770
I was involved from the time
we were in discovery on.

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:59.470
You can find places
where you can fit.

00:59:59.470 --> 01:00:01.950
Where you can really,
really make a difference

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:04.540
in the disability community.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.130
I fell into this.

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:08.300
I was on the green
line and was asked,

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.290
have you ever had
problems riding on the T?

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:14.540
After I finished laughing,
the person who asked me

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:18.140
that gave me his card,
and from then on,

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:21.130
I was involved with
the T and disability

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:23.770
and getting things better.

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:25.740
It took quite a bit.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:27.284
- Thank you.

01:00:27.284 --> 01:00:27.950
Other questions?

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:28.450
Comments?

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.970
That's it.

01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:36.257
Sorry, I'm told no more.

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:37.840
- I hate to be the
bearer of bad news,

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.310
but I think that
just for the sake

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:42.060
of the schedule and
to keep things on time

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:46.080
we're going to wrap up this
portion of the conversation.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.730
I think I speak on
behalf of everyone

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:51.960
in expressing our
thanks to Judy and Tom.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.810
[APPLAUSE]
