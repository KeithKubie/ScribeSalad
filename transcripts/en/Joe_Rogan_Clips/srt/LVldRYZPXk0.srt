1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,520
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,140
I have avoided games on my phone for a
very specific reason why I have a problem

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,530
with games. Like you said,
you got hooked on it. Yeah.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,930
You have a bad ass gaming rig over
there. I saw that gaming rig, game room,

5
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:16,450
the land. But that's all for first
person shooters while we're here. Okay.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,310
CanNot have a game that I love on
my phone. Why not have that? Why?

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,650
Because I'm a child. Yeah, you
get obsessed with it. Yeah.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,240
I don't have that kind of control.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,200
If I have a fucking awesome game that's
on my phone. Yeah, that's my life.

10
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,990
My life's gone now. You go get
the game on me. Everywhere I go.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,690
What apps you have on your phone?
What apps, what else keeps you going?

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,460
I have a bunch of, um, normal
apps like Instagram and Twitter,

13
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,360
but I have a bunch of cool ones.
Like some star map shit.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,560
What do you have never looked for this,

15
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:47,960
but I just found some playing
quake on their phone. Oh, ah, yeah.

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,880
That Xbox controller.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,960
It's sorta like that as a controller you
can excrete dope shit, but they play,

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,250
they have quake three port it on there.
God Damn it.

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,440
See why the fuck would you telling me
that whenever I looked before it son of a

20
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,970
bitch. It looks like it
was two dimensional though.

21
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:07,090
Or not two d but it didn't have an
up and and down. Yeah. Addiction.

22
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:09,480
Now congratulations on your new
addiction. No, I'm not going to do it.

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,060
I don't have anything on my phone.
I don't even have chat.

24
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,060
I played chess on my phone for a little
while and I didn't even like that. Yeah,

25
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,730
cause I was started going, hmm, how do
I get better at this? I'm like shut up.

26
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm try saying that I had to just shut it
off and we put that goddamn thing down.

27
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,340
Do you have to pick and choose what you
want to devote your time and energy? So,

28
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:24,751
so what are your,

29
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,650
what are your top three things that you
put time and interest to that aren't

30
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:32,550
your family right now? Well, work stuff.
It's mostly work stuff or martial arts,

31
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,550
right?
So it's like work stuff is a stand up,

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,810
which is the most time consuming because
I have multiple sets tonight and I'm

33
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:43,500
always writing, always tweaking and
listening to the pouring. So how do you,

34
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:46,410
how do you do at your standup stuff?
So I want to get this shit.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,030
You want to get into stand up?
Not really.

36
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,090
Well that was kind of thinking about
how do I get into stand up comedy?

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,150
People watch my videos. Like while
you're kind of funny, you're funny.

38
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:56,610
You should do stand up. I was like,
Shit, I'll trust me. I'm a professional.

39
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,410
You're funny guy. You can
totally do it. Thank you.

40
00:01:58,411 --> 00:02:02,130
All you have to do is go to an open
mic night. So yeah. What I suggest,

41
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,040
go to an open mic night and see
how terrible everybody is. Right.

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,430
And then you'll be inspired to try to say,
you're going to be terrible too.

43
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:10,440
Don't get me wrong.
I was terrible when I first started,

44
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,610
but you'll probably be better than most.
Really? Yeah. And that's all you need.

45
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:18,630
All you need is people.
If you say something people ha ha ah,

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,350
just that's all you need.
Just a little chunk. One guy
in the front row. Yes. Okay.

47
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,940
I gotta remember I got an ember.
Yeah.

48
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,460
Like I can do this and you'll figure
it out and you'll get better at it and

49
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:29,850
you'll work at it and you'll tweak it.
And how old are you? 36. You can do it.

50
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,530
You still have time still alive when once
a cutoff date. 40 Shit. Kill yourself.

51
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,610
I don't mean that. Don't
listen to me. You'll never
just jokes folks. Just joking.

52
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,180
Kidding Jay k. But if you, if you're
a person who can make people, uh,

53
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,970
and you are willing to
dedicate yourself to it,

54
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:51,700
it's not like you have to have certain
amount of flexibility or you know,

55
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,610
a certain amount of physical
strength, right? No,

56
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:56,910
it's just can you make people
laugh? Okay. Then you can do it.

57
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,590
Are you going to pull it off?
Right? That's another question.

58
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:03,130
So how do you get inspiration? How do you
see you sit down? Yeah. This is funny.

59
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:06,940
Now write this down. How do you get
inspiration for that? I think it's,

60
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,260
you have to be what I would call
a professional, and this is a,

61
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:14,440
I've gotten this from Steven
Pressfield who wrote the war of art,

62
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,370
which is a great book.

63
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,730
And I'm also got it from reading Stephen
King on writing and talking to a lot of

64
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,710
different writers about how
they handle things, right?

65
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,980
If you just waited to be inspired,
and that's the only time you wrote,

66
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,630
you wouldn't have half as much
shit. Right? Not even close Britain,

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,770
not even close.

68
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,630
Half as much good material as you
do if you decide I'm going to write.

69
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,340
So I sit down and I write and sometimes
I don't know what the fuck to write

70
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:45,490
about. And I just started writing. I just
started rambling. Right? And a lot of the,

71
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,970
like the first 20 minutes might be total
horse shit that doesn't get me anywhere.

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,690
But then I got an idea. What about
that? Well, why the fuck do we do that?

73
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,840
And then I'll start writing about that.
Well, this and that will make things up.

74
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,920
I'll make up a fact and then I'll
argue against that fact. Right?

75
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,860
And then maybe I'll find out what the
real fact is and see if I can argue that

76
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,890
way. And then I'll, I'll, I'll,
and then I'll, and I'll give up.

77
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,680
I'll get to like 1700 words, something
like that. I'll shut the laptop.
