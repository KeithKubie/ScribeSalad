00:00:04.562 --> 00:00:06.162
My name is Abbie Vandivere

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:08.402
Princeton University Class of 2001

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.780
the Department of Art and Archaeology

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.594
Program 2 in the Visual Arts.

00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:21.014
I initially wanted to be a dentist.

00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:22.909
In my freshman and sophomore year,

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.657
I took all of the science classes in

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.428
order to prepare for dental school.

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:28.583
It was in my sophomore year that I decided

00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:32.583
that I wanted to major in art alongside

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:33.847
these pre-med classes.

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:37.552
As part of a course I had to take, we got

00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:39.621
to go around the Princeton University

00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:41.917
art museum and find out what each of the

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.041
people who worked there did, so we

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.661
met with the registrars, the curators.

00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:48.057
We also went up to the conservation studio

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:49.852
and when I walked into that room and saw

00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:51.790
these paintings being restored by

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:53.603
Norman Muller, I thought, "Wow, this

00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:56.523
combination of art and science is perfect

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.391
for me." And that day, I called my mother

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.547
up and said, "I'm going to be a paintings

00:01:01.547 --> 00:01:03.397
conservator. Sorry, I'm not going to be a

00:01:03.397 --> 00:01:04.677
dentist anymore."

00:01:04.887 --> 00:01:06.941
For my junior project I combined the

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:09.671
sciences and the arts by making a series

00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:11.793
of paintings based on view through a

00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:14.168
microscope, and for my senior thesis

00:01:14.168 --> 00:01:16.020
I developed this combination of science

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.890
and art further by making a whole series

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.129
of paintings, drawings, and works in

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:22.937
different media based on X-rays.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.223
And I also worked at the museum for a year

00:01:25.223 --> 00:01:28.158
after I graduated. I went for a three-year

00:01:28.158 --> 00:01:30.795
post-graduate program at the Courtauld

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:33.287
Institute of Art in London for art

00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:36.580
conservation school. After that I moved to

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.599
the Netherlands. I worked for ten years as

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.051
a freelancer working in different museums.

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:45.237
I did research on early Netherlandish

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:48.417
painting, and I got my Ph.D in 2013.

00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:52.445
Since 2015, I've been working here in the

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.264
Mauritshuis in the Hague as a paintings

00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:58.550
conservator. It is a small but beautiful

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.244
collection with some of the best examples

00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:03.970
of Dutch Golden Age art, including

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.161
Vermeer's "Girl With a Pearl Earring."

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:09.260
I am also a coordinator and lecturer of

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.429
a new master's program in technical art

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:14.663
history at the University of Amsterdam.

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:17.584
In what little spare time I have, I play

00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:19.649
roller derby. I play for the Amsterdam

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:21.650
Derby Dames, and at the moment also for

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.454
the Dutch National Team. I played rugby

00:02:24.454 --> 00:02:25.973
when I was at Princeton and the

00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:27.817
combination of hard hitting and fast

00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:30.312
skating I find really enjoyable.

00:02:30.312 --> 00:02:32.851
Every conservation treatment that I do

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:34.907
starts out with a thorough technical

00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:36.909
examination where we look at the works

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.074
using different types of light: normal

00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:42.897
light, ultraviolet rays, infrared light,

00:02:42.897 --> 00:02:44.972
and then looking at the painting under the

00:02:44.972 --> 00:02:46.448
microscope to find out as much as

00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:48.205
possible about the painting technique.

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:50.782
This still-life by Pieter Claesz shows a

00:02:50.782 --> 00:02:52.997
skull and a stack of books and other

00:02:52.997 --> 00:02:56.131
objects related to life slipping away, and

00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:58.834
I'm partway through varnish removal, and

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:00.303
you can see that the varnish is a little

00:03:00.303 --> 00:03:02.137
bit yellow, and by removing it and

00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:05.067
replacing it with a translucent varnish

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:07.291
that it will really regain some of its

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:08.604
depths and color.

00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:11.701
In addition to treating and restoring

00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:14.556
paintings, I do a lot of research about

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:16.784
painting technique. A painting hanging

00:03:16.784 --> 00:03:18.719
right now in an exhibition at the

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.171
Mauritshuis is a painting of a goddess

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:24.148
and it is a very rare example of a

00:03:24.148 --> 00:03:26.250
painting on gold leather. And I got to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.609
examine this painting when it came up to

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.991
the studio before the exhibition, and at

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:32.954
the end of the day, I decided to take an

00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:34.832
X-ray of it to see if it would yield any

00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:36.901
interesting results, and we came up with a

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:39.304
fantastic discovery that the whole gold

00:03:39.304 --> 00:03:41.989
background would have had these stamped

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.044
punched decorations that would have made

00:03:44.044 --> 00:03:46.668
the whole background glitter and shimmer

00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:48.714
in the candlelight, but has now been

00:03:48.714 --> 00:03:52.126
covered up in the centuries since.

00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:54.925
So what I call the "Leather Lady" has gone

00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:58.421
from a piece that was hanging downstairs

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:00.501
in the storage facility to something that

00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:02.661
scholars and researchers are really

00:04:02.661 --> 00:04:04.547
interested in, and these are the types of

00:04:04.547 --> 00:04:07.058
discoveries that make my work so exciting.

00:04:07.626 --> 00:04:09.418
I go through this process of investigation

00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:11.347
and I really feel a closeness, both to the

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:13.508
work itself and to the artist that created

00:04:13.508 --> 00:04:16.449
it. By looking at these brushstrokes very

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.623
carefully I can kind of get into the mind

00:04:18.623 --> 00:04:20.771
of how the artist worked, what brushes he

00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:23.029
might have used, how his paint might have

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.795
behaved as he applied it, and because

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:26.867
these treatments may take several months,

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.624
by the end of this process I have a

00:04:29.624 --> 00:04:31.926
real attachment to these paintings.

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:35.879
Works I've treated in the past, I look at

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:37.230
with great pride as I see them hanging on

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.695
the walls of a museum.
