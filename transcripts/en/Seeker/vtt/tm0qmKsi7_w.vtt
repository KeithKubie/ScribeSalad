00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.030
Ow.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.529
Am I right, ladies?

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.790
Hello everyone!

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.589
Welcome to another episode of DNews.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.900
Amy here with you guys and gals today, and
you gals specifically might have experienced

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.070
sore breasts in the days leading up to your
period.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.050
Premenstrual breast tenderness, properly called
"cyclical mastalgia," or "cyclical mastodynia,”

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.099
is extremely common with severity varying
between women.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.140
Some might feel a dull ache while others may
experience stabbing or shooting pains.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.410
It all comes down to fluctuating hormones.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.430
Estrogen levels begin to rise in the first
half of a menstrual cycle, causing the breast

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.430
ducts to enlarge.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.860
Once an egg is released from the ovary, the
body produces progesterone to help thicken

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
the uterine lining in anticipation of that
egg being fertilized and implanted — pregnancy.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.559
Progesterone also causes the milk glands in
the breasts to swell.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.800
It’s the rising level of those two hormones
that lead to breast soreness.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.899
But sore breasts could also be an indicator
of fibrocystic breast disease, a condition

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.059
that leads to large, noncancerous lumps appearing
in the breast tissue before menstruation.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.039
They move when pushed but typically disappear
once menstruation begins.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.930
The exact timing of the hormone levels changing
varies for each woman as do specific symptoms,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.450
though in most cases symptoms typically peak
just before menstruation.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.730
And it’s more than just tenderness and soreness.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.080
Breast tissue at this point in a woman’s
cycle may become denser and have a bumpy,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.250
cobblestone-like feeling, especially in the
outer areas of the breast.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.400
There may be a general lingering dull pain
and an overall sense of fullness leaving the

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.800
breasts feeling heavy.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.830
Premenstrual breast soreness could be worse
if you’ve just started taking hormonal birth

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.300
control, like the pill.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.540
Breast soreness and enlargement is itself
a side effect of the pill along with weight

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.540
gain.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.330
And of course, sore breasts is just one of
a wide array of premenstrual symptoms women

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.780
are all too familiar with.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.720
Emotional symptoms like mood changes, physical
symptoms like abdominal or even full body

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.880
bloating, and cognitive symptoms like exhaustion.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.190
Premenstrual breast soreness affects roughly
70% of women during their lifetime with up

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.420
to about a third of women experiencing moderate
to severe pain.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.850
And it’s most common for women between the
ages of 30 and 50.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.460
And unfortunately, there’s not much to do
about it besides wait.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.001
But luckily, breast soreness typically goes
away as soon as your period starts, or at

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:04.400
least within a couple of days.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.810

dealing with premenstrual breast pain?
