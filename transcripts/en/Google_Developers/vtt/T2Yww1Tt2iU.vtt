HARLAN STENN: My
name is Harlan Stenn,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.730
and I'm with Network
Time Foundation.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.100
Network Time Foundation
is a legal entity

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.840
that can receive money and
equipment on behalf of network

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.220
time projects like
the NTP project

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.170
and a couple of PTP projects,
and three or four others.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.240
Time isn't important
until it is.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.450
So it goes to everything
from quality of medical care

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.090
to whether or not a
stock market trade

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.840
should have been allowed
to happen or not,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.720
based on the time.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.440
Your dry cleaning, in
by nine, out by five.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.100
The list goes on
and on from there.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.610
It's a lot of social contracts,
a lot of other things,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.170
service-level agreements,
things like that.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.230
Network Time Foundation
has been involved

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.240
with Google Summer of Code
since 2007, maybe 2008.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.360
This year, we had seven
projects and students.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.200
Two of them worked on
testing, and writing code

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.120
to test our various algorithms.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.090
Two of them worked on
trying to decide from the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.750
get go, how much
does the time have

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.550
to be adjusted for a clock.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.680
And how fast does it drift away?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.850
We had one student working
on our new general time-stamp

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.310
API, which is a way to
have actually useful time

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.410
stamps for code, two,
three, four, five.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.890
We had one student
who cleaned up

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.390
a directory that contained a
bunch of miscellaneous files

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.359
and programs.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.900
And then there was
a seventh student.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.476
And that project is
currently just escaping me.

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:35.850
Some of the things
that we'd like

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
to do with Google Summer of
Code that we haven't done before

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.900
include finishing work
on some of the projects

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.310
we've started that frequently
take multiple years

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.850
and multiple sessions to finish.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.350
We've always got
openings for students,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.990
hopefully at the PhD
or postdoc level,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.580
who are very good
with mathematics,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.320
to study clock algorithms
and noise, to make

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.260
more precise clocks.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.885
We can usually find
plenty of things to do.

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:11.860
[BACKGROUND APPLAUSE]

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.110
Oh that was definitely for me.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.920
Yeah, really.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.450
We'll take anything from
systems administration help,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.720
webmaster email help.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.320
We love people who can write
documentation, or to help

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.330
with social
networking and media.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.590
We'd love to have
people who write code.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.130
This can be anything
from understanding

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.950
the deep technical
guts of what it takes

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.800
to have time work
properly, to folks who

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.680
want to help make sure
we have a good GUI

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.290
to configure something.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.480
So basically, if they have
a good idea, we'll take it.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.910
And if they're
looking for ideas,

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.480
we can probably find a
whole bunch for them.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.930
There are lots of
amazing opportunities

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.130
in a wide variety of
places, for people

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.020
who want to help volunteer
at Network Time Foundation.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.290
We had actually two
mentors who have come back

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.350
from previous Google
Summer of Code

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.000
to help mentor current students.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.380
And that was really wonderful.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.790
Network Time Protocol
has been in operation

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.870
for a little over 30 years now.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.640
It's one of the longest running
protocols on the internet.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.250
I really enjoy helping
students explore new ideas,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.460
and get used to what it's like
to write production-worthy code

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.790
in the real world, and to
find things that excite them

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.640
and find a way to
have it be a win-win.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.180
Google Summer of Code
has been remarkably

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.460
wonderful to Network
Time in several ways.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.170
We've had several projects that
have been very difficult to do.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.440
And I can think of
two or three of them

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.940
that we've run the program
three years in a row just

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.550
to get them completed.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.910
And we wouldn't have been
able to have completed

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.310
these projects at all if
we hadn't done the earlier

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.520
sessions where we'd
also worked on it.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.560
And we just haven't had the
volunteers to come forward.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.950
And I haven't had the
time to do them myself.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.410
So Google Summer
of Code has helped

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.880
us to bring to fruition
several projects that

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.290
were just big in scope.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.950
And it's also helped us
with a number of projects

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.930
where we just needed
somebody for a few months

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.013
and they can sit and punch
something out and focus

00:04:18.013 --> 00:04:19.070
on it for a while.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.990
We've had several
students who've

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.130
been involved with
Google Summer of Code

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.210
stick around with either
the Network Time Protocol

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.500
project or Network
Time Foundation,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.990
to either continue to
do their work they've

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.759
done as volunteers, or to shift
direction into other areas

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:36.800
and help out the project.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.060
And that's been really
wonderful for them and for us.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.210
And I'm not just saying
this to kiss up either.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.572
