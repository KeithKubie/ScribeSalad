00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:06.373
I wrote it. 
- She sent it.
- I'm ****ed

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.113 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So I was out one night
with a bunch of friends and I

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:15.782 align:start size:88% position:13%
ran into my ex-boyfriend
with this, like,

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.684
basic blonde looking girl.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.685
- Very, very basic.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.752
- She was not cute, right?

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:20.954
- And, I wasn't there.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:21.788
- Right, she wasn't there.

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:22.755
- I'm always there.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.257
- Then I get home and I'm like

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.191
"Okay, you know what, like
I'm actually a little upset.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.892
Like, why did I not say hi?"

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.562
- You're like drunk, it's
three in the morning and

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.797 align:start size:88% position:13%
meanwhile I'm asleep
and you just wake me up.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.265
- I'm typing it all out.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:35.134 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm like "It was really
weird to see you out, like,

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:36.803
I don't think we
should be friends."

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:38.738
Probably the opposite of
what I actually wanted.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.773 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It was obviously the
opposite of what you wanted.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:44.610 align:start size:97% position:3%
I tell her all the time,
like, you do not text an ex.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.111
Especially when you're drunk.

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.647
Especially when it's
three in the morning.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.481
Always ask me.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.749
- But you didn't care.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:50.583
I was like crying and
then I'm just like

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.417
okay I don't need you.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.652
- I don't need no man.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.986
- You always need
me and you know it.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.622
- Okay that's probably true.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.622
So I press send.

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:57.923
Like, what is he gonna say?

00:00:57.923 --> 00:00:59.425
- And he texts her
back and it says-

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.292
- All good.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.127
- All good.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:01.961
- All good.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.162
- Who does that?

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.397
- I send like this,
like this essay.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.632
And then I get like that.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:06.899
- And then he sends this.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.301
- Now I have to send
another text and like

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.468
dig myself out of this.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:10.769 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You gotta dig yourself
out of the hole.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:11.971
Obviously when you do
something like that,

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.072 align:start size:81% position:19%
and then you're
like "I'm f***ed."

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:13.906
- Right and it was...

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.742
- You gotta unf**k it.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.244 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You know what, just
like, forget what I said.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.745
I was a little emotional.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.181 align:start size:94% position:6%
I also had to admit defeat
and like I'm emotional.

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.616
- Like, okay, I'm
a little psycho.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.618 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Right, so I'm like
"Okay like you know just

00:01:25.618 --> 00:01:27.352
forget it ignore
it, like whatever."

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:28.654
- And then what'd he say back?

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:30.423
- He said "No worries."

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:31.257
- Period.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.259
- Pro-tip.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.761
- Twin knows best.
