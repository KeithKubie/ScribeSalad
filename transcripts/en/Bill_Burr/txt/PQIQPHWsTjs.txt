Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, January 11th, 2016 what's going on? How are Ya? Oh, is it going? I'm in a great fucking mode. I don't know why. You know what? I haven't boozed in like fucking, I don't know what it's been. I don't t nine 10 days or something like that. I did have a sip of wine last night, but I don't really consider that Busan, you know, the way I go after it. Um, my wife's so, you know, something was funny when I, when I stopped drinking, my wife always tries to get me back to drinking, not to get drunk or anything. She just is like, you're so fucking, you know, I drive her so fucking nuts that I just think sometimes, you know, if she wasn't such a good person, I think she would try and like drug me every night like around supper.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       Right. Make a little dinner and be like, how is that honey? Oh, look at you. You look sleepy. Like I have no idea. Like, she just put some shit in my food, not to like kill me, just to sort of sedate me. Um, but, uh, anyways, she bought, I haven't drank in like 10 days or something. Wow. That really made my head go somewhere like, wow, that's Kinda fucked up. She does that. Um, but yeah, I haven't drank in like 10 days. I, uh, I'm feeling good and that, so what happens is nice slowly, you know, I start to eat better. I'm starting my day off with the old, uh, from the old country thing, you know, little fucking water at room temperature, which should make you keg if you're any kind of a fucking human being. But, uh, you get used to it with some lemon and then a little cayenne pepper in it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       And then I take a, I let that settle in me. Then I get a couple of scoops of a Greek yogurt, the all natural stuff that actually kind of tastes like sour cream. And the first time I ate it, I was like, this is the worst shit I've ever tasted because I was used to the, uh, the crack baby yogurt that I've been eating my whole life that has like fucking 40 bags of sugar in it, you know, and you yogurt, you're like, yeah, I mean, the amount of sugar that's in fucking regular yogurt humani you should fucking snort it. I mean, it's literally like, I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you. I still fucking love it. But, uh, the Greek shit took me a minute and now I'm actually, uh, I like it, man. If I drink this shit and just have a couple scoops of that, it kind of fills me up.

Speaker 1:          00:02:27       And, um, that's kind of the big thing is you become an old fuck like me. It's just, just somehow getting the hunger to go away without doing damage to yourself, you know, and then walking around and burning a few calories before you go to the next one. You know, and I know this sponge, you know, hopefully some younger listeners listening to this judging Makos and this old far talking about fucking lemon water, Cayenne pepper and fucking Greek yogurt. Well, you know something. If you're lucky enough, you'll live long enough. If we don't fuck up something or something bad doesn't happen to you. A, you know, to get to by age and you know, it's good to start healthy habits now. Fuck. Shut up bill. What do you the fucking first lady, you know what I'm doing right now? I'm doing shit that like a first lady does right now.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       I'm actually, let's get in shape. Kids, how about you go outside for 10 minutes a day and you just do some jumping jacks? Can you fucking believe that they've got to tell kids to go out and play? You know, that's how fucking insane video games have got. I mean, if I made video games and I actually saw Michelle Obama on TV begging kids to try to not have their first cardiac incident by the time they were in the third grade, I mean I, I would tear up and just be like, I did it. You know, I am so fucking great at my job. I've made children stop playing outside, you know. Do you think there's like at the Alec Baldwin of the video gaming industry, you know, from Glengarry Glen Ross Ross coming in just screaming at him, you know, how many kids I cause to have a heart attack? Seven, fuck Yo.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       She's screaming at him trying to get them to, we haven't done our fucking jobs til every kid has a fucking pacemaker by the seventh grade. Um, I dunno. Anyways. Yeah. So I'm trying to get back in shape. So, uh, I've been stone sober. So yesterday I got my, uh, my f my first massage in like, I dunno, like two years. Whenever I get a massage afterwards, I always think like, I got to start doing this, man, this is great for an old Fart, like make, you know, and then you come home, you crush the waters, you get all the toxins, adi or whatever yoga shit they tell you to do. And um, both the, I know this always have them. I don't fucking do this. You know what? Once, once a month I'm going to go down there, you know? Okay. Fucking you haven't worked out my fucking back. Like my whole right. I don't know what's like, I have a little curvature of the spine and the lady's like, where are the problem areas? Right. And of course your brain always goes my dick, but you know, it's illegal place.

Speaker 2:          00:05:16       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       okay. Yeah. They seemed to be able to be a problem in the central pelvic area on the frontal lobe. Um, I'm like Mike, I never even noticed it either. I was like, uh, my right. Yeah. Shoulder, my right forearm and my right foot. And I was just like, wow, how fucked up is my right side? And then I realized all of them, all of those injuries I got from playing drums, you know, my right forum from fucking holding this stick wrong. I don't know what I'm doing with my shoulders. Probably after I fuck up another field looking at the bass player and shrugging like, I'm sorry. I mean I tried to get back on one right? And then my foot, I fucked that up years ago trying to get my bass drum fast as John Bottoms, you know, which I never even remotely achieved. I just had the lifetime pain.

Speaker 1:          00:06:03       You know, every time I take a step I'm always reminded of what a wonderful drummer jump on him is. Um, so anyways, uh, I did that. Um, with the lovely Nia, that's always a good thing to do it, you know, you go in there with your wife, then you don't feel like a dirt bag. Cause anytime I go to get a massage, I always feel like a dirt bag. There's just no way not to feel like a fucking complete piece of shit when you walk in there like, yeah, Hey, I want you to, I want you to work out the kinks. This we heard, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       Wait a minute. What am I talking about? I got a massage and fucking, Nah, Milwaukee. No, I didn't. No, I did not. That was a steam. That was a steam. That's right. Oh, that's right. That's right. Yeah. I guess I haven't had like two fucking years. And they always do the same thing when they, when they put my hands on my back, they just go, wow. Wow. Do you have a lot of stress? Has it been a while to that guy? Yeah. Yeah. If your back feels like gravel. So anyways, we did that and then we came home and um, we made a Mario Batali's, a Lasagna, bowling Aes, and uh, it was fucking delicious. Uh, homemade pots, the homemade pasta things and all that. I gotta get my homemade pasta game up. I tried to make the spinach pasta and this just the pasta was definitely green, but you could still see the chunks of a spinach in there. You know what I mean? So what does that mean? Did I not need the dough enough? Was uh, cause it was frozen spinach, like it's said to be, you know, like the, uh, the recipe said to be, am I saying that right? Like the recipe said,

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       said to be, what the fuck does that mean? Like the rest he said it should be. I think that's what I was trying to say. But um, you know, when I dried it out and maybe I just didn't dice it up enough, I have no idea. But I'm, I'm actually psyched that a, the consistency though, I can get that down. I might've needed it, needed to need it a little bit more. I don't know. Is there any, uh, higher qualified people out there that could help me out on how to make, uh, the right Spanish pasta? Cause I watched some videos and I still fuck the thing up. But anyways, so we did all of that and me while I was watching like the playoff games, play offs and um, fucking great games this weekend. Heartbreakers but just fucking, just great games with the also that, that creeping sadness that I always have when the playoffs are here.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       That it's just like, did another regular season go by that fucking fast. God Damn it. It's, it's going to be over. It's another month. It's going to be fucking over this time. Next month is good. This I'm not even going to say cause it's going to be too fucking depressing. Um, however, I have gotten totally into the Celtics and NBA hoop with my Bruin, so I mean, I got a little game almost every night sometimes too. But anyways, so let's go through them. Let's go throw him his every fucking do shoe doesn't like sports is gonna roll their eyes. Just fast forward like fucking 40 minutes and you'll be safe. Um, the first one I saw, I think I want, I taped all of them. Um, so I watched them at weird times. I watched a, the second half of the original Texas, the Kansas City chiefs, just absolutely dominating the, uh, the new Texas.

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       And I actually tweeted that out to on a, on Twitter. Um, and I actually got a ton of shit for people like, oh, what are you trying to show off your sports knowledge? It's like, no, I like sharing it. I love when people do stuff like that and I'm a sports nerd. Okay. I'm not acting like I played at a professional level. I just love that shit. So I'm going to take you through it for those of you didn't know that the chiefs are originally called the Texans. They actually played in Dallas, Texas. Um, when the AFL first started and when the AFL first came out, the NFL, the established league publicly laughed at them and said, these guys are crazy. They'll, this will never work. Hahaha. Whatever. I, you know, I, you nervous now are not nervous at all. We're just going to do, you know, the American people know where the quality football is at, right? That's what they said publicly. And then behind the scenes as much as they may or may have not believed that they then hedge their bets and they wanted to try to sabotage the AFL as much as they could before it even got started. So the AFL, how many fucking teams did they have? They had the Boston Patriots, the buffalo bills, the New York titans.

Speaker 3:          00:10:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:10:47       Uh, the Dallas Texans, the Minnesota Vikings. And I'll get back to that before you say that. I'm wrong on that. They had the Minnesota Vikings, I used to know this by heart. Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders, San Diego chargers. I'm sorry, the Los Angeles chargers. And uh, dolphins weren't in it. Bengals weren't in it. Who the fuck else has left? Bears. Lions. Yeah, something like that. I, I probably forgot a team or two. And um, so the owner with the most money was Lamar Lundy, I believe that was his name. I didn't look the shit up again, but I read this whole book on it. Lamar Lundy, and he was the wealthiest of all owners. So basically this guy could hold out the longest in this new crazy venture. All right. So how, how they attack the fucking AFL? They did it on two different levels. The Dallas Texans were owned by Lamar Lundy, the most wealthiest of all the owners.

Speaker 1:          00:11:52       So what they the NFL did was they awarded Dallas a team, which became the Dallas cowboys. So for a season or two, I forget, I didn't look it up as I said that you could either go see the Dallas cowboys or the Dallas, Texas, now the Dallas cowboys, as much as they were an expansion franchise, you could go down and watch them get the shit kicked out of them, you know, by Johnny Unitas, Jim Brown or you know, Frank Gifford. And while these guys, you know, all these legends, the fucking Green Bay packers would come to town. You get to see Vince Lombardi in the early days of the packers sweep. You could see all this professional level talent or you could go across town and go see the Dallas Texans, a bunch of nobodies playing a bunch of nobodies cause they wanna establish it. So obviously that completely, um, that's a no brainer.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       As a sports fan, you're going to go see the NFL team and go see all these stars that you've been watching on TV. So, uh, that completely fucked them. And they had to move to Kansas City and they became the chiefs. They kept their color. So, but they were originally called the Texans, but they gave up the name. And then the Minnesota Vikings, which I did not know. I didn't know any of that shit till I read the book. The Minnesota Vikings were originally going to be an AFL team. So at the NFL did was not only award Dallas a team, they also went to the owners of the Minnesota Vikings and said, hey, do you want to just join the NFL and not be part of the AFL? Come on, we're an established league. And of course they said, hey, fuck you guys and your new venture.

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       We're going to fuck a fuck the whole goal and against the NFL, we're going to join them. So that's what they did. They uh, they opened a franchise across town from the wealthiest owner and then they stole one of their teams. That was their two moves as they publicly laughed at the AFL. So there you go. There's a little fucking little little history from all freckles. Um, and I haven't said that, you know, maybe they got him back, but I guess they'd have to beat the fucking cowboys and are also part of the NFL. So, uh, congratulations to the chiefs and evidently they're playing the Patriots is what I got from some of the tweets. And uh, I am not a comfortable Patriot fan know Patriot fan who's been watching the Patriots is, you know, we had a lot of losses towards the end of the year. Um, I'm hoping, you know, we're going to get some help back on our offensive line.

Speaker 1:          00:14:13       Um, either way it's going to be, even if we were healthy, it would have been a brutal day because, uh, you know, Andy Reed is no slouch as much as a guy gets a ton of shit. I mean, the guy's been to a bunch of, uh, NFC championship games and shit like that. He has been there before, but you know, you do need the players. You do need the ownership. You need all of that type of shit to try to, uh, to try to succeed. So congratulations to them. And, um, I am by no means comfortable with next week. Um, and you know, also, you know, the chief speak the Seattle Seahawks as far as p and the loudest fans at one point. And they did it in that old ass stadium rather than the, uh, the stadium Seahawks fans have that helps them out and contains the sound was such a cut, but it's true. Um, and uh, yeah, so speaking of the Vikings and the bangles, my condolences to fans of both teams. I've been there, fortunately you have not been there in a long time. I guess the Jane's license, but I can't Wayne as a fan with all the other shit that was going on. But uh, Jesus fucking Christ. What the fuck was that guy doing after he picked off the ball, walking up to the tunnel already celebrating. I don't fucking athletes. We're superstitious. The fuck are you doing

Speaker 2:          00:15:33       okay

Speaker 1:          00:15:34       right there. Yeah. Right. That's fucking unbelievable to me. And then he's fucking sitting there. He probably already took his God damn cleats off. And then the very next play, whatever's it two plays in, they fumble the fucking ball. I had to watch this part of the game on highlights cause I taped the game and for the one time I don't do the extended fucking record. This shit happens and I'm probably gonna put his cleats on and run back out on the field and think he was so fucking frustrated cause he still had champagne, you know, of course. And through his veins, he was already mentally the next week that he goes, it was the same guy. Right. Goes in and fucking knocks out that player. Unfucking believable.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       I'm fucking believable. Hey Steeler fence. How many years? Shut the game off after the interception, Huh? No, cause you're a fair weather fan. Just because you couldn't stomach to watch the Bengal fans jumping up and down and having some joy. You know, I, I'd forgive you if you did that. I'd forgive you if you walked away. You know, or if you already started celebrating and you turn your big fucking sausage Eaton back to the fucking TV and you're already doing well when it hey, but up, but who do we got next week doing all that shit. Fucking brutal. And, uh, the Vikings, I won't even, I don't even, can you explain to me how you place kicker had the laces facing your kicker twice in one fucking game and a playoff game?

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       That's unfucking I've never, I mean, you never see the laces in, right? I never even knew about it. I'm not gonna lie to you. I didn't ever even knew about laces out since fucking ace Ventura. That's when I learned about it. Or is it ace Ventura? I'm Jesus. Fuck. I mean, I watched the replay of that game and I went on Twitter beforehand and I fell and I found out that vikings wonder, which a fucking sucked, but I was in the middle of, you know, trying to make spinach pasta, which was well beyond my cooking ability. So, you know, I was a little fucking, uh, got a little sideways there for a minute. And, um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       I was thinking like, what the fuck? I mean, he must make this feel goal and then Seattle just has a ridiculous kickoff return and then they're able to kick it. Or maybe they score a touchdown or maybe a defensive back falls down. I had no idea that he was going to fucking lose it. Oh my God. Fucking brutal. But you know what? Every championship team, you got to have a little bit of luck. The first fucking super bowl, the Patriots won. We had the Tuck rule, which was a fucking rule. Everybody blames Tom Brady. It was a blame. The officials are now there. The rule rules committee for coming up with that where we went, because I say to this day, that's a fucking fumble. That's a fumble. The way sugar bear Hamilton did not interfere with Ken stay the year the fucking Raiders won in Superbowl 11. So anybody in Oakland puts your fucking hankies away, cause I don't wanna hear your crying about it. That was payback for Superbowl. Uh, not super 11. The fucking playoffs playoffs in a 77 when sugar bear Hamilton was already in the air. Jumping at Ken Stabler in the, and then he lets the ball go and he called roughing the passer. And back then it wasn't a 15 yard penalty. It, they put the ball where the guy threw it and it was the end of the game. He threw a 50 yard fucking prayer.

Speaker 1:          00:19:00       Ray Hamilton's already in the fucking air lands on Ken Stabler. They call roughing the passer and they took the ball from like the 50 and put it on the fucking one inch blind and then the Raiders went and won the fucking game. So I don't want to hear anything about it, but I am man enough to say that the Tuck rule is fucking horseshit and uh, I think it's a fumble, you know, but I'm not expecting that level of maturity from radar fence, you know, a fan base that goes to the game, you know, dressed with, um, you know, spikes on your shoulder pads that have been checked by security to make sure that they're totally safe as you make a, I'm not safe, angry face.

Speaker 1:          00:19:42       Um, you know, something that does bug me. I can't stand when they fucking, um, when people get upset that Hollywood has the audacity have awards. We have awards shows and they always talk about these self-congratulatory night. Um, like what business doesn't have an award show? It's just not fucking televised. You know, if you fucking drill for oil, you know, they had the best of, you know, BP and all them, they have their fucking yearly fucking Christmas party in our best rage and all manager goes, da Clem. Clem failed out of fucking Mishawaka clam. I'm paying for that copper up tonight. Just kidding. Is his wife here. You know, they do it and they give them a little fucking trophy. They have salesmen or the month shit. You work at McDonald's, you can get employee of the month, you know, you know they have franchise with here. You join the fucking cub scouts, you tie your fucking shoes, they give you a little badge to sow and your fucking shirt, right?

Speaker 2:          00:20:44       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:20:44       Why isn't Hollywood allowed to have their little fucking evening? What is it? Huh? What is it that bugs you? That there's a bunch of hot famous ass there?

Speaker 2:          00:20:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       Oh, Geez. I'm sorry.

Speaker 2:          00:21:02       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       You only want to see, I want to see somebody go out there and defend bill Cosby on an award show dead serious and just fucking hold it and never let anybody in on the joke and then try to continue hosting into it in the monologue.

All right, let's get back to the thing here. Um, all right. Uh, oh today as I'm rushing through this fucking podcast, um, I'm having somebody coming over looking at my garage today, I even have to whisper this shit. I somehow talked my wife into, uh, you know, allowing me to have just have somebody come over and take a look at the garage. And I know I did that a couple months back, but then I got busy but now I, I got the person coming back again and uh, I'm actually using her

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       skills, you know, that she does with me. That's how I ended up with the dog. Like we're not getting this dog. We just were a fostering the dog for a couple of days cause she knew that I'd fallen in love with the fucking dog and then that would be yet. So it's kind of like when you first start start dating a woman, um, you know, when she wants a relationship, when she comes over to your apartment, which she starts to do, is she leave shit there cause it gives her an excuse to come back. I mean it's fucking nuts, right? Like they're thinking that far ahead. All, you're sitting there like, oh, look at those dirt or the fucker. Right. That's all you're thinking. And they're sitting there plotting, you know what I mean? It's like you're some fucking head coach that has no game plan and she's across the field like fucking Bill Walsh calling the first 25 plays of the game.

Speaker 1:          00:27:05       Right? Oh, I love a football life. There's a nice reference to use. Um, so, you know, it's fucking hilarious. And speaking with the Patrice O'Neal benefits coming up, once again, uh, I'll tell you a quick Patrice story. Um, he was so fucking brilliant that I remember he was dating this woman and you know, uh, whatever, seeing her and she started leaving shit around his house and I, and it just had brought that up. I go, yeah, you know, I did this for me. No, she left this shit here and she left there. It's like, what the fuck? You know, I only see you like, you know, once every two weeks. He just has shit there. So for two weeks I keep looking at her fucking brush or the shampoo she left or whatever. And it's just, I keep thinking about it and it's annoying me and Patrice just goes, Ecos, so throw it out.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       I go, what? He goes, throw it out. I go, I can't throw it a brush. He goes, I would like, go get the fuck out. He goes, yeah. He goes, I did that. They told me a story. Well, there was a woman he was messing around with and she left these toiletries and a little bag of like, you know, makeup and brush and all that eddy. He fucking threw it out. And then he came back like a week and a half later and she goes to go in the bathroom and she's like a, she's like, Hey, what did you do with my a my stuff? He goes, and he just plays dumb. He goes, what stuff? She goes, I left shampoo here, I a little makeup bag. He goes, Oh yeah, I was yours. Yeah. He goes, yeah. He threw it out and she was like literally beside herself, but actually on some level respected him for like fucking realizing what she was doing.

Speaker 1:          00:28:56       And then also I think because that early on he clearly let her know in a very funny fucking way that he wasn't looking for a relationship and uh, that she was able to relax and kind of be thinking that, oh, we're just fucking all right. I wanted a little more, he doesn't at least, but he let us know so fucking early on that it didn't really hurt, you know? Does that make sense? I mean, I don't, maybe I'm speaking for her, but I guess I am, but whatever. Either way it was fucking funny, you know, Jesus was that the fucking worse. I literally just jumped out of the plane and pulled the fucking ripcord on that story. Sorry. It's been a while. It's been a while since I told that story as it, I have, I told it before. I don't fucking know. So anyways, so I'm kind of using, um, my, the same fucking tricks that my wife used that got me the dog I'm using with her because, um, we're gonna like, hey, why am I whispering here?

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       Like, she can't just listen to the fucking podcast fucking he that sometimes like how dumb I am. It just really fucking, so anyways, what I want to do is I have this old school fucking, you know, my house is built in 1923 so the garage whenever it was fucking built was built, um, to house like a fucking model t Ford kind of car and those things for those things, you sat inside the fucking wheel wells, you know what I mean? If you, if you look at old cars, um, you know how the fenders used to flare out and then there was just the engine and you know, you sat like literally like right behind basically what you, you sat in the, I can't, I don't know if I, if I'm explaining correctly, you know what I mean? You sitting inside the fucking wheel wheel wells, right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:44       Not like literally in them, but as far as like the line down the side of the car, right. Like if you stuck your head out and you didn't have any fenders on it, you'd be looking at the fucking tire. Right. As opposed to, you know, the fucking road. I know all you guys know what I'm talking about. And it also goes to show you like how fucking fat and big people have gotten, you know what I mean? Two things. If you ever go to Mount Vernon and you go to Thomas Jefferson's house and you have to duck underneath the fucking, uh, the, uh, the fuck, do you come the doorframes you see how much taller people are. And then when you look at those old fucking cars, the fact that two adults could sit side by side like that and it wouldn't be the, probably won't even touching each other, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:31:28       So anyways, what I'm trying to say is that my, uh, my garage is long and skinny and it's like high up, you know, and uh, and then it kind of flares out at the back as it kind of wraps around the back of the house a little bit. So what I wanna do, the front part is long enough for me to squeeze my truck in there. Um, but then in the back, what I want to do is I want to turn that into like a little gym, which my wife has all four. And then I'm also pitching that I build the, maybe a little drum room that could actually, I got this drum kit that I bought that I have in cases that if I want to play it, I have to throw it in the truck and drive it down to a studio. I'm thinking of making, building like a room within a room, which will add no value to the house unless I someday sell it to another fucking drummer who also whispers on his own fucking podcasts.

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       Like his wife can't hear it. Fuck it. I'm still whispering. You know why? You know why? Because the guys coming in like a half hour and my wife is asleep downstairs. If she hears me yelling about it, I might have to have this argument sooner than I'm prepared to have it. So, um, that is the game plan. And like a couple months back I bought those colds. Um, you know, all those things like though that American Ninja Shit, so down downstairs in the garage, I want to just have those hanging from the ceiling so I can do all of that grip strength shit that I want to get better at. By the way, I fucking started working out for the first time in forever and I went to Duke. Go do pullups. Holy Shit. I literally felt like as like, do I have sandbags in my pockets? What the fuck's going on?

Speaker 1:          00:33:04       I did six good ones and whimpered through the last four. I always try to do 10. I can't even fucking do it. It's pathetic. Um, so that's like the big exciting thing in my life right now. And I got to kind of get this thing going, um, before my wife wakes up and find something else to do in the house. You know, maybe, I don't know. So anyways, by the way, people, I'm doing a Gig in a Vancouver, I'm doing a Gig in Vancouver, uh, Canada this Sunday night, alas, second one. That was added because I left my January open because I'm still waiting to hear about a season two. We meet with Netflix this week to pitch them our ideas for season two. Uh, so if you've already watched F is for family. I thank you so much cause you've got me to at least getting the meeting.

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       So we'll see a, we will see what happens. It's um, with that and um, so I hadn't booked anything, um, in January. So now we're having some last second gigs, um, coming up. I'm going to do a Gig in Vancouver this Sunday and then I'm going to do a couple of dates, one or two dates I think right before the Patrice O'Neal benefit, um, in the tristate area. We're still, I'm trying to fucking iron those things out as we speak. Jesus Christ. Bill, spit it out. All right, let's get to the, uh, the questions of this week. Uh, all right. Inbox, inbox, inbox. Where's the content? Here's the con. No, I had it on the other page. What am I doing? Oh there we go. All right, Bill Patriots first. Kansas City. Hello there. Mr. Bird. How's it going? Your freckled cut there. How are Ya? Uh, hope your holidays were just peachy.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       Same to Cleo and Nia. Uh, today I just wanted to hear your honest and objective thoughts about the matchup between your paths and my chiefs this weekend. I was just listening to your podcast from 12, seven 15 we'll you said Casey won't when Shit, somebody tweeted me that I said that I talked so much trash. I don't even remember saying that. Uh, and I'm content that you may eat those words this week. Oh, absolutely. Oh, I absolutely might eat those words this week. Uh, but having said, I think I might, what Casey, what, when Shit is, you're not gonna win the Super Bowl. That's what I mean. My pick is, uh, the Seattle Seahawks, which is not really a, it's not really a genius pics by any stretch of the means. They've been there two fucking years in a row. Um, I mean, didn't they win yesterday without Marshawn Lynch? I was running back and forth trying to make lasagna noodles.

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       Uh, as far as I know, I didn't see Marshawn lynch in there. My wife was also clicking back and forth to like the fucking Golden Globes. So, um, I just know that they, uh, now when I wait, that was, that was the earlier one. Do, do you know yesterday I watched, I watched fucking Ohio state, Indiana. I watched two playoff football games and I watched half of a Celtic game and fell asleep was fucking ridiculous. So I'm trying to remember what the fuck I saw this weekend. But, um, no, I don't think it's going to be an easy, uh, listen, I've got to tell you this. If we were fucking healthy, we would kick the shit out of you. All right? If we actually had an offensive line and Edelman was back and Amygdala was back, we had a fucking running game and a way we, we've, we were healthy. This is no fucking contest at home. You know it and I know it right now, Brady is driving a fucking rental car. So you might go in there and beat us and then you're going to get all fucking excited and loud. And then, you know what? I don't know. You know, why would I root against you guys? Hey, you know what, you guys, heck, you guys haven't won since what? 1970 all right. What was that? Uh, what was that fucking Hank stream call

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       power trap. Cross 57 five nine five. What the fuck was that thing called? I don't remember. You guys have an a. When you beat the fucking Vikings, Jesus Christ going way back. You beat the AFL team. That fucking sold up. Maybe that's why they're cursed. Maybe that's why they've lost one or they lose three, three, four Superbowls. Three Superbowls. Right? They lost to the fucking chiefs. They lost to the packages. They lost to the dolphins. Any loss to the Steelers. Is that right? Wait, the dolphins lost to the cowboys.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       Then they beat the vikings and they beat the Redskins. That's right. She speak the vikings. Green Baby. The chiefs. They didn't beat the Raiders, did they? They beat the Vikings. Right now. The Vikings would have been in the NFL by then. I don't fucking or whatever. You lost like fucking three of them. Maybe because you'd get, you didn't stick with the AFL guys. Does that make any sense? Whatever. Good luck to the chiefs this week. A good luck to the Patriots. Obviously my heart is with the Patriots, but uh, you know, I don't know. I didn't like, like that dolphins game where every time Brady, the few times he went back to past, there was just somebody right in his grill every fucking time. Um, but whatever the end of the fucking day, we have the greatest fucking quarterback and coach of all fucking time. So go fuck yourself.

Speaker 1:          00:38:31       I think we're gonna beat you. All right. It'd be no fun if I said good luck to you guys. So fuck you guys. You don't stand a chance there. Now if you beat me, you got something to talk about, then he could trash me and I can fill out a fucking hour next week on the podcast. Um, alright. Drive to school. Oh, by the way, Alabama. Clemson, I have no, I don't know shit about either team. I was so fucking busy in the fall. I didn't get to watch any of it, but of course, um, I, I wouldn't care if Alabama won, but Clemson hasn't won in a while, so I'd love to see them win. However, if, if Alabama wins, it just makes the Cleveland Brown's futility even funnier to me because the dumbest fucking move ever. Do you realize that they had bill Belichick and Nick Saban coaching their team and they fired them?

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       The VUS, the fucking Paul Brown, Vince Lombardi of the modern day NFL and the Paul Brown bear Bryant, Vince Lombardi,

Speaker 2:          00:39:37       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       Of NCAA Division One football. They had them both coaching together and they fired the CEO of Alabama. As a Cleveland Brown fan, you have to be rooting for Clemson. You just have to, you guys have had enough fucking pain. Right? Who knows? Maybe Lebron can get you over the hump this year, you know, uh, I always root for Cleveland. Like I said, I have relatives, you know, family that grew up out there and all that type of shit. I, uh, actually love Cleveland. So, um, however, I also love a good joke. So if Alabama wins tonight, it'll still be funny. Anyways, continue on drive to school. Hey Bill, I've been a fan of yours since the ona days and Chappelle show. Somewhere along the line I had a kid and he's old enough to listen to some of your podcasts. Uh, I listened to it with him on the drive to school.

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       I listened to the whole episode before beforehand and cut out any of the stuff that is a bit heavy or sexual. Uh, Jesus, you're fucking great dad. When you start editing their content, you know, look at you, you're a regular, typical a not because I'm sheltering him, but because he and I don't need, don't need share certain podcasts moments. When you talk of Ges in uh, in some skank before 8:00 AM exactly. Let the kid have a childhood, uh, trying to keep it light and positive with the exception of the funny negative. Anyways, I wanted to tell you that it's the best thing we got going. We listened to about 15 minutes a day. It puts him and I in a laughing mood, which he needs schools, a lot of work these days. And he always got a ton of homework and projects and his dragon in the morning.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       This wakes him up. Sometimes we pause and talk about certain things or I'll explain certain stuff to him about politics, sports, et cetera. Yeah. In other words, correct. The dumb shit that I said, all that father son stuff. Thanks for the parental assist. Oh, that's great. Who would ever thought my ignorance could be had? Warman uh, anyways, uh, I'm already regretting fucking making funny Ricky Gervais' why did I do that shit? But you know, I mean, he's making fun of everybody on the show. It's only fair, right. Does showing up with fucking acceptance speeches and he's got all those fucking zingers at him and his writing staff wrote, it's only fair. That's why I like Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson gave him shit back. I don't understand why people just go out and smiling. They should fucking trash them. A vasectomy. Ah, dear bill, I don't want to get a vasectomy.

Speaker 1:          00:42:08       I just don't. My wife and anyone else who chimes in on this subject started trying to break down positives and point out the lack of negatives ever. Just not want something. I just don't want one. Can you believe this or you with everyone else that it must be rooted in some fear, et cetera. Fuck that dude. Fuck that. Are you fucking kidding me? Do you think you could fucking tell a woman what the fuck to do with their body for two seconds before she just said you're a, you're a chauvinistic cunt. Yeah, Dude. Fuck that. Fuck that all day long. That's your fucking Dick and balls. All right. You got that. They fuck with your Dick. If you don't fucking want them to go in there and snip, snip, whatever the fuck I've even looked up the operation, I still don't get it. I don't get it. Nothing comes out. So does it stop your ability to make choices? Do they put an utter down there where you got to milk the ges out as well? That's disgusting. I don't get, I don't get what happens, but fuck that. Fuck that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:12       Fuck that. Just just sit down with you. I say, listen, I don't want to do that. And she'll be like, why? Why not you? You're just, you're just fear based. It's like, no it isn't. I don't want to be walking around and like, dude, you know what that's like. You like a muscle car and they want to rip the engine out and put a fucking v6 in there. Fuck you and keep you a Shelby badge on the side of your car. And every day in the morning you wake up standing there looking at yourself after you got out of the shower knowing that it's a lie. Fuck that dude. Fuck. Do you keep the bullets in that gun? Alright, she can't handle it. You know I, you know, what is she going to do to you? Huh? She gonna hold you down and make while someone else does it just, yeah, you don't want one dude.

Speaker 1:          00:44:04       You don't want one to the level you're reaching out to a fucking podcast. Okay. Do you understand that? Would even use that in your argument? Just be like, but I don't play this audio though. I would just say, listen, I so do not want to do this that I actually wrote into a podcast to get advice. That's how much I don't want to do this. And then she'll just be like, well, maybe we need to go talk somebody about it, which means she's going to set up an appointment with somebody who agrees with her. Okay. All right. Cause she's going to set up the appointment call. Listen, my husband needs to get a vasectomy. He's very nervous. He says he doesn't want to get it, but it's gotta be the best for us and she's going to totally set the fucking table. It's like those dumb fucks that go on, Doctor Phil, do you have a c those said sacks that go on that fucking show with their wife.

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       Like they have a fucking prayer doctor. Phil's audience is women. So he's going to have to side with the woman every fucking time. Even if he, you know, he's going to try that, you know, hide his hand and give her a little bit of Shit. But at the end of the day he's going to be looking at you go, you need to get your balls snipped right. He's got to come at you like that while he sits there, you know, with his junk still fucking work. You know, he's got a giant fucking unit. Doesn't he do that big fucking Goof, that big bold goof. Walk it down the hall. I, you know, he's got a fucking giant fucking unit. Big Greg. Great Dane balls. I don't know why. I think he's got a fucking giant unit. He does. He's just like, he's just dirt. But the way he talks, he's just, God always gives them big dicks. It just, I don't know what it is. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:46:00       well the giant size 16 brown wooden wingtips just sitting across from you. That's gotta be the worst fucking show ever to be on. Oh my God. I never thought about doctor Phil's junk before you see that it takes somebody to fucking bring up a vasectomy, you'll never be able to think about them again. Megan, my big Dick say, you need to listen to your wife. All right. Jumping out of a plane. Hey Bill, where are you at on jumping out of a plane? Uh, if you're a chicken shit American, I'm a Brit. How much money would it take you to jump? Uh, I got a bet with my mate that you hate heights and it take 500,000 US dollars. Don't change your answer to be contrary to what I just guess. Keep it fair. Good sir. Thanks a Jesus. Another arrogant Brit. These guys think they're fucking geniuses. Um, I've already done it. You fucking idiot. And I paid someone to do it. Paid. I went to a in Pepperell, Massachusetts when I was 19 years old and I didn't do a tandem jump either. I did a static line jump. I've told this story on the podcast, sir, if you're a little bit, um, more up on it. Uh, and also I have a pilot's license. I fly helicopters. So if I afraid of heights,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       I mean I'm afraid of heights. Look, if I don't have a parachute on my back and I'm not in a, in a, uh, in a vehicle that's designed to fly, okay,

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       then yes, I'm afraid of heights. Like, I don't like, uh, you know, like if he should, like one time I watched the youtube video and they just showed these guys that had the climb up to the top of this fucking building

Speaker 4:          00:47:57       and then,

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       no, no claims. That was it. They took the elevator, who's getting hope? They, they, they were on the roof and it was already on the fucking roof. This building was so fucking high up and you know, the wind up there must be ridiculous. I would literally just lay down in the fetal position and crawl back to the fucking door that leads to the stairwell, reach up to the handle and fucking go back down. But this, this dude, um, then climbs the fucking, the, the, the whatever though though the radio tower or whatever and it just keeps getting higher and higher and higher in the tower gets smaller and smaller and smaller and he's hooking and unhooking his safety line. I literally, I couldn't find, I mean obviously the guy lives cause it's his GoPro on his helmet and I've never been so fucking unsettled watching something in my life. Okay. Then I would hate heights. But I think at that point everybody hates heights. But, um, yeah, when I was 19 years old, I went to a, this place, uh, in Pepperell, Massachusetts, which I don't think exists anymore. They might still be an airport there and they had a, a, a school. And uh, I did the static line jump, if you've ever seen that movie, a Fandango when Kevin Costner's earlier ones were the dude from a breakfast club, uh, Judd Nelson, his character jumps out.

Speaker 4:          00:49:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:30       Um, that's exactly what I did. And I remember when we went up, the command was sit in the door, get out, and then he slapped you on the shoulder and said, go.

Speaker 4:          00:49:41       And uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       I remember when he said sit in the door. I thought he was saying close the door. So I was reaching up, I'm sitting down, reaching out, trying to close the door, and he had this big smile on his face. Like he thought I was chickening out. I feel like I just told this story on the podcast and then if I really thought he was saying, sit in the door. So you sit in the door and basically it's one of those planes where the, the wing is above the aircraft. Do you know what I mean? It's on top of the aircraft as opposed to below, which actually gives you a much better site I would think. Um, as far as if you wanted to look down. Um, and then there's the support that goes to the side of the plane. So, and then right above one of the landing wheels, the wheels don't retract on this plane.

Speaker 1:          00:50:23       They had a welded, a little step. So you sat the fucking door and a, I forget how high we were at going to say we will only like 1500. We weren't that high up because you shoot immediately comes out. Um, so you said you sit in the door, then he goes get out and then what you do is you reach out and you grab that support beam from the wing and you hold onto that while one of your feet is, uh, is standing on that little step thing. And then basically what you do is, I'm literally acting this out so I can remember it, is you then basically you, you bend your arms and you bring your chest, like flush with the support beam and then the, the, the foot that's dangling, you put it straight out behind you. It's almost like a yoga pose.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       So it was sit in the door, get out, and then he slaps your shoulder and he goes, go and you let go. And then you, you arch you arc, right? Arc One arc, 1002, 1003, 1000. Look, if nothing look reached Paul. And when you're looking, you're looking over your, your shoulder to see if you shoot came out. And then if nothing you looked down at the handle, reach, pull it. Cause for some reason they say if you don't look down, you might be flailing because you're panicking. Cause it's the first time you jumped in, the shoot didn't come out. Sorry. Cayenne pepper Ra. Hang on a second. So anyways, I get out, he goes, go, I let go. And instead of arching ice, I don't know what I did. I just reached for something. All I know is I started doing front foot front flips as my shoop was coming out and I felt it go by my leg, the inside of my leg, I felt it go by my leg.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       I felt something hit that and I was immediately thinking, oh my God, I'm going to roll right up in this fucking thing. Like, you know when you put Bacon on shrimp and a the second I had that thought like the shoot already had come out. And by the grace of God I didn't get tangled up. I think about that sometimes. Like how easily I could have fucking died. Um, and then boom, your shoot comes out and when you shoot comes out, you don't even feel like you're falling because there's nothing going past you. Cause you're above the treeline and all that. So you just feel like you just sort of suspended in the air. And uh, there was a radio and this lady just talked to you and she say, pull the left toggle and you had to pull it all the way down to your knee.

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       Cause I remember there was this, this big girl in the class and she couldn't get it around her hips and she landed across the street in a pile of loom in a dislocated her knee. I remember that before. And then I went up after her and I was just like, fuck. Um, and then they have this ridiculous, you know when you get to the treeline you suddenly realize how fast you're falling. I think it was like 17 feet per second or maybe 11 feet. I can't remember. But it was really fast. It was like basically, you know, jumping off of a, of a basketball rim. Like how fast you'd come down. It had to be a little bit slower, right? No, no. Cause you're not reaching terminal velocity. I don't fucking know. So all I know is when you hit the ground, where you were supposed to do is look straight ahead because for some reason if you look down at your feet, what you were going to do, they were worried you'd pick your feet up too quickly and somehow break your legs.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       So what you had to do is look straight ahead and as right as you hit the ground, you supposed to do this little fucking like collapsed down and then this big ridiculous, bring your both your legs straight up in the air and then over to your side. I don't know why. I doubt that they still have people do that. And I did. What everybody else did is I came down and the second my feet hit the ground, I did a face plant right into the grass and my buddy grabbed the, uh, the Mike from the person who called me a Dickhead, something like that. What a dick hit or something in the um, in the, in the radio. Um, so yeah, there you go. So I did it. And what are you basing chicken shit. American not, Huh? Oh, you tough guys over there with your fish and chips. Have you done it yet? 500 euros. I, there's nothing you can sub. If I don't want to do something, I wouldn't do it. There's not money that you can give me and all. He goes, oh, you fuck a break now I'm making great money. I got enough money, I got enough money. I'm good to take my life in my fucking hands. Now. That's one of those things. Now, I was back working at the warehouse. I mean, granted I pay somebody when I was working in a fucking warehouse, I a shit, you know, let's see.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       How much would they, I mean, if they gave me, literally, if you gave me $400, you would've doubled my pay for the week. So I would have done that. Well, let's see, let's go back to the building to climb up dead building. How much money would they have to give me a, when I was working in the warehouse, uh, $800.

Speaker 4:          00:55:38       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       and that now for that, that building, uh, I would say, uh, yeah, I just wouldn't do it. That's, no, I'm all right. I'm all set. I'm all set. I, you know, I should actually send you guys dead video.

Speaker 4:          00:55:54       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       so it's not that I hate heights, sir. I hate, I'm risking my life to that level. If there's like a parachute or something like that, it is a bungee cord or there's like a fucking safety line, that's fine. But you know, going up that tower where I have to unhook the safety line and then hook it back up and there's wind and shit. Fuck that. That's too much of a risk. I wouldn't do that.

Speaker 4:          00:56:21       You know? Fuck.

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       Why do I even want to fucking talk about college cooking dear Billy boy. Oh, that's a great one. What a great one. Bill. Billy Paul. Yeah. D. Oh fuck. I gotta wrap this up. This guy's coming in 12 minutes. Uh, I'm sure everyone is blowing you up to make another cooking video, so don't worry. This isn't that I'm a college student. I know you've lived like a college student into your early thirties. From past stories about living with Bobby Kelly. Oh Dude. We weren't living like college students. We will live in like fucking animals. Uh, do you have any menu suggestions besides pasta? What would you mix together? I'm pretty current creative, and I do all right, but I'm open to some suggestions. What's good to throw together on a budget and on a fly. You know what dude? I would go to, um, I would, this is what I would do.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       I would go on Youtube and I would ask that question and you'll find videos and then just start searching. And at some point you're going to connect with somebody. And I feel like I'm, you know, dropping the ball here on the question, but like I'm not a chef. I'm not even a cook. I'm really early on this to this myself. So that's what I would do. There's a bunch of old episodes of Mario, Mario Batali's, multiple Mario, m. O. L. T. O, Mario. Um, I really suggest watching those. Just watch the guy. I used to just watch the show and just by watching it, you learn things and you start to see how things are made. Um, and, and, uh, the big thing is not having, you just have to, to, to learn shit in life. You got to have the, the mindset of like, I'm gonna, you know, I'm going to fuck this up probably the first time.

Speaker 1:          00:58:10       And that's all right. And then I'll get a little better like the pasta already. Just even just running it through the pasta maker. I already have like three, three fucking things that I'm not going to do the next time. Um, and by the way, somebody gave me a great tip when you, after you find needed the dope and you put it through your pasta maker, be sure to douse like both sides with flour, be liberal with the flour. Cause if you don't it's going to tear. It could tear when you're in there cause it's supposed to be like sticky and elastic at the same time. And uh, when you run it through there, um, yeah you could, you could possibly have some issues and it tears then it's a big fucking pain in the ass. And then he gets sad. You feel like a fucking failure and you're not, he had the balls to try it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       So I would, uh, I go that Rachel Ray's got a great bunch of great ones from back in the day. Everybody always makes fun of her, but she wouldn't, she, I made 20 minute meals. He did little fucking lab. She'd do. I used to watch your shit all the time. That's great shit for probably where you're at. But I would also Google some stuff like that. Um, but it's great as a college student, if you start to learn how to cook, if you start to learn how to cook right now and you do it religiously, you are going to be a beast compared to the average person. Um, by the, by the time you're in your thirties, dude, forget it. If you add like shit, like learning how to, how to make a pie crust cause then then you can make Turkey pot pie. You can make key, she can make all of this shit.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       You start making homemade pasta. Forget it. It's fucking over. Then you learn how to do all this other stuff. I forget what I mean. I made it with Nia. I was really concentrating on making the pasta. She did the bowl and Aes and then she did the whole milk sauce thing, but I just was watching her do that where you heated up some butter and some flour and then he heated up some milk. Then you poured the whole thing together instead of using like a ricotta cheese, um, or any of that type of shit. Um, you use this really rich milk thing. It was almost too much. The fucking dish was like, it almost tasted like a dessert. It was so fucking good. But, um, I didn't know how to do shit when I was your age. So I think it's great that you're doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       Um, you know, you want, how about Blue Apron? Sign up for that shit and just, you know, steal some of their meal ideas and then expand on them. If there's a, or if there's a style of cooking that they give you, then you go on Youtube and, uh, you just start looking at recipes about that. Like, you know what, I, I don't know anything about, which is weird because I loved the food is any sort of Asian style, um, cooking. I actually smoked some ribs and I, and I had this, uh, this dipping sauce that was like, oh, uh, you know, whatever, uh, Chinese or Japanese influenced, you know, with the fucking soy sauce and all that. And it was, and I was in a part of the grocery store that I never went to. And it was the shit. It tasted great. And, um, that's something I was kinda thinking this year. I want to get down pasta and start to have some Asian, uh, type dishes in there. So if there's anybody out there that can help me with that, I'd appreciate it. So anyways, the guys coming here in eight minutes, I get to upload this fucker. Um, I'll talk to you later.
