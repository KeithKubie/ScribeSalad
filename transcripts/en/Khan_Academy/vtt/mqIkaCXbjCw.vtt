00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:01.126
- [Voiceover] We're already looked at

00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:02.588
Faraday's law in some detail.

00:00:02.588 --> 00:00:05.671
It showed us that if we have some

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:09.554
loop of conductor and we have a change

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:12.667
in magnetic flux over
time through the surface

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.598
defined by that loop, it's going to induce

00:00:14.598 --> 00:00:17.198
an EMF through that loop which will cause

00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:22.198
a current to start to
circulate through that loop

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:23.732
and that current, of
course, will be dependent

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:26.597
on the actual resistance of the conductor.

00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:28.242
And there's many ways
that we've already seen

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:30.477
of having a change in magnetic flux.

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:33.444
One, you can have a change
in the magnetic field.

00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:35.435
It could be a change in its magnitude

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:37.085
and, or it's orientation.

00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:39.198
You could have a change in the shape

00:00:39.198 --> 00:00:41.540
of the actual loop of conductor.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.754
If its area increases or decreases,

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:45.197
that will change the flux.

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:46.904
Remember, the flux is just your,

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:49.098
the component of the magnetic field

00:00:49.098 --> 00:00:51.759
that is perpendicular to the surface.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:53.263
If you took the average of that times

00:00:53.263 --> 00:00:55.376
the area of the surface.

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:56.303
And then the other way that we're going

00:00:56.303 --> 00:01:01.303
to study in this video is
inducing an electromotive force

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:06.196
by changing it, not the shape of the loop

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:08.085
and not the magnetic field but by changing

00:01:08.085 --> 00:01:10.077
the orientation of the loop.

00:01:10.077 --> 00:01:13.795
And in particular, we're
going to have the loop rotate.

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:15.583
So let's think about this.
So I have this loop here.

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:18.306
It's connected to this axle
and I'm going to rotate it

00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:22.207
in a, I'm going to rotate
it in a clockwise direction

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:24.137
through this constant magnetic field.

00:01:24.137 --> 00:01:25.356
You can see it's constant.

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.631
All of the magnetic field vectors

00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:29.911
I've just sampled'em at
different points in the field.

00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:31.955
They're all pointing straight
up and I've drawn them

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:34.089
so that they all have the same magnitude.

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:36.980
Now we'd appreciate is as we rotate this,

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.703
the angle between the magnetic field

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.628
and the surface is changing
and right from this point,

00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:44.822
as we rotated this clockwise direction,

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:46.834
the component of the magnetic field

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:51.834
that is perpendicular to the
surface is going to increase.

00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:53.071
Now what am I talking about?

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.416
Well, let's look at it
from this point of view.

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:55.920
Let's look at it from the point of view

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.821
of the actual loop of wire,
so from this point of view

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:01.873
the magnetic field is at some angle.

00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:05.306
I can draw that angle here
so, you know, whatever angle,

00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:08.029
it's a little hard to see,
whatever angle this is,

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.898
we could say that is that angle here

00:02:09.898 --> 00:02:12.640
and as we rotate the
entire loop, it's attached

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.095
to some type of an axle here,
in a clockwise direction.

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:18.289
What is going to happen to this angle?

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.902
Well, after let's say delta
T, let's say we're just

00:02:20.902 --> 00:02:25.782
rotating it a constant
rate, we're going to have

00:02:25.782 --> 00:02:29.297
the magnetic, so after
we've rotated a little bit,

00:02:29.297 --> 00:02:31.280
the magnetic field of vector is going

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.946
to look something like that.

00:02:32.946 --> 00:02:35.510
So it's the component
that is perpendicular

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.916
to the surface was what
we care about for flux,

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:41.085
it's going to go from being
like this, it's gonna go

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:45.007
from being like that to going to being,

00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:48.765
to being like this, to being like this.

00:02:48.765 --> 00:02:51.894
So at least for this
point of the rotation,

00:02:51.894 --> 00:02:53.377
for this point of the rotation till we get

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:55.502
to the flat, until we
get to the flat point,

00:02:55.502 --> 00:02:59.017
until we have our loop
being completely flat,

00:02:59.017 --> 00:03:02.653
the component of our magnetic field

00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:05.356
that is perpendicular is going to increase

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:07.205
which is going to have,
so we're going to have

00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:10.296
an increase in flux over that time.

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:12.490
So if we have an increase
in flux over that time

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.456
as we rotate up, at least
until we get to the flat point,

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:16.492
what is going to happen?

00:03:16.492 --> 00:03:17.955
Well, we're going to induce a current

00:03:17.955 --> 00:03:19.030
and then we just have to think about what

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.812
is the orientation of the current?

00:03:20.812 --> 00:03:22.526
So we want to have a current that

00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:23.806
will induce a magnetic field that will

00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:26.651
go against the change
in flux so the current

00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.394
should induce a magnetic field that is,

00:03:29.394 --> 00:03:31.771
if our flux, at least for
that part of the rotation

00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:35.733
is increasing in the upwards direction,

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:39.097
if we're from the point
of view of this loop,

00:03:39.097 --> 00:03:41.635
then we need to create a magnetic field

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:43.728
that is acting against that.

00:03:43.728 --> 00:03:46.471
So magnetic field that
is acting against that

00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:48.483
or we need to, we're
ready to induce a current

00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:50.026
that induces a magnetic field that acts

00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:52.059
against that change in flux.

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:54.313
So, how do I, what type of current

00:03:54.313 --> 00:03:56.101
would induce a magnetic field like that?

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:57.535
So I'll just use the
right-hand rule, my fingers

00:03:57.535 --> 00:03:59.383
would go in the direction of these,

00:03:59.383 --> 00:04:02.553
of the magnetic field, so my fingers

00:04:02.553 --> 00:04:04.260
and I have to use my right hand,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.555
so my fingers are gonna
go in that direction,

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:08.404
so my right hand, my thumb,

00:04:08.404 --> 00:04:12.326
my thumb would go in this direction.

00:04:12.326 --> 00:04:14.032
So that is going to be the direction

00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:16.145
of the current that is induced.

00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:17.933
So the whole point of me showing you this,

00:04:17.933 --> 00:04:19.518
is that there's multiple ways to have

00:04:19.518 --> 00:04:22.342
a change in magnetic flux and there's

00:04:22.342 --> 00:04:26.019
multiple ways to induce a current.

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:28.173
And this one is particularly interesting

00:04:28.173 --> 00:04:30.977
because it lets you or we
can start to think about,

00:04:30.977 --> 00:04:35.193
wow, I could turn, I could
turn a mechanical rotation

00:04:35.193 --> 00:04:39.500
into an induced current and
this is, this basic principle

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.898
although they wouldn't use
such a simple loop like this,

00:04:41.898 --> 00:04:44.560
is exactly how electric generators work.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.534
They're actually, in some ways,

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:46.814
the reverse of an electric motor.

00:04:46.814 --> 00:04:48.847
An electric motor has a current

00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:50.452
that causes something to rotate.

00:04:50.452 --> 00:04:52.077
Here, we're having something rotate

00:04:52.077 --> 00:04:54.576
causing a current to
form and that's actually

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:56.647
what we have happening when you look

00:04:56.647 --> 00:04:58.660
at something like windmills or

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.285
when you look at hydroelectric generators.

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:02.255
Right over here, this windmill, the wind

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:05.164
is going to cause these
blades to turn around

00:05:05.164 --> 00:05:07.668
and then inside, inside
of this little place

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:11.914
right over here, you're going
to have a more fancy version

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:14.554
of this rotating which is
going to induce a current.

00:05:14.554 --> 00:05:16.870
The magnetic field isn't
going to be exactly like this.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.659
It's going to be a more
sophisticated mechanism

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:20.935
but it's the same underlying principle.

00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:22.743
It's just Faraday's law at work.

00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:24.754
Same thing with hydroelectric generator,

00:05:24.754 --> 00:05:26.400
you're using the potential energy

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.890
of the flowing water to turn an axle

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.983
and then that helps us
generate electricity

00:05:32.983 --> 00:05:36.335
by the exact same principle.
