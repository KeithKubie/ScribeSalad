00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.480
Michigan – a state surrounded by water – is drowning in controversy. For years, Nestle,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.469
the world's largest food and beverage
company, has bottled Michigan's water for

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.059
next to nothing and sold it at great
profit. Now, the state has greenlit the

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.440
company's request to pump even more,
despite widespread opposition.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.119
And all Nestle has to pay for these millions of gallons of water it gets a year is $200.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.920
And this, in a territory where Native
American tribes have treaty rights.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.300
There is a perception around the world that
Nestle goes into poor communities with

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.900
lax regulations, entices them with the
promise of jobs and then takes their

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.120
water, sells it back to them at a profit.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.760
We have to go where the water is at.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.340
What do you think Nestle should do?

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.520
Go home to Switzerland.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.640
We're walking up to see the White Pine
Springs well, where Nestle pumps 250

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.700
gallons of water a minute that it
bottles under its Ice Mountain brand.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.600
Despite massive opposition, Michigan has
just approved Nestle's request to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.710
increase that amount to 400 gallons of
water a minute. And all Nestle has to pay

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.030
for these millions of gallons of water
it gets a year is $200, which locals here

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.920
are furious about. John McClane has worked as a surveyor in this area for over 30

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.820
years. He and Peggy Case are members of
Michigan Citizens for Water

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.120
Conservation, an organization that's been
fighting Nestle for nearly two decades.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.860
So we're looking at Nestle's well over there.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.240
That's Nestle's White Spring well.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.380
And it's fenced off because obviously we
cannot even get close to it.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.080
You can get within 20 feet.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.460
Since 2005, Nestle has
extracted more than 3.4 billion gallons

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.630
of water from Michigan. The state doesn't
charge extraction fees for water like it

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.220
does for oil and gas. And because Nestle
owns this land, the company can take as

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.200
much water as it wants for a $200-a-year
permit fee *if* there's no harm to the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.460
environment. But locals here say the
damage is clear.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.820
Well, this is supposed to be the headwaters of Chippewa Creek.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.940
Where it starts.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.860
Where this Creek begins.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.940
According to Nestle, there should be
water here. Don't see much.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.300
In order to grant Nestle's request to pump 400 gallons per minute, the state required

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.110
the company to run its plan through a
computer model, which determined there

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.950
*would* be an adverse impact on the
environment. But Michigan's Department of

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.569
Environmental Quality, or DEQ, overruled
those findings, and instead relied on

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.980
data provided by Nestle to push the
permit through. The final hurdle was a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.420
public comment period, during which the
DEQ was flooded with more than 80,000

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.080
comments against Nestle's request, and
only 75 in favor. But they approved it anyway.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.380
Why are you opposed to what
Nestle is doing here?

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.600
Well, we're opposed to bottled water and we're opposed to privatizing water. They're taking the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.100
water, putting it in plastic bottles,
selling it outside of the watershed and

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.540
making a huge profit off of water that doesn't belong to them. The water belongs to the people.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.790
Locals we spoke to accuse Nestle of

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.100
trying to cover up traces of environmental
damage by offering to replace local

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.300
infrastructure, like this culvert, where
water markings show how levels have

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.140
dropped significantly over time.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.840
So the water used to be up that high, and now it’s this low?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.660
Yeah, two feet higher, which would have placed it up above the stones here.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.140
So you guys, Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation, made noise about how you can tell the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.480
water has gone down, and right away they
offered to replace the structures?

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.720
At the next public meeting, they made that offer.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.900
Do you want them to do that?

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.400
No.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.960
Why?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.380
Because it would destroy this evidence here.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.420
The fight for resources in this region
goes back centuries.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.570
Desmond Berry is a tribal citizen of the
Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.700
Chippewa Indians. A treaty dating back to
1836 gives the tribe rights to the land

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.060
and water in this area. The tribe spent
more than a year lobbying the DEQ against Nestle.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.630
Our treaty rights are
under threat by Nestle, a corporation

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.500
that proposes to withdraw groundwater at
unprecedented levels, which will have an

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.440
effect upon surface waters within our
treaty ceded territory where our way of

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.390
life is dependent upon access to those
treaty reserved resources such as

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.200
fisheries, such as wildlife, plants, animals.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.620
Have you seen that happen, so far?

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.800
We've seen that happen in this area
where we're standing right now, we should

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.140
probably be in knee-deep water, and we're not.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.320
And who's that fault for that?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.360
Nestle's that fault for that, because
about 2,000 yards behind us is their well.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.100
Nestle operates several well fields
across Osceola and Mecosta counties,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.270
including the White Pine Springs well.
Opponents say the surface waters of the

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.620
two local creeks and river are suffering
as a result. The water Nestle extracts

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.890
gets pumped to the small town of Evart
and then trucked to the Ice Mountain

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.640
factory in Stanwood, where it's bottled
and sold all over the Midwest.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.600
For years, critics have accused the company of exploiting

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.160
lax water laws in economically depressed areas.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.020
Jobs. That's what this tiny town of Evart had

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.070
hoped for. More than 44% of
residents here live below the poverty

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.520
line, but it's rich in water. And for over a decade, Nestle has been purchasing a lot of that water from two

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:45.160
of the town's municipal wells. City manager Zachary Szakacks credits Nestle for saving his town.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.100
How much water are they getting from this well?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.000
500 gallons per minute.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.720
And what are they paying for that?

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.320
$3.50 per thousand.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.580
That sounds like a good deal for Nestle.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.080
It's a great deal, but you just got to think of everything that Nestle has to do to get that water produced.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.620
They have to maintain this well. This well, to replace it, would be almost $1 million.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.460
Well, $1 million, one could argue, is a drop in the bucket compared to their profits worldwide and ...

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.240
Oh, it could be. It could be.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.080
So what is in it for the city of Evart, then?

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.320
The revenue we generate annually from them.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.100
How much is that?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.400
I just looked at the numbers for 2017, and basically we generated $313,000.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.060
Is that significant for a city like Evart?

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.280
Oh, it's major for a city like ours.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.700
Despite hopes, Nestle never built a
factory in Evart. The few jobs that exist

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.430
here are at the transfer station, where
water pumped from wells gets trucked to

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.530
the Ice Mountain plant in Stanwood – 40
minutes away. Instead, Nestle helped

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:46.780
finance things like new softball fields,
a state fairground and a new well.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.360
Did Nestle effectively buy out your town?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.960
No, not at all. Where do you come up with that?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.780
I mean, they've-

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:01.180
They have not bought out our town. All they're doing is purchasing spring water from us.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.960
It's frustrating. We're not like puppets.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.100
But Evart residents Maryann Borden and her daughter Rhonda feel differently.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:18.560
OK, they built new softball diamonds across the street from us. But we already had softball diamonds over

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.020
at the fairgrounds. I mean, the things that they say they have given us, and maybe they're a little nicer,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.100
but we already had those things.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:32.760
Maryann has lived in this home since 1953. Her two children grew up here, playing in this backyard creek.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.160
They claim they’ve witnessed noticable changes since Nestle came to town.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.500
What should be a coldwater stream where trout thrive is now warmer, narrower and more shallow.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.560
So what do you think is going on?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.700
Well, somebody is sucking the water out of my creek.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.900
And who do you think that somebody is?

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:58.360
I think that somebody is Nestle. And they'll say you can't prove that. However, they are the only large corporation

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:05.780
that is sucking water out of my stream by the millions of gallons that has moved into my township.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.539
Nestle agreed to speak to us at their Ice Mountain plant in Stanwood.

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:18.250
In 2016, the company reportedly sold more
than $343 million of Michigan

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.870
water under its Ice Mountain and Pure
Life labels. But that's just a fraction

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:29.060
of its worldwide footprint. Headquartered
in Switzerland, Nestle has over 8,500 brands in at least

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:35.520
80 countries. Arlene Anderson-Vincent is the natural resource manager for Nestle Waters North America.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.160
Why do you think there was so much local opposition to Nestle increasing their pumping there?

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.520
We have lots of strong partnerships with residents and local businesses and business leaders.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.800
I'm not sure how much local opposition there is.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.080
Well, I'll give you an example. We filmed a few people, several people I spoke to who were standing on

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.400
the side of the road and fishing trout.
And we'd say, "How's the fishing going?"

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.380
One man literally said, "Well, I don't catch as many thanks to Ice Mountain." What do you say to him?

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.880
The science just doesn't show that.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.640
I also received lots of pictures of people saying, "Look how healthy the trout streams are." So ...

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.640
So you're not concerned that the area's being depleted at all by Nestle's pumping?

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.960
I'm not concerned that the area’s being depleted.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.840
There's genuine concern among locals, who say, "Once Nestle starts pumping to 400

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.680
gallons a minute, our ecosystem here will suffer." What do you say to those people?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.440
The science does not show that. We are very confident in the science. We looked at it very conservatively.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.080
400 gallons a minute is a very conservative number, as to what that well could pump,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.760
without negatively impacting any of the ecosystems. We study the ecosystems, we study the streams.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.600
But Nestle’s science relies on subcontractors the company hires itself.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.160
Does Nestle believe that water is a fundamental human right?

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.560
Most definitely. It is a human right. It is most definitely a human right.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:12.400
There is a perception around the world that Nestle goes into poor communities with lax regulations,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.160
entices them with the promise of jobs and then takes their water, sells it back to them at a profit.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.600
How do you respond to that?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.520
I can't speak to the perception, per se, but from the science perspective, we have to go where the water is at.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.000
So a lot of times, those are going to be more rural areas, because that's where we have thick

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.480
aquifers. It's not heavily industrialized. So that's where, from a science perspective, why we're in this area,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.440
why we're at White Pine Springs and why we're in Stanwood.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:51.120
In 2016, bottled water surpassed soda for the first time, to become the number-one beverage in the U.S.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.080
Here in Michigan, just days after the state greenlit Nestle’s request to pump more

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.040
water, the governor announced Flint residents would no longer be receiving free bottled water.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.280
People we met in Flint called out the irony.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.760
Tax Nestle and give it to Flint!

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.240
That’s a slap in the face, that’s all I have to say. I mean, how would you feel if you had a $200 water

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.840
bill and a billion-dollar company was getting a billion dollars’ worth of product for free?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:30.000
Despite public outcry, Nestle’s presence in Michigan appears unstoppable.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.640
In the ideal scenario, what do you think Nestle should do?

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:39.440
Go home to Switzerland. I'm serious. Go home. We don't want bottled water here.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.680
And we don't want corporations taking the water and turning it into a profit. Period.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.500
Hey guys, it's Dena. We did a lot of coverage of water problems for this season on Direct From

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.480
From Cape Town, to Flint, to the Nestle story here. Check out the Direct From playlist
