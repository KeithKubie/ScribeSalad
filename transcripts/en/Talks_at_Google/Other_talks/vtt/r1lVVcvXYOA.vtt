00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.540
RYAN GERMICK: Welcome,
everybody.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.020
We are here today with
a bunch movie star

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.488
folk, so that's exciting.

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.210
SETH ROGEN: We just
got to ride a big

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.630
slide, so that's exciting.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.400
We weren't supposed
to, but we did it.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.580
RYAN GERMICK: Did you have
to sign a special waiver?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.750
SETH ROGEN: No, we
just jumped on.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.800
RYAN GERMICK: Wow.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.680
Do your own stunts.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.760
SETH ROGEN: The security
guy did not look

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.230
happy, but we did it.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.960
RYAN GERMICK: So we have Seth
Rogen here, Craig Robinson,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.570
Evan Goldberg.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.100
So give another round
of applause here.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.471
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:44.756
SETH ROGEN: Thank you.

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:47.720
RYAN GERMICK: So I'm sure you
guys know a lot about these

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.930
folks' credits, but I
want to show that I

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.910
read IMDB this morning.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.280
SETH ROGEN: Good.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.720
Perfect.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.360
RYAN GERMICK: So you, sir,
are in the new "Arrested

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.730
Development."

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.870
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, I did a
couple things in that.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.000
RYAN GERMICK: Awesome.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.800
And-- yes.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.055
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:00.730
SETH ROGEN: Thank you.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.120
RYAN GERMICK: And then, to
complete the trifecta of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.930
underrated TV shows, also
"Freaks and Geeks,"

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.019
"Undeclared."

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.810
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, I'm
in all of them.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.070
RYAN GERMICK: Fantastic.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.310
SETH ROGEN: I just wish I was
in "Veronica Mars," and I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.480
could round it out.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.030
RYAN GERMICK: You could
Kickstarter to get yourself

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.310
into "Veronica Mars."

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.150
SETH ROGEN: I could
get in there.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.720
Yeah.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.630
RYAN GERMICK: Cool.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.370
And then you've done
a bunch of stuff.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.610
I'm skipping you for
a second, Craig.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.680
My flow is mixed up.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.240
I apologize.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.360
CRAIG ROBINSON: Happens
all the time.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.420
EVAN GOLDBERG: Tell
me about it.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.800
RYAN GERMICK: We'll come back
to you in about 40 minutes.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.100
And you've done a bunch
of work with Evan--

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.840
"Superbad," "Knocked Up,"
"Green Hornet."

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.350
SETH ROGEN: Yes.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.510
EVAN GOLDBERG: I tend
to be around.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.310
SETH ROGEN: He's around.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.290
RYAN GERMICK: Yes,
he's around.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.520
But also, you wrote an episode
of "The Simpsons," which I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.250
thought was really cool.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.740
SETH ROGEN: We did write an
episode of "The Simpsons."

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.670
EVAN GOLDBERG: It
was thrilling.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460
RYAN GERMICK: And you were going
"Ali G" when you were,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.620
like, 14 years old.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.440
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, we were in
our early 20s, but we were

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.510
writers for "The Ali G Show"
when it was on HBO.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.980
I think we were 22 or
23 at the time.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.150
EVAN GOLDBERG: 23, I think.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.820
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, it
was a good job.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.740
EVAN GOLDBERG: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.120
SETH ROGEN: Yeah.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.030
It was fun.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.755
RYAN GERMICK: Craig, you just
wrapped up "The Office."

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:56.485
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yes.

00:01:56.485 --> 00:01:58.437
RYAN GERMICK: Like,
119 episodes or

00:01:58.437 --> 00:01:58.955
something like that.

00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:01.148
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:02.370
CRAIG ROBINSON: Oh, no.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.200
It was 200.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.070
The finale made it 200
or 201 or something.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.500
RYAN GERMICK: Wow.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.960
I'm going to--

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.870
SETH ROGEN: IMDB got
that one wrong.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.671
RYAN GERMICK: --send
a bug report to--

00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:12.580
can't rely on them.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.335
And "Hot Tub Time Machine."

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:14.060
SETH ROGEN: Oh, yeah.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.310
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yes, indeed.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.040
SETH ROGEN: They're making
another one.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.635
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, I heard
that's your next thing.

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:21.940
CRAIG ROBINSON: "Hot Tub 2" will
start filming on Tuesday.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.040
SETH ROGEN: So exciting.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.470
RYAN GERMICK: It must be tough
to do sequels to movies where

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.962
the space-time continuum
is disrupted.

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:33.120
CRAIG ROBINSON: Well, Josh Heald
wrote one, and he wrote

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.945
number two.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:35.710
And it's pretty cool.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.740
SETH ROGEN: It all continues
in a hot tub time universe.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.495
CRAIG ROBINSON: Exactly.

00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:41.750
SETH ROGEN: They actually make
most sequels, probably, out of

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.450
movies that mess with the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.110
space-time continuum, honestly.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.570
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah,
that's true.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.470
SETH ROGEN: Which makes
the least amount

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.435
of sense, but yeah.

00:02:46.435 --> 00:02:47.700
RYAN GERMICK: It gives you
a lot of flexibility.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.965
SETH ROGEN: It does.

00:02:48.965 --> 00:02:50.665
EVAN GOLDBERG: The ability to
rewrite history in a story

00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:52.030
means you can just cheat
as a writer.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.080
SETH ROGEN: Exactly.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.790
You're killing Hitler in
the second one, right?

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.770
CRAIG ROBINSON: That's
the goal.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.270
RYAN GERMICK: Good.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.650
If you're not killing Hitler--

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.765
SETH ROGEN: That would be
a great plot, though.

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:01.670
RYAN GERMICK: But I want to give
you credit also because

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.390
you're in the original "Arrested
Development," like

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.120
way back in the day.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.600
So that's pretty cool.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.540
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yes, yes.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.950
I was a security guard.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.200
RYAN GERMICK: At
Gengie's house.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.350
CRAIG ROBINSON: And I got to
audition for con man number

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.118
two or something.

00:03:14.118 --> 00:03:16.960
RYAN GERMICK: And did you
get it over Dr. Funke?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.630
I don't remember how
that wrapped up.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.750
CRAIG ROBINSON: Say again.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.880
RYAN GERMICK: Did you
get the part?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.065
CRAIG ROBINSON: Uh, no.

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:22.160
I don't know.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.690
I don't think so.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.744
RYAN GERMICK: They never
called you back.

00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:25.140
CRAIG ROBINSON: Never
called me back.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.390
RYAN GERMICK: Cool.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.090
Well, big movie coming out
this week, June 12.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.160
SETH ROGEN: June 12, yes.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.000
RYAN GERMICK: "This
is the End."

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.670
SETH ROGEN: "This is the End."

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.812
RYAN GERMICK: So go see it.

00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:35.940
Well, that's the point.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.820
That's why they're here.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.946
Not just to ride the slide.

00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:40.605
SETH ROGEN: I'm mostly here to
talk about Craig on "Arrested

00:03:40.605 --> 00:03:42.586
Development."

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:48.140
RYAN GERMICK: So what was-- no,
so the cast is awesome,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.530
besides the two of you.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.420
Do you make a cameo in
there somewhere?

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.310
Are you in the crowd scene?

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.655
EVAN GOLDBERG: If you look,
you'll see me somewhere.

00:03:52.655 --> 00:03:53.600
RYAN GERMICK: Usually
behind the scenes.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.770
EVAN GOLDBERG: Lurking
around in the back.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.280
RYAN GERMICK: Did you know
like camera was on?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.930
Or was it just like--

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.060
EVAN GOLDBERG: Yeah, Franco came
up to me one day and was

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.580
like, you've got to throw
yourself in the background, or

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.690
you're going to regret this.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.060
So I did.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.120
RYAN GERMICK: Hitchcock
moment.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.350
EVAN GOLDBERG: I tried to throw
myself in that hellhole,

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.930
but I did it with no shirt
because I thought it would be

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.240
funny for the crew.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.630
It kind of stood out as
a little weird, so

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.770
we had to cut me.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.520
So we threw me in on
another little bit.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.430
RYAN GERMICK: It would be really
disappointing if the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.450
DVD version--

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.339
oh, there's beeping.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.010
What's going on?

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.250
SETH ROGEN: I don't know.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.760
EVAN GOLDBERG: It's
going to blow.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.360
Throw it in the crowd!

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.240
SETH ROGEN: My girlfriend's
about to explode.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.560
RYAN GERMICK: As much as I'm
excited to be here, I'm not

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.190
comfortable with this.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.480
If you guys want to use this,
you can film the audience and

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.340
the back backstage,
if you'd like.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.980
It's open.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.010
And I think they can flip
to it at some point.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.280
CRAIG ROBINSON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.955
going down the slide.

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:37.230
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.610
And you guys got to wear Google
Glass a moment ago.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.750
SETH ROGEN: We did wear
Google Glass.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.720
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, that made
this whole trip worth it

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.010
immediately.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.610
SETH ROGEN: Yeah.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.460
RYAN GERMICK: It's the
least we could do.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.050
What did you do on
Google Glass?

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.690
EVAN GOLDBERG: I thought I
could watch a video, so I

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.340
thought I could pull up a
porno to make everyone

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.446
uncomfortable.

00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:51.830
But it doesn't do video yet.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.830
SETH ROGEN: Doesn't
do that yet.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.050
RYAN GERMICK: They're
working on it.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.110
SETH ROGEN: I honestly
thought we were

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.360
coming to YouPorn today.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.750
This was all a horrible
misunderstanding.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.270
RYAN GERMICK: This
is San Bruno.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.650
That's like somewhere
in the valley.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.900
SETH ROGEN: That's in
Chatsworth, I think.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.200
RYAN GERMICK: So "This is the
End" is a bit of a departure

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.970
for you guys in that it's like
a religious parable.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:16.580
SETH ROGEN: Yes.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.320
RYAN GERMICK: It's a very
moralistic tale.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.510
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, it's
a moral tale.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.950
Yeah, I think--

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.310
I mean, we're always
interested in

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.490
that kind of stuff.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.690
I think inherently, it's
interesting to us as people

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.235
who weren't raised to believe
that one day the devil is

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:38.680
going to destroy to learn that
a lot of people we know were

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.340
raised to think that was
going to happen.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.380
So it was just always something
that kind of

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.600
fascinated us, I think.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.780
And we one day just sat
down and thought,

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.650
what if they're right?

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.590
How would that go?

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.890
We'd be fucked.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.480
That's the first thing
I could tell you.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.350
And so that's kind of
where that idea came

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.746
from a little bit.

00:05:59.746 --> 00:06:01.700
RYAN GERMICK: And is
it a coincidence

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.760
that it's in Los Angeles?

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.250
Do you think that will be the
epicenter of the apocalypse.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.230
EVAN GOLDBERG: That or Vegas.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.870
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, that or
Vegas, or Chatsworth.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.670
RYAN GERMICK: Chatsworth?

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.240
EVAN GOLDBERG: Just California,
Southern

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.910
California.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.660
RYAN GERMICK: Craig, how did
they pitch this movie to you?

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.405
I mean, I figure these guys
are bouncing around-- it

00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:19.340
started as a short film.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.530
I want to talk about
it in a second.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.380
But at what point did they
come to you, and how

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.040
formulated was the idea?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.450
And how important--

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.060
did you get points
on the back end?

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.790
Did you have to edit down
the script yourself?

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.920
How did that work?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.990
What was your--

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.625
CRAIG ROBINSON: No points.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.520
RYAN GERMICK: I'm trying
to speak Hollywood.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.950
I'm doing what--

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.000
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, that
was good jargon.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.845
I like that.

00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:37.340
RYAN GERMICK: I'm better
with HTML.

00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.440
CRAIG ROBINSON: The guys, they
just approached me and said,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.360
this is what we're doing.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.940
It's crazy.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.050
And they were explaining
it to me, and we're

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.670
going to play ourselves.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.250
And I was just on board, because
it had been a while

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.640
since I'd worked with them.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.635
And I know we do good
stuff together.

00:06:58.635 --> 00:07:00.030
RYAN GERMICK: Cool.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:00.760
I agree.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.235
The movie's fun and a
religious parable.

00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:05.170
SETH ROGEN: A religious
parable.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.900
RYAN GERMICK: I got the talking
points from Tony.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:07.870
They wanted me to keep
repeating that.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.560
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, I'm sure that
was high on their list.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.430
Make sure you emphasize
the religious aspect.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.480
RYAN GERMICK: Really
emphasize that.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.926
SETH ROGEN: Kids love that.

00:07:15.926 --> 00:07:18.500
Speaks to YouTube's audience.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.810
RYAN GERMICK: So I listened
to the Nerdist

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.100
podcast you guys did.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.680
And I'm glad that the car ride
here was longer than the part

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.510
where it took you to get to
the annoying questions you

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.420
always get from every press
type of interview.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.160
SETH ROGEN: Oh, really?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.480
I can't even remember
saying that.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.600
Why, did you have some
of those questions?

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.290
RYAN GERMICK: I'd say mostly it
was that, because you said

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.980
that for "Guild Trip"--

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.160
another film you guys did--

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.920
people just wanted to ask you
about Barbra Streisand.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.175
What's Babs like?

00:07:44.175 --> 00:07:46.850
That's the whole entire
half of a sheet.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.790
SETH ROGEN: She's great.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.645
RYAN GERMICK: Let's see, I want
to ask-- just taking "The

00:07:50.645 --> 00:07:52.470
Guilt Trip" seriously for one
second, because I watched it

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:52.910
on the plane.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:53.720
I just got back from Chicago.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.700
And I woke up from a nap, and
it was playing on the plane.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.620
This is really two days ago.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.780
And I know in a movie where you
have a romantic partner,

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.300
you could potentially
get a girlfriend,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.330
boyfriend jealous, right?

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.040
SETH ROGEN: Yeah.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.980
RYAN GERMICK: Well, having
Barbra Streisand play your

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.860
mom, did that make your
mom jealous at all?

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.790
SETH ROGEN: I think it made my
mom psyched, like she was

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.080
getting portrayed by who all
Jewish women consider to be

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.500
the holy grail of people
portraying them.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.920
It'd be like if Brad Pitt
played me in a movie.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.670
It's be incredibly exciting.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.540
So after being around Barbra
Streisand, you realize every

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.409
Jewish woman models themselves
after her, like she's like the

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.666
monkey in "Outbreak" that
starts the virus.

00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:42.740
If they ever want to cure Jewish
neuroses, she has it in

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.610
her DNA somewhere, because
she's the cause of it, I

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.440
think, in a lot of ways.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.930
CRAIG ROBINSON: You know that's
going to be a headline.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.150
Seth Rogen compares
Barbra Streisand--

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.445
SETH ROGEN: To the "Outbreak"
monkey.

00:08:50.445 --> 00:08:50.730
Yeah.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.970
RYAN GERMICK: And the sub-line
is like "and cures Jewish

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:54.410
neuroses."

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.200
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, and cures
Jewish neuroses.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.020
That'd be good, though.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.940
SETH ROGEN: Plus
one, minus one.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.890
So this film is really
interesting.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.840
I mean, the conceit
it's hilarious.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.460
You guys probably know, you
saw the trailer, the

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.560
apocalypse, there's a house
party at James Franco's house.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.040
There's a lot of fancy
Hollywood folks.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.740
Some of them are topless.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.560
Some of them aren't.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.280
Some of them made the cut.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.370
Some of them didn't.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.190
And the apocalypse happens.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.920
Of course, there's a bromance
in there somewhere, as well,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.800
and a group dynamic
that is explored.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.660
But one thing that's really fun
is the meta level of so

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.120
many people playing
themselves.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.160
And sometimes, they play against
type, and sometimes

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.950
they play with type,
what you'd expect.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:30.720
Unpack that a little bit.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.230
What's funny about people
commenting on their personas

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.585
either in the affirmative
or negative?

00:09:36.585 --> 00:09:38.990
EVAN GOLDBERG: Everything's
funny about it.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.140
The actors really went
crazy with it.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.660
They were so excited, as Craig
said earlier, just to do this

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.500
weird thing where instead of
performing and then having

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.155
everyone comment, they did them
both at the same time.

00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:53.850
CRAIG ROBINSON: Another they
did was they took what we

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.965
truly wear every day and
made that our wardrobe.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:09:59.640
So it was like--

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.800
RYAN GERMICK: The "take your
panties off" shirt

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.485
that you had on?

00:10:01.485 --> 00:10:03.940
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yeah, they saw
me with that shirt on at a

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.030
party, and they were
like, great.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.805
We want to use that.

00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:10.055
SETH ROGEN: And the towel.

00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:10.640
He always has a towel.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.990
CRAIG ROBINSON: I always have
a towel, because I'm either

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.755
sweating or about to sweat.

00:10:14.755 --> 00:10:16.660
RYAN GERMICK: It's a good
place to be in.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.180
CRAIG ROBINSON: So yeah, they
wanted that much reality.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.730
So that part of our characters
is real.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.000
Like when I did the "Take
Your Panties Off"

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.560
song, that's real.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.860
I'm playing the piano
stuff from my act.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.520
And then there's other
things that were

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.980
just heightened versions--

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.935
a movie version where, like--

00:10:33.935 --> 00:10:35.130
SETH ROGEN: You wouldn't
let Aziz die.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.930
CRAIG ROBINSON: I wouldn't
let Aziz die.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.690
I would've at least reached
out for real.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.420
Stuff like that.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.010
RYAN GERMICK: You'd think,
like in the moment--

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:42.340
SETH ROGEN: You don't know.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:42.930
Yeah.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.560
CRAIG ROBINSON: I mean, but I
was really callous to him.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.820
It's too late for you.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:46.140
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.430
RYAN GERMICK: You've got to
establish rules for that.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.283
SETH ROGEN: You would have
pretended that maybe you

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:49.706
would've tried.

00:10:49.706 --> 00:10:50.956
CRAIG ROBINSON: No!

00:10:53.404 --> 00:10:55.610
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, I mean we've
only been fans of-- like, I

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.590
think "Seinfeld" is honestly
one of the

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.920
first things I noticed.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.510
My parents were big fans of "The
Garry Shandling Show,"

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:01.690
which was--

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:02.670
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah,
amazing show.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.160
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, which was
amazing, and really kind of--

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.900
RYAN GERMICK: And Judd Apatow
connection there.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.690
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, but the
original-- like, "Larry

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.640
Sanders Show" did it.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.320
But before that, "The Garry
Shandling Show" really was

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.025
like a dissected sitcom, like he
was aware of the fact that

00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:16.680
he was on a sitcom--

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.730
RYAN GERMICK: Go into the
audience, talk to the actors.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.350
SETH ROGEN: In the sitcom, he
would talk to the audience.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.540
And I remember--

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.970
I mean, I was a little kid
when that show was on.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.240
But even at that time, I
remember thinking, like, oh

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.010
wow, this is really original and
different than "Who's the

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.940
Boss" and the other stuff
that was on television.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:36.090
So I think we were always just
big fans of that type of

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.340
slight breaking of the fourth
wall type of comedy.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.660
Charlie Kaufman has done
it very well, I think.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.490
We just made it stupider.

That's the only thing.

00:11:48.394 --> 00:11:53.710
SETH ROGEN: So to go a meta
level deeper, in Hollywood--

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.450
so I wonder about this in the
software executive world.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.100
When someone goes on stage at a
big conference, do they have

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.010
a style consultant that tells
them to wear a black

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:01.875
turtleneck?

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:04.620
I mean, I wonder, because it's
like, is it appealing?

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.730
And I wonder, do you guys have--
is there an agent or a

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.590
best friend or a girlfriend or
something that tells you, you

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:12.540
should really work this angle.

always look so shitty is we

you'd better ask the publicist

SETH ROGEN: Not really.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.660
I mean, hopefully the movies
we've done just--

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.670
we really try to make the movies
appealing en masse to

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.440
the audiences.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.810
So ideally, you can just talk
about the movie for what it

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.880
is, and that will do the
manipulation for you.

up any certain angle.

the pot angle, we would just

we just try to represent the

represent ourselves for how we

are as smart or dumb a strategy
as that may be.

EVAN GOLDBERG: The only thing
we kind of play off of is

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.490
wherever we are is what we do.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.280

we were not getting

earlier, the movie started as

a short film in,
I think, 2007.

just kind of an idea

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.430
that spawned that would
be really fun to do?

Was there larger ambitions
there?

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.380
Just walk me through that.

he made it for one
of his projects.

And then we put it on
YouTube, actually.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.160
And it got a lot of attention.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.040
EVAN GOLDBERG: It got,
like, 180,000 hits.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.290
SETH ROGEN: Like very fast.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.505
It's funny, because it was
actually right when "Knocked

00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:31.920
Up" was coming out.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.200
We didn't know that people would
in any way be interested

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.000
in what we were doing
necessarily.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.890
So it was kind of a pleasant
surprise that we just put this

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.720
thing out there, and without
even realizing, expecting it,

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.280
it got quite a bit
of attention.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.230
And that's when we started to
think, oh, people actually

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.120
like this idea.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.800
Maybe there's something worth
revisiting about it.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.270
RYAN GERMICK: Man, cool.

lot of your friends,

It seems like a lot of fun, but
it's also a lot of work.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.730
I'm kind of curious about--

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.500
I know you hate this question,
so I'm not going to ask that

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.800
question, what's it like to
work with your friends?

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.290
But what's the other side?

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.320
What's the hard stuff
about it?

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.570

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.700
Do you feel like this,
for example--

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.720
I'm going to have a leading
question here.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.320
Do you think the studio looks at
you and says, hey, we gave

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:20.700
you all this money.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.000
You're just screwing around.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.140
You'd better make this movie.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.150
Or is it more like
pretty chill?

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.490
EVAN GOLDBERG: We specifically
have worked a situation with

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.900
the studio where we're like, how
much money will it be for

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.240
you just to never talk to us?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.145
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, basically.

00:16:31.145 --> 00:16:34.260
EVAN GOLDBERG: And the answer we
hoped would be $45 million.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.590
Turned out it was $31 million.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.270
SETH ROGEN: But that
was enough.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:41.400
And honestly, that's what we
really strive for more than

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.340
anything is autonomy
and just freedom.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.470
EVAN GOLDBERG: Because with our
comedy, if you don't go

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.540
past too far, then you're not
going to have gone far enough.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.910
If they have restraints on us,
they want certain things,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.040
it'll just mess up our style.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.240
SETH ROGEN: And if it's
not really risky--

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.850
like I think the movies we've
had the most success with are

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.220
the ones where as we're making
them, the whole time, we're

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.620
like, this could just
spectacularly go wrong.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.319
Like we literally, conceptually
might have done

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.020
something that people
just don't like.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.550
So that actually makes it more
fun, because you feel like

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.789
you're really taking a big
swing, and it's a big gamble.

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:15.760
The studio knows how hard
it is to do that.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.490
They make a lot of movies that
sometimes aren't as funny as

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.270
they hoped they would be.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.589
So I think they appreciate when
people actually are able

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.619
to make an audience
laugh a lot.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.430
And they put a lot in that.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.480
And they don't often pretend
they know how to do that

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.360
better than we do,
which is nice.

SETH ROGEN: Yeah, definitely.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.470
It needs to be almost a terrible
idea in order to be a

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.050
really good idea.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.170
CRAIG ROBINSON: These guys,
they mix these genres, so

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:08.480
they're becoming--

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.320
like "Pineapple Express" mixed
stoner with this action,

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.330
bloody stuff.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.940
And this one is apocalyptic with
comedy with supernatural

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.770
things going on.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.090
They're carving out
this niche.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:23.155
It's pretty special.

00:18:23.155 --> 00:18:23.660
RYAN GERMICK: I agree.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.210
EVAN GOLDBERG: Thank
you, Craig.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.890
RYAN GERMICK: It looks like
a $45 million movie.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.710
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, it does.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.846
Looks like we got
what we wanted.

00:18:30.846 --> 00:18:33.700
RYAN GERMICK: This is also a
foray into directing for you,

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:34.660
which is unusual, right, Seth?

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:34.750
Like you're--

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.100
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, we've
never directed

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.580
anything before, literally.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.600
RYAN GERMICK: So how was that?

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.090
How is that process different
from-- usually, you're very

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.715
involved as a writer,
producer.

00:18:42.715 --> 00:18:44.160
But director is kind
of another step.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.100
So what's up with that?

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.010
SETH ROGEN: It's a lot
of fun, honestly.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.710
Producing--

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.050
we keep saying--

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:50.990
directors are going
to hate us.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.510
Producing a movie is a lot
harder than directing a movie.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.940
EVAN GOLDBERG: Like
10 times harder.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.840
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, like getting
people to give you $31 million

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.650
is way harder than spending
$31 million.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.100
It's fun to spend $31 million.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.830
It takes years to convince
people to give you that money.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.960
EVAN GOLDBERG: And as the
writer, you're always

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.710
answering to people.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.330
As the producer, you're always
answering to people.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.890
As the director, everyone
answers to you, and you just

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:13.520
get to have the fun.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.410
SETH ROGEN: It's true.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.650
It was kind of a revelation.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.920
We were like, oh, wow.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.510
This is way more fun than the
other jobs we've been doing.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.930
So yeah, it was great.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.360
And in some ways, it was less
stressful than not directing

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.280
the movie, because as the
producer, we didn't have to

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.270
worry about what stupid shit the
director might do, because

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.210
we were the ones doing
the stupid shit.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.470
RYAN GERMICK: Craig, how'd
they do as directors?

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:39.480
CRAIG ROBINSON: They
were great.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.790
It was like being in the
basement with your friends,

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.770
and somebody's like,
I got a camera.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.746
And then let's do some
funny stuff.

00:19:47.746 --> 00:19:49.340
RYAN GERMICK: Did you realize
they were making

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.670
a film at the time?

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.480
CRAIG ROBINSON: I was
like, wait a minute.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.190
Is this a set?

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.140
But it was a lot of fun.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.850
And they took liberties.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.970
Like there was a drug sequence
in the film.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:06.580
And this didn't make the film,
but we recreated a Spider-Man

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.660
kind of thing, where Franco was
The Goblin, and he was on

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:12.075
a skateboard.

00:20:12.075 --> 00:20:13.380
EVAN GOLDBERG: And we got
his mask and shit.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.640
CRAIG ROBINSON: And Seth
was pushing him around.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.650
And he was goblining, and
McBride was Spider-Man.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.810
And I was behind him.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.660
I was Mary Jane.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.670
So yeah, we did these things.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.050
SETH ROGEN: Craig
was in a wig.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:28.820
CRAIG ROBINSON: A blond wig--

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.440
SETH ROGEN: He had
lipstick on.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.160
CRAIG ROBINSON: --and
red lipstick.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.880
EVAN GOLDBERG: Screaming,
help me, Spider-Man!

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.240
Save me!

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.260
RYAN GERMICK: So the cast--

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.888
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yeah,
that happened.

00:20:39.888 --> 00:20:41.040
SETH ROGEN: It's
fun to direct.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.180
RYAN GERMICK: Do you think
they'll just give you-- how

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.210
many millions can you get to
just put that out directly as

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.665
an entire feature film?

00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:46.750
EVAN GOLDBERG: Depends
how cool Marvel is.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.700
SETH ROGEN: I think we need
Marvel's permission for that.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.190
EVAN GOLDBERG: They're pretty
easy going, I hear.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.880
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yeah, I hear
they're cool with ecstasy use

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.906
in their characters.

00:20:54.906 --> 00:20:58.380
RYAN GERMICK: So amazing
cast to mention.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:03.550
You guys, Jay Baruchel, Danny
McBride, Jonah Hill, Emma

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:08.920
Watson, James Franco, Michael
Cera, Aziz Ansari, Rihanna.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.680
There's like a million funny,
interesting people.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.330
Who surprised you the most on
set as far as how far they

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.900
were willing to go with
lampooning themselves?

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.755
Or any diva moments?

00:21:23.755 --> 00:21:24.640
CRAIG ROBINSON: That's
a spoiler alert,

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.170
that one, isn't it?

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:25.830
RYAN GERMICK: Well, yeah.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.700
So without the spoiler.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.465
EVAN GOLDBERG: We
didn't really--

00:21:27.465 --> 00:21:28.150
SETH ROGEN: Michael Cera.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.100
EVAN GOLDBERG: I'd have
to say Michael Cera.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.970
SETH ROGEN: There's some cameos
in the movie that

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.640
actually aren't revealed in any
capacity, I think, that

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.330
people will be shocked to see.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.770
And we'd like to keep
it that way.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.460
But Michael Cera, everyone
knows he's in the movie.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.500
And what he did was
unbelievable.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.800
He plays a coked-out sexual
deviant, which the real

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.770
Michael Cera hasn't
been for years.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.660
EVAN GOLDBERG: I think he
might still be a virgin.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:57.040
SETH ROGEN: So yeah, it was
pretty amazing to see him do

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.310
that, because it was actually
scary at times.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.710
It got dark at times.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.930
EVAN GOLDBERG: It's crazy when
you have, like, 16 incredible

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.550
actors all watching him,
going, holy shit.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.230
This guy is going for it.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.160
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, everyone was
like, I can't believe he's

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:08.690
doing this.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.340
Yeah, it was pretty
unbelievable.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.360
EVAN GOLDBERG: He got
a lot standing

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.650
ovations from the crew.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:14.170
SETH ROGEN: They don't give out
Oscars for that type of

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:17.660
performance, but they
should consider it.

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.440
RYAN GERMICK: So it got dark.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.530
So is that stuff that
went off script?

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.430
Did you guys do a lot of
improv on the set?

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.220
How do you manage
that versus--

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.710
as a director and writer, you
probably have some feeling of

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.050
preciousness about
what you wrote.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.860
SETH ROGEN: Not at all.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.680
EVAN GOLDBERG: We create the
structure-- like literally, if

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.670
Craig figured out a better
ending while we were filming

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.145
it, we would have done that.

00:22:36.145 --> 00:22:38.250
SETH ROGEN: Like Franco kind
of came up with the end for

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:38.780
his character.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.700
We actually had another thing.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.560
And it was something he pitched,
and we were like,

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.320
yeah, we could do that.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.260
I mean, we really--

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.940
EVAN GOLDBERG: We can't deny
that all these guys, some of

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.870
them are better at our jobs
than we are in certain

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:48.390
capacities.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.520
Like Franco's directed way more
stuff than we ever had at

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.140
that point.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.300
And so we let them come in
and do what they can.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.050
And in the end, we think this
one was about 50-50.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.330
SETH ROGEN: The best
idea wins.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.510
CRAIG ROBINSON: There's a
lot of playfulness, too.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.600
Yeah, there's a structure.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.300
You've got the script
there and the set.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.310
And then you just--

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.290
you know you've got to
hit these beats.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.860
So you start to play
around it.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.120
But every scene, we got
to play in there.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.290
And it's always--

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:18.370
the in-the-moment stuff
usually wins.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.110
RYAN GERMICK: How do
you plan for play?

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.170
I mean, you're on a tight
schedule, right?

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:21.850
You've got so much money.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.350
You've got so much time.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.790
You kind of estimate this
shot's going to take

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.260
this long to shoot.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.250
But then do you put in, like,
x amount of buffer to say,

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.885
we're going to screw around
a little bit, too?

00:23:31.885 --> 00:23:34.460
EVAN GOLDBERG: Our first AD,
Jonathan Watson, might be the

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.240
greatest AD to ever live.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.210
And he just assessed how we
worked and figured it out.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.470
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, he'd worked
with us before.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.370
He did "Eastbound &amp; Down,"
also, which they do a

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.050
lot of improv on.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.120
And he would ask us sometimes.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:46.940
Sometimes, we would tell him.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.220
We would be like, this scene,
we know we're going to

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.290
really go off on.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.730
And I think he was actually
really great at just kind of

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.840
gauging on his own by who was in
the scenes and how many of

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.440
us were in them as to how
long we needed to shoot.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.180
And we finished right
on schedule.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.140
EVAN GOLDBERG: But every blue
moon, like the Milky Way food

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.390
scene, we did it.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.220
And then we came up with this
thing where Jonah had the gun.

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.000
And so we had to go back and
redo all the coverage of Seth,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.900
because we didn't know the gun
thing then, because we hadn't

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.950
figured it out yet.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.070
So that happened a few times.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.290
And when that happens, you can
get fucked over, because you

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.960
have a very small amount of time
in the day, and you have

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.970
to spend an extra 45 minutes
catching things because one

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.900
person just said one thing, and
it sent/ the whole thing

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.110
in another direction.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.260
SETH ROGEN: Sometimes, it's so
funny, you're just like, oh,

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.440
we've got to go back and cover
it on the other guys.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:30.730
Yeah.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.200
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, Jonah
Hill was really amazing.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.370
He did an awesome job
in this movie.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:37.635
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, he has a super
bizarre performance.

00:24:37.635 --> 00:24:40.630
RYAN GERMICK: He was one of
the only people who played

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:41.690
super nice [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.950
SETH ROGEN: Super nice.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.710
Yeah, that was his
idea, actually.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.390
And that kind of speaks to how
we developed the characters

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.950
with the guys.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.980
Like at first, we kind of knew
where we wanted his story to

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.530
end, which I won't ruin.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.435
But it's pretty--

00:24:52.435 --> 00:24:53.700
RYAN GERMICK: It's a dark,
ridiculous-- yeah.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.920
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, it ends
in a pretty dark way.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.220
So we kind of worked backward
from there.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.980
And at first, we wrote his
character as being kind of

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.250
like an aggressive asshole.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.740
And it was actually his idea.

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.460
It was like, I think it's more
interesting if I'm one of

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.500
those guys who acts super nice,
and you can't really

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.450
tell if I'm an asshole or not.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.410
And some people think I am, and
some people think I'm not.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.960
And it just turned into this
really bizarre performance.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.200
And he wears this giant diamond

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.410
earring, which is so strange.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.480
EVAN GOLDBERG: And there's
literally--

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.130
he was just like, I would
like to wear a

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.170
giant diamond earring.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.180
SETH ROGEN: We almost talked him
into actually piercing his

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.850
ear, which would've
been hilarious.

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:25.130
EVAN GOLDBERG: He should've.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:26.510
We lost a lot of time with
that thing falling off.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.010
SETH ROGEN: It's true.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:27.635
It kept falling off.

00:25:27.635 --> 00:25:30.580
We were like, ah, just
pierce it, dude.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.010
Yeah, I mean, the actors really
seemed to take some

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.680
kind of masochistic
joy in making

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.785
themselves look terrible.

00:25:36.785 --> 00:25:38.792
EVAN GOLDBERG: Jay said to me
in the middle of it, he was

00:25:38.792 --> 00:25:39.630
just like, this is crazy.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.780
He's like, I'm at work, I'm
getting a paycheck, and I'm

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.820
having free therapy.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.850
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, it's kind
of like therapy, because you

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.790
have actors, like Daniel Day
Lewis, like transform.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:50.210
But this is like an inward--

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.410
SETH ROGEN: Exactly.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.060
That's the real hard
place to look.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.240
[INAUDIBLE] looking
at yourself.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.510
EVAN GOLDBERG: Michael Cera was
Daniel Day Lewis-esque.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:58.430
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah,
I think so.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.440
I saw that.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.740
So there's definitely a running
theme of bromance in

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.130
your guys' work, to
use a phrase.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.686
Or just sort of male
camaraderie.

00:26:08.686 --> 00:26:10.540
EVAN GOLDBERG: I'd much prefer
if the world took male

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.330
camaraderie instead
of bromance.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:12.330
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.720
RYAN GERMICK: Sick
of bromance?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.970
Sick of that?

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.750
You mentioned earlier you guys
are writing and making movies

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.140
that are kind of like
where you're at.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.450
Is that something you think
you'll continue to work at?

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.190
What's interesting about male
camaraderie to you in a

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.270
narrative sense?

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.190
SETH ROGEN: For one thing, it
just seems to be something

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.220
that, until more recently, not
a lot of movies were about

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.920
that as much.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.370
Almost every comedy had some
sort of romantic story in it.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.060
EVAN GOLDBERG: Studios were
like, and the woman character?

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.460
Who's the love interest?

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.740
SETH ROGEN: Like "Ghostbusters,"
I

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.670
mean, all of them.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.980
It's kind of like, and then
there's this romantic story.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.510
RYAN GERMICK: Though it's pretty
cool when Sigourney

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.950
Weaver is like floating--

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:54.775
SETH ROGEN: No, it's a great.

00:26:54.775 --> 00:26:55.860
And I'm not saying it's bad.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.460
I'm just saying--

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.260
EVAN GOLDBERG: That's literally
probably our

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:57.630
favorite movie.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.120
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, it's probably
our favorite movie.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.910
But it just became such a
convention that it almost

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:04.600
started to feel obligatory,
whether or not it was organic

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.600
to the story you were trying
to tell or not.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.460
And often, we just found that
our movies, what we were

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.600
tending to write about, what
we were experiencing, was

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.830
these kind of relationships that
we were having with other

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.360
guys, not with women.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.290
And again, there are just so
many romantic comedies out

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.830
there that I think we also feel
like we didn't have a lot

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.910
to offer that genre.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.100
EVAN GOLDBERG: Like during the
earlier years of our lives, we

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.170
dated girls, and
they moved on.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.080
But our friends did not.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:34.740
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.860
EVAN GOLDBERG: And now
we're married.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.500
So who knows?

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.220
Maybe we'll write some hilarious
marriage comedies.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:43.210
But until now, we've been a
bunch of guys with girls who

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.220
come and go in our lives, but
the guys stay the same.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.410
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, and that seems
to be where the real

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.270
stories in our lives have felt
like they've come from.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.650
EVAN GOLDBERG: I also think that
women, in general, can

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.270
work with really, really
handsome men

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.370
whenever they want.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:56.010
We're just not--

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:56.780
SETH ROGEN: They just don't
want to work with us.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.925
EVAN GOLDBERG: Who would want
to stand around with these

00:27:57.925 --> 00:27:59.490
three guys all day when you
could be with Ben Affleck?

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.695
SETH ROGEN: Exactly.

00:28:00.695 --> 00:28:01.860
RYAN GERMICK: Like, Natalie,
I've got this

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.325
story idea for you.

00:28:03.325 --> 00:28:04.900
SETH ROGEN: Just aesthetically,
there's better

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.840
places to be.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.010
RYAN GERMICK: Craig, what kind
of movies would you like that

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.020
aren't out there?

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.370
CRAIG ROBINSON: What kind of
movies would I like to see?

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.640
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.470
These guys mentioned that they
saw the male camaraderie

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.550
dearth in Hollywood, and they're
filling that role.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.695
EVAN GOLDBERG: Well, you're
big into dragon movies.

00:28:18.695 --> 00:28:20.410
CRAIG ROBINSON: I was
in a dragon movie.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.540
EVAN GOLDBERG: Craig's in a
Korean movie called "Dragon

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.720
Wars" that everyone
should check out.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.546
SETH ROGEN: It's dope.

00:28:26.546 --> 00:28:28.740
CRAIG ROBINSON: I like
all that stuff, man.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.770
I like gangster comedies.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:31.840
Yeah, a gangster comedy.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.170
That would be fun.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:32.630
EVAN GOLDBERG: You
want to make one?

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:33.310
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.175
EVAN GOLDBERG: OK.

00:28:34.175 --> 00:28:35.730
SETH ROGEN: Like "Boyz n
the Hood" but funny?

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.190
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.210
See, another genre twist.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.870
SETH ROGEN: "Don't be a Menace
to South Central While

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.160
Drinking Your Juice
in the Hood."

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.040
EVAN GOLDBERG: That
was a great movie.

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.805
CRAIG ROBINSON: That
was very funny.

00:28:44.805 --> 00:28:46.230
SETH ROGEN: Wayans brothers.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.920
RYAN GERMICK: So at YouTube,
I mean, I have to ask--

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.340
I know you guys have
had amazing--

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.380
it's an honor to be
with you guys.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.430
You've got amazing success
doing your thing.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.400
It's really cool.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.650
At YouTube, I'm wondering, even
though you found this

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:02.460
huge success in the Hollywood
system, what do you think new

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.990
media has to offer, distribution
on the internet,

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.480
that kind of thing?

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.070
Do you look at that as a
place for possibility?

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.310
Are you worried about
the kids coming up?

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.682
They're going to take
your jobs, or what's

00:29:12.682 --> 00:29:13.370
the story with that?

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.050
SETH ROGEN: Yeah.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:16.880
It's interesting, honestly.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.875
EVAN GOLDBERG: We're learning.

00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:19.470
SETH ROGEN: We're learning
about it.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:24.830
We, honestly, are a little older
than I think a lot of

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.530
the people who are kind
of on the forefront

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.090
of this stuff are.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.860
But it is--

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:36.030
I mean, I do like the kind of
Darwinistic, slash, kind of

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.880
democratic nature of YouTube,
how anyone can put

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.800
anything out there.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.690
And just what people
like is the stuff

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.320
that people will watch.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.720
EVAN GOLDBERG: We're from
a socialist country.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.275
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:48.275 --> 00:29:49.170
We like that.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:53.110
Yeah, as Canadians, we approve
of that mentality.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.650
But honestly, it is just--

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.780
like we have friends that are
a lot better at it than we

00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:58.830
are, honestly.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.760
Like the Lonely Island guys are
brilliant with this stuff.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.560
And Sarah Silverman's really
great with it.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:07.600
So honestly, we're not by any
means the guys who are using

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.010
this to the best of
its potential.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.470
EVAN GOLDBERG: But we do
understand the potential's

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.230
massive and is the future.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.730
And if we don't figure
it out, we're fucked.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.500
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.350
So that's why we came
here today, and to

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.785
ride the slide, mostly.

00:30:18.785 --> 00:30:20.185
But that's the other reason.

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:20.770
CRAIG ROBINSON: It's amazing.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.310
It's launching careers
and all of that.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:24.050
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, man.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:24.425
We've hired people--

00:30:24.425 --> 00:30:25.440
CRAIG ROBINSON: Because it
levels the playing field.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.970
SETH ROGEN: --off YouTube,
basically, like Bo Burnham.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.760
We first saw his stuff
on YouTube.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.980
There's a lot of guys
who we saw--

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.860
Gerard Carmichael.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.830
I think we first were shown
his stand up on--

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.180
I mean, it's just a way
that people just,

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.200
hey, check this out.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.370
And we've literally put these
people in movies and stuff

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.120
like that based on it.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.610
So for us, it's helpful just as
people who are looking for

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:47.040
funny people to exploit.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.960
EVAN GOLDBERG: Yeah,
this movie--

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.960
"This is the End" would not have
happened if it wasn't for

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.000
YouTube because we
made the short.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:54.980
It wasn't quite good enough.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.380
It was about eight
minutes long.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.630
So Jason Stone, who directed
the short, reduced it to a

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.850
minute and a half trailer.

00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:02.032
And every now and then, someone
would be like, oh, I

00:31:02.032 --> 00:31:02.310
watched that.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.000
And it would remind
us of the movie.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.680
And it kept it in the forefronts
of our minds.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.140
And it wasn't for that, it
would've just been a short.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:07.570
Move on.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.226
We would have never thought
of it again, probably.

00:31:09.226 --> 00:31:11.790
RYAN GERMICK: So there's a mic
in the center of the room.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.380

here that might have some

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.460

she taught piano.

comic books, then eat our

00:36:39.987 --> 00:36:41.600
AUDIENCE: This question's
for Clay--

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.980
I mean, Craig.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.630
How did you get involved in
the "Dragon Wars" movie?

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.045
EVAN GOLDBERG: Yeah,
more "Dragon Wars."

00:36:48.045 --> 00:36:48.860
AUDIENCE: Somebody had to ask.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.250
RYAN GERMICK: Probably like 90%
of the people here have

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:50.870
seen this movie.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:52.190
SETH ROGEN: Have you
seen "Dragon Wars?"

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.760
EVAN GOLDBERG: Can we
see a show of hands?

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:53.680
AUDIENCE: Actually--

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.550
kind of funny story--

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.360
I walked into it because I was
really early or really late

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.580
for a movie, something
like that.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.720
I kind of walked and sat in
there, and I was like--

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.550
I was kind of in shock that it
actually became a movie.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.720
I mean, it was great.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.615
It was amazing.

00:37:06.615 --> 00:37:08.810
I think it's very underrated.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:09.880
But I'm just kind of--

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.300
I didn't even, honestly, until
I just looked back now,

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.780
realize that you were in it.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.230
But how did you get involved
in such a random movie?

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.320
CRAIG ROBINSON: Wait, so
you saw it for free.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.720
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:34.630
CRAIG ROBINSON: I was in a TV
show called "Lucky" on FX.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.825
And the casting director brought
me over to "Dragon

00:37:37.825 --> 00:37:41.620
Wars." They sent me this
trailer of this crazy--

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.695
these Korean War fighting
in these dragons

00:37:46.695 --> 00:37:49.880
and shit and snakes.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.530
It was amazing.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:52.750
It was like, Craig, you want
to be in this movie?

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:53.190
What?

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:55.000
Yes!

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.170
How?

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.660
So she brought me
in the audition.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.170
I got the part.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.550
And the Korean director is a
guy named Hyung-rae Shim.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:10.390
He is a big-time comedian
and legend in Korea.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:14.720
And he was directing now, and he
spoke very little English.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.090
And only thing I really
understood

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.460
him say was, action!

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.130
So he would say that.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:25.030
And then, like in the
movies we do, they

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.315
let the cameras roll.

00:38:26.315 --> 00:38:27.280
Or they're like, cut.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.340
Let's try it again.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.810
You do five, six, who knows
how many it takes.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.170
This dude did two takes.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:34.560
And I would be like, OK,
I'm going to set up.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.100
We'll do it again.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.770
They're like, OK, moving on.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:37.260
What?

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:37.750
Ah!

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.220
No!

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.170
So yeah, thanks for
bringing that up.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.170
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.670
That's all I had to ask.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.440
AUDIENCE: Hey guys.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.360
First off, Evan, Seth,
shabbat shalom.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:48.776
SETH ROGEN: Thank you.

00:38:48.776 --> 00:38:49.530
AUDIENCE: Shabbat shalom.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.230
Craig, you too.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.720
Shabbat shalom.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.680
CRAIG ROBINSON: Hey, man.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.152
I went to Israel for
birthrights.

00:38:55.152 --> 00:38:56.800
AUDIENCE: So I'm just curious.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.620
In the movie, which of the
characters shows the most

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.770
glimpses of them being exactly
like they are in real life.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.195
I really hope it's Jonah Hill.

00:39:05.195 --> 00:39:06.980
EVAN GOLDBERG: It
is Seth and Jay.

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.330
They just play super, super
stupid, less moral versions of

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.360
themselves.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.142
CRAIG ROBINSON: I think that
cheeseburger scene is as real

00:39:15.142 --> 00:39:16.290
as it gets.

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:17.480
You bite into that--

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.210
EVAN GOLDBERG: Yeah,
you're right.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:19.180
That is the most real moment.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.980
The first 10 minutes
are almost totally

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.430
realistic to life.

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.790
SETH ROGEN: So yeah, we kind of
anchor the movie slightly.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:28.240
Whatever anchor there is,
I think we provide.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.280
So yeah, I think me and Jay are
probably the closest to

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:30.795
our characters.

00:39:30.795 --> 00:39:31.810
AUDIENCE: Nice, nice.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:33.350
CRAIG ROBINSON: And then when
I sing "Take Your Panties

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:34.800
Off," that's real.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.760
EVAN GOLDBERG: That's some
Craig Robinson shit.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.270
AUDIENCE: It felt real.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.090
It felt very real.

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:38.695
Thanks, guys.

00:39:38.695 --> 00:39:39.370
SETH ROGEN: Thank you.

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.060
RYAN GERMICK: So we have
a few questions

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.000
from Twitter as well.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.377
SETH ROGEN: Great.

00:39:43.377 --> 00:39:44.640
CRAIG ROBINSON: Hello,
Twitter.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.700
EVAN GOLDBERG: I assumed we were
not to mention Twitter

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:47.210
while we were here.

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.980
RYAN GERMICK: They
bleep it out.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.800
SETH ROGEN: It's a symbiotic
relationship.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.160
RYAN GERMICK: It's like,
Google+ questions.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:40:00.751
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:00.751 --> 00:40:03.070
SETH ROGEN: Gmail had
a few questions.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.620
RYAN GERMICK: This is from--

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.500
this is all capitals.

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.300
I don't how this works out.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.610
EVAN GOLDBERG: You've
got to say it loud.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:10.690
RYAN GERMICK: Well, no, their
name is all capitals.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:15.150
SRV_JR asks-- this is
for you, Seth, but I

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.870
think everybody can--

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.370
what's your favorite movie that
you've been in so far?

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.800
I guess it's, like, I don't
know, favorite-- just

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.740
qualitatively and maybe
aesthetically fulfilling.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:25.490
I don't know.

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.395
CRAIG ROBINSON: "Dragon Wars."

00:40:26.395 --> 00:40:29.640
SETH ROGEN: "Dragon
Wars." Yeah.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.210
It's tough.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:31.650
I don't know.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.760
I really like "Observe and
Report," honestly.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.490
It's a totally insane movie.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:38.830
It's one of those movies--

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:40.530
I mean, I like this movie,
too, obviously.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:40.820
But I feel--

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:41.710
EVAN GOLDBERG: You should've
said "This is the End," Seth.

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.810
SETH ROGEN: I don't want to say
one of my own movies that

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.200
I wrote and directed.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.500
So I'll give Jody Hill some
credit. "Observe and Report."

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.580
Let's do that.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.350
Evan?

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.300
EVAN GOLDBERG: I like
"Pineapple Express."

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.030
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah,
that was awesome.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.940
EVAN GOLDBERG: It's just, I
can re-watch it again and

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.630
again, and it doesn't
make me bored.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.820
And most of the other movies,
I'd rather blow my brains out

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.200
than watch them again,
because I've seen

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.840
them all 5,000 times.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.062
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, I remember I
heard you guys say-- and you

00:41:06.062 --> 00:41:09.620
said, Seth, in the podcast you
never listen to or watch one

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.830
minute or one second of any
of the press, Seth,

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.040
that you've ever done.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:13.600
SETH ROGEN: No.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.870
RYAN GERMICK: So do you think
you'll be, like, 80 years old

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.790
and all this stuff will probably
just live on forever

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:23.985
somewhere, and going down memory
lane and jogging--

00:41:23.985 --> 00:41:25.470
SETH ROGEN: Watch myself
do press junkets.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:29.240
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, what do you
want to say to yourself 50

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:29.900
years from now?

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.710
CRAIG ROBINSON: Nice.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:32.430
SETH ROGEN: Nice.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.011
What do you want to
say, Craiggers?

00:41:34.011 --> 00:41:35.855
CRAIG ROBINSON: No, you first.

00:41:35.855 --> 00:41:36.810
SETH ROGEN: I don't know.

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:37.700
Hang in there, pal.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.125
If you're alive, then it's
a fucking miracle.

00:41:39.125 --> 00:41:41.728
That's what i want to say.

00:41:41.728 --> 00:41:44.560
It means you're 81, which
is pretty good.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.750
RYAN GERMICK: Craig, do
you watch this stuff?

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.760
When you do press stuff, do
you ever go back and give

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.400
yourself notes?

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.190
CRAIG ROBINSON: Eh.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.790
RYAN GERMICK: Little bit?

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.280
CRAIG ROBINSON: Very little--

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.620
I mean, not much nowadays.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.200
Matter of fact, no.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.680
I used to kind of see
stuff when it

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.240
first started happening.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.410
And then it gets twisted.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:06.880
Like I've read some articles
where it's

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.885
not even how I talk.

00:42:07.885 --> 00:42:10.000
And they twisted to
the words all up.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.880
RYAN GERMICK: Like old
English or something.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.450
CRAIG ROBINSON: What is
really going on here?

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:13.360
I did not say that.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.575
SETH ROGEN: I don't
use the word "ye."

00:42:16.575 --> 00:42:19.640
CRAIG ROBINSON: So yeah,
I don't do that.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.240
I just started watching
myself on screen.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.190
So I don't do that as much.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.340
EVAN GOLDBERG: Seth and
I have a good time.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:27.550
Every now and then, we'll go
onto IMDB under my name.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.630
It just says Evan Goldberg.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:32.030
And we directly shit talk back
to people who shit talk us.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:33.910
We haven't done it in years,
but that used to be fun.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.970
Just tackle the bad
press dead on.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:36.390
SETH ROGEN: Yeah.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:37.640
Antagonize people,

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.220
RYAN GERMICK: But it's just the
lowly commenters, right?

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:43.040
You don't actually
get to the--

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.980
the actual people writing
reviews, do you ever get to--

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.560
SETH ROGEN: On Twitter, I
respond to actual movie

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.830
critics and stuff like that.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:48.340
EVAN GOLDBERG: What is it?

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.240
Something called The Playlist
just said something

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:50.660
bad about our movie.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.120
So I said, you've broken
our hearts.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.155
We tried really hard, and you've
hurt our feelings.

00:42:55.155 --> 00:42:56.980
SETH ROGEN: It's true.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:58.270
We play the emotional card.

00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:59.680
EVAN GOLDBERG: Because if we're
like, fuck you, asshole,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.270
you guys suck--

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:00.920
RYAN GERMICK: It just
fuels the fire.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.050
EVAN GOLDBERG: --they're going
to be like, well, fuck you!

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:02.810
SETH ROGEN: We're just
like, why, man?

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.060
We tried so hard.

00:43:06.492 --> 00:43:09.790
I don't criticize the work
you try really hard on.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:14.765
I support it in the hopes that
it will improve one day.

00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:15.660
RYAN GERMICK: This should be--

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:20.550
I don't know if you can
use Tangicon's tweet

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.820
in your movie promotion.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.790
But it's a little bit
of a softball.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.880
Would you consider this
the "Avengers" of

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.850
comedy, this film?

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:30.820
EVAN GOLDBERG: We said that
all the time on set.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.780
We hope.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.380
I know it won't make the
same amount of money.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.700
But you know that shot in
"Avengers" where they go

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.530
around all of them, and they're
standing in a circle?

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:40.240
We tried that.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:42.490
We failed, because we're
shittier directors.

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.170
But we had that same
shot in our movie.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.560
SETH ROGEN: We had no
robots, though.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.310
EVAN GOLDBERG: We talked a lot
about how in "Avengers," when

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:49.840
all of them were together, was
the best part of the movie.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.530
And that kind of led us to try
to keep all six of our guys

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:55.788
together for every scene
that we could.

00:43:55.788 --> 00:43:58.160
RYAN GERMICK: I'm curious.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.930
What do you guys-- what's
your relationship--

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.560
we talked a little about
YouTube, but relationship to

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:02.860
technology, in general.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:06.500
You're sort of a nerd heaven
right now in Silicon Valley.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.970
You guys live down south,
presumably.

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.450
SETH ROGEN: We do.

00:44:09.450 --> 00:44:12.020
RYAN GERMICK: What gets you
excited about being up here?

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.510
Is there anything about
the future technology?

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.310
EVAN GOLDBERG: You guys
have dim sum that's

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:19.292
years ahead of ours.

00:44:19.292 --> 00:44:21.340
SETH ROGEN: It just makes us
realize how shitty all our

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.820
offices are more
than anything.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.540
EVAN GOLDBERG: Yeah, we had
"Rock Band," and we thought

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.225
that made us cool.

00:44:26.225 --> 00:44:27.500
SETH ROGEN: Oh, we
got an Xbox.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:28.560
Yeah.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.690
Twitter, they're like, we got
"Dance Dance Revolution." We

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.080
don't have that.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.440
Honestly, as far as promoting
the movies go, it's really

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.440
interesting, because I've seen
just in the years I've been

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:45.960
making movies a real shift as to
where the attention you get

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:53.020
is, where it comes from, and
how to communicate with the

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:56.120
people who are doing it and how
to just get the message of

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:57.260
your movie out there.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.550
It used to be about doing press
junkets where you talk

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:01.980
to "Access Hollywood" and
"Entertainment Tonight."

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.500
And now we still
do that stuff.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.610
I don't know if it's useful
or not, but we do.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:09.270
But to me, this kind of stuff
is really the type of thing

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.850
that seems like it's going in
the direction of where the

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:14.030
stuff will be going more.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.890
People spend a lot
more time online.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:21.490
The regular peoples' opinions,
I think, infiltrate the

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.880
marketplace a lot more with
Twitter and Facebook

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.690
and stuff like that.

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:26.850
EVAN GOLDBERG: Which
is way less boring,

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.560
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, which is kind
of better in a lot of

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.610
ways, because honestly, that's
who we make movies for.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:34.090
Often, people in the film
community are actually the

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.440
last people that we are making
these movies for.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:40.310
We're making them for people
who are far from that.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.170
And so it's actually--

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.490
it's really amazing, and it's
cool just to come to these

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:47.830
companies and see--

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.790
I mean, these are some of the
biggest, most successful, new,

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.170
young companies on the planet.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:55.590
So it's just neat seeing, just
on a visceral level, how they

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.670
work on a day-to-day basis.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.320
CRAIG ROBINSON: And
it's so much--

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.185
I'm addicted to the
technology.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:08.410
All the sites, like Facebook
and YouTube and--

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:09.750
I don't even know what
else is out there.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.400
So a girl came up to
me the other day,

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.230
you're not on Tumblr?

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.810
And I'm like, what?

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.980
I don't even know what--

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:15.650
why?

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:16.060
Is it--

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.170
RYAN GERMICK: You guys have to
bleep all these out, right?

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:19.420
CRAIG ROBINSON: You're
not on Google+?

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:31.390
But it all comes down to
the human part, like we

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.480
were doing a tour.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:36.510
And I guess you all got the
slide here and then the sleep

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.800
chair, right?

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.970
Who's been in the nap chair?

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:40.686
Come on.

00:46:40.686 --> 00:46:42.070
Yeah?

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:43.440
EVAN GOLDBERG: I thought it'd
be like a shame thing, where

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.990
no one ever uses it.

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:46.510
RYAN GERMICK: You have
to book it, I think.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:47.660
I think you can reserve it.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.350
CRAIG ROBINSON: But
they said that--

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:50.105
SETH ROGEN: I think the security
guard kicked you out

00:46:50.105 --> 00:46:50.780
of the nap chair.

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:51.960
CRAIG ROBINSON: Oh, he's getting
in the crowd now.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.530
Who's been in the nap chair?

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.380
Who's been in the nap chair?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:54.635 --> 00:46:57.100
CRAIG ROBINSON: --now
the camera's on you.

00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.870
But they were saying that you
all believe the best ideas

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:04.710
come between sleep and being
awake, like that moment.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.110
So that was really interesting
to me.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:07.490
So I will have to start--

00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:08.340
RYAN GERMICK: Napping more?

CRAIG ROBINSON: --keeping a
Dictaphone near my bed.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.535
Yes, I said Dictaphone.

You all don't even know
what that is.

with Google [INAUDIBLE].

about you, Evan?

do for you?

we do better?

EVAN GOLDBERG: I don't know.

They kind of covered all
the things that are

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:36.380
out there right now.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.380
RYAN GERMICK: Dictaphone was
on the tip of your tongue?

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:39.480
SETH ROGEN: You guys
seen Dictaphones?

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:40.680
EVAN GOLDBERG: Smaller
Dictaphones.

Smaller Dictaphones.

RYAN GERMICK: Less intimidating
Dictaphones.

EVAN GOLDBERG: Dictaphone
glasses.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:52.191
RYAN GERMICK: So what's
next for you guys?

00:47:52.191 --> 00:47:53.895
You guys, you got married.

00:47:53.895 --> 00:47:55.890
EVAN GOLDBERG: We got
married, yeah.

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:57.845
RYAN GERMICK: How long is it
going to take you to process

00:47:57.845 --> 00:48:00.260
the marriage stuff until
you've got a

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:01.080
movie out of that?

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.520
EVAN GOLDBERG: We both should've
proposed about a

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.510
year or two earlier
than we did, so--

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:06.790
SETH ROGEN: We've had a
long time to process

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:07.950
this marriage stuff.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:09.380
We started writing a movie--

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.150
yeah, we started kind of kicking
around an idea about

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.070
people getting married
and engagement and

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.300
that type of stuff.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:18.180
So yeah, there's usually a
couple-year gestation period,

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.280
I guess, that it takes.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.715
But yeah, we've started
kicking it around.

00:48:21.715 --> 00:48:23.740
EVAN GOLDBERG: And we just
finished filming a movie

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:27.450
that's kind of on the same
point, the next step in our

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.390
maturing, which is--

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:29.150
SETH ROGEN: I play a father.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:30.095
EVAN GOLDBERG: He's
a father with Rose

00:48:30.095 --> 00:48:30.870
Byrne, who's his wife.

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.175
And they have a six month--
year old daughter.

00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:35.270
And Zac Efron moves in next
door with his frat.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:36.020
And they go to war.

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:40.380
So we're literally bridging our
generational gap ourselves

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.650
through our movies.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:42.480
It's all free therapy.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.230
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.706
It sounds good.

CRAIG ROBINSON: "Dragon
Wars" 2 and 3.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.980
I've got a movie coming out June
7, Friday before "This is

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.950
the End." It's called
"Rapture-Palooza." It's set

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:01.000
two years into the rapture--

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.420
SETH ROGEN: You have two rapture
movies [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.880
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yeah,
two apocalyptic

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:05.440
movies five days apart.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.725
RYAN GERMICK: That's a
great double feature.

00:49:06.725 --> 00:49:07.290

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.180
RYAN GERMICK: Kind of
a bummer, but--

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.550
CRAIG ROBINSON: And
the Antichrist has

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.260
taken over the world.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.460
And I play the Antichrist.

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:14.850
Yep.

CRAIG ROBINSON: And I fall in
love with Anna Kendrick and

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.080
really want to sleep with her.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.426
And then hilarity ensues.

00:49:23.426 --> 00:49:25.040

that leaves many questions.

out and rush to the

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:42.370
Did you like it?

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.110
RYAN GERMICK: I liked it.

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.920
I love the meta stuff, so like
the Larry Sanders stuff.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.660
And I would want to--

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:50.530
we were talking earlier--
like, drill deeper.

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.980
I want to see you talking with
your agent about, we're going

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.560
to make this movie
about ourselves.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.450
So to see where it kind of
collapses on itself.

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:57.850
SETH ROGEN: That would
be very meta.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.420
I mean, I think it's a
truly original movie.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:05.900
I can honestly say there's no
movie like it, which is not

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.950
something that you see a lot
of in Hollywood, I think.

00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:10.765
And it just destroys.

00:50:10.765 --> 00:50:12.910
EVAN GOLDBERG: Yeah, I think
it's gotten the most laughs

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.530
per minute of any movie
we've made.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.560
SETH ROGEN: Yeah, I think in the
theater, it plays better,

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.310
honestly, than any of our
other movies ever have.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:20.230
RYAN GERMICK: It's
a big movie.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:21.750
There's a lot of big
stuff going on.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:22.515
EVAN GOLDBERG: Michael Cera.

00:50:22.515 --> 00:50:23.080
CRAIG ROBINSON: Michael Cera.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.500
EVAN GOLDBERG: People got to see
what this guy does. it's

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:24.860
fucking crazy.

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:27.240
RYAN GERMICK: And so when he's
impaled, at that point, you

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.910
can go and get popcorn, because
it's sort of like

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:29.000
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.360
EVAN GOLDBERG: No, you need that
app that tells you when.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.860
We should find out what moment
they've deduced.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.720
There's an app that tells you
when to go to the washroom.

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.910
SETH ROGEN: It's probably in the
montage where we're bored.

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.630
RYAN GERMICK: When it gets all
new wave for a second.

00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.610
SETH ROGEN: The bored montage.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.000
RYAN GERMICK: What
about you, Craig?

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.880
Give us your best pitch here.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.100
CRAIG ROBINSON: I do a duet
with Rihanna in the movie.

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:54.900
RYAN GERMICK: That's true.

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.255
SETH ROGEN: That's true.

00:50:55.255 --> 00:50:56.445
EVAN GOLDBERG: To "Take
Your Panties Off"

00:50:56.445 --> 00:50:57.420
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yes, to "Take
Your Panties Off."

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.050
RYAN GERMICK: And you do a duet
with Snoop Dogg on the

00:50:59.050 --> 00:50:59.820
soundtrack.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.770
CRAIG ROBINSON: Yes,
Snoop Dogg--

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.130
Snoop Lion.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:06.690
We did a remix to "Take
Your Panties Off."

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:10.001
And it's out now.

00:51:10.001 --> 00:51:11.800
EVAN GOLDBERG: You can make love
to the song right now.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.240
CRAIG ROBINSON: It'll be
on the soundtrack.

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.090
Yeah, we did it pretty
much for this movie.

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:18.610
I don't even know how
that came about.

00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:19.590
[INAUDIBLE], I guess.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:20.385
SETH ROGEN: It was
our dumb idea.

00:51:20.385 --> 00:51:22.020
EVAN GOLDBERG: It was
our dumb idea.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.580
CRAIG ROBINSON: And first--

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.430
I mean, yeah, and they
made it happen.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.190
And we went in the studio
with Snoop Dogg.

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:31.335
I've never been higher
in my life.

00:51:31.335 --> 00:51:32.445
RYAN GERMICK: Just
from contact?

00:51:32.445 --> 00:51:33.100
Just like--

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:33.770
EVAN GOLDBERG: No.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:34.390
SETH ROGEN: No.

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.590
CRAIG ROBINSON: No.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.982
I participated.

00:51:38.982 --> 00:51:41.570
SETH ROGEN: Ferocious
direct intake.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.980
EVAN GOLDBERG: But all the
legends, Snoop Lion is the

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.710
legend that he is.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:45.240
It's true.

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:47.790
CRAIG ROBINSON: He's a very
wise leader, that he is.

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:50.510
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, and like a
Pop Warner football coach.

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:51.410
He's a grounded individual.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:53.320
EVAN GOLDBERG: Yeah, the only
time he seemed upset with me

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.610
the whole time was he asked
if I like to go for walks.

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.110
And I said, not really.

00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:00.030
And he's like a very-- he's a
dad and likes to go for walks.

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:01.230
And every now and then, he
comes and gets stoned and

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:02.600
makes an incredible song.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.360
RYAN GERMICK: Cool.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.005
Well, you guys made an
incredible movie.

00:52:05.005 --> 00:52:05.810
SETH ROGEN: Thank you.

00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.330
RYAN GERMICK: Everybody should
go out and see it.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.720
June 12, "This is the End."
But it's more of like a

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.080
quarter period for you guys.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:12.720
You're going to keep going.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.470
EVAN GOLDBERG: This is
just the beginning.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.850
SETH ROGEN: We keep going.

00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:15.470
RYAN GERMICK: When you're
80, you'll making the

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:16.120
80-year-old--

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.000
EVAN GOLDBERG: We're not
living that long.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:18.716
Keep saying that.

00:52:18.716 --> 00:52:21.065
CRAIG ROBINSON: Hi,
80-year-old Craig.

00:52:21.065 --> 00:52:22.410
RYAN GERMICK: Cool.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:23.980
Well, again, it's a real
pleasure and honor to speak

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:24.770
with you guys.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:25.690
Thanks so much for coming.

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:26.320
EVAN GOLDBERG: Thanks
for having us.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:26.950
CRAIG ROBINSON: Thank you all.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:27.948
EVAN GOLDBERG: Thanks, guys.

00:52:27.948 --> 00:52:37.928
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:37.928 --> 00:53:01.830
