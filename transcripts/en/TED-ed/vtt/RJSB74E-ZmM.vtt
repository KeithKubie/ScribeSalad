00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:07.198
We're already seeing now

00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:09.581
that people in companies

00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:14.099
who try to specialize too much into one job description

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.751
are limiting themselves ultimately.

00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:19.647
So, the more you can learn,

00:00:19.647 --> 00:00:21.946
the easier it is for you to learn new things,

00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:25.320
to acclimate to changing environments and adapt,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.639
the better you'll be.
