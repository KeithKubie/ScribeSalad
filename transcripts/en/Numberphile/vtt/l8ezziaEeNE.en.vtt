00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.310
DR. JAMES GRIME: So another
prime-generating formula is

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.800
actually the most important
one of all.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.020
It's called the prime
number theorem.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.480
So let me write it out.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.630
I think it deserves
being written out.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.920
Really important result
in mathematics.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.730
It's so important that you
can refer to by its TLA.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.570
You can refer to it by its
three-letter acronym.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.180
Just call it PNT.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.560
People know what PNT is.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.660
It's the prime number theorem.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.250
It's that important.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.240
And the prime number theorem is
about how many primes are

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.470
there, less than a number n.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.980
So how many primes are there
less than a billion?

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.270
Something like that.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.060
And so the formula says
that the number of

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.150
primes less than n--

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.250
well, the symbol for
that is pi of n.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.990
Now, don't be confused.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.490
This pi is not 3.14.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.800
It's nothing to do with pi.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.690
We've reused the symbol
for something else.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.510
So it's P for prime.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.020
So the number of primes
less than n.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.735
And this is approximately n
divided by natural log of n.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:08.500
A couple of things to say,
because some of you won't be

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.980
familiar with that
natural log of n.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.050
Some of you will.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.170
But for the ones who aren't
familiar, I'll try and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.790
quickly show you.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.130
It's just a function.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.350
You could call it--
it's just a thing.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.480
Any number-- you
pick a number.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.960
Any number, like n, can be
written this way, as e to the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.790
power x.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.140
e is another constant.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.840
It's 2 point--

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.630
I never remember what it is.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.940
718, something, something,
something.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.490
So any number can be written
in that way.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.920
It's 2.718 to the power
of something.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.320
And the log of n is this bit.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.910
It's x.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.530
It's the power.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.680
So that's what a log is.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.350
If I plot log of x, it
looks like this.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.050
This is actually growing,
but it grows

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.870
really, really slowly.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.790
I think the log of
1 billion is 21.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.990
So you put in a big number, and
you're actually getting a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.020
very small number out.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.180
It's always getting bigger.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.789
It's actually tending
to infinity.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.930
One more thing to say--

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.500
this twiddle is a new
symbol to you.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.170
Tilde--

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.600
or twiddles, as I like
to call it--

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.370
it's a new symbol.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.220
What it means is if you divide
those two things--

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.550
so I'm going to divide
them, like that.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.780
If you divide those two things,
that's tending to 1 as

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.710
n gets bigger.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.750
That's what it means.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.990
It's slightly technical.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.110
You can say approximately
equal to, if

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.510
you're happy with that.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.380
But that has a proper meaning.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.800
So what it's told us
is it tells us

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.900
how many, on average--

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.940
it gives an approximation, at
least-- of how many primes we

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.700
can expect less than
a number--

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.230
1 billion, 10 billion,
a googol.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.070
But we can then get some
results from that.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.420
That means that the proportion
of prime numbers is-- well, if

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.895
we divide by n, the proportion
of primes less than n is 1

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:07.900
over log n.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.180
So if we're talking 1 billion,
I said the log of

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.120
1 billion was 21.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.210
So the proportion of
primes is 1/21.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.810
It's like 5%.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.250
5% of numbers less than
1 billion are prime.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.220
You can call it a probability
if you want.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.350
If I picked a number at random,
what's the probability

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.550
that it's going to be
a prime number?

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.240
It's 5%.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.920
What does it mean?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.040
It does mean that the prime
numbers are getting rarer,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.060
more spaced out, as the
numbers get bigger.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.370
So this proportion is
getting smaller.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.330
The gaps--

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.690
we can write the
gaps, as well.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:52.360
The average gap between primes
is now equal to log of n.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.580
So if n was 1 billion again--
let's stick with that--

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.200
it turns out the average gap
between the primes is 21.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.930
Some have bigger gaps.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.050
Some have smaller gaps.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.470
Some are twin primes.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.040
But the average gap is 21.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.370
BRADY HARAN: Let me give
you a number, and you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.720
give me all the stats.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.660
I'll give you a number.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:20.269
Give me the state of the nation
for the first 5 and 1/2

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.860
billion numbers.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.940
DR. JAMES GRIME: 5
and 1/2 billion--

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.555
5 and 1/2 billion is this.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.570
So 1 billion has nine 0's.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.970
So this is 5 and 1/2 billion.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.590
We're going to take the log
of that, the natural log.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.670
What have we got?

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.820
22.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.806
BRADY HARAN: 22.4.

00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:40.635
DR. JAMES GRIME: 22.4.

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:42.290
BRADY HARAN: So what
do you now know?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.650
DR. JAMES GRIME: So I know that
the proportion of primes

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.060
less than 5 and 1/2
billion is 1/22.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.660
Again, it's just like--

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.510
well, let's see.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.410
Is it 4%?

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.860
Let's see if we can do it.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.940
Yeah, so about 4% of numbers
less than 5 and

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.860
1/2 billion are prime.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:08.390
The average gap is about
22.4, 22, 23.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.630
So that's a lot of
information.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.340
And then one more thing, then.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.340
One more thing we can
learn from this--

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.730
our prime number formula.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.250
The n-th prime twiddles,
or is approximately,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.140
n lots of log n.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.230
So you might see where
this comes from.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.590
If the average gap is log n, and
you want to know the n-th

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.380
prime, you can multiply by n.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.280
You add the gaps all together.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.960
The n-th prime is approximately
n log n.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.600
Which means 5 and 1/2 billion,
the 5 billionth, 500 million

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.580
da-da-da-da-da prime is--

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.070
it actually gets better
results the

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.790
bigger the number is.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.580
So it helps you find--

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.610
but it is an approximation,
rather than those formulas,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.800
the prime number formula
giving ones.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.970
One more thing I wanted
to say about this--

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.450
this average gap we've
discovered, which is log n--

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.340
and I said it was an average.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.700
So sometimes you get
bigger than that.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.400
Sometimes you get
a twin prime.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.430
You make an average of
it, you get log n.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.490
The gaps do have
bounds on them.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.580
You can't go as big
as you like.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.400
There's actually a little--

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.675
it's called Bertrand's
postulate.

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:27.460
And it says if you pick any
number-- let's pick the number

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.320
n-- he said that there will be
a prime that is bigger than n

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.130
and smaller than 2n.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.300
So you can't have a gap
that is too big.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.080
There's a little
rhyme for this.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.740
The rhyme is, "Chebyshev said
it, and I'll say it again,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.560
there's always a prime between n
and 2n." And if you put n as

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.190
a prime instead--

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.170
let's take it as the
n-th prime--

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.830
then the next prime you're
looking for has to be

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.650
sandwiched between prime
and 2 times the prime.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:03.000
Let's pick a prime.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.750
Prime's the nice version
to do it in.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.372
Well, pick a prime.

00:07:07.372 --> 00:07:07.770
BRADY HARAN: 11?

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.600
DR. JAMES GRIME: 11's fine.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.560
Right, so let's have 11.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.670
All it's telling you is that
you're guaranteed to have a

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:18.390
prime between 11 and
22, which is true.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.550
So your gaps can't
get too big.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.260
For primes over 100, you
can do better than 2.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.930
That can actually shrink
down to 1.2.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.390
So that gives you quite
a narrow gap.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.680
So that just means that the
primes can't have very, very,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.510
very long gaps between them.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.080
So they're quite regular.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.410
Primes are always turning up.

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.040
They're fairly regular.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.250
And there's infinitely
many of them.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.400
But they're like weeds.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.460
They're always popping up.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.300
You can't get rid of them.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.240
There's another prime.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.140
You don't go for too long
without another

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.310
prime popping up.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.980
BRADY HARAN: Surely when we
get up into sort of the

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.365
Graham's numbers of the
world, those weeds

00:07:58.365 --> 00:08:00.330
become a bit more sparse.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.840
DR. JAMES GRIME: They
become spaced out.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.360
But proportionally, compared
to the size of numbers that

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.790
you're using, the proportion is
actually very, very tiny.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.330
In absolute terms, they're
really spaced out.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.310
But as a proportion to these
huge numbers we're talking

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.380
about, they're close.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.570
This prime number formula is
actually the easy version of

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:28.900
the prime number formula.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.960
There's more sophisticated
versions of this.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.390
They look the same, but they've
added on extra terms.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.740
And so you can see that the
error is sort of zigzagging

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:39.990
around 0-ish.
