00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.520
In the last video, we had
set up the definite integral

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.060
to evaluate the volume of
this upside-down gumdrop

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.159
truffle-looking thing.

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:09.700
So now in this video,
we can actually

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.310
evaluate the definite integral.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.810
So what we need to
do is really just

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.132
expand out this expression, this
square root of y plus 1 plus 2.

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:17.840
So let's do that.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.440
So this is going to be equal to
pi times the definite integral

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.200
from y is equal to negative
1 to y is equal to 3.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.210
If you expand this out,
you get square root of y

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.005
plus 1 squared, which is
just going to be y plus 1.

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.380
And then you're going to have
2 times the product of both

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.005
of these terms.

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.910
2 times 2 times square
root of y plus 1

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.940
is going to be plus 4 times
the square root of y plus 1.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.660
And then you have 2
squared, so plus 4.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.170
So you have this
whole thing times dy.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.440
We can simplify a little bit.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.990
You have a 1 plus a 4.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.322
We can add the 1 to
the 4 and get a 5.

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.280
And now we're ready to
take the antiderivative.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.430
So this is going to be
equal to pi times-- let's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.790
take the antiderivative of all
of this business-- pi times--

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.129
and I'll color code it.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.250
The antiderivative of y
is just y squared over 2.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.880
The antiderivative of
4 times the square root

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.400
of y plus 1-- you
just really have

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.090
to think of it as 4 times
y plus 1 to the 1/2 power.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.720
We could use u
substitution explicitly,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.595
but you probably are
pretty practiced in this

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:23.803
and can do this in your head.

00:01:23.803 --> 00:01:25.590
You have y plus 1
raised to the 1/2 power.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.220
Derivative of y
plus 1 is just 1,

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.740
which is essentially out here.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.810
So if you did u
substitution, you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.770
would say u is
equal to y plus 1.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.020
But this antiderivative is
going to be equal to-- well,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.740
if you increment
this exponent, you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.430
get 3/2 multiplied by
the reciprocal 2/3.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.490
2/3 times 4 is 8/3.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.560
So it's plus 8/3 times
y plus 1 to the 3/2.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.602
And you can verify.

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:54.060
If you take the
derivative here you

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.340
will get this expression
right over here.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550
3/2 times 8/3 is 4.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.670
Decremented, you have y
plus 1 to the 1/2 power.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.650
And then finally,
you have-- let's see.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.580
What color have I not used yet?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.880
Finally, you have this 5.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.850
The antiderivative
of 5 is just 5y.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.840
And we are going to evaluate
it at 3 and at negative 1,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.260
y equals 3 and y
equals negative 1.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.420
So this is going
to be equal to pi.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.490
So let's evaluate all
this business at 3.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.450
So 3 squared over 2 is 9/2.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.384
3 plus 1 is 4 to the 3/2.

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:34.550
Well, that's-- so let's see.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.210
If square root of 4 is 2 to the
third power is 8, 8 times 8/3

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.730
is 64/3, so plus 64/3.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.740
You have 5 times 3.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.550
Well, that's going
to be 15-- plus 15.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.570
And from that, we're
going to subtract

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.310
all this business
evaluated at negative 1.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.370
So you have negative
1 squared over 2.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.450
Well, that's just 1/2.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.920
Negative 1 plus 1 is
0 to the 3/2 power.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.440
That's going to be 0 times 8/3.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.981
This is all going to be 0, so
we don't have to even write it.

00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:08.900
And then finally, you
have negative 1 times 5.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.220
Well, that's just
going to be negative 5.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.860
And we are in the home stretch.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.470
We really just have to do
a little bit of arithmetic,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.370
add some hairy fractions
right over here.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.760
So let's do it.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.060
So this whole thing is going
to simplify to pi times--

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.310
and it looks like-- let's see.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.560
Our least common multiple
of all of these denominators

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.650
is going to be 6.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.150
So let's put everything
over a denominator of 6.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.910
So 9/2 is the same
thing as 27/6.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.093
64/3 is the same thing as 128/6.

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:47.010
15 is the same thing as 90/6.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.320
1/2 is the same thing as 3/6.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.380
So you would distribute
the negative sign.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.230
So this is negative 3/6.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.770
And negative times
negative is positive.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:07.860
5 is the same thing
as 30/6, so plus 30/6.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.990
And so this is going to
give us-- our denominator

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.570
is going to be over 6.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.590
We're going to multiply
something times pi.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.760
We have this pi over here.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.176
And then we just have to figure
out what the numerator is.

00:04:18.176 --> 00:04:22.290
So let's see if I can
do this in my head.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:31.620
So 27 plus 128 is going
to be-- let me see.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.270
That's going to be 140, 155?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.420
Is that right?

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.980
155?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.000
Let's see, if we get to 48
plus another 7-- yeah, 155.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.957
Plus 90 gets us to 245.

00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:48.540
Is that right?

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.040
Yeah.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.830
Plus 90 gets us to 245.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.740
Minus 3, you subtract 3
from that, you get to 242.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.400
And then you add 30 to
that, you get to 272.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.424
So we're left with 272 pi/6.

00:05:05.424 --> 00:05:06.590
But then we can-- let's see.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.210
272 and 6 are both
divisible by 2.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.030
So this is equal to-- let's see.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.287
272 divided by 2 is
going to be 136 pi over--

00:05:19.287 --> 00:05:21.370
and if you divide this
denominator right over here

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.467
by 2-- over 3.

00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:24.050
Is that right?

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.550
Yeah.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.240
136 pi/3.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.580
And 136 is not divisible by 3.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.120
So we have it as
simplified as we can.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.490
This right over
here is the volume

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.900
of our little upside-down
gumdrop-looking thing.
