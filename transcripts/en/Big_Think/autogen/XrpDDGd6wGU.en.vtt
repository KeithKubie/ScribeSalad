Rwanda in Darfur right and the question
 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.000
Rwanda in Darfur right and the question
is why why does this happen and and why

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010
is why why does this happen and and why
 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.100

do people care so much and it turns out

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110
do people care so much and it turns out
 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.359
do people care so much and it turns out
is the research on what's called the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369
is the research on what's called the
 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.029
is the research on what's called the
identifiable victim effect and the

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039
identifiable victim effect and the
 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.340
identifiable victim effect and the
question is if you have how many lives

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350
question is if you have how many lives
 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.040
question is if you have how many lives
are at stake and how much do we care you

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050
are at stake and how much do we care you
 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.810
are at stake and how much do we care you
would expect that as more lives are at

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820
would expect that as more lives are at
 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.670
would expect that as more lives are at
stake we would care more maybe in a

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680
stake we would care more maybe in a
 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.590
stake we would care more maybe in a
linear relationship or maybe we would

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600
linear relationship or maybe we would
 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.910
linear relationship or maybe we would
care more in the beginning and it'll be

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920
care more in the beginning and it'll be
 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.500
care more in the beginning and it'll be
kind of a diminishing return like we

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510
kind of a diminishing return like we
 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.639
kind of a diminishing return like we
wouldn't care if it's a hundred or a

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649
wouldn't care if it's a hundred or a
 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.290
wouldn't care if it's a hundred or a
thousand but we care a lot at the bottom

emotions and the question is what can
 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.569
emotions and the question is what can
activate emotion and it turns out that

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579
activate emotion and it turns out that
 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.649

people give more when it's emotional
 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.390
people give more when it's emotional
than when it's statistical what happens

than when it's statistical what happens
 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.520
than when it's statistical what happens
when we give both information but say

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530
when we give both information but say
 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.800

of course this explains a little bit

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720
of course this explains a little bit
 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.930
of course this explains a little bit
they kind of imbalance between what we

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940
they kind of imbalance between what we
 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.120
they kind of imbalance between what we
give to and what we don't give to so

turns out that those things are

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220
turns out that those things are
 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.220

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.580
kids in the future from getting malaria
is again not that exciting but if you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590
is again not that exciting but if you
 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.920
is again not that exciting but if you
can help one person specific concrete

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930

from it so there is a real imbalance

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350
from it so there is a real imbalance
 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.800
from it so there is a real imbalance
between what really matters and what we

if you run enough for profit of course

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060
if you run enough for profit of course
 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.330
if you run enough for profit of course
you want to build on these on this
