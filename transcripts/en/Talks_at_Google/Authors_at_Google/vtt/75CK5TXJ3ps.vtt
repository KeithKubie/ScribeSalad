00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
&gt;&gt; Presenter: All right, folks. Thanks so
much for coming today. We're very happy to

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.710
have Brendan Boyle with us.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:13.799
Brendan Boyle is partner and Chief Invention
Officer at IDEO. His role has a special emphasis

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.720
on entrepreneurship, and is focused on creating
intellectual property that IDEO develops,

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.670
while promoting entrepreneurial thinking and
practices throughout IDEO's eight global offices.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.570
Before coming to IDEO, Brendan co-founded
a company called Skyliners, which was acquired

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.210
by IDEO. And under its leadership, IDEO has
licensed over 125 toy game and consumer products

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.899
with leading manufacturers And in 2007, Crainium
Sounds by the Seashore, which was designed

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.379
by IDEO, was nominated for Toy of the Year
Award by Toy Industry Foundation.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.230
In addition to his duties at IDEO, Brendan
sits on the board at the non-profit National

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.229
Institute for Play, where focus on bringing
play based techniques to innovation. And currently,

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:01.399
he teaches a class that he created in Stanford's
new D school, called "From Play to Innovation".

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.570
So we're excited to have Brendan here to talk
about his new book, "The Klutz Book of Inventions".

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.110
And he asks if you already bought a book,
please don't start reading it until after

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.110
the talk.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.870
So please join me in welcoming Brendan Boyle.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.870
[applause]

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.131
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: All right. Thank you.

00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:26.680
So I always like to start a talk with a little
warm-up exercise. And this is one where, if

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.260
you're sitting down, pick up your right foot
and spin it in a clockwise motion. Keep spinning

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.720
it. And keep spinning it as you draw a big
number six in front of your face. Keep spinning

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.520
it clockwise. It's really hard to do, isn't
it? All right. So figure that one out.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.460
So thanks again. This is neat to be here.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.660
So imagine...this book is all around 'Brilliant
meets Ridiculous'. And I'll emphasize that

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.660
theme.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.070
But imagine it's 1887. And you're F. A. Mulleroff.
And you've invented this thing called a contact

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.070
lens.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.270
So any contact lens wearers out there?

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.060
And no one's ever seen it before. And you've
prototyped this little piece of blown glass.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.160
And you walk up to your friend and say: "Hey
will you test this thing? Put this piece of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.730
glass in your eye." And friend would say,
"Well, will it break?"

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.980
Then you'd say: 'Well, I'm not really sure.
Maybe. But it's probably pretty safe." Your

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.230
friend might say, "That's ridiculous! I'm
not gonna try that."

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.340
To me, almost every great invention I think
you could trace back, and someone or a group

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.111
of people, or maybe hundreds of people would
say that was a ridiculous idea.

00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:43.480
Or further along the lines of eyewear. Imagine
you're Salvino Damarte. And it's 1284. And

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.291
you've invented the first pair of glasses.
And you test them. You put them on someone

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.400
and they say, "I can see better. That's neat.
But aren't I gonna look kinda dorky if I walk

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.520
around with these things?"

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.120
For those who wear glasses -- I don't know
about the rest of you. But the first time

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.520
I had to wear glasses, I was really worried
about going to school. Like this is gonna

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.490
look crazy, right? People are gonna think
I'm different. And so I suspect this seemed

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.650
quite a bit, at a time, ridiculous.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.870
So think about some of your own big ideas.
Have you heard...has that felt like that's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.870
ridiculous?

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.081
And then one more on the eye care, which would
be laser surgery, which has been around now

00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:27.120
I think thirty some years, in different forms.
But I remember the first time I heard about

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.270
this, and I was thinking, "You're gonna shoot
lasers in my eye and then I'm gonna see better?".

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.730
That probably seemed like a pretty far out
there idea.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.950
And I always used to wonder being in California,
"What if you're getting laser surgery and

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.480
the earthquake hits?" Like, that would probably
be tricky.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.930
So insert any big invention here. Probably
one of the biggest inventions is the wheel.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.349
And you could go back a zillion years ago.
And probably the first person fooling around,

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.470
the first cave-person fooling around with
the wheel. The rest of the cave-folks were

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.069
probably thinking. "That's some kind of little
nitwit off to side, doing some type of invention

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:07.129
thing." Again it's that pushing yourself,
and having a safe enough environment to do

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.129
that.

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:15.239
&gt;&gt;Music

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:35.020
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: So John Cassidy and I, John
Cassidy is the founder of Klutz. Great guy.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.020
We decided to push this thinking into a project.
And my whole life's around projects which

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.780
I enjoy doing. And he's a great person to
collaborate with.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.930
So we thought, "Why don't we make a whole
bunch of inventions, make a book about it,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.720
which pushes this razor-thin line between
brilliant and ridiculous. Is it a brilliant

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.060
idea, or is it a ridiculous one?"

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.030
This is the one on the cover. So just be prepared.
I'm gonna show you a bunch of brilliant meets

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.690
ridiculous ideas today. This is the one on
the, the cover, which I wonder if for those

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.030
who fly a lot, which I do. And you have to
check your orange juice and you can't bring

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.740
it through TSA. If you would be allowed to
carry this and a bag of oranges, if that would

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.960
be okay. You could make that.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.220
So we had -- the project lasted about a year.
We probably could have done it faster. We

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.150
ended up building 162. Each one was prototyped
in the shop, built, and then photographed.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.430
And then a story written about it.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.370
We did probably a 100 different brainstorms,
thousands of different ideas. And what we

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.729
did to figure out what was that fine line,
was we took the sketches of the ideas to fourth

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.300
and fifth grade classrooms. If they thought
it could be a real idea, like they believed

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.991
in it, then that kind of passed that line
about that "Hmm. There's something on that

00:05:44.991 --> 00:05:45.991
fine line."

00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:50.520
There's something about a fourth grader that's
still very child-like but still exposed to

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.610
enough adult things. So they've -- they see
a lot of potential, where I worry as we get

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.050
older, we start to... we've heard "that can't
be done" enough.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.550
So this was reaffirming. I showed this. I
was giving a talk and there was a fifth grader

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.080
in the audience. And during the questions,
he raised his hand and said, "Can I buy that

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.080
invention?"

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080
[audience laughter]

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.430
And I said, "Dude, I can tell you how to make
one." So, it was pretty neat around that.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.009
So I'm going to distill this down into five
ways to think about being more innovative.

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.960
That's what we do a lot at IDEO, think about
ways to innovate in our process. So I'll talk

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.949
about five of them. A lot these you've probably
heard. So think about ones that you haven't,

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.440
or how you can improve in your own innovation
process.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.190
So the first is, I love to, again this whole
premise of encourage your ridiculous. How

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.919
do you get more comfortable? It's really one
is -- there are two things.

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:43.889
One, you're worried about being judged by
others, being judged by the tribe. "Hey, if

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.900
I throw out this big idea, someone's gonna
say I'm an idiot, or it looks stupid."

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.970
Or probably even more dangerous is being judged
by yourself. You'll be in a meeting and you'll

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.590
hold back on that idea because you're "Ahh-I
don't know. Maybe it's just not good enough".

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.630
So I think that if you can get more comfortable,
through encouraging ridiculous, and one of

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.990
the best ways I know to do that is through
play.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.242
The reason we like to play is because it's
fun and we wanna do it again. That's the reason

00:07:09.242 --> 00:07:12.320
the dog brings the ball back. "It was enjoyable.
I wanna do it again", right?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.710
So find something that's enjoyable. Then do
it again, and encourage that. So for me around

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.430
innovation, that's really neat.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.700
So, I'll slice through some ideas in the book
here.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:33.860
So, how might we get in shape while on the
go? So how 'bout the idea of the elevator

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.410
with a built-in Stairmaster? So, yeah you
gotta take a hundred flights up, but you gotta

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.490
get a little exercise.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:46.889
So, maybe this is borderline more on the ridiculous.
But either so much in this country, worldwide

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:50.520
even, spreading around obesity. I think there's
gonna be a lot more of how do you get people

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.729
to move.

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:56.380
I fly a lot, and I'm always amazed. I'll take
a six-hour cross country trip. People get

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.410
off that plane. They've been sitting and then
they get on that moving sidewalk at SFO. Like,

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.750
dude! You could walk. You could get a little
stretching, right? So I think there are going

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.389
to be a lot of things around how to get people
to move with this.

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:10.830
[pause]

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.970
All right. For those with kids, how might
we invent a kid's tricycle that does some

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.699
of your yardwork? How to get the kid working
kind of a little bit?

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:25.770
So I love the lawnmower tricycle. It's got
a few safety concerns. I'll grant you that.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:32.120
But some proper shrouding, and I think we
could handle that. So this idea probably seems

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.130
closer to the ridiculous.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:40.610
But I think it was two years ago, Fisher Price
came out with a smart cycle, which is a little

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.399
video gaming system. But the kid has to put
some energy in to get some excitement out

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.480
kind of thing, which has done really well
for them.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.240
So again, you'll see, I think a lot more of
thinking around how to get people to move

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.230
a little bit.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.310
So when I think about the innovation process,
we talk a lot about design thinking at IDEO,

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.589
we really start with observe and understand.
Understand what the user's doing, that frames

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:08.899
up into a point of view, into some type of
synthesis, a strategy.

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:12.589
I'm really focusing around the ideation. So
once we've done that part, how do you push

00:09:12.589 --> 00:09:14.290
yourself to get something more innovative?

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:20.170
So this book is focused around that. After
that, lots of prototype and testing. And then

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:25.580
go back and do it again. So what are your
different techniques to ideate more, is really

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:32.260
kind of the focus. Just put in some process
prospective.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.670
All right. How might we reinvent the common
parking ticket?

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.450
I don't know about you guys, but my office
is downtown Palo Alto. I walk out and I get

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.500
a parking ticket. I'm pretty bummed out for
a little bit. Like, "Duh. If I just got here

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.140
ten minutes earlier, I could've moved my car".

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:51.360
So we were trying to think how we could reinvent
that. Put the fun back in traffic citations.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.360
[audience laughs]

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.240
So I get my ticket and you scratch-off: "Double
my fine." "Zero fine." Or "We owe you the

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.240
fine!"

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240
[audience laughs]

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.080
So – and I was talking to someone from the
city of Palo Alto, and they're saying the

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.120
biggest problem in parking tickets is people
throw them away. They just don't...especially

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.520
if they're from out of town.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.500
If you put some fun, you felt like you got
a deal, you'd have to, I think, tweak the

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.390
economics here. "I got a dollar off". Maybe
people would feel more apt to pay something

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:22.160
on that. But this one, I think's closer. I
like this.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.560
[pause]

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:30.390
All right. And then another one is: How might
we make using the umbrella easier? How about

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:36.140
if we had the helium umbrella? So, it floats
over your head. It's always something to do

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.140
with your arms.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:42.791
All right. So I'm gonna...I love a little
warm-up exercise, I need you to pick a partner.

00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:46.980
And you each get a post-it and a pen. And
it doesn't have to be somebody you know. It

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.070
can be meet someone new.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.440
And this'll just take about two or three minutes
to do this exercise. So pick a partner, and

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.450
this will encourage a little play. So it's
fine. We'll do a little play here.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:03.092
[sounds of audience choosing partners]

00:11:03.092 --> 00:11:04.092
[pause]

00:11:04.092 --> 00:11:06.920
All right. So everyone's got a partner. This
is called, this is called a "Mash Up." One

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.160
person. The first part of the exercise you
do by yourself. So, one person list five things

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.860
you would find in your junk drawer, or your
kitchen or your garage. Make them unique.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.180
Think about five things. The other person.
List five things you'd find in a drugstore.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.180
That's the first part.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:25.330
All you need to do is take a minute. Do a
quick list. Decide who is doing what, and

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.330
make a quick list.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:33.500
[pause]

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:49.690
All right. Play along a little bit.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.790
[pause]

00:11:51.790 --> 00:12:04.600
Drugstore: Walmart, Walgreens or CVS, Long's,
that kind of thing.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.029
[pause]

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:09.420
All right. Just another couple seconds to
make your list.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.120
[pause]

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:21.041
You guys are doing well.

00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.890
[pause]

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:32.370
Hey. Okay. All right. Now, take...look at
your lists together over the next--this is

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:37.561
called a "Mash Up". Over the next couple minutes,
see if you can brainstorm a combo idea.

00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:41.120
Here's my example: I've got a welcome mat.
I've got a whoopee cushion. I have a whoopee

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.550
mat. Right?

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.790
So, do a brainstorm combo idea and push your
thinking. This is "encourage ridiculous".

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:57.990
We're in a safe environment here, and let's
see what we can come up with.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:12.550
[audience chatter]

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:19.830
[pause]

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:31.370
All right. If you can do a quick sketch, that's
even better. If you can do a quick sketch,

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.370
you guys will rock.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:41.430
[audience chatter]

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:46.140
[pause]

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:57.100
All right. Just another few seconds

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:02.050
[audience chatter]

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:11.950
[sound of phone ringing]

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.420
[pause]

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:26.990
All right. You guys got one? All right. Fifteen
more seconds. So finish one up. Good. Perfect.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.990
Okay.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.611
Who wants to share one? Who's gota share one?
We'll start with you guys. What've you got?

00:14:32.611 --> 00:14:37.560
&gt;&gt; Male Audience Member #1: We came up with
an edible credit card that's made out of aspirin.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.940
So you just bite off pieces of it any time.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.070
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Edible credit card made out
of aspirin! I think that might work. Brilliant

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.760
or ridiculous. I'm not sure. I like it. What
do you guys have? You got one?

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.190
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Yeah. We have
a coaster that dissolves into soap and shampoo.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.500
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Ooh. A coaster that dissolves
into shoap -- soap. Very interesting. I like

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.950
that. You guys got one?

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.470
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Yeah. We've got
the underwear doggie bags. The stuff that

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.780
cleans up after itself.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.500
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Underwear doggie bags that
clean up after themselves. Hmm. You prototype

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.190
that one. I'm not gonna prototype it! What
do you guys got?

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.561
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: Okay. We've got
sunscreen keychains so that you always have

00:15:10.561 --> 00:15:12.339
your sunscreen with you when you need it.

00:15:12.339 --> 00:15:15.171
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Ooh. Very -- . I haven't
seen that. That could be very cool. Who else?

00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:16.311
What do you guys got?

00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:20.630
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: We have diaper
balls. So they're good to play with and then

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.740
you can also roll them up and use them.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.510
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Diaper balls. All right.
I'll let you guys prototype that one too,

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.181
awesome. Some new kids in the family I think
somewhere. Who else? Anyone else got one?

00:15:30.181 --> 00:15:34.800
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: Yeah. We came up
with one. A disposable wall mountable camera.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.470
For taking pictures of your party.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.860
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Very cool. Disposable wall
mounted camera. Might be good.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.000
All right. Thanks guys.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.810
Again just trying to encourage your ridiculousness.
This is a really good warm-up exercise if

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.050
you find your group wants sort of to expand
a little bit and get into a little more playful

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.011
attitude. Typically these aren't gonna be
the big ideas, but you get more comfortable

00:15:55.011 --> 00:16:00.029
producing ridiculous ideas. And I think that's
a neat state to be in.

00:16:00.029 --> 00:16:06.230
Again I've given this talk several times.
Usually at universities, there's --20 percent

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.940
of the ideas have a condom involved for some
reason. I think it's in both, in most junk

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.220
drawers, or whatever.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.300
That's the "Mash Up". That's a nice -- encourage
your ridiculousness.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:21.220
One, around being more innovative is just
encouraging quantity. Just more ideas. You'll

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.700
have more to choose from, which is a really
good thing to think about.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:30.350
There's a lot of stereotype about the big
idea of the flashlight over someone's head

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.380
and they're waiting for that. And that's really
hard to count on.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.060
Like your boss comes up to you: "What are
you're doing". "Oh I'm just waiting for the

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.389
big flash. Don't worry". Or "I'm gonna go
home and take a nap."

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:44.930
So, getting used to having lots of ideas and
then going back and choosing is a better way,

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.890
I think, to be innovative. It's just like
-- have a part of the day that's very generative,

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:54.760
and then a part where you can judge. But get
comfortable with lots of ideas.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.200
This is a great quote. "When the tough get
going – when the going gets tough, the tough

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.490
get stupid. Out of a 100 ideas, the first
60 -- this is a brainstorm session -- produced

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.029
five that were actually new or different.
The next 20 produced nothing but laughter.

00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:12.959
And ideas 80 through 100 produced 10 that
were amazing. Thankfully, we didn't give up

00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:17.549
when the well ran dry around idea number 60."-from
"The Ebb and Flow of Ideas", of Dev Patnaik

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:20.100
who is the founder of Jump, neat guy.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.629
So they've started to take a look at their
typical brainstorms. You can sort of get to

00:17:24.629 --> 00:17:30.409
this part here, and I think sort of the humor
will help you move through. So lots of ideas,

00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:31.559
you'll have more to choose from.

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:32.679
[pause]

00:17:32.679 --> 00:17:37.659
All right. How might we reinvent the next
best thing in chainsaw technology? Probably

00:17:37.659 --> 00:17:45.909
not a lot of chainsaw folks here, but who
knows? You need the chainsaw dvd player. So,

00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:49.389
it's prototyped up [inaudible].

00:17:49.389 --> 00:17:55.000
So we had a lot of discussion about what movie
to put in there. Should be like a slasher

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.549
movie. We ended up with a romantic movie.

00:17:57.549 --> 00:18:02.300
We figured first it's kinda like enough action
going on anyway. But it is amazing if you

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:10.229
start look at it. If you go out to most restaurants
or bars now, how many LCD screens are everywhere.

00:18:10.229 --> 00:18:15.779
So you start, to--I've even started to see
now televisions in bathroom mirrors at high-end

00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:19.779
hotels and things where they're starting to
put in things like that for advertising. I

00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:22.999
heard they're going to do that at airports
so when you walk up to the airport, in the

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:27.149
bathroom, the TV will pop up and give you
some advertising.

00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:31.919
So, don't know. Jury's out on this one as
brilliant or ridiculous, but it's someone's

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:32.919
experimenting.

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:34.419
[audience member coughs]

00:18:34.419 --> 00:18:38.779
The third one for being more innovative, I
really like, is this principle of encourage

00:18:38.779 --> 00:18:39.779
"yes, and..".

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:46.059
Anyone folks do improv out here? So this is
a basic tenet. of improv. Accept what's been

00:18:46.059 --> 00:18:50.840
given at that moment or second, and then move,build
on it, which is really neat.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:59.700
I find a lot of folks as they advance in their
career become more "yes, but..." people. Someone

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.320
will throw out an idea and they'll listen
to it and they'll say, "Yes, that's a great

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.889
idea. It's gonna -- But it's not gonna work
out".

00:19:06.889 --> 00:19:12.549
So if you find yourself becoming a "yes, but"
person, I think, try to throw a few more "yes,and's"

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:16.340
into your conversation throughout the day,
which is really nice.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.600
So "yes, and.." and build on that idea a bit
little more. I just think it's a really nice

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:22.600
thing.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.609
The creative folks that I know, some of the
most creative folks I know really sort of

00:19:25.609 --> 00:19:31.009
embrace this. It just makes them more interesting
folks to hang around.

00:19:31.009 --> 00:19:37.139
So, all right. This will be the last little
warm-up exercise I've got you guys doing.

00:19:37.139 --> 00:19:42.929
So find a group of three. And we're going
to do a little "yes,and.." exercise. So a

00:19:42.929 --> 00:19:48.070
group of three, and then you'll start with:
"Let's throw a party!". And then "yes,and..".

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.379
And I'll let you go around once or twice,
and we'll see who's got the best, sort of

00:19:51.379 --> 00:19:56.519
exciting party. So start it with "Let's throw
a party!". Google's probably got tons of parties.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:20:02.019
So how do you get the best one? Maybe this
could be for next holiday party. "Yes,and...".

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:08.110
So get three people, and then -- three or
four people's fine. And then spend about a

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:12.889
minute doing this. And write it down on your
post-its as you go and we'll see who's got

00:20:12.889 --> 00:20:13.940
the most exciting party.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:22.649
[pause]

00:20:22.649 --> 00:20:40.080
(Audience talking)

00:20:40.080 --> 00:21:18.140
Try to get around the horn at least twice,
guys. See how wild this can get.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:22.080
[pause]

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:29.960
[audience chattering]

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:50.249
All right. We'll go another fifteen seconds.

00:21:50.249 --> 00:21:52.889
[pause]

00:21:52.889 --> 00:21:58.190
[audience chattering]

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:10.940
All right. All right. Okay. You guys make
it around a couple times?

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:11.940
Perfect. Okay.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:17.309
Let's hear about what the holiday party next
year perhaps at Google will be.

00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:21.210
You guys seem like you're laughing. What do
you guys got?

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:25.830
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: So it's like
a cloud based, cloud themed party. Our party

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:30.789
actually like floats.So there's an elephant
and clowns, and cupcakes, and they're tethered

00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:36.019
to balloons, lots of balloons. So they all
started floating away into the clouds.

00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:40.451
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Very cool. Way to stay on
brand too. Very nice. What did you get? Did

00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:41.669
you guys want to share? What do you got?

00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:47.809
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: We had a flying
petting zoo, with a taco truck, pulled by

00:22:47.809 --> 00:22:51.649
a hot air balloon that goes to to different
open spaces and parties.

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:54.379
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Sweet! Flying petting zoo.
You guys better have a good year for that

00:22:54.379 --> 00:22:55.509
one. That's awesome.

00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:58.619
Who else? Who else wants to share? Yeah. What
do you guys got?

00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:02.399
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: We've got a alcohol
themed party,

00:23:02.399 --> 00:23:03.399
[audience laughter]

00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:07.690
with different music, food, and dancing themed
to different types of alcohol. So Mexico,

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.349
tequila and so on. Crazy fun.

00:23:10.349 --> 00:23:13.159
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: It's very cool! Anyone else?

00:23:13.159 --> 00:23:14.159
[pause]

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.250
All right. I'm coming over there.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:20.019
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: So the main parts
of our party are -- there's musical instruments.

00:23:20.019 --> 00:23:23.320
So if you want to sit down and play the drums,
no problem. We got a drum set. We got a bass,

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:30.489
guitars, keyboards, and gorilla costumes.
Hats a must. And earrings a must. And a trampoline

00:23:30.489 --> 00:23:31.489
for those who jump.

00:23:31.489 --> 00:23:32.609
[audience laughter]

00:23:32.609 --> 00:23:36.279
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Fantastic! All right guys.
Oh, you got one. Cool.

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:39.940
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Ours is balloon
themed too. But in our case, the dogs wear

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.669
costumes as well. And we have fun mirrors
in those balloons. And we skydive into random

00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:45.669
farms.

00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:47.749
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Skydive into....?

00:23:47.749 --> 00:23:50.529
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: Are you questioning
me?

00:23:50.529 --> 00:23:51.570
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: (Laughs)

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.570
[audience laughs]

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.009
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #8: [inaudible]

00:23:54.009 --> 00:23:57.740
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: All right. Again, thanks
for trying that little warm-up exercise.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.129
The point, "yes,and..", right? Do build. A
little building.

00:24:00.129 --> 00:24:06.470
Again, I've done this with colleges. And there's
usually nudity involved in every party. So

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.950
it didn't come out at this one.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:13.320
I've done it with other, other folks where
some big star. Then someone else in the group

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.929
didn't like that star. So that star died.
But "yes, and" then came back to life. And

00:24:16.929 --> 00:24:21.239
then "yes, and" then died. And they're in
an infinite loop of that person they didn't

00:24:21.239 --> 00:24:25.019
like, and then liked.

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:27.609
So these are just some quick sketches from
other parties.

00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:32.840
Invite Aerosmith in a rocket-stage. Things
of that nature.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.049
All right. For those with kids. Anyone with
kids out here?

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:39.340
Yeah. So how might we make family roadtrips
more tolerable?

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.340
[pause]

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.830
Well, let's go back.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:53.850
So this is the sibling binders. So, very low
prototype tech here. But what you can't see,

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:59.039
can't annoy you. So that's kind of out there,
probably more ridiculous.

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:06.229
But I see, for those who own minivans, I think
most of them now come equipped with DVD players.

00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:10.960
Two in the back to keep the kids sort of pacified.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.720
I worry a little bit. I could envision a family
driving through Yellowstone and the kids are

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:22.039
a watching a travel log video about Yellowstone
versus looking out the window.

00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:26.630
So, I love this quote. "To invent you need
a good imagination and a pile of junk." So

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:31.620
this is from Edison. And a pile of junk means
a pile of stuff. And a lot of great inventions

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.909
have been combination inventions, or at least
have been inspired by different things, so

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:39.749
having a lot of stuff around. And depending
on what industry, the stuff could be totally

00:25:39.749 --> 00:25:40.749
different, right?

00:25:40.749 --> 00:25:48.049
Look. So I think number four is: Don't be
afraid to collect stuff. Collect stuff and

00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:52.359
use it as great examples. Either collect them
for yourself, collect them for your group,

00:25:52.359 --> 00:25:55.690
collect them as a company. And what are the
best or most interesting examples?

00:25:55.690 --> 00:26:01.799
So if you take a tour of IDEO, you'll see
a lot of stuff. Different areas.

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:08.809
So this is -- if you're lucky enough to get
to Edison's, this is Edison's lab actually

00:26:08.809 --> 00:26:13.269
in Dearborn, Michigan, now. Henry Ford was
a big admirerer of him. So he moved all his

00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:14.950
lab over to Greenfield Village.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:19.149
So if you get there, there is an amazing amount
of stuff in there, right? So he's considered

00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:23.570
one of the most prolific inventors of his
time. So I think that's really cool. I think

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:28.070
it's just – it's very inspiring. So figure
out what that is for you, and collect more

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.409
of it.

00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:37.469
So a really quick example, personal example.
This is an invention we did called the Jumparoo.

00:26:37.469 --> 00:26:41.229
This is...we take one of the things that hung
in the doorframe, bounced up and down, and

00:26:41.229 --> 00:26:45.599
we made it free-standing. The problem with
the one in the doorframe is, moms loved it

00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:48.480
and hated it. They loved it because the infant
loved it. They hated it 'cause they thought

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.909
it might fall down. It's dangerous. Or if
you live in a small apartment building, it

00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:55.190
blocked your key passageway.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:59.759
So we made it free-standing. And we could
quickly--we took that insight, quickly prototyped

00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:01.239
it up 'cause we had all this junk around.

00:27:01.239 --> 00:27:06.749
And made this one. And that turned into that
one. And then we sold it to Fisher Price.

00:27:06.749 --> 00:27:12.499
It turned into a whole category. They sell
over a million units a year at 60 bucks. It's

00:27:12.499 --> 00:27:15.270
in its fifth year, and it's done really well.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:20.809
So it's a nice sort of "collect junk" example
for us. And it's really neat. We give them

00:27:20.809 --> 00:27:27.109
out all the time for babyshower gifts at IDEO.
And someone sent me back a YouTube video of

00:27:27.109 --> 00:27:31.599
their kid on it. I thought that was interesting.
So I searched "Jumparoo" on YouTube, and there

00:27:31.599 --> 00:27:37.960
were over 5,000 individually Jumparoo generated
videos. People loved seeing their kid jump

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.080
up and down, so they're sending it.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:44.990
So that's a new metric. To see if -- post-metric,
if it's successful, of something that worked

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.990
well.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.070
And we can go back and get inspired by what
folks are doing with that.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:53.389
Those who grew up in a large family. I was
sixth out of seven kids. There's always arguments

00:27:53.389 --> 00:28:02.379
about the bathroom. So we've got the multi-seat
family model. It's Mom, Dad, Jenny, and Charlie.

00:28:02.379 --> 00:28:08.659
You know, if you do a book like this you get
a lot of humor around the bathroom. So at

00:28:08.659 --> 00:28:14.809
one point, I think we had eight or nine commodes
in the shop and we had to get rid of some.

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:18.419
The guys in the shop actually put them up
on Craigslist. And people were buying used

00:28:18.419 --> 00:28:24.989
toilets, which is interesting in itself.
So this is a product someone sent me, after

00:28:24.989 --> 00:28:28.610
seeing that sent me this. I haven't seen one,
but it's some kind of--I don't know if this

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:35.269
is doing well or not. Seems a little bit mechanical,
but same issue.

00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:39.669
And then the last one is really to act different.
I think routine sort of can really kill innovation.

00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:44.529
So make sure your own life doesn't fall onto
too much of a routine.

00:28:44.529 --> 00:28:48.389
And how can you sort of shake things up a
little bit? And that I think helps you get

00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:52.369
inspired and I think see things a little bit
differently.

00:28:52.369 --> 00:28:56.769
This is the class I teach at Stanford. We
did a project last year around how do you

00:28:56.769 --> 00:29:01.429
encourage more movement in meetings, or when
you're sitting at your desk? Some of the insight

00:29:01.429 --> 00:29:07.879
they saw from big companies -- probably not
you guys -- but I think more typical corporate,

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:10.729
where if you're not seen at your desk, you're
not seen as working.

00:29:10.729 --> 00:29:15.259
So people were afraid to get up and move around.
So this one group invented this kind of an

00:29:15.259 --> 00:29:18.629
exercise chair that would be at your desk.
You could do some stretching and do some other

00:29:18.629 --> 00:29:20.049
things like that.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:24.139
This group tried to reinvent the whole meeting
of sitting around. The meeting they saw a

00:29:24.139 --> 00:29:27.940
lot of insights, where the boss would come
in, sit in the same seat. The boss might sit

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.220
in a more powerful stuit.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:35.219
So they tried to break all those things up
by wearing writeable suits with no desks.

00:29:35.219 --> 00:29:39.909
So you'd be brainstorming and writing on people.
Right. So pushing the ridiculous on that,

00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:44.389
but pushing the thinking further out. That's
got all sorts of lawsuits written all over

00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:45.389
it.

00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:46.489
[audience laughs]

00:29:46.489 --> 00:29:48.339
But it was interesting to see that they were
experimenting.

00:29:48.339 --> 00:29:50.539
[pause]

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:54.969
I saw this online. This Japanese class trying
to make chores more fun. So they'd make it

00:29:54.969 --> 00:29:58.009
into a game. How fast they could do things.
So they're trying to break up the routine

00:29:58.009 --> 00:30:02.799
of picking up the classroom which no one wants
to do, into something more interesting, which

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:03.799
I thought was really neat.

00:30:03.799 --> 00:30:07.049
[pause]

00:30:07.049 --> 00:30:09.889
So a few closing thoughts.

00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:14.669
Don't take yourself too seriously, discover
the opposite of play isn't work. This is sort

00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:19.379
of the whole class is based around the opposite
of play isn't work. It's, I think, boredom,

00:30:19.379 --> 00:30:21.169
or in the worst cases, depression.

00:30:21.169 --> 00:30:24.519
So if you're not interested or passionate
about what you're doing, you're not gonna

00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:31.570
innovate. So, most people think play is for
kids. It's frivolous. I think that's totally

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.570
wrong.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.720
I think as you get older you should be incredibly
excited about what you're doing. If people

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.730
aren't, then I usually can get them thinking
about this way about their hobbies. Like some

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.749
of their hobbies are incredible amount of
effort, "work" so to speak. But they love

00:30:45.749 --> 00:30:49.289
doing it, so they want to keep doing it more
and more.

00:30:49.289 --> 00:30:52.650
So I think for innovation, if you can feel
the sort of playful mode, not maybe all of

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.230
the time, but more of the time, that's a really
neat thing to do.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.869
[Music]

00:30:57.869 --> 00:31:01.149
[phone ringing]

00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:15.919
&gt;&gt;Woman in video: Hey Gary. Hold on a sec.

00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:17.559
[music]

00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:23.989
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: For those on CalTrain you'd
want to have one of those to give to the person

00:31:23.989 --> 00:31:32.959
next to you. So this is probably not the right
solution. But again, if you fly a lot, phones

00:31:32.959 --> 00:31:37.259
will be on planes. They've been on planes
in the past, they'll come on, and there'll

00:31:37.259 --> 00:31:38.369
be some issues around this.

00:31:38.369 --> 00:31:42.359
So people will be trying to solve this. This
cone of silence is probably not it. But there'll

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:47.879
be something else out there. So this will
be pushing that thinking somewhere.

00:31:47.879 --> 00:31:51.830
So with that, be ridiculous. Create something
brilliant.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.099
Thank you very much everybody.

00:31:53.099 --> 00:32:00.719
[applause]

00:32:00.719 --> 00:32:04.399
So I think, at this time, we probably have
some time for questions.

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:08.419
What do you guys normally do? So if you guys
got any questions, love to.

00:32:08.419 --> 00:32:09.419
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: [inaudible]

00:32:09.419 --> 00:32:14.631
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: You bet. Yeah I'll repeat
it if you yell it out.

00:32:14.631 --> 00:32:15.631
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: Basically I understand
the idea of creating tons of ideas,[inaudible]

00:32:15.631 --> 00:32:25.730
then what's the process of narrowing down
the ideas? Or maybe not necessarily to[inaudible]

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:31.099
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Right. Yeah. So the question
is if you create lots of ideas, how do you

00:32:31.099 --> 00:32:32.099
narrow down?

00:32:32.099 --> 00:32:33.709
[people in audience laughing]

00:32:33.709 --> 00:32:38.200
A couple things. People have different techniques.
The first is to realize when you're in a divergent

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.789
mode, when you're creating ideas, and when
you're in a convergent mode and you're eliminating

00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:42.789
ideas.

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:48.300
Too often, folks are somewhere in the middle
where they'll keep trying to come up with

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.049
ideas when they're trying to focus, and that
doesn't help.

00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:56.490
So one: realize what mode you're in. And then
two: for me it's be ruthless as to which ones

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.799
fall to the floor.

00:32:57.799 --> 00:33:02.450
Everyone wants to save lots of ideas, like
maybe this one's good, or maybe not. So there're

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.499
different techniques we do.

00:33:03.499 --> 00:33:07.839
The first one is after a brainstorm is we
quickly quickly take a group vote as to which

00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:12.379
ones. And that's just to sort of see where
the butterflies sort of land, and that will

00:33:12.379 --> 00:33:14.349
help sort of narrow some things.

00:33:14.349 --> 00:33:19.190
The others, then we'll sort of circle ten
that we like, and then do quick experiments

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:24.080
to see if those have some merit. Again, that
next part of that phase.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:29.389
But two things. Realize you're in convergent
mode. So it's okay to cut. And then two, try

00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:32.809
to experiment and see if it goes somewhere.
Good question. Yeah.

00:33:32.809 --> 00:33:47.950
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #10: [inaudible] The
car with the multiple DVD screens kind of

00:33:47.950 --> 00:34:03.099
bothered me [ ]. What do you do about ideas
that are ultimately successful but negatively

00:34:03.099 --> 00:34:04.099
[ ]?

00:34:04.099 --> 00:34:06.789
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Well first, that car DVD
idea wasn't mine so...

00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:08.660
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #10: [inaudible]

00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:13.109
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: [Laughs] No, I know. I think
again it comes down to your values and your

00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:14.109
judgment.

00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:18.440
At IDEO, we're a service industry, most of
our work. So we're trying to decide what clients

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:24.289
to work. Dave Kelly our founder, we've used
this for years, is we have a teeter-totter.

00:34:24.289 --> 00:34:26.690
On one side's a heart and on one side is money.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:30.859
So we're trying to balance some of those things,
right? So if it's too far out of whack one

00:34:30.859 --> 00:34:35.610
way, we'll usually say "no". If it's too far
only the heart, we can only do some of those.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.779
Otherwise we can't sustain.

00:34:36.779 --> 00:34:42.159
So there's somewhere in the middle or something
that you're comfortable with. Yeah those are

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:44.349
challenging.

00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:49.111
I think we lean probably more towards the
heart, so hopefully, That's a good question.

00:34:49.111 --> 00:34:50.220
[pause]

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.510
And I worry about that too.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:57.460
Too many TVs. Kids aren't getting out. I grew
up in a world of physical play, you're outdoors

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:08.010
most of the time.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:13.010
[pause]

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:14.010
Yeah.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.010
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #11: So you mentioned
having a lot of junk around. [Inaudible} I

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.010
know as a person living in San Francisco,
it's hard to keep stuff.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.980
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Yeah. So hard to keep stuff.
One, I was talking about innovation in the

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:24.430
workplace. So maybe there's more junk around
here. Seems like there's plenty of room here.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:29.000
So it's a question of is it your personal
kind of inspiration for those types of projects,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.730
or is it work stuff. So if it's here, then
you dedicate more things.

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:38.150
We're...I think you're probably in the same
boat. Most companies aren't. We're really

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.960
big on having different types of magazines
in IDEO. It's just like a quick way to glance

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.059
at something, and there will be big racks
of magazines.

00:35:44.059 --> 00:35:48.690
I read a really interesting study where in
typical corporate world, if you're seen reading

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:52.109
a magazine at your desk, people will think
you're goofing off.

00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:56.310
But if you're seen reading a black and white
copy of that magazine or article, people will

00:35:56.310 --> 00:36:00.810
think you're working. So it's a wrong type
of a thing.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:06.599
Encouraging that type of attitude around a
library of that stuff or other junk, collections

00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:13.789
of stuff, collections of...you know, thanks
to you guys we can find that stuff right away.

00:36:13.789 --> 00:36:14.789
Yes.

00:36:14.789 --> 00:36:20.920
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #4: [inaudible]

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:30.000
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Well yeah. I think if we're
on innovation in a group or an industry or

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.410
whatever, I think it's inspiring to have that.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:37.079
For personal things, I like a clean, neat
house without a lot of junk. For those who've

00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:42.559
had kids, all of a sudden it just starts to
escalate on all this stuff. That's ususally

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:50.119
why people remodel to put stuff somewhere
else. But yeah. This is on a sense around

00:36:50.119 --> 00:36:53.640
innovating...

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.640
Yes

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.680
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #12: [Inaudible]

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.029
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Yeah. That's when I alluded
to that slide around how do you find the problems,

00:37:00.029 --> 00:37:01.869
What's the tough questions?

00:37:01.869 --> 00:37:07.019
So usually a client will come to IDEO. We've
got great relationships with different clients,

00:37:07.019 --> 00:37:10.789
and they'll have a question. We'll spend a
lot of time framing up, is this the right

00:37:10.789 --> 00:37:11.789
question?

00:37:11.789 --> 00:37:16.519
And we'll go out-the first part about being
inspired and understanding that a user deeply

00:37:16.519 --> 00:37:20.500
around-maybe we'll have a few sacrificial
questions, but there's a lot of effort around

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:25.830
framing up what is that question before you
would jump to ideating. You can use ideation

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:30.569
early to do some test concepts to see if that
resonates around the question.

00:37:30.569 --> 00:37:39.430
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #13: I really like
your example of [inaudible]. Any other cool

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:40.700
categories [inaudible].

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:47.210
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: I think everyone's seen new
insights, or people are seeing them early

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.830
and then building whole categories.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #13: I mean from IDEO.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.860
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boyle: Oh, from IDEO.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.860
[pause]

00:37:53.860 --> 00:38:02.569
Yeah, it's challenging top of mind on that.
Almost with any of our clients its a collaborative.

00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:03.569
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #13: Yes.

00:38:03.569 --> 00:38:04.569
[pause]

00:38:04.569 --> 00:38:09.510
&gt;&gt;Brendan Boiyle: So I'm trying to think about
something. Let me come back to you on that

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:16.200
one. There are probably five or ten that are
good ones. That one's one on up top of my

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200
mind.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:23.890
[pause]

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:33.020
Neat. The--what we're doing, we're doing a
lot of work around social innovation, social

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.020
impact.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.500
So we've started what we call openIDEO.com,
where you can go there.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.600
And there was recently a challenge we had
with Jamie Oliver around how to get kids to

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.390
eat more fresh fruits and vegetables.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:50.190
So, out of that there were a bunch of ideas.
We're hoping things like that, we're trying

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:54.960
to tackle bigger issues like that. With that
type of venue. Especially around the obesity

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960
and things of that nature.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:59.329
[pause]

00:38:59.329 --> 00:39:01.569
All right, gang! Go out and be ridiculous.

00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:01.640
[applause]
