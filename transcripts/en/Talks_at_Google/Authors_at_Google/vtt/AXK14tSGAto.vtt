00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.832
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:07.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:08.748
DAVID BENSON: Please, everybody.

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:10.210
Please, grab a seat.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.115
So first off, welcome.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:12.990
OWEN SLOT: Thank you.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.031
DAVID BENSON: And thank
you for coming to Google.

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:17.940
Great turn out, especially on a
sunny day with a train strike.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.310
It's normally a good
excuse to stay at home.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.870
But you've obviously
got the draw.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.060
So just sort of, for
everyone in the room,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.850
Owen Slot has been the
Chief Rugby Correspondent

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.410
for "The Times" since 2015.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.652
But before stepping
into this role,

00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:34.360
he was the chief
"Times" sports reporter.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.620
And the roles overlapped.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.180
And that really
allowed him to cover

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.340
the Rio Olympics,
which was, what,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.930
six summer games in succession?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.920
OWEN SLOT: Six on
the trot, yeah.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.300
DAVID BENSON: Pretty impressive.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.490
Going back to Atlanta in 1996--

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.132
so given the average
age of Google,

00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:49.090
I think that's probably
when most Googlers were

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.120
being born at the time.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.480
And so he's reported over those
Olympics and three Winter Games

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.830
as well.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.310
So it was really sort
of seeing that success

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.090
of the great British Olympic
team over 20 years that

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.750
inspired him to write
this amazing book.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.630
But he did want me to
tell you that he has not

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.850
come close to winning an
Olympic medal himself,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.670
although did compete for the
Dorking under-16 tennis team

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.550
and was Dorking champion,
I believe, so fantastic.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.727
OWEN SLOT: Proud moment.

00:01:22.727 --> 00:01:24.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.380
DAVID BENSON: So,
Owen, I want everybody

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.864
to not just hear about
what's in the book.

00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:31.030
You should all buy the book.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.394
That's a solid
recommendation from me.

00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:35.810
But, also, to sort of hear a
bit about the story around it

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.804
and some of the big
outtakes you had from it.

00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:39.220
So perhaps you
could just kick off

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.290
with what really inspired you
to write "The Talent Lab."

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.760
OWEN SLOT: Sure.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.590
So the first Olympic Games I
went to as a reporter was '96.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.090
And I was 28 years old.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.230
And it was sort of
the culmination,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.372
or it was my ambition,
as a sports reporter,

00:01:56.372 --> 00:01:57.580
to go to one of these things.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.650
And going to Olympics is
an amazing experience.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.710
And I don't know if many people
experienced that in London

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.320
in 2012, but a great
thing to be a part of.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.810
So I went there as a journalist.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.544
And there were no
great expectations

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:10.419
for the British team.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:15.544
And the British team won one
gold medal at those games.

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:17.210
I said there were no
great expectations,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.640
but that was lower
than anyone had really

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.598
considered at the time.

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:21.330
And it was pretty rubbish.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.740
And there were smaller
nations, like North Korea, that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.420
did better than Great Britain.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.060
And this was all
part of the story.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.990
And it was a classic case of old
British mores in elite sport,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.290
if you like, as in we were--

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.840
I say we, but the team were--

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.390
amateur-based.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.940
The athletes all had jobs
outside of their sport.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.870
So they were competing against
full-time professionals.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.020
They were happy
amateurs, if you like.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.290
There was no great ambition
to do better than that.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.590
And they got what they
deserved, if you like,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.010
finished 36th on
the medal table.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.830
And as a journalist, it
was a good story to cover,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.179
because it was so poor.

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:12.220
I remember one day, one
of the stories at the end

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.140
was the two members of
the diving team had set up

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.510
a shop, a sort of
pop-up shop on the side

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.000
of the main street in Atlanta.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.330
And they were selling their kit.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.180
And this was like a
sort of a metaphor

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.540
for Great Britain, the
paupers of the Olympic world.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.450
It didn't go down too well with
the management, funnily enough.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.570
But so anyway, so I saw '96.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.140
And then lottery money
came in after that.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.230
And then I just had
the best position

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.440
to witness the phenomenal
growth from there to there.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.220
So '96 one gold medal.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.730
2012, Great Britain
won 27 gold medals.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:04.140
And '96, there was a total of
one female British medalist

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.870
at all.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.920
Denise Lewis won a
bronze in the heptathlon.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.980
And then Rio Games,
20 years later,

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.740
the number of British women
to win a medal of any kind

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.380
was 58, so 1 to 58.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.150
And so I'd seen
this, what I thought,

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.980
was one of the great
transformations,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.357
a great transformational
story in sport,

00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:28.440
one of the sort of great
success stories in sport.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.820
And it was partly
inspired by the money,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.910
but I sort of got to learn how
they did it and what drove it.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.080
And I just thought that that's
one of the great stories

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.979
and went to the people
involved and said, listen,

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:45.270
we've got to do a book on this.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.050
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.990
I mean, it's interesting
you should say that.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.410
Because, whenever I was going
around, say, drumming up

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.830
a bit of sport saying,
look, this is a great book,

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.330
and everybody went,
well, of course,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.250
we won the medals,
because we put money in.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.180
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.230
DAVID BENSON: But
that's not true, is it?

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.050
OWEN SLOT: Well,
so it's the start.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.160
So that is the natural
reaction, and it's not

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.610
an incorrect reaction either.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.650
So before money--

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.550
Great Britain 36th
on the medal table.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.920
Rio-- second on the medal table.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.940
So one of the questions for
the book which I try to tackle

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.370
is, if you just
chuck money at it,

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.350
does that guarantee
your success.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.670
Is it just a straightforward
money equals medals equation?

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.640
And my answer is
very, very much no.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.010
So we don't know how much for--

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.760
so in Great Britain, we
publish an audited account

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.480
of how much is spent on every
single sport, every year,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.730
so we know exactly what it is.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.307
And funnily enough,
Russia and China

00:05:45.307 --> 00:05:47.390
don't do the same sort of
thing on a public basis.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.220
But we're pretty sure that
they outspend Great Britain,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.236
considerably.

00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:56.000
But one of the great
achievements of Rio

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.670
was that Great Britain
finished above both those two

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.070
traditional Olympic superpowers.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.400
And then, if you compare
Great Britain to,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.790
for instance, one of our great
sporting rivals Australia--

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.910
who over the '90s and early
00's were ahead of Great Britain

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.550
on the medal table.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.610
For the Rio Olympics,
Great Britain,

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.360
if you total what was
spent on the elite team,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.580
over the four years,
going into the games,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.170
Great Britain outspent
Australia by 37%,

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.340
but beat them on the
medal table by 131%.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.090
One of the other comparisons I
like is, if you put together,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.270
on a similar basis,
Japan and South Korea,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.100
who do have very exact
accounts of what they spend--

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.150
if you put together what they
spent leading into the London

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.420
Games, they spent seven times
what Great Britain spent.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.240
Yet, on the medal
table, Great Britain

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.730
matched those two put together,
so sort of seven times

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.110
more effective.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.280
So sort of what I argue in
the book is having the money,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.080
having the lottery funding,
allows talented kids

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.370
opportunities to do well.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.229
But it doesn't make
them take them.

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.020
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.350
Amazing.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.840
I mean, you just
sort of mentioned

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.480
that sort of Russia and China
are big Olympic superpowers

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.046
but not very transparent.

00:07:19.046 --> 00:07:21.170
You know, one of the amazing
things about this book

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.430
is you have so much access.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.494
There's so much revealed
about how we did it.

00:07:27.494 --> 00:07:28.160
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.660
DAVID BENSON: How did
you get that access?

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.785
And how did you get all
these people to talk to you

00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:35.420
about their secrets of success?

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.840
OWEN SLOT: Well, yes, I
was slightly surprised.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.440
So in the years of build
up-- so as a reporter,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.720
I did a lot of Olympic sports
reporting in the lead up

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.910
to the Athens Games in '04
and then Beijing in '08.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.584
So at that point,
we knew that London

00:07:54.584 --> 00:07:55.750
were going to get the games.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.590
So as a reporter,
I thought, right,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.630
I'm just going to be
on the Olympic story,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.647
because it's the
big sports story.

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.230
And so during that
time, I got to know

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:05.540
some of the people who
worked for UK Sport, which

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.195
is kind of like the central
funding hub for all Olympics

00:08:09.195 --> 00:08:09.695
sports.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.560
Well, they decide
where to invest.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.860
They're, in a sense, a bit like
sort of an investment bank,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.860
also management consultants
at the same time.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.605
So they're trying to
work out what businesses

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:27.230
to stick their money into, where
they're going to get a return.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.480
And they're also trying to
manage it at the same time.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.480
And they have all sorts
of different businesses,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.080
the big successful ones and
the start-ups, if you like.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.350
So I got to know who
people ran them quite well.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.330
And it became quite
clear to me that they

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.680
had phenomenal knowledge that
wasn't being reported much

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.570
in the newspapers, that they
were cutting-edge globally

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.110
in terms of the
knowledge and the smarts

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:01.100
and the skill sets they took
to managing sports teams.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.660
I mean, talent ID
was the first thing

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.660
that I sort of started
writing about with them.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.190
And at the time, talent ID
was almost like a dirty word,

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.660
in sport, in Great Britain.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.820
When they announced that they
were going to do a talent ID

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.410
scheme, I kid you
not, there were

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.570
newspapers that were
comparing it to East Germany.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.230
And it was like the
old East Germany,

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:26.330
which was sort of the dark days
of how not to run a sporting

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.250
system.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.170
And so they were brave,
and they were cutting edge.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.440
And in the lead-up to the London
Games, I was saying to them,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.260
listen, what you're doing
is clever and impressive.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.760
And the story of your
growth and successes

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.030
is staggering as well.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.700
So I think it's a great story.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.770
And they were going,
yeah, but we'd

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.470
like to keep it to ourselves.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.440
And I guess I was lucky that I
managed to win some confidences

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.150
and to make some friends.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:07.490
And at the same time,
around the weeks and months

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.380
after the London Games, there
was a change in management.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.950
And there was a
new sports director

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.135
called Simon Timson,
who was pretty gung-ho,

00:10:17.135 --> 00:10:19.670
a really good bloke, but
sort of liked to be out there

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.130
and was quite happy
for people to know

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.450
about what they were doing.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.030
Also, at the same
time, you may remember

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.720
there was a big concern.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.350
So lots of funding had gone
into British Olympic sport

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.185
up to London.

00:10:32.185 --> 00:10:33.560
And there was a
big concern that,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.480
after London-- sort of
London had happened.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.390
We'd done it.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:37.450
It had been a success--

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.170
that funding would drop off.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:47.420
And so they were quite
happy for their skills

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.060
and their abilities to
be promoted a bit more.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.470
And so thus, the book.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.010
They generally have taken
the book to sports ministers

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.639
and funding people in
Parliament and saying, listen,

00:10:57.639 --> 00:10:58.430
this is what we do.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.680
And this is why we do it well.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.050
And it was also seen as a
way of trying to get support.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.490
So they eventually said, yes.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.140
Then the publisher said yes.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.370
And then we had this
sort of magical sort

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.270
of two years where I would
go into the UK Sport offices

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.430
once a month.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.770
And with the two leading
people in UK Sport--

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.030
Simon Timson was one and Chelsea
Warr, who was his deputy--

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:28.190
every session, we'd target
either a sport or a theme.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.930
So it could be swimming.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.370
Or it could be leadership.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.210
Or it could be gymnastics.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:38.030
Or it could be how
to stay successful.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.970
We'd talk sort of all
the way through the story

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.914
of how they saw swimming and
whether it was doing well

00:11:43.914 --> 00:11:45.080
or what it was trying to do.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.600
And then, at the
end of the session,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.090
we'd have a list
of names of coaches

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.800
and performance directors,
psychologists, or whatever.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.580
And then over the
next couple of days,

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.390
they'd be copying me into
emails with those people.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.620
And then I'd be following up.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.092
And then I'd be going to the
swimming people and saying,

00:12:03.092 --> 00:12:04.050
can I come and see you.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.220
So I sort of created
a very long journey

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.750
that started at UK Sport.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.150
And then I'd get to see
more and more people.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.750
And--

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.680
DAVID BENSON: So you
sort of gradually

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.020
worked your way into the system.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.561
OWEN SLOT: Yeah,
and just accumulated

00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:18.000
more and more information.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.500
And for sure, there
were some people

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.040
that felt awkward about
sharing their information.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.940
And for sure, that there's only
a limit to where I've gone.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.490
And there's,
obviously, areas where

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:31.350
they didn't want
the public to see

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.990
or their competitors to see.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.427
But I think-- well,
as you said, I

00:12:35.427 --> 00:12:37.260
think they were quite
open with what they've

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.160
allowed to go out there.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:38.565
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:12:38.565 --> 00:12:40.148
Well, I think you've
certainly created

00:12:40.148 --> 00:12:43.580
almost a manual of how to build
an Olympic team, quite frankly.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.790
It's a great place to start.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.000
But, you know, just to put
the achievement into context,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.430
so normally teams do
well in their home games

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.224
and then decline.

00:12:54.224 --> 00:12:54.890
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.060
DAVID BENSON: We didn't.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.914
We did better in Rio than we
did in London, is that correct?

00:12:59.914 --> 00:13:00.580
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.990
So the book at one
stage was going

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.930
to be called "66 and 121."

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:11.580
The reason being that,
in London, Great Britain

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:17.490
won 65 medals in the Olympics
and 120 in the Paralympics.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.600
And UK Sport put up this
target in their offices,

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.450
about four months later,
after the London Games, which

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.510
was 66 and 121, which
is basically our target

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.340
is to do better than
we did in London.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.140
And there were people,
observers, myself included,

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.100
just sort of shaking
heads and going, you know,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.320
you don't have to do that.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.600
Why would you set yourself--

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.310
the level of astonishment at
Britain's success at the London

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.950
Games was higher.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.700
You know, they did
much better than anyone

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.533
expected them to do.

00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:52.290
So why take that and
try to aim higher?

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.070
And I guess it's one of those
things that in all businesses

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.460
you set targets.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.400
But most people set targets
that they think they generally

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.150
can hit, but no one
generally thought they

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.709
could hit that target in Rio.

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:05.500
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.670
OWEN SLOT: But as you say,
that there is a pattern that,

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:12.270
if you're a host of an
Olympic games, then,

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.900
naturally, your host country
wants you to do well.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.947
So there is financial
input put into your teams

00:14:19.947 --> 00:14:21.030
and your sporting systems.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.620
And so host teams
generally tend to build up

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:26.800
in the Olympics towards
their home games,

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.900
peak at their home games.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.480
And no one's done better.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.440
Everyone's hit the peak
at their home games,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.460
and gone down the other side.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.293
And Australia's the
sort of classic example,

00:14:34.293 --> 00:14:38.430
who were fourth in Sydney
at their home games.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.524
By the time they got to
Beijing, they were eighth.

00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:41.940
And then they were
10th in London.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.330
And they were 10th in Rio again.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.320
So they just followed the
classic parabola of up one side

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.580
and down the other.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.995
And people running
the British team,

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:52.620
UK Sport, in particular,
they were just

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.800
saying, that is
what we want to--

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.810
we are just dead-set
on avoiding that.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.760
We think it would be
the greatest achievement

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.410
to have done what
we did in London

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.660
and then do better afterwards.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.493
DAVID BENSON: Sustain
that success, amazing.

00:15:04.493 --> 00:15:06.360
So the book's
absolutely chock full

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.180
of great stories
of how they changed

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.430
things, how they found people.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.570
Perhaps, let's dig
into some of those.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.760
Give me one of your favorite
stories of success in the book.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.740
OWEN SLOT: Well, OK.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:26.550
So one of the people,
one of the interviews

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.220
that really, really stuck
with me from the book

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.180
was an interview with
a swimmer, now a coach,

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.520
called Mel Marshall.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.530
And she went to the Athens
Games in '04 as the number one

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.990
in the world for
200-meter freestyle.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:46.500
And she's a great, great
personality, real sort

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.750
of punchy, effervescent girl.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.959
She always used to say that,
when she retired from swimming,

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.375
she was going to
be a firefighter.

00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:56.050
She wasn't scared of anything,
a take on the world type.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.220
It was just a real
pleasure to meet this girl.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.370
So, as I say, she went
to Athens as the favorite

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.550
for the gold medal.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.860
In her heat, she had sort of
quite a scratchy performance,

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.600
but she got through
to the semifinal.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.180
And in the semifinal,
she came last,

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:15.510
so end of games, just
sudden, complete,

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:19.050
go home, whole thing
over, dream dies.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:22.170
Your four years' preparation
for your big moments are over.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:28.220
And when I spoke to her, she
was just astonishingly candid

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.500
when she said that
she kind of knew

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.640
she wasn't going to win
before she even got there.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.210
She talked about the stress
that was brought down

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.700
from her performance
director and then her coach.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.685
And she said she thought--

00:16:46.685 --> 00:16:48.810
she guessed she was physically
and mentally drained

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.860
before she even arrived.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:57.834
And then she went
into coaching herself.

00:16:57.834 --> 00:16:59.250
At the same time,
British swimming

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.580
was probably the
standout failure

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.569
amongst British sports
during the years leading up

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.310
to London and London as well.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.970
So in the decade
leading up to London,

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.200
British swimming had had total
investment of 52 million quid.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.710
And that was second
only to athletics,

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:22.156
I think, so a huge investment.

00:17:22.156 --> 00:17:25.200
Of that, 52 million
pounds was spread

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.790
over a total of 282 athletes,
some getting a bigger

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.130
share if they were
potential gold medalists.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.341
If they were sort of at
the start of the pathway,

00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:35.340
you get a smaller share.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:41.550
But 52 million over 282
swimmers, and, of 282 swimmers,

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:46.380
total number of gold
medalists it produced was one.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.211
So after--

00:17:47.211 --> 00:17:48.960
DAVID BENSON: Terrible
return on that one.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.110
OWEN SLOT: Terrible return.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.840
So London was a great success.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.990
The significant
failure was swimming.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.790
So for Mel Marshall's
failure in 2004,

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.170
there had been a sequence
of management changes.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.540
So you'd have an Olympics
failure, management change.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.120
They started bringing
in coaches from abroad,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.720
bringing new ideas,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.130
So there was a cycle of
change, cycle of change.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.115
So there was no
cohesion, no consistency,

00:18:15.115 --> 00:18:17.450
and nothing seemed to work.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.890
And then, after London,
again, another change.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:24.550
They brought in
this English guy,

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.490
called Chris Spice, who'd worked
in different sports before,

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.440
wasn't a swimming specialist.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.250
And his appointment
was in place just

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:38.030
before the world championships
a year later in 2013.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.370
So he arrived just before those.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.720
And he only really went
in an observational role,

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.630
because no time to
make any changes

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.290
or work out what
he wanted to do.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.790
So he watched what
happened there.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.700
At those world
championships, Great Britain

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.310
won one bronze medal.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:19:00.140
And he said to me,
his quotes were,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.680
"I was staggered by the
level of under-performance.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.010
I was staggered by the
amount of stress brought down

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.470
by the coaches."

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.800
And so that was from '04 to
'13, nine years the same culture

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:18.780
of fear and stress
amongst the performers.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.650
So Spice did two things.

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.370
He said, how come we're spending
52 million on 282 people

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.370
and getting one gold medalist?

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:31.010
He said, do we really
know what a good swimmer

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.440
or a potential gold
medalist looks like?

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.910
Do we know where
we can spot them?

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.910
At what stage should you
be able to spot someone

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.910
who could win a gold medal?

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:44.000
Do we know what the age
profile for a gold medalist

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.010
is and not just in
swimming overall?

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.410
But there are 34 different
events in swimming,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:54.140
so is there a different age for
a sprinter or a longer distance

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:54.880
swimmer?

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.352
At what stage should a swimmer
reveal himself or herself

00:19:59.352 --> 00:20:00.560
as a potential gold medalist?

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.195
At what stage do
they have to have

00:20:02.195 --> 00:20:07.070
been working with a top coach?

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.570
How many lengths
or what distance

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.420
should they swim or someone swim
a week, a month, or whatever?

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.750
So he had all these questions.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:16.730
And he commissioned
this big data study,

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.160
took on two sport scientists
and effectively said,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.480
you know, give me these answers.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.630
Because we've got
282 swimmers, and we

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.090
don't know really who it is.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.720
And these two sports
scientists eventually

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.340
brought him just tons and tons
of answers and stats and data.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.180
But they said to him,
actually, your number is nine.

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.257
He said, how nine?

00:20:40.257 --> 00:20:41.090
What does nine mean?

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.247
They said, well, it's
our belief that there

00:20:44.247 --> 00:20:45.830
are nine swimmers
in this country that

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.120
could become gold
medalists in the Rio Games.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.042
So that was quite
a startling thing

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:53.750
when you think how
many other people he'd

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.190
been funding at that time.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:21:00.080
So he took the decision, OK,
let's really strip it back.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.190
Let's take those nine.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.530
They became known in the inner
circle as the golden nine.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.904
And the funding was totally
restructured around them.

00:21:07.904 --> 00:21:09.320
They didn't cut
off everyone else,

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.300
but quite a few people were cut
or their funding was shrunk.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.340
And, basically, everything
was given to the golden nine

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.850
to just see if we've got these
top people, what can we get out

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.470
of them.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.650
At the same time, he knew
that his coaching structure

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.160
was wrong.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.860
His management was
wrong in so far

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.290
as the coaches were
bringing all this stress

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.792
down on their athletes.

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.250
And part of the
reason was because,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:39.820
like in many walks of life,
if your team's not doing well,

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.490
then someone's
going to pay for it.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.550
And especially in sports,
where you're so accountable,

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.470
if your athlete's
not doing very well,

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.290
then the coach might
not keep his job.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:55.239
So amongst fellow
coaches who should all

00:21:55.239 --> 00:21:57.530
have been working for the
same thing, which was success

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:00.230
amongst British
swimmers, they started

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.450
competing for each other,
not sharing information,

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.370
becoming terribly protective.

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:08.180
And so he brought in
someone to coach the coaches

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.430
and change the whole
culture of the coaching.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.410
And one of the
coaches that benefited

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:16.010
was Mel Marshall,
who absolutely loved

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:20.750
this new environment of growth
and education and learning.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.600
And so we get to Rio.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.540
There is the great culmination.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.170
So of the golden nine, as
they were, six of the nine

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.060
made it into the British team.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.650
Four of the nine
won medals in Rio.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.040
And one of them
was Adam Peaty, who

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.070
happened to be the kid who
was coached by Mel Marshall.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.000
So from 2004 to that,
I thought was just

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.980
a wonderful turnaround.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:45.771
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:22:45.771 --> 00:22:48.050
I mean, that's an amazing
story, because it's

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:50.750
a good example of how the
book covers everything.

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.320
It's about data and analysis.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.260
It's about funding the big bets.

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.644
There's a lot of leadership
and psychological safety

00:22:56.644 --> 00:22:58.560
and the trust that gets
built up with coaches.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:58.950
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.040
Yeah.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.290
DAVID BENSON: And you really
feel that coming through,

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.110
which is the relationship
between these elite athletes

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.570
and their coaches.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.060
It's almost-- I
mean, I've got kids.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.742
And I think the bond
between the coaches

00:23:11.742 --> 00:23:13.200
and the athletes
is almost stronger

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.870
than that in some senses.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:23.580
The role of the coach
and the athlete,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.560
how did he go about
changing that?

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.804
He brought in a rugby--

00:23:27.804 --> 00:23:28.470
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.990
So the guy he brought in--

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:30.210
DAVID BENSON: --coach to
the coaches, didn't he?

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:30.290
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.890
The guy he brought in
to coach the coaches

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.306
had no history in
swimming at all.

00:23:33.306 --> 00:23:36.720
But he had a back
where he played rugby

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.820
for England and
the British Lions

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.900
and, post-rugby, had
qualified as a rugby coach

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.940
and then started moving
into high performance

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:46.210
more generally.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.970
And so his specialism was
in coach management, if you

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.590
like, management consultancy.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:57.020
So he was brought in
with a fresh set of eyes.

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.160
And he said, himself,
his first meeting

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.660
with some of these
coaches, he could

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.750
see them looking at him
going, hey, you know,

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:04.930
nothing about swimming.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.750
What's all this about then?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.940
And then he started
this conversation

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.770
about how we could
help each other.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.353
And he said, one of the coaches
just put his hand up and said,

00:24:13.353 --> 00:24:15.420
I'm not sharing my
information with anyone else.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.430
And he said, are you serious?

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.340
You think that you can
be better on your own

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.390
rather than with 20 of the best
swimming brains in the country?

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.980
So he slowly had to
break down that culture.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.090
And I think one of the
things from that which

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:34.200
can be sort of applied to life
outside of a swimming pool

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.752
is he introduced the
idea that it wasn't just

00:24:38.752 --> 00:24:40.460
the athletes that
could be a benchmarked.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.626
So, obviously, if you're a
swimmer, then your times'

00:24:42.626 --> 00:24:44.460
in the pool, you know,
it's on a stopwatch.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:49.200
Everyone knows how good you are,
day by day, over a four year

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.280
period.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.180
And so it was the swimmers
that were being benchmarked.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.150
And he persuaded the
coaches that, actually, they

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.190
were performers
themselves, and that they

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.510
should be benchmarked, as well.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.302
And it wasn't just the
success of their athletes

00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:04.260
that was being watched.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.580
It was their own performance
and their own demeanor.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.450
And probably all of them
had swum to a decent level,

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.600
themselves, at some stage.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.760
So this triggered their
own competitive instinct

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.780
of how they could improve,
rather than just handing down

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.940
what they thought were the
fruits of success, the seeds

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.660
of success, to their athletes.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.741
It was we have to
improve ourselves.

00:25:30.741 --> 00:25:32.240
And I think that
is something that's

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.830
still in British
swimming is the idea

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.740
that just because you make
it as a coach, that's not it.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.789
You improve all the time.

00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:39.580
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.410
So there's sort of
continuous improvement.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.230
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.813
DAVID BENSON: Sort
of within the book,

00:25:43.813 --> 00:25:46.060
you actually debunk a lot
of conventional wisdom.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.018
So there's this-- we've
all heard of, you know,

00:25:48.018 --> 00:25:48.780
10,000 hours.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.970
And you've got to do 10,000
hours to master a subject.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.250
But, actually, you've
got a number of examples

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.044
where that's debunked.

00:25:58.044 --> 00:25:58.710
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:04.290
So one of the challenges I have
with the book was my editor

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.760
wanted it to be a success
manual, if you like.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.304
And you've probably seen quite
a lot of those sort of books.

00:26:11.304 --> 00:26:12.720
And a lot of them
are really good.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.820
But what he really,
really wanted

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:20.860
from me was an answer, a
sort of how to be successful,

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.050
so he could put it on the
front cover, like grit

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.640
or 10,000 hours or genetics.

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.580
Or what is the secret, you know?

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.200
How you part your
hair or whether you

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.360
work for Google or
something, is that what

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.660
actually makes you successful?

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:42.000
And that was, obviously,
in part a marketing tool.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.220
But there are so many
books that are out there,

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.250
at the moment, that say,
if you do this one thing,

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.090
then you become successful.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.880
And I had a massive
struggle with that.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.140
Because, though I tried
to please my editor

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.360
and deliver what
he wanted, the fact

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.270
is that, if you're writing about
27 gold medals or whatever,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.270
you've got 27 different stories.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.996
And as I started saying
to him, after a while,

00:27:08.996 --> 00:27:10.620
we're just kidding
our readers if we're

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.470
going to tell them there is
one thing that all these 27

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.270
people did that's collective,
that is your secret to success.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.720
And so it's not just
your 10,000 hours,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.060
or it's not just
your leadership,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.600
or your environment,
or your talent ID,

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.170
it's all these things.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.430
But if we get to tell all these
stories in a different way,

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.120
then actually it's 101
different things, which I think

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.130
is actually more interesting.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.680
It doesn't give
you the opportunity

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.530
to put one simple answer
on the book and say,

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:45.360
success is straightforward.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.420
I mean, it would be boring
if winning a gold medal

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.450
was as simple as just follow
Owen Slot's Book of A to Z,

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.580
and, probably, in
the first chapter,

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.990
we can tell you how to do it.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.760
DAVID BENSON: Well, I was
obviously disappointed, myself.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.705
OWEN SLOT: You know,
it's very complicated.

00:27:57.705 --> 00:27:58.205
Yeah.

00:27:58.205 --> 00:27:59.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.410
DAVID BENSON: Sorry.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.480
OWEN SLOT: It's just a
very complicated thing.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.844
And especially in
British Olympic sport,

00:28:08.844 --> 00:28:10.260
which, as I was
say before, you've

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.810
got some sports, like rowing,
where people have been winning

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.320
medals from way back, and they
have a sophisticated system

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.000
and are expected to
win a lot of medals,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.590
to you're sort of start-up
companies, like trampolining,

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.300
for instance, which won
one medal out of nowhere,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.080
or diving, for instance,
where Great Britain never

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.700
won anything, and now we won
a gold, silver, and a bronze

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.630
in Rio.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.420
Or gymnastics, you know,
the British gymnastics team

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:41.340
were sort of the joke
amongst the high performing

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.730
world until 2004.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.400
Then suddenly, 2008, out of
nowhere, a silver medal's

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.650
won by a kid called Louis Smith.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:54.600
And then in 2012, there's
a team medal that's won.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.290
And Beth Tweddle wins the
first female gymnastics

00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:58.980
medal for ages.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.890
And then in Rio,
two gold medals won

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.199
within an hour of each other.

00:29:03.199 --> 00:29:03.990
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.865
OWEN SLOT: And that's
just come from nowhere.

00:29:05.865 --> 00:29:07.890
And they're all different.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:12.390
And they're all stories of
how talented people became

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.307
the best in the world.

00:29:13.307 --> 00:29:15.139
DAVID BENSON: So one
of the stories I really

00:29:15.139 --> 00:29:17.280
liked in the talent
ID was it really

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.490
feels that part of
that success story

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:21.501
is actually finding
the right people

00:29:21.501 --> 00:29:23.250
and the talent to put
into that pipeline--

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:23.340
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.715
DAVID BENSON: --in
the beginning.

00:29:24.715 --> 00:29:27.330
And there were some really
interesting ways in which

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:28.810
they found that talent.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.020
So one of them was this
chap went to a university.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.240
And he literally put two
pieces of colored tape

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.890
next a door, a red and a
blue, at certain heights.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.640
And if you were taller
than that, he went,

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.620
you'd be a good rower.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.420
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.170
DAVID BENSON: And, you
know, red for women

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.385
and blue for men, basically.

00:29:44.385 --> 00:29:44.910
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:46.260
DAVID BENSON: And then
he would just literally

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.750
walk up to these students as
they picked up their student

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:51.480
cards to say, have you
ever thought about rowing?

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.090
That's an amazing
leap, isn't it?

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:58.200
I mean, he's literally casting
that net really broadly.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.330
Are there any other,
sort of anecdotes

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:04.170
where you think
someone really just

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:09.504
did something very different
in order to source that talent?

00:30:09.504 --> 00:30:10.170
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:18.480
I mean, they pushed their
areas of learning to work out

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.420
how to find successful people.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.270
I mean, so for me, one of
the complete culture changes

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.540
in British sport,
from '96 to now,

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:34.050
is, in '96, pretty
much the only way

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:37.200
you could become a medalist,
a British Olympic medalist,

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.730
was if you found your
own way to the top.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.740
So if you happened to
be put into a sport,

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.455
through your school or your
parent's enthusiasm, whatever,

00:30:46.455 --> 00:30:47.880
and you happened
to be good at it,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.550
and you happened to find the
right coach at the right time,

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:53.550
then you might happen to
find your way to the top.

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.250
Whereas, over the next
20 years, the sort

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.560
of the culture completely
changed, which was, let's

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.404
not just feed off
those happy accidents,

00:31:01.404 --> 00:31:02.820
where we find
people who are good,

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.750
let's just go looking for them.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.700
So it was like, let's work
out what good looks like

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.020
rather than let's just do the
best of what good comes to us.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.257
So in the diving,
for instance, I

00:31:16.257 --> 00:31:17.840
loved the way they
did it with diving.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:23.280
So the question was, what
does a good diver look like?

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.600
And one of the straightforward
answers to that is a good diver

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.900
looks Chinese, because
the Chinese divers

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.650
tend to win 80% of the gold
medals over the previous 20

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.540
Olympics.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.900
Well, that's good to know.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.450
So how do we feed off that?

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:42.210
Well, just so happened that, in
the sort of early '00s, there

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:48.100
was a Chinese elite diving camp
at Crystal Palace diving pool,

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.600
every year.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.190
They used to do a
week's camp there

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.710
before one of the big
European competitions.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.400
And so UK Sport said to
the Chinese diving people,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.457
you can come and use Crystal
Palace, still, as your camp,

00:32:01.457 --> 00:32:03.540
if we can come and do a
research project with you.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.940
So they go, OK,
that's fair enough.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.860
So the Chinese divers come in.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.550
And the talent ID
person of British diving

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.680
goes and meets the
divers and does

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:19.920
a complete physiological
study on size, arm length,

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.515
leg length, the
whole sort of thing,

00:32:22.515 --> 00:32:25.680
asked about their background,
their history, when

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.160
they got started
coaching, basically got

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.740
the full map of what a gold
medal diver could look like,

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.390
brought that back,
tried to work out

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.100
what that would look
like if you put it

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.830
into a seven or eight-year-old.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:45.150
And then from then on, they did
a massive talent ID program,

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.509
very, very specific.

00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:48.300
You had no chance of
being on it unless you

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.470
live within a 20-mile radius of
a diving pool in the country.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:54.360
So if you lived
near Crystal Palace

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.111
or if you lived near Plymouth
or if you lived near Leeds, then

00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:58.110
you'd have got a chance.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.401
And they went into the schools.

00:32:59.401 --> 00:33:01.200
And they got them to
do these tests to see

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.420
if they could be anything like
what these Chinese divers were

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:04.920
like.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.030
And then, funnily enough,
Tom Daley came from Plymouth.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.550
That's where he was found.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.410
And then the result was seen
in Rio where, as you say,

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.810
we got a gold medal, a silver
medal, and a bronze medal

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.917
from a talent ID program that
had started 12 years earlier.

00:33:22.917 --> 00:33:24.750
DAVID BENSON: Well,
that's an amazing story.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.170
And it sort of applies
to us, because it's

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.520
like, understand
what good looks like

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.920
and what you need to do the job.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.320
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.270
DAVID BENSON: And
then go and define

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.470
where are you going to go
and find those people that

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.754
fit the profile to do the job.

00:33:33.754 --> 00:33:34.420
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.878
DAVID BENSON: And
actually removing

00:33:35.878 --> 00:33:38.050
all of those biases,
which is the good divers

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.702
will have come up through
the old traditional roots.

00:33:40.702 --> 00:33:42.660
OWEN SLOT: Yeah, because
their mum or dad said,

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.780
let's go and try diving.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:44.040
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.480
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.480
DAVID BENSON: And, in
fact, some of these people

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.656
had never been diving
before until they got put

00:33:48.656 --> 00:33:49.530
through this program.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:50.196
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:51.960
And their testing
program didn't require

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.210
them to go near water, either.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.710
It was sort of jumping or
different things, you know?

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.226
The water was sort
of a side track.

00:33:58.226 --> 00:33:59.017
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:33:59.017 --> 00:34:00.590
Well, one of the particular
ones I love-- just

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.500
to share it with the room to
tease you to buy the book--

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.556
was for the taekwondo
team, where, again,

00:34:04.556 --> 00:34:05.680
were incredibly successful.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.930
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.430
DAVID BENSON: It
was literally just,

00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:10.250
can you do 35 head
kicks in a minute?

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.449
And if you could, you
were in the program.

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:13.130
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.263
DAVID BENSON: And, we
excel in taekwondo now.

00:34:15.263 --> 00:34:15.929
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.610
DAVID BENSON: It's
some amazing stuff.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:20.920
Let's talk a little bit
about the translation.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.219
This is, first and foremost,
an amazing read on what goes on

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.350
and how we succeed
in the Olympics.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.210
But there is transition
and translation

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:33.940
to business and things we can
all do to achieve performance,

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.459
I guess.

00:34:36.459 --> 00:34:39.580
As you said, there's
no simple formula.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.650
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:45.639
DAVID BENSON: But how should
we think about ourselves maybe?

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.949
Because we are both--

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.134
this is all about helping
athletes achieve success.

00:34:50.134 --> 00:34:50.800
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.341
DAVID BENSON: Should
we see ourselves

00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:55.510
as the athletes or the
coaches or a bit of both?

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.146
How do we start to
translate from this sort

00:34:58.146 --> 00:35:02.980
of elite sporting environment
into our world, do you think?

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.250
OWEN SLOT: Well, I'd say
everyone's an athlete, really.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.526
Even, right to the top, you're
a performer in your own way.

00:35:10.526 --> 00:35:12.400
And I think that's where
swimming went wrong,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.340
for so long, is the
coaches forgot that they

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.870
were performers, themselves.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:19.790
I think everyone
is the performer.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.330
What I like about
what UK Sport did

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:26.590
is they went into
different businesses,

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.570
if you like, and
tried to work out

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:32.366
how and why they were
performing and how they

00:35:32.366 --> 00:35:33.490
could be performing better.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.198
And one of the stories
that I really like

00:35:35.198 --> 00:35:38.460
is a Paralympian
called Dave Henson.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.990
He was an Afghanistan soldier.

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.060
He was in the Royal Engineers.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.190
February 2011, he
stepped on a mine

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:53.260
and lost best part
of one of his legs.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.360
Two years later,
he was back at home

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.300
and was taken to a
talent ID center.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:03.040
And this sort of rather
cute little idea that you're

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.920
a servicemen, now
you're injured,

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.530
therefore, you could
be a Paralympian.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:12.370
So for London 2012, there
was a whole program,

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.980
which took injured
servicemen into London 2012.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.120
And the theory was
quite good, if you like.

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.530
So if you're a serviceman
or servicewoman,

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:26.150
and you've served the British
Army or the Armed Forces,

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.390
then you are, one,
highly trained.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.020
That's part of the deal.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.600
Therefore, you're
highly trainable.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.360
And also, the chances are that
you're reasonably athletic,

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.700
because you probably have done
some quite athletic things.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.440
So, therefore, we
think that you lot,

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.640
who have been injured
in Afghanistan or Iraq,

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.350
could become Paralympians.

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:54.580
In London, there was one guy
who won two silver medals.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:58.120
But afterwards,
the thinking was,

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.820
we didn't get quite the
return from these people

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.890
that we thought we should do.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:05.384
And because it's a
sensitive subject,

00:37:05.384 --> 00:37:07.300
because it was Paralympics,
and because you're

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.860
dealing with injured
servicemen, it

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.740
would be very easy for them to
have just carried on as they

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.170
were, getting mediocre success.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.480
Two silver medals is
not such a bad thing.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.730
They could have carried on
with the program as it was.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.460
But they took the decision
to strip it right back

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:25.960
and ask why weren't we doing
as well as we should have done.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.900
And they went and talked
to all the servicemen

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.960
who had become Paralympians and
asked about their experience.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.500
And they found two
really crucial things.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.390
One was-- what these
serviceman said

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.410
was, when we were
in the army, say,

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.270
or whatever squadron
we were in, we're

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.530
taught to go at the pace
of the slowest person.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.405
You all go at the pace
of the slowest person.

00:37:48.405 --> 00:37:50.560
You look after the slowest
man or the slowest woman

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.185
in your team.

00:37:51.185 --> 00:37:53.060
And now, suddenly, we've
become Paralympians.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.321
And we're told we're supposed
to kick-ass every day

00:37:55.321 --> 00:37:57.820
and not wait for anyone, because
we've got to beat everyone.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.300
And that whole sort of frame of
thinking was totally different.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.600
But even more
significantly, they

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.270
worked out the
really brutal truth

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.090
that no single serviceman,
who ever went to Afghanistan

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.880
or Iraq, ever had
this dream of being

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.130
a Paralympian, funnily enough.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:17.440
Everyone who's been in the
Olympics, at some stage,

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.710
it's been their dream probably
from when they were a kid.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:21.910
That was the ultimate.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.180
But no one in the army ever
wanted to be a Paralympian.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.450
So they had to strip
it back and understand

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:32.540
exactly what was the motivation
of these men and women, who

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.540
they could take to
the Paralympics.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.000
And so they completely
redesigned the program

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.410
around the psychology of what
was in it for these people

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.520
to go to the Paralympics.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.580
And they worked out that
the Paralympics was just

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.080
a real secondary driving force.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.630
So they wanted to
be Paralympians, A,

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.130
for their own self-esteem.

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:58.930
B, because they thought that
might help them as role models

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.420
to their kids, C,
because they just

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.110
saw sport as a way of helping
them become fitter and stronger

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:05.800
again.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:11.390
And so, for every single
person, Paralympic success

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.140
was secondary to something else.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.640
So at the back of
that, they managed

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.820
to sort of psychologically
understand what

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.190
was the driving force.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.930
Instead of just
saying, we know how

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:23.170
to make success in
Paralympics or we

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.240
know how to make you go faster,
they had to go to the athletes

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.150
and say, we want you to tell
us why you want to do this,

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.280
and then we'll work
around you instead.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.250
And so, as you say, if you want
to put that into a business,

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.010
they just stripped
back the whole thing

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.370
and went, well, why
wasn't it working well?

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.900
What did everyone actually
want to achieve out of this?

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.640
And how can we
improve this to do so?

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.645
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:39:44.645 --> 00:39:47.270
And then that to me, again, is
a really helpful learning, which

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.750
is you can lead a project.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.750
But actually to really
drive a successful team,

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.970
you've got to understand
the motivations of all

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:54.730
the individuals in that team.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.540
And what does good
look like for them--

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:56.780
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.670
DAVID BENSON: --as well as,
you know, good for yourself?

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.670
I'm going to open this
to the floor in a second.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:04.167
But I do have one more
question, and then I

00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:05.250
do have a backup, as well.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.490
But because we're
Google, there's

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.867
a large part of this book which
is about innovation in tech.

00:40:10.867 --> 00:40:11.700
OWEN SLOT: Oh, yeah.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.283
DAVID BENSON: You
know, I didn't know,

00:40:13.283 --> 00:40:17.060
but there were 140 projects
involving Formula 1

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.000
engineers and all kinds of
engineers to actually improve

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.850
the technology of our athletes,
so rebuilding the bikes,

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.270
designing the sleds, et cetera.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.320
Just so you know, part of you
sort of goes, is this fair?

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:30.960
Right?

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.212
But every other country
is also doing this.

00:40:33.212 --> 00:40:34.670
So can you maybe
give us an example

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.670
of what was sort of the
biggest wows in terms

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.550
of the technological
innovation that went into that?

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:44.420
And how did we succeed in
bringing that tech innovation

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.080
to the games?

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:45.996
OWEN SLOT: Yeah, sure.

00:40:45.996 --> 00:40:51.560
So, for me, the model in
this is British cycling.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.580
Maybe not so surprising, because
there's so much tech involved

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.320
in a bike, in a skin suit,
in a helmet, in the shoes.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.560
There's so many bits that
have to be aerodynamic

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.740
and can be
aerodynamically improved.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.275
And so when British cycling
started getting competitive,

00:41:09.275 --> 00:41:11.990
it realized that there
were significant gains

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:14.270
to be made from
competing in this area,

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:19.520
as well as having super fit,
super good cyclists themselves.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.990
So there was a program
that started in the lead up

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.930
to the '08 Games, if you like.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:31.320
And they gathered together
a really elite group

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.320
of mega-brains, if you like.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.250
They went round.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.995
They didn't just look
within British cycling

00:41:36.995 --> 00:41:38.120
or British cycling coaches.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.220
They went out to the military.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.155
They went out to
textile industries.

00:41:43.155 --> 00:41:44.780
They went out to
universities and tried

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:49.520
to recruit a group of
disparate intellects

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.680
that could come together,
say, once a month

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.580
or once every six months,
just to pool ideas.

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:54.930
Well, have you
thought about this?

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.096
Have you thought about that?

00:41:56.096 --> 00:42:01.950
So it was a way of tapping
into the bigger work

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:06.100
force or the bigger intellect
in the country, if you like.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.000
So they did that.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.650
So in '08, they produced
faster bikes, faster kits.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.200
And when you talk
to them about that,

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.000
they said that
was like gathering

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.960
the low-hanging fruit.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.410
Because they found that, because
of the way they'd done this,

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.080
they were better than
the opposition countries.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.429
So 2012 came along, and
the opposition countries

00:42:27.429 --> 00:42:28.970
had seen what Great
Britain had done,

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.460
knew that this was a
real area of competition

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.000
that they had to compete in.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.650
But still, Great Britain
were ahead in that respect.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.270
The low-hanging fruit was
sort of harder to find

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.370
or higher-hanging fruit.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:45.710
So by the time they got
to the Rio cycle, again,

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:50.360
how could we use research
and technology and innovation

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.990
to improve the speed
of our cyclists?

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:59.510
And they went, OK, so we
think the marginal gains

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.330
that we can make, from a more
aerodynamic bike or helmet

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:05.820
or whatever, are so small that
we need to look elsewhere.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:10.670
And so they took a shift that I
suspect the other nations will

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:14.420
take for the next
Olympiad, which they went,

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.040
so it's not stuff.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.850
It's not kit.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.340
It's how can we train better.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:23.421
So, for me, it's just this
phenomenally smart thing

00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:23.920
they did.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.470
And it all came from a survey
they did with the athletes.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:28.820
What helps you perform well?

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:32.620
What's impeding
your performance?

00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:36.430
And they came down to this
slightly awkward subject

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:37.520
of saddle sores.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.719
And they did a survey
of the saddle sores.

00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:42.260
And they worked out,
one, that people

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.915
felt awkward about
discussing it,

00:43:43.915 --> 00:43:46.040
especially the female
riders, which is probably not

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.790
really surprising.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.440
And then they were
staggered also

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.910
to find out how many
days training were

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:52.220
missed due to saddle sores.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:57.174
And also, further to that,
because no athlete wants

00:43:57.174 --> 00:43:59.090
to miss a training
session, because that looks

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.130
bad on their
record, the athletes

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.271
have acknowledged,
well, one day a month,

00:44:04.271 --> 00:44:06.020
my training's not as
good as it should be,

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.910
because I'm training
that day when I'm

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:09.560
suffering from saddle sores.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.110
And so instead of trying
to make the bike fast,

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:16.730
they tried to work out how
can we solve that problem.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:21.820
And the solution was
just phenomenally simple.

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.200
There are rules in
cycling on your saddle,

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.650
which the angle of the
saddle, it could only be flat

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.670
or 2 degrees dipped
going that way.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:35.990
They worked out, if they dipped
it by a further 7 degrees,

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:40.980
then the whole problem would
be dramatically solved.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:45.300
And they went to the governing
body of cycling and said,

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.290
listen, this isn't for
us, it's for everyone.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.000
But we reckon we can make our
cyclists healthier and happier

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.660
by doing that.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.780
The whole thing was approved.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.280
No other country knew about it
even though it was written up

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.510
in the UCI document.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.250
And so the success
continued in Rio.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.620
And I can't tell you
how much, but, for me,

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.000
that was just like--

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.980
I mean, sometimes
the best innovations

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.789
and the most satisfying ones
are the simplest, aren't they?

00:45:10.789 --> 00:45:11.580
DAVID BENSON: Yeah.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:11.720
Absolutely.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.290
OWEN SLOT: And that was
certainly one of those.

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:14.331
DAVID BENSON: Absolutely.

00:45:14.331 --> 00:45:16.070
So this has been fascinating.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:20.439
The book has got so many
more examples like that.

00:45:20.439 --> 00:45:21.230
It is mind-blowing.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:23.620
But I just want to open
the questions to the floor.

00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:27.640
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.410
Thanks very much for your time.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:33.175
I was really interested in the
golden nine you spoke about.

00:45:33.175 --> 00:45:33.340
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.900
AUDIENCE: Obviously, you said
there was hundreds of swimmers,

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:35.983
and they found these nine.

00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:37.939
And then they invested
all the money into it.

00:45:37.939 --> 00:45:39.730
How did they find these
nine, what metrics?

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.310
Can you give us some
insight into the specifics

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:44.064
of how they chose these nine?

00:45:44.064 --> 00:45:45.480
How do they recognize
that talent?

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.890
What techniques, what
analysis, did they do?

00:45:47.890 --> 00:45:50.941
And how could we then
use that to spot talent

00:45:50.941 --> 00:45:51.940
in the business context?

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.606
OWEN SLOT: Sure.

00:45:52.606 --> 00:45:55.277
It was largely about just
following an athlete's-- excuse

00:45:55.277 --> 00:45:56.020
me--

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:56.700
pathway.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.700
So they looked a lot at the
two most successful swimming

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.820
nations, Australia
and the United States.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.820
And they looked to all
their gold medalists.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.030
And they worked out how--

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.570
so if you took, say, Michael
Phelps, for instance,

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:14.280
the most famous
swimmer in the world.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.790
So they would
follow his pathway.

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.180
And they would work out at what
stage was he showing himself

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:22.045
as an outstanding swimmer.

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.920
And how good do you have
to be at that stage?

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:28.300
So, for instance,
Great Britain has had--

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.700
still has, but had--

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.180
a pretty successful junior team.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:37.810
And so we were thinking, well,
we've got these good juniors.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:41.210
Therefore, we'll fund them and
take them on into the seniors,

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:43.430
and they should be successful.

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.180
But the more research
they did into it,

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.720
they saw that actually the
correlation between being great

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:53.760
at the age of 14 and 22
doesn't really exist.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:59.090
So they did that comparison
across those two countries.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:01.510
And so for each of
those 34 events,

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:03.295
they sort of worked
out a timeline

00:47:03.295 --> 00:47:09.090
and a pathway of what your
swimmer has to look like.

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.650
At what point can you tell
that they might reach that?

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.760
And they saw that
it was pretty late.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.980
And then they saw,
at that point,

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.220
at what point do they have
to be with a good coach.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.230
And so they put all that
information in and tracked it

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.654
back and saw, well, who's
in that position now.

00:47:25.654 --> 00:47:26.820
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:29.470
So it was more about
physical traits

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.380
rather than, like,
measurable lung

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.792
capacity or speed of
reps, that kind of stuff?

00:47:34.792 --> 00:47:36.250
OWEN SLOT: Well,
it would have been

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.510
their performance in the pool.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.428
So, yeah.

00:47:39.428 --> 00:47:40.136
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.780
AUDIENCE: Just following
on that question--

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.592
why do you think other
countries couldn't do that?

00:47:47.592 --> 00:47:48.800
OWEN SLOT: Why they couldn't?

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.425
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:49.425 --> 00:47:52.250
So whatever metrics we talked
about, that's very public,

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.750
right?

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:53.416
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:47:53.416 --> 00:47:55.730
AUDIENCE: So any country,
let's say China or India,

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.740
can also go and look
at the US metrics

00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.050
and think, oh, I
could also do that.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:03.980
So what is the difference that
we did that others couldn't do?

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:09.750
Or have you researched
into that or you thought?

00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:13.850
OWEN SLOT: I think
what Great Britain did,

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:15.770
which was different, was--

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:18.020
as you say, other
people can work that out

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:20.860
if they're prepared to put
the time and effort into it.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.200
It's not insurmountable.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.120
But it was the way that they
invested so heavily in such

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.140
a small group of people.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:32.570
So they really, really backed
themselves to do it that way

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:34.920
and identified who that was.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.930
And I think-- so it
sounds quite simple.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.980
But, at the time, when
the British team did it,

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.580
it was controversial.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:51.260
And so, for instance, the best
British swimmer at the time

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.100
was a young man
called Liam Tancock.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.910
And he was a double
world champion.

00:48:58.910 --> 00:49:01.370
He won the Commonwealth Games.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:06.080
So he was kind of like the face
of British swimming almost.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.310
But they followed
sort of his time line.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:13.160
And they saw, well, by
the time you go to Rio,

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.640
you're actually going
to be 32 years old.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:19.760
And so we think that
takes you way out

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.370
of reach of what could
potentially win a gold medal.

00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:24.530
And so they cut his
funding altogether.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:28.280
And so, that's
effectively saying

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.950
we decided to cut the
funding of our best athlete.

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:34.239
So I think it was
as much the bravery

00:49:34.239 --> 00:49:36.030
to push it to the
extreme as anything else.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:37.280
AUDIENCE: Here and then over--

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:41.490
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:42.240
I'm halfway through the book.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.800
It's a fantastic
read, even for those

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.180
who don't enjoy sport too much.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:48.750
And I'm conscious, both in
the book and in your answers,

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:50.250
you're sort of a
bit reluctant to go

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.530
too far into lessons for
business and the rest of us.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:54.210
But I wondered.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:56.040
You know, you've been covering
this story for a long time.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.460
It's an amazing turnaround.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:01.050
If you were looking at your
own professional life, editor

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:02.430
of "The Times" or
Rupert Murdoch,

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:05.730
what would you do differently
and apply from those lessons

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:06.912
to your world?

00:50:06.912 --> 00:50:07.896
OWEN SLOT: Shit.

00:50:07.896 --> 00:50:10.848
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.380
OK.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.830
Now, that's really interesting.

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:24.440
So if I was to apply that to
what I did, then I would be--

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.190
so if I was following
that to the extreme,

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:29.790
I would be looking at
what the successful sports

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:33.120
writers did, which I think
is something I did do.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.890
So I wanted to be
a sports writer.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:38.460
So I used to hoover up
the best sports writing,

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:40.920
all the sports writers I
really liked and looked

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.370
at how they reported, how
they wrote, et cetera.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.060
So to answer your question,
what I should then be doing

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.450
is going, well, what
happened to the best sports

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.470
writers when they got
to a decent position?

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.890
So I was sent to cover
Olympics age of 28.

00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.250
I thought, Christ, I've made it.

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:04.260
And so what happens next?

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:05.700
I was really happy to be there.

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.710
But some sports
writers then went on

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:12.230
to becoming news reporters,
foreign correspondents.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.790
Some went to become
sports editors.

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:20.220
And then the guy who took
me on at "The Times,"

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:21.330
he was the sports editor.

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:23.954
He went on to become the deputy
editor of "The Times," and then

00:51:23.954 --> 00:51:25.350
deputy news editor of the BBC.

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:28.990
So maybe I should be looking
at their pathways and going,

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:31.290
you know, how or
why did they do it?

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:33.660
I mean, I did want to be a
sports editor for a while.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.460
And I probably
never cracked what

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:38.559
it was that was
their talent that I

00:51:38.559 --> 00:51:39.600
should have been pushing.

00:51:43.721 --> 00:51:44.720
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:45.990
That was really interesting.

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:48.400
So I used to work for
a venture capital firm.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.490
And one of the projects
I was looking at

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:53.060
was how can we spot founders
before they're founders.

00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.790
So how can you start to
look at founder attributes?

00:51:56.790 --> 00:52:00.870
Do you think you can apply any
of the thinking or methodology

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:03.330
to kind of early start-up
founders or those

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:06.960
within that kind of high
growth technology sector?

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:13.700
OWEN SLOT: So, I apologize.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:14.820
Can you explain founder?

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.055
Do you mean a founder
of a start-up company?

00:52:17.055 --> 00:52:17.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.730
Yeah.

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:22.460
So the company would invest in
kind of later-stage founders,

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:24.043
but we were trying
to work out, can we

00:52:24.043 --> 00:52:25.745
spot prospective
founders, either when

00:52:25.745 --> 00:52:28.070
they are at university or
when they are at school,

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:30.710
and then hone their talent.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.530
So I was wondering
if you could apply

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:37.244
any of that kind of thinking to
founders or technology leaders.

00:52:37.244 --> 00:52:37.910
OWEN SLOT: Yeah.

00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:42.700
I think-- so, one
of the chapters

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:47.800
that I was interested in,
in the book, was shooting.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:55.040
So, again, shooting was
maybe not far off a start-up,

00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.450
if you like.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:57.620
They didn't win very much.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.110
And they wanted to
know how to do better.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:05.720
And for the shooting
team, UK Sport

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.130
brought in someone
from private equity,

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:12.730
who was a professional
in investing in start-ups

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:15.200
and also turning
around companies

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.400
and working out how can
we apply that to sports.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:24.250
And they tried to take those
very philosophies to shooting.

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:29.630
And I guess the
founder that they

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:35.450
brought in there was the guy
who became chief executive of--

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.450
sorry, performance director
of British shooting.

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:44.900
And he was encouraged to
try to address shooting as

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.510
if it was a start-up company.

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:52.790
And so he wrote a performance
plan and very much along

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:57.350
business terms of how we can do
it and how far we can achieve

00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:59.562
and how we're going to do that.

00:53:59.562 --> 00:54:01.520
And his first business
plan was sent right back

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.070
to him saying you've not
been ambitious enough.

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:06.740
So one of the things that--

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:07.240
yeah.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.600
So one of the elements that UK
Sport are always looking for

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.830
is people to lead sports.

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:18.980
I think they're better now
at finding athletes than they

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.600
are at finding leaders.

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.940
And they have got to
the point where they're

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:25.490
trying to talent ID
for prospective leaders

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:30.031
as well as prospective
Olympic gold medallists.

00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:31.030
DAVID BENSON: Brilliant.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:33.660
Well, look, I think
we're out of time.

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.840
And we could carry on
forever, but people

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.227
have got to get to meetings.

00:54:37.227 --> 00:54:38.810
So, Owen, I just
want to say thank you

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:42.200
very much, both for a fantastic
session and an amazing book.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.180
So if we can have everyone
give him a round of applause,

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:43.930
that would be great.

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:44.805
OWEN SLOT: Thank you.

00:54:44.805 --> 00:54:48.480
[APPLAUSE]
