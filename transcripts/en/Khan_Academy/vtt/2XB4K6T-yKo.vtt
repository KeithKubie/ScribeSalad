00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:01.594
- [Voiceover] We know
from previous videos,

00:00:01.594 --> 00:00:04.575
that the derivative with respect to X

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:08.408
of the natural log of
X, is equal to 1 over X.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.718
What I want to do in this
video is use that knowledge

00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:17.031
that we've seen in other
videos to figure out

00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:19.929
what the derivative with respect to X is

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.412
of a logarithm of an arbitrary base.

00:00:23.412 --> 00:00:27.162
So I'm just gonna call
that log, base A of X.

00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:32.328
So how do we figure this out?

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:35.198
Well, the key thing is, is
what you might be familiar with

00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:37.566
from your algebra or your
pre calculus classes,

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.186
which is having a change of base.

00:00:40.186 --> 00:00:43.306
So if I have some, I'll do it over here,

00:00:43.306 --> 00:00:47.597
log, base A of B, and
I wanted to change it

00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:49.436
to a different base, let's
say I wanna change it

00:00:49.436 --> 00:00:53.603
to base C, this is the same
thing as log, base C of B

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.763
divided by log, base C of A.

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:08.050
Log, base C of B, divided
by log, base C of A.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.777
This is a really useful
thing if you've never

00:01:09.777 --> 00:01:11.700
seen it before, you now have just seen it,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.873
this change of base, and we prove it

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.520
in other videos on Khan Academy.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.499
But it's really useful
because, for example,

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:21.006
your calculator has a log button.

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.740
The log on your calculator
is log, base 10.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.557
So if you press 100 into your calculator

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:31.734
and press log, you will get a 2 there.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:33.935
So whenever you just see log of 100,

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:37.195
it's implicitly base 10,
and you also have a button

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:40.372
for natural log, which is log, base E.

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:44.205
Natural log of X is equal
to log, base E of X.

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:48.146
But sometimes, you wanna
find all sorts of different

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:52.298
base logarithms and this is how you do it.

00:01:52.298 --> 00:01:54.722
So if you're using your
calculator and you wanted to find

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:58.055
what log, base 3 of 8 is, you would say,

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:05.979
you would type in your
calculator log of 8 and log of 3.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.248
Or, let me write it this way, and log of 3

00:02:09.248 --> 00:02:11.700
where both of these
are implicitly base 10,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.121
and you'd get the same value if you did

00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:16.871
natural log of 8 divided
by natural log of 3.

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:19.920
Which you might also
have on your calculator.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.988
And what we're gonna do
in this video is leverage

00:02:23.988 --> 00:02:26.412
the natural log because we
know what the derivative

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.586
of the natural log is.

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:31.929
So this derivative is the
same thing as the derivative

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:33.679
with respect to X of.

00:02:35.273 --> 00:02:38.394
Well log, base A of X, can be rewritten as

00:02:38.394 --> 00:02:41.644
natural log of X over natural log of A.

00:02:43.994 --> 00:02:46.056
And now natural log of
A, that's just a number.

00:02:46.056 --> 00:02:50.626
I could rewrite this as,
let me write it this way.

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:54.709
One over natural log of
A times natural log of X.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.094
And what's the derivative of that?

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.128
We could just take the constant out.

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:02.357
One over natural log of
A, that's just a number.

00:03:02.357 --> 00:03:06.435
So we're gonna get 1
over the natural log of A

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:10.602
times the derivative with
respect to X of natural log of X.

00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:16.684
Of natural log of X.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.264
Which we already know is 1 over X.

00:03:20.264 --> 00:03:23.134
So this thing right
over here, is 1 over X.

00:03:23.134 --> 00:03:27.301
So what we get is 1 over
natural log of A times 1 over X.

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:33.403
Which we could write as, 1
over natural log of A times X.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.388
Which is a really useful thing to know.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:46.317
So now, we could take
all sorts of derivatives.

00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:50.484
So if I were to tell you F of
X is equal to log, base 7 of X

00:03:56.654 --> 00:04:01.084
well now we can say well F
prime of X is going to be

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:04.084
1 over the natural log of 7 times X.

00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:11.199
If we had a constant out
front, if we had for example,

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:12.648
G of X.

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:16.815
G of X is equal to negative
3 times log, base, I know.

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.394
Log, base pi.

00:04:20.394 --> 00:04:21.564
Pi is a number.

00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:25.731
Log, base pi of X, well G
prime of X would be equal to

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:29.252
1 over, oh.

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.013
Let me be careful, I have
this constant out here.

00:04:32.013 --> 00:04:35.914
So it'd be negative 3 over,
it's just that negative 3,

00:04:35.914 --> 00:04:38.164
over the natural log of pi.

00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:42.128
This is the natural log of this number.

00:04:42.128 --> 00:04:42.961
Times X.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.879
So hopefully, that gives
you a hang of things.
