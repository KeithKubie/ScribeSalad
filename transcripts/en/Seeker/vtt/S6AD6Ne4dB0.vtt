00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.629
Usually we think the brain is in charge, not
the heart, but in Soviet Russia, heartbeat

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:05.629
controls YOU.

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:06.629
Actually.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.940
That's misleading… your heartbeat can control
you all the time, regardless of your sociopolitical

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.280
system or country of origin.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.290
Hey heart-beaters, Trace here for Dnews.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.620
You probably know that the way you feel can
affect your heart rate.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.430
If you’re feelin’ calm, your heart rate’s
nice and slow, chances are you don’t even

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.430
feel it.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.340
And when faced with fear or… something really
exciting, you might feel your heart pounding

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.370
away in your chest.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.640
But your heart rate doesn't just respond to
what you're feeling, it can -in some ways-

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.420
control how you feel by changing the way you
process incoming information.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.650
A study lead by Dr. Sarah Garfinkel and published
in 2016 in the Journal Trends in Cognitive

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.790
Sciences found cardiovascular arousal, or
that state where your heart is pumping faster

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.280
or harder than normal, can actually intensify
your feelings of fear and anxiety.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.780
The researchers say this happens because every
heartbeat- the strength, the timing- is signaled

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.450
to the brain thanks to receptors in the blood
vessels called baroreceptors.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.299
When the heart rate and blood pressure increase,
baroreceptors tell this to the brain, and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.499
it’s thought that the brain can interpret
that signal as fear.

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:12.920
In a set of studies by Garfinkel, participants
were shown images of faces -- some that looked

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.640
neutral, and some that looked scary.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.060
Researchers timed the images so that some
would coincide with when participants hearts

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.079
were contracting and pumping blood -- the
systole phase -- and others would coincide

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.490
with when the heart was relaxing, or in the
diastole phase.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.609
Turns out the participants could spot the
scary images faster when the heart was contracting

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.310
than when it was relaxing.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.969
The same effect was not seen with the neutral
images.

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.119
In fact, the neutral images were perceived
slightly more at the diastole phase.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.420
And in another study published in the Journal
of Neuroscience, Swiss researchers found that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.889
when the participants were shown a flashing
object that was in sync with their heartrate,

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.859
it took them longer to even notice it compared
to when it was not in sync.

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:58.639
It was as though the heart rate cancelled
out some of the incoming information.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:04.880
There is also some evidence showing that heart
rate may impact the way we perceive time.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.679
Researchers out of the Japan Society of Kansei
Engineering tested this theory on 48 people

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.460
with the help of a little music.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.659
They varied the tempo of the music and by
putting the study participants on exercise

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.200
bikes, they could speed up or slow down their
heart rates.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.860
The authors found that with a slight increase
in heartrate, people underestimated how long

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.099
the music was.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.910
With a really fast heart rate they overestimated
the duration, thinking the music lasted longer

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.910
than it really did.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.050
And still another study published in the journal
Biological Psychology found that people who

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.150
are more sensitive or aware of their own heartbeat
are better at judging duration of time.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.000
I feel like that's totally me.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.980
The thing is, it's not a superpower.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.799
A study published by Chemnitz University of
Technology in Germany found that heart rate

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.720
alone may not actually be to blame when you
feel like time is dragging by.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.870
They showed subjects a presentation while
they were either exercising or holding their

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.319
breaths.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.390
Exercising would increase their heart rate,
while breath-holding would actually slow it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.730
down.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.950
Participants were then asked to rate how intense
they thought the strain of the activity was

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.170
and how long they thought it took.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.560
The results showed that intense strain -- or
what the researchers called arousal -- led

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.799
to higher time estimates than just faster
heart rate.

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.620
We like to think of ourselves as higher animals,
with the brain driving the body; completely

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.060
rational and independent of our ancient programming,
but studies like these show our biology is

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.280
affecting our perception of time, our decision-making
and how we look at the world around us!

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.829
We're just big dumb animals after all.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.989
Sorry, my heartbeat was really high on that
one, forgive me.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.890
This isn't the first story we've done about
how your body controls you!

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.310
The heart isn't alone in this!

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.000
Amy has a video about how our gut instincts
might actually be real, here . Can you feel

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
your heartbeat?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.520
Do you have a burning science question?
