00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.470
For a movie that almost didn't get made in
the first place, Star Wars has done pretty

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.710
well for itself.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.820
Throngs of creative-types credit the franchise
as having a huge influence on them.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.000
And as a result has impacted the world in
a way that almost no other series has.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.850
But after seeing these bloopers, we know that
the key to success is not taking yourself

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.850
too seriously.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.280
And hey, if you like what we’re about to
show you, or we missed one of your favorites,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.380
let us know in the comments, would ya?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:36.579
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Amazing Star Wars
Bloopers.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.690
Freeze Frame (V)

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.840
The Star Wars franchise is full of shots that
make Harrison Ford look like a badass.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.480
But if you take a look at the behind the scenes
footage, you’ll quickly realize how much

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.769
help he’s getting from the folks off-screen.

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.679
In one scene where he and the gang bust in
on Darth Vader, Han Solo pulls his gun and

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.219
fires off a quick shot.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.339
Apparently that was the queue for the entire
cast to freeze— and a hand slowly reaches

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.530
into the shot and replaces Solo’s weapon.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.399
It’s pretty ridiculous for everyone to tableau
in the middle of a battle, but you gotta do

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:10.549
what you gotta do when it comes to getting
the right shot.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.420
Storm-TRIPPERS (IV)
As far as company-issued uniforms go, the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.790
Stormtroopers have it pretty good.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.549
They to carry sweet blasters, wear a snazzy
futuristic suit of armor, and a helmet so

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.520
they never have to worry about their hair.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.380
But no job is risk-free, especially if you
sign up to fight for the dark side.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.240
They live under the constant threat of being
murdered by their leader, murdered by their

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.729
enemies, or murdered by their own outfits.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.680
The gag-reel footage of Stormtroopers slipping,
tripping, or being trampled on, is almost

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.820
limitless.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.259
R2-DEAD2 (I)
R2D2 is not exactly nimble, and rolling over

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.979
uneven terrain has proven to be a challenge
for the droid.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.010
In The Phantom Menace’s extras, the blooper
reel shows R2 falling over in the background

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.630
in multiple scenes which, obviously, is hilarious.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.329
But our favorite happens when Padmé and Anakin
are walking along behind a masked extra.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:01.820
who full-on walks into the poor droid, nearly
knocking him over.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.079
Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman are able to
keep their composure for about one nanosecond

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:07.159
before cracking up.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.840
It’s not the only thing wrong with Episode
1, and to some fans, the entire movie feels

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
like a blooper.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.260
But it’s always funny when a robot falls
down.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.580
Constructive Criticism (VII)
Before 2015, almost nobody had heard the name

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.750
Daisy Ridley.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.500
She turned from being a relative unknown into
a Hollywood it-girl overnight.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.290
Thus is the power of the Star Wars franchise.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.470
The Force Awakens was a hugely successful
installment, and appealed to both the franchises

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.210
old school fans and created some new ones
too.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.821
But on the first day of filming, Ridley wasn’t
exactly sure how much longer she’d have

00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:42.821
a job.

00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:46.849
The actress was on the receiving end of some
criticism from director JJ Abrams, and she

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.440
may or may not have cried— immediately,
on set, in front of everyone.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.440
But!

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.080
If she hadn’t had this experience, the movie
could have turned out a lot differently.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.790
Laughing Leia (IV)
Have you ever started laughing in the middle

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.819
of an argument?

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.430
If you have, then you know one of two things
can happen: either your giggling will break

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.739
the tension, or, it will make everything exponentially
worse.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.599
Governor Tarkin is the stone-cold killer who’s
really pulling the strings on the Deathstar.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.129
Vader may get all the glory, but Tarkin is
the real deal.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.750
Princess Leia pleads with him to not blow
up her home planet of Alderaan, and, like

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.830
a total dick, he ignores her super reasonable
request.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.299
It’s a tense moment in the final cut, but
the actor playing Tarkin took a few times

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.769
to get his lecturing right.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:35.960
And a couple of times in the process he outright
laughed.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.420
Fender Bender (VI)
There are legions of fans who specialize in

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.530
the minutiae of the franchises canon, and
their level of expertise is intense.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.810
But one of the most interesting sub-fandoms
to emerge from the series is dedicated to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.040
transportation.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.519
Every ship is unique, and seems to have its
own personality.

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.840
But a lot of people prefer a smaller, zippier
option.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.090
Like the speeder bikes!

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.579
At some point or another, every die-hard Star
Wars enthusiast has probably imagined themselves

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.329
racing through the forests of Endor on the
back of one.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.720
So the people who got to ride them in real
life probably had a great time, right?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.720
Wrong.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.150
Almost immediately after hopping on, one of
the crew crashed into a tree.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.100
Guess those bikes aren’t as nimble as they
look.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.209
Tongue Twister (IV)
If you want to live in space, there are a

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.670
couple of things you need to know.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.810
First, you’ve gotta make sure you look the
part.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.441
Next, you have to learn the lingo.

00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:30.060
Finally, you have to say the lingo while looking
the part and make no mistake, that is not

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.490
as easy as it sounds.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.740
Mark Hamill knows this firsthand.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.090
While filming the attack on the Deathstar,
the actor was wearing a helmet secured with

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.090
a chin strap.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.860
Aside from being proper procedure, donning
a helmet just seems like a responsible choice.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.050
But as a result, the actor had one hell of
a time trying to verbalize the word “supernova”,

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:59.400
and the blooper reel has proof.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.590
Man On a Wire (V)
In any movie, the action sequence is only

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.560
as good as the stunt crew who perform it.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.080
Even though there are usually a great deal
of safety measures put in place, things can

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.590
still go sideways.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.690
While filming the battle of Hoth, one of the
stuntmen got a colder ride than he was supposed

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.690
to.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.840
The rope he was attached to didn't quite lift
him fast enough, and ended up dragging him

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.730
for a few feet before pulling him out of the
snowy wake they’d accidentally created.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.460
But to be fair, the final product looks pretty
badass, so obviously production hired the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.130
right team.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.430
Game Over (II)
It’s no secret that it takes a lot of dollars

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.979
to create the feeling of a galaxy far, far
away.

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.370
You may have heard that the Star Wars movies
are kind of expensive to make.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.250
So when props or set-pieces get busted up,
it’s safe to assume they’ll take a couple

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.790
bucks to replace.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.340
Imagine the dread Hayden Christensen must
have felt when one his ship’s joysticks

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.650
broke off in his hand in the middle of a take.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.840
He played it off like a pro, but somewhere
on set there was probably a production manager

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:02.789
who was having a heart attack about it.

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.599
Sound Check (IV)
Perhaps the best thing that could have happened

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.490
to Harrison Ford was being cast in the role
of reluctant good-guy Han Solo.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.320
And many fans agree that every time he hopped
into the Millennium Falcon, Ford brought his

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.570
A-game with him.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.240
But some of Solo’s lines proved to be a
little trickier than others — especially

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.289
if they had to be said really fast.

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.940
The extras show a take where he messes up
some dialogue, but instead of laughing or

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.020
apologizing, he just goes ahead and pops a
microphone in his mouth.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.910
Oh Han, you’re so unpredictable.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.910
Hey, thanks for watching.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.199
