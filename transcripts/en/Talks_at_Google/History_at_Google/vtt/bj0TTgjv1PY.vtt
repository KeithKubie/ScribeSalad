[MUSICAL SOUND EFFECT]

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:07.180
SPEAKER 1: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.420
Welcome to Google Cambridge.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.490
We're very pleased to
have, today, Susan Maycock

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.948
and Charles Sullivan of the
Cambridge Historical Commission

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:14.650
with us.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.820
They'll be talking about their
book, "Building Old Cambridge."

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.460
Old Cambridge is the area
around Harvard Square.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.350
And it's especially interesting
for a bunch of reasons.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.740
One of them is, of course,
Harvard, and all the activity

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.590
that goes with Harvard, and some
of the special buildings there.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.490
Now, we all know about the
Georgian, and the Victorian,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.350
and the neo-Georgian
buildings at Harvard.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.980
But all-- Harvard also has
the only Le Corbusier building

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.850
in North America.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.360
It has two buildings by the
great architect HH Richardson

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.406
and so on, so interesting area.

00:00:44.406 --> 00:00:46.530
But beyond that, there are
other interesting things

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.655
in the Harvard Square area.

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:52.260
Brattle Street, an old street,
has been rich for a long time,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.575
from before the Revolution.

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:55.200
It was known as Tory
Row, so there were

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.670
many Tories on Brattle Street.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.530
I'm always curious to
know, what happened

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.150
to them after the revolution,
why were they there

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.358
in the first place, why were
they in Cambridge rather

00:01:02.358 --> 00:01:04.450
than Boston, things like this.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.590
So the architectural history
and the history of the region,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.270
of the area, tells
us a lot about

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.130
the social, economic,
and political history

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.517
of the area as well.

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:14.850
And I believe Charlie's also
going to be talking, today,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.880
about some of the development
of the Kendall Square, which,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.490
when I first knew
it many years ago,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.570
was a bombed-out flat
area, and is no longer.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.000
So I think this will be a
really interesting talk.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.710
So Susan, I think we'll be
introducing, and then Charlie.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.090
Oh, by the way, this is
a book I got, I think,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.990
40 years ago about
Old Cambridge.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.580
And now, with the additional
research that's been done,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.180
we see that they've
made it a lot thicker.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.630
So a lot of research
has been done, a lot

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.100
of interesting background.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.746
And I look forward to it.

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:52.662
SUSAN MAYCOCK: Thanks.

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:55.973
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.970
Actually, we
started out thinking

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.940
we would just kind of
update that red one that's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.070
been out of print for
years, and years, and years,

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.979
and should come back in, because
it's a really interesting area.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.770
And once we started
looking at it,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.610
once we started working on it
and realized how much more we

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.880
had learned since 1972,
when that was published,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.810
it just sort of wrote
itself and ended up

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.690
with 1,100 photographs and maps.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.460
And what you get
is a hefty volume.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.490
So I thought that I would talk
to you a little bit about who

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.150
the Historical Commission
is and what it does.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.540
And then Charlie's going
to introduce the book

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.820
and talk some about
Kendall Square as well.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.850
So the Cambridge
Historical Commission

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.480
is actually part of
the city government.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.570
And it's a department that deals
with historic preservation.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.590
And with that, it
works to preserve

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.770
buildings, and sometimes,
whole neighborhoods.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.030
And it also helps people
understand the context

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.400
of their buildings and--

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.660
oh, are you-- can you hear me?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.300
SPEAKER 1: Yep.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.258
SUSAN MAYCOCK: --the
context of their buildings

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:21.610
and how Cambridge came to
look the way it looks today.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:28.740
So the Commission protects over
3,000 buildings in Cambridge.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.770
But we have a file,
an informational file,

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.880
on every single building,
all 13,000 of them.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.580
And this includes
information on the history,

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.210
maybe on the
architects, the builder,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.180
who built it in the first
place, who it was built for.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.620
And we then have
thousands of photographs

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.260
of individual buildings,
but also of areas, and maps,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.090
and city directories.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.490
So all of this is
open to the public.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.400
And we have researchers come in,
and we help them with whatever.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.960
If you wanted to know if
all of these people who

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.345
live in Cambridge want to
know about their building

00:04:09.345 --> 00:04:13.140
or their house, give
us a call or come in.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.918
And we'll walk you
through it individually

00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:17.959
and see what we can find.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.200
And sometimes it's great.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.610
We have newspaper articles from
the time the buildings were

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.020
built, et cetera.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.210
Main part of the
Commission's mission

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.700
has always been
outreach, which we

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.980
do through helping researchers.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.960
We also make house calls.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.710
We go out.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.100
We talk to help people with
their technical issues.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.850
We also consult on
paint colors to make

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.150
them appropriate for the
exterior of their house

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.710
depending on the history and
the style of their house, which

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.180
is mandatory in the
historic district,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.150
but is just informational in
any other part of Cambridge.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.360
But it's made a huge
difference over--

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.650
we started doing it in the--
during the bicentennial.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.990
And over that
time, Cambridge has

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.830
gone from being gray, gray
and white, yellow and white,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.010
and white to many of the
colors that you see today.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.690
And we also publish books
on the various neighborhoods

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.200
and buildings of Cambridge.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.560
And this is our newest one,
"Building Old Cambridge."

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.590
And it's also our biggest
one, as you can see,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.650
and our most well-illustrated.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.630
But the title, "Building
Old Cambridge,"

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.090
sometimes needs a
little explanation.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.460
Because some people
think it's building

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.110
Ye Olde Cambridge or
old Cambridge buildings,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.850
buildings that are old.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.380
But it actually, as
Stavros said, is--

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:09.840
it's centered on the area
around Harvard Square that

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.990
was the original
settlement in 1630.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.290
So it became known
as Old Cambridge

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:21.180
to differentiate it from the
newer areas such as Cambridge

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.440
Port and East Cambridge that
were developed in the 1800s.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.250
And so "Old
Cambridge," as a name,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.920
shows up on the map on
the cover of the book.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.730
And it shows up on
some early maps.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:41.160
But these other areas didn't
develop until almost 200 years

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:48.960
after Old Cambridge was
established and developing.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.000
So Charles will give
you the history of that.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.709
But now you know where you are.

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:57.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:57.821 --> 00:06:59.320
CHARLES SULLIVAN:
OK, thanks, Susan.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.070
What people have been
telling you is true,

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.100
that Cambridge was founded
in 1630 several miles

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.290
up the Charles River from--

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.780
from Boston Harbor.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.430
It was intended to be the
capital of Massachusetts.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:18.490
It was the only town laid out
on a grid plan in New England

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.270
until New Haven was
founded a few years later.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.660
The intersecting streets of
Kennedy, Dunster, Holyoke, Mass

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.220
Ave., Mount Auburn Street,
Winthrop Street, South Street

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.610
are the original
grid plan of 1630.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.660
The legislature,
in 1634, decided

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.530
that Boston was a better
choice and moved the capital

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:42.460
to Boston.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.480
And in 1636, they gave
Cambridge Harvard University,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.610
or Harvard College as it was
at the time, favoring New Town,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.340
as the village was then
called, over Salem, which

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.560
was the other town
in competition

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.000
for the first college
in the colonies--

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.380
or in the Northeast.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.680
So this map shows the
original settlement

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.050
at what's now Harvard Square,
Boston on its peninsula,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.830
surrounded by
water on all sides,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.110
connected to the mainland only
by a narrow street, Washington

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.890
Street, that would
flood at high tides.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.660
And Kendall Square, you'll see
represented by this purple star

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.620
throughout the presentation
to give you some orientation.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.110
Kendall Square was,
for 100 years--

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.260
150 years-- at least, was not
a place where anyone would go

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.159
or even could go, and
certainly not at high tide.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.040
Because most of it would
have been underwater.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.110
So in this period, and until
1793, there are only two ways

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.380
to get to Boston,
none of them direct.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.860
The road to Boston crossed
by the Harvard Stadium

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.970
went down through Brookline
Village, Dudley Square, and up

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.920
Washington Street
eight miles by road.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.310
Or you could go four
miles out to what's,

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.770
today, Sullivan Square,
down into Charlestown,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.400
and take a ferry
into Boston, and pay

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.080
for the privilege, of course.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.860
So Cambridge was isolated.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.030
The college liked it that way,
kept the undergraduates out

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.650
of trouble.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:25.120
And Cambridge remained
a very small village

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.660
for the first couple of hundred
years of its settlement.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.310
This is the first
view of Cambridge

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.300
made by a French intelligence
agent who came down

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.500
from Quebec in the 1660s.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.630
Produced this map 20 years
later that shows the meeting

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.800
house and the college.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.170
These are two Harvard buildings,
this one and this one.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.850
And then, the village
around it have

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:53.301
called it a town of 80
houses and one university.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:54.926
AUDIENCE: The meeting
house, would that

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:56.710
be First Church Cambridge?

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.110
CHARLES SULLIVAN: This
would be 80 houses in--

00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.874
AUDIENCE: No, the meeting house.

00:09:59.874 --> 00:10:00.640
The meeting house?

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.670
CHARLES SULLIVAN:
The meeting house--

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.070
yes?

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.670
AUDIENCE: Was First
Church Cambridge?

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.900
CHARLES SULLIVAN:
Yes, First Parish.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.740
AUDIENCE: First Parish.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.031
CHARLES SULLIVAN: First Parish.

00:10:07.031 --> 00:10:11.526
And there's a whole
ecclesiastical history

00:10:11.526 --> 00:10:13.400
about the difference
between the first parish

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.275
and the first church.

00:10:14.275 --> 00:10:15.760
It's not a happy story.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.420
But this is the first
church of the first parish--

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:24.970
or the first meeting
house of the first parish.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.620
So by the Revolution--

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:32.440
you know, this is, what,
135 years after settlement--

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.370
the village at Harvard Square
was really still very small

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.550
and grouped around the
university, or the--

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.100
Harvard Yard, as it became.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.020
This is Massachusetts Hall.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:48.010
That's the fourth meeting
house on the corner,

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.490
where Lehman Hall is today.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.770
This-- the kiosk is right
there in that triangle.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.550
This is the old burying ground
at the corner of Garden Street.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.590
There's the bridge
over the Charles.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.750
The stadium's over here.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.360
This is-- you can--

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.650
perhaps you can make this out.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.880
This is a hill surrounded-- or
not surrounded, but bordered--

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.250
by salt marshes along the river.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.390
The curve of Brattle
Street and Elliot Street

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:21.460
is described by a creek that
rose in Harvard Yard, rose--

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.340
went through Harvard Square,
around the foot of the hill,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.940
and out here by Elliott House.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.470
So the village is nestled
on top of this hill.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:36.550
Winthrop Square, the little
open space on Kennedy Street,

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:41.230
was the town marketplace and
has always been a public space.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.800
So the landscape at the
time of the Revolution

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.750
was characterized--

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.250
was an agricultural landscape.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.751
But a lot of it was
occupied by estates,

00:11:54.751 --> 00:11:59.860
by the Loyalist families who had
settled plantations in the West

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.270
Indies, and in Barbados,
Jamaica, Antigua, and the rest,

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.630
and found the
climate unsupportable

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:13.480
for raising families, began
to establish second homes

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.400
in Rhode Island, and on the
Mystic River in Massachusetts,

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.350
and on the Charles
River around the 1750s.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.830
And so by 1775,
a good proportion

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.350
of the town of what's
today Cambridge

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.960
was occupied by these estates.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.060
These were wealthy
families who were

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:34.420
politically loyal to
the English government.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.040
They were slave owners.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.440
Many of them had planta--
sugar plantations

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.550
in the West Indies, brought
their slaves from there.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.760
These were all sort of
gentlemen's plantations.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.360
They weren't really
agricultural enterprises.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.510
But they did occupy a
large amount of territory.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:58.780
There's Kendall Square,
off on the edge of town.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.500
The brown divisions
are lot lines.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.030
These are property divisions.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.480
And the characteristic
of this area,

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.550
these long, long, narrow
lots represented--

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.150
the only thing of value that
was generated in this area

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.270
was salt marsh hay,
which was extremely

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.170
valuable for agricultural use.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.170
You could mulch with it.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.470
The seeds wouldn't
germinate in fresh water.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:24.700
Cows could bed in it.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.870
You know, cows would eat it.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.000
It was extremely val--

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.700
the most valuable agricultural
product in Cambridge.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.680
So these lights were constantly
being subdivided among heirs.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.810
And you might have a
lot 8 or 10 feet wide

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.504
running for several hundred
feet into the marshes

00:13:41.504 --> 00:13:44.800
down to the mudflats.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.390
Otherwise, Kendall Square
was basically worthless.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.530
So the Loyalist
estates all had houses,

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.320
of which this was the
grandest, on Brattle Street.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.890
This is now the Longfellow
National Historic Site.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.210
George Washington slept
here during the early days

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.620
of the Revolution.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.980
And common people lived
in the village in houses

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:15.550
like this, on Kennedy Street
at the corner of South Street.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.010
The landscape at the
time of the Revolution

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:23.140
is really almost
completely open.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.450
Most of the natural forest
cover had long since

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:27.175
disappeared, been cut over.

00:14:27.175 --> 00:14:32.100
The agriculture here was
mostly grazing and pasturing.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.380
The soil wasn't very
productive, so there

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.840
weren't many crops that
were raised, although it

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.950
was good soil for fruit trees.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:44.060
So this is a view looking
from over West Cambridge.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.530
This is Brattle Street
running down into the village.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.810
This is Sparks Street.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.920
And this is the Charles
River and the Great Bridge,

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.700
what's now the Anderson
Bridge, by the Harvard Stadium,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.300
Dana Hill in the background on
the horizon beyond the village.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.270
So the Charles River
is tidal until 1909.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.950
It's the easiest
way to get around.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.040
But of course, it floods.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.010
The banks are shallow.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.110
These views, by the
way, are of a model

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.270
that we made at the time
of the bicentennial that

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.360
were based on the best
available research at the time.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.060
So we still think
they're pretty reliable.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.630
The tide, it's
about a half tide.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.210
And so you can make out
the channel of the river.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.680
And you can make
out the mudflats.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.390
This is where the
business school is

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.670
today, Harvard Business School.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.260
And then, these
are salt marshes.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.540
This is the edge
of a salt marsh.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.100
So at spring tides, about
once a month, all of this area

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.930
would flood right up
to about that line.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.680
So this is a neighborhood
called The Marsh--

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.600
still called The
Marsh-- in Cambridge.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.540
It was settled in the
1850s by Irish immigrants.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.610
Kerry Corner down here,
beyond the Harvard houses,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.320
was the lower marsh.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:12.820
And the marshes covered
large parts of the town.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:18.070
So the person who took advantage
of all of this open space

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.810
around the village
was Francis Dana,

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:24.550
who was America's first to
Ambassador to St. Petersburg,

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.030
came back and became the chief
justice of Massachusetts.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:33.670
He lived in a house on
Dana Hill over here.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.580
This is a view taken from
about the site of Weidner

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.080
Library looking east on--

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.920
this is Harvard Street.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.880
Massachusetts Avenue
is going off there.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.890
The Inn at Harvard
would be about here.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.750
Francis Dana lived--
or was a patriot,

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.150
lived on the scale
of the Loyalists

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.856
who lost their estates
after the Revolution

00:16:59.856 --> 00:17:03.580
in this house which was right
about there, on Massachusetts

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.040
Avenue where Dana
Street comes in.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.020
There's a bluff that falls off--

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.380
if you're going towards Harvard
Square, falls off on your left.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.260
There are views all around.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.329
And at that time, in
that open landscape,

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.740
Dana could see
across Boston, could

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.650
see ships coming
into Boston Harbor,

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.880
and had an open view of
all of this landscape east

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.970
of the village, which, by
the time of the Revolution

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.760
had only three farms.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.760
There was one at Leachmere's
Point in East Cambridge,

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.060
there was another one
up here, and another one

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.900
right about behind city hall,
Dana's house, dated a couple

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.730
of years after the Revolution.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.920
So Kendall Square, you can see,
in this fairly detailed chart,

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.260
is really at the
edge of nowhere.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.630
There is the channel
of the Charles River

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.970
at low tide with soundings.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.260
Would bring you up--

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.960
you could navigate about
as far as Boston Common

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.970
or the public garden.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.000
But you needed at least a
half tide or a full tide

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.210
to get up to past Harvard
Square, which was often done.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.080
These were the flats.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.000
And these were the
salt marshes that

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.930
made East Cambridge an
island at high tides.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.660
So a lot of this,
a lot of what's

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:31.450
now dry ground in Cambridge,
originated as tidelands.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.890
So what Dana did was to
get investors together

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.930
to build the first
bridge direct to Boston.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.810
This is the West
Boston Bridge of 1793

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.340
on the line of the
Longfellow Bridge

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.990
where the subway crosses.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.450
That's the state
house on Beacon Hill.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.180
We're looking from Cambridge,
from Kendall Square,

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.610
into Boston.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:58.150
So very quickly, within
about 35 years, what had--

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.820
a territory that
had only three farms

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.770
suddenly has two new villages.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.840
This is a map of 1830.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.900
So all of these streets,
all of these buildings

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.200
in this area east
of Harvard Square

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.430
have all developed
in 35 years' time.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.620
What the West Boston
Bridge did was

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.010
to open up a desire
line that extended up

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.280
into the middle of Vermont.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.040
Middle and southern Vermont,
western Massachusetts,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.810
southern New Hampshire, all of
that, our agricultural produce

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.030
wanted to reach
the Boston Market.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.210
And all of it had formerly
had to be transported

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.270
through Charlestown or the long
way around that I showed you.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.060
Now, all of a sudden,
they could save five miles

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.710
of travel on dirt roads by
accessing the West Boston

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.510
Bridge through Kendall Square.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:55.180
So the bridge was actually about
3/4 of a mile across and 3/4

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.430
of a mile of causeway
across the mudflats

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.510
down to Lafayette
Square, and then

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.730
promoted the construction
of River Street,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.960
and Western Avenue, and those
bridges of Massachusetts Avenue

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.910
up to the village
of Harvard Street.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.950
Broadway was
actually an extension

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.990
of the Concord Turnpike.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:18.730
So Concord Avenue, and
Broadway, and Cambridge

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.990
were built as a toll road
going out to Concord.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.305
Hampshire Street, it was
the Middlesex Turnpike.

00:20:25.305 --> 00:20:27.160
So it was named Hampshire
Street because it

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.299
led to New Hampshire, to
Tewksbury, on the Merrimack

00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:32.590
River, where it connected
with one of the New Hampshire

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.670
turnpikes.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.100
And then in 1809,
a second bridge

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.110
was built across
from East Cambridge.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.200
And that led to another--

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.360
to a grid plant settlement
at East Cambridge,

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.590
and another street, Cambridge
Street, and other improvements.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.740
And these real estate people
and bridge proprietors

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.550
were constantly competing to
shortcut each other's routes

00:20:54.550 --> 00:21:00.880
to open up land for development,
to attract activity.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.000
And it was a period
of enormous turmoil.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.830
It was just an insane free for
all for real estate developers.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.830
Because after 35 years,
you have a village

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.280
at Cambridgeport, which
is settled primarily

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.920
by migrants from
northern New England

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.325
from the maritimes who are
dealing with highway traffic.

00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:25.690
They're running taverns
and scales and workshops

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.960
serving the traffic into
Kendall Square, into Boston.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.620
East Cambridge is founded
as an industrial suburb

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:33.880
around the glassworks.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.790
So Lafayette Square,
which is the intersection

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.240
of Main Street and Mass Avenue,
had the first meeting house

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.890
in Cambridgeport.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.700
That's where some of you may
remember the Shell station that

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.790
used to be there and then
that's now part of a park.

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.350
That's Main Street
going off here,

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.750
Massachusetts avenue coming
from Harvard Square there.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:57.250
These were taverns and
warehouses and stores

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.360
serving people on the
highways to Boston.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.140
East Cambridge is industrial.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.660
The New England glassworks
is founded there

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.020
in the early days
of the century.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.260
Workers were imported
from Germany and Scotland

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.260
to work in the glass factories.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.300
And the town grew up around
them and the Middlesex county

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.280
courthouse.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.420
Whereas the old
village, by this time,

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.870
was becoming known
as Old Cambridge--

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:30.040
is a simple, a quiet,
more or less settled

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.210
place that's been there
for two centuries already.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.880
So it has a sense
of its heritage.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:39.340
It has Harvard, the
world's soon to become--

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.400
and even then-- the world's
greatest university, right?

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.340
And so Old Cambridge had
an attitude toward it

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.990
that caused resentment in East
Cambridge and Cambridgeport,

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.320
where people were new, where
they had to go to town meeting

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.440
and ask for funds for schools
and roads and services

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.270
that the Old Cambridge taxpayers
were not eager to give.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:06.970
So in the 1840s, folks in Old
Cambridge attempted to secede

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.925
and set themselves off
as a separate town.

00:23:08.925 --> 00:23:11.980
And divide this
town at Lee Street,

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.440
and cut loose Cambridgeport
and East Cambridge.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.760
And then Old Cambridge then
would become a separate town

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:22.170
with North Cambridge
as kind of a suburb.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:29.470
So by this time, this is another
25 years after the 1830 map,

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.090
you can see that the grid
plant in East Cambridge

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.890
is filling out.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.940
The streets in Cambridgeport
are filling out pretty

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.290
satisfactorily.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.930
Not much is happening
at Kendall Square,

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.730
but I'll come back
to that in a minute.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:48.910
So the town, in the
1850s, began to see itself

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.240
as a potential suburb of Boston.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.050
Boston was becoming overcrowded.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.850
The Irish were settling
in the North End,

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.490
driving out the Yankees, who
were looking for new places

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.450
to live.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.310
Cambridge was an
obvious prospect.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:04.240
The tolls on the bridges
disappeared in 1854.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.120
Two men had this vision--

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.780
Gardner Greene Hubbard
and Estes Howe.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.490
Howe is a medical doctor
who gave it up and became

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:13.650
a real estate investor.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.230
Gardner Hubbard
was an attorney who

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.110
is best known because his
daughter married Alexander

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.890
Graham Bell.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.150
She was deaf.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.250
He was her teacher.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:28.180
Hubbard was the lawyer who set
up the original Bell Telephone

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.480
companies and had the idea of--

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.820
you used to have to rent
your telephone equipment

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:39.540
from AT&amp;T. Pay a monthly
rent for that handset

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.270
with the dial, which was the
brilliant idea that Gillette

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.080
used to sell you razors
and razor blades,

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.630
and made AT&amp;T the
powerhouse that it was.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.600
So Hubbard started
out in real estate.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.480
And to serve his
real estate ventures,

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.950
he established a whole series of
important urban infrastructure

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:00.480
ventures.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.370
The first one was the
Harvard branch railroad

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.440
that came down from
the Fitchburg division

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:11.080
in Somerville, at a station
where the Harvard Law School is

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.730
facing Cambridge Common.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.690
It only lasted five years.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.480
It couldn't attract
enough passengers.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.290
It was the first railroad
abandoned in Massachusetts.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:26.380
In 1852, he and Howe established
the Cambridge Gas Company.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:32.890
Gas was produced at that time
by heating coal in a retort,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.920
driving off the gas,
and then that leaves you

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.000
with coke as a byproduct.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.740
But the coal would be
captured in a gas holder.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.410
This is a conical
structure with a roof

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:45.670
that barely shows up here.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.610
But that encloses
a steel tank, which

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.820
is like an upside down
cup and a water seal.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.240
Gas is produced by heating coal.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:01.690
It is pumped into that
container, the weight of which

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.780
provides the pressure to drive
the gas out into the mains,

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.330
under the streets,
into people's homes,

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.400
where it was mostly
used for eliminating

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.232
and for street lights
in this early period.

00:26:12.232 --> 00:26:14.440
This is at the foot of Ash
Street, where the Memorial

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.170
Drive apartments are now.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.300
So they also founded
the Cambridge Waterworks

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:21.940
as a private business
in 1852, to take water

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.540
from a fresh pond.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.650
They built a reservoir
on Reservoir Hill

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.550
with a standpipe for
additional pressure,

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.910
laid pipes under the
streets and the city

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.800
actually took this over in 1865,
and it's now the current water

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.110
department.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.040
And then they founded
the Cambridge railroad,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.600
which was the first horse
railroad, the first street

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:49.360
railroad, the second in the
US after one in New Orleans,

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.240
to run from Boden Square in
Boston at Government Center,

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.510
out Main Street and Mass
Avenue to Harvard Square,

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.060
and out beyond that
to Mount Auburn.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:02.000
Mount Auburn Cemetery--
which sounds strange,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.460
but Mount Auburn was like
the amusement park at the end

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.230
of the streetcar line.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.710
It was a place where people
in Boston, in the thousands,

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:16.300
would go on weekends
to enjoy the landscape.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.520
And so by the 1860s,
Harvard Square

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:25.640
is becoming a real center for
the western part of Cambridge,

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.290
but also for the
western suburbs.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.370
All the streetcar lines
that came in from Watertown,

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.950
from Newton, from
Waltham, from Arlington

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.510
all funneled into
Harvard Square,

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.380
where people would change to
take the streetcar into Boston.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.720
So it became a transfer point
and got an economic importance

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.120
that it had never
had in the first 200

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.460
years of its existence.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.050
Harvard Square is
also characterized

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:53.120
by a lot of buildings
and services

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.790
that were intended to support
students at the University.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:03.380
These buildings-- one of them
was built by the University

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.870
as a dormitory for
graduate students.

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.910
These were early
private dormitories.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.160
Harvard never intended,
and did not provide,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.440
accommodations for
all of its students.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.320
By the end of the 19th
century, only seniors

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.490
were guaranteed dormitory rooms,
and they lived in the yard.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.670
Everybody else, including
14-year-old freshmen

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.450
would have to find
accommodations in the town.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.220
Either at boarding
houses, or for the people

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.280
who had well-to-do parents,
in private dormitories

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:40.040
that were built expressly for
this purpose, where students

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:43.370
would get together and live
in, essentially, apartments

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.550
without cooking facilities.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.760
Everybody ate in the town, in
restaurants and lunch rooms

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.310
in the village in
Harvard Square.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:59.910
Harvard came late to providing
dining hall services,

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:04.350
and that was a much,
much later development.

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.530
And in fact, Harvard
undergraduates

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.390
didn't have to live
in Harvard dorms.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.850
And Harvard could not provide
Harvard accommodations

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:17.870
until about 1929, when the river
houses were finally opened.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.500
So the rest of Cambridge, of
Old Cambridge at this point,

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.950
was becoming a suburb.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.120
This is Mass Avenue looking
north towards Porter Square--

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.080
in this period was one
of the most prestigious

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.390
residential streets
in the Boston area.

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:35.630
All of these large
mansions going up and down

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.640
the street on both sides.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.260
There was no commercial activity
here until about World War I.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:47.030
At the end of Mass
Avenue is Porter Square.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.260
This is what
suburban Cambridge--

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.400
this best represents
suburban Cambridge.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.090
There's the railroad station
where the subway headhouse

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:57.980
is now in Harvard Square.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.930
There's a train in the cut.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.840
There's a horse car on
Massachusetts Avenue

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.000
at the corner of Upland Road.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.690
These churches actually
existed, and so

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:13.640
did this little house, which
now faces Porter Square,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.260
faces the Porter
Square bookstore.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.920
This engraving,
this lithograph was

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.490
done as a real estate promotion
for the property associated

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.480
with this house, which was known
as the Pine Island cottage.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.570
There's a pine tree.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.440
There's the island.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.920
We thought this-- when
we first saw this,

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.910
we thought this
is just a cartoon.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.100
This is a joke.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.760
But in fact, this little
pond and this little island

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.350
show up on a map.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.970
And there it is.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.860
So this is how
Cambridge was developing

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:49.700
in the 19th century as a
middle class suburb of Boston.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.330
So now we're going to
go to Kendall Square.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.510
This is Kendall Square, or
the Cambridgeport shoreline

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.990
in 1847.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:01.940
The bridge-- there's
the West Boston Bridge.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.930
That's the bridge
head, about where--

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:10.190
well, now the dry
land is about here,

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:12.440
and the streets
intersecting here.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.770
So this area
initially had a burst

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.490
of activity after the Bridge was
built. A group of entrepreneurs

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.390
had the vision that if they
dug canals through the marshes,

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.300
that they could attract
traffic coming out

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.470
of the Middlesex Canal.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:30.740
The Middlesex Canal
came out in the Charles

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.960
up around Sullivan Square.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.080
Canal boats could
cross the Charles

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.210
into the north end of Boston.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:41.370
And they thought, well, why not
have canal boats come up here

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:45.220
into Kendall Square, where
they can unload their traffic

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.970
cargoes, granite and wood
and lumber and firewood,

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:53.590
and transshipped them to coastal
schooners for trade elsewhere.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:32:03.730
So folks built the Broad Canal,
which exists now to about here,

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:07.930
but once went all the way
back to Portland Street

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.850
and up behind, all the way
through East Cambridge.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.850
There's a cross
canal, there's a dock.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.830
This is Broadway.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:22.270
This is Harvard Street,
which once connected to Main,

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:26.470
and a dock and a South
Canal, a cross canal,

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:30.280
and we are right about there.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.530
This is Dock Street.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.150
That was the dock.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:38.140
A stub of Dock Street exists
next to the fire station,

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.700
the Firehouse Hotel
across the street.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.600
It was called Dock Street
for obvious reasons.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.330
So when you came across the
river from Boston in the 1850s,

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:53.830
this is the replacement for the
original West Boston Bridge,

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.260
but it's on the same
location with a drawbridge

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.160
in the middle.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.540
That's Kendall Square
in the background.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.010
If that factory right
there is this one,

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.060
if you came across
at low tide, you

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.820
had the kind of obnoxious
experience of a mudflat

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:13.990
at low tide, where all the
sewage of all of Kendall Square

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:17.140
and of all the surrounding
towns was pumped directly

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.520
into the Charles River.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.310
It became an enormous
public health hazard.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.730
As the tide went out, the sewage
collects on the mud flats,

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.080
dries out in the sun.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:31.570
It's blown around in the clouds
of dust in the westerly winds,

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.630
and was a major
impediment to people

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.180
living anywhere near
the Charles River

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.230
until an interceptor sewer
was built in the 1890s.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.320
So moving on into
Kendall Square,

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.710
that's Broadway and Main Street.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.630
Boston is behind us.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:53.800
And the hotel is over here,
and then your office building,

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.930
this building, is in
the middle of this block

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.280
somewhere back here.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.970
So by this time, from
say, the 1840s on,

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.370
this is actually a
residential neighborhood.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.800
There was an elementary
school down here,

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.970
a collection of houses.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.820
People lived here,
worked in the factories

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.989
nearby, or commuted into Boston.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:18.060
The Broad Canal, like
everything on the Charles,

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.860
emptied out at low tide.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.760
It was served by
coastal schooners.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.989
This slide's not very
clear, but that's

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:27.510
the stern of a two-masted
schooner that's

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:31.770
tied up at a wharf here.

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.710
Two-masted schooners
were the semi-trailers

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.760
of the 19th century.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.850
They carried any
kind of bulk cargo

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:44.639
anywhere you had more than maybe
six feet of water at high tide.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.510
They had to be flat-bottomed,
because as the tide went out,

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.820
they'd rest on the mud.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.520
But they were
capacious and cheap,

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.100
and functioned in
coastal commerce

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:03.780
until the 1920s in New England.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:10.770
So the Broad Canal runs almost
a mile up into Cambridgeport.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:13.710
The industries here at this
time in the late 19th century

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.110
were smokestack industries.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:21.090
George Blake started out
developing steam-powered pumps

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:23.910
for emptying out clay pits.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:27.290
And in World War
I, the company--

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.930
it was said that every
naval ship that was launched

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:35.460
had between 3 and
400 pumps from Blake

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.860
performing different
functions on the ship.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:44.460
This became a national supplier
of steam pumps and machinery.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.240
Part of that complex,
this part right

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.060
here, the former
brass foundry, still

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.900
exists on the corner of
Binney and 3rd Street.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.440
Just down Binney Street, Alden
Speare was a chemical company.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.390
These brick buildings,
this brick building

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.730
was owned by Standard
Oil, was a warehouse.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.310
Had a railroad siding behind it.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:08.430
Those brick buildings
are now part

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.220
of Biogen. They've
been adapted or reused

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.580
as part of the Biogen complex.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.400
Further up Binney is
Boston Woven Hose &amp; Rubber.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.920
Rubber was a major
industry in this area.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.880
There were at least two rubber
factories, American Rubber

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.100
on the east side
of Binney Street,

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.600
and then Boston Woven Hose
was a major national supplier

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.550
of hoses.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.350
This complex still exists.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.650
The Kendall Square Cinema
is right back there

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:41.850
where the Boston and Albany
Freight House used to be.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.220
All of these buildings,
almost all of these buildings

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.620
still exist, except for
this one and this one.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.277
And if you look around,
at least on the perimeter

00:36:51.277 --> 00:36:53.610
of Kendall Square, you can
see these layers of history--

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.026
that part of which,
I have to say,

00:36:55.026 --> 00:36:56.580
we've managed to
protect on purpose.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:02.340
Because we want to preserve
these memories of when

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.580
Cambridge was a place where
people made things, where it

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.720
was a smokestack town that
was, in the early 20th century,

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.680
being compared to Detroit as an
emerging industrial powerhouse.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.080
And you can think of
where Detroit went

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.240
and where we'd
gone, I think we got

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.610
the better part of the bargain.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:25.630
So by 1910, the Longfellow
Bridge has been completed here.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:29.060
The subway's not in place yet,
but that's Kendall Square.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.800
Well, Kendall Square
is actually there.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.220
But this is the
industrial area around it.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.140
East Cambridge was off up here.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.940
This building still exists.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.580
That's the Athenaeum
Press Building.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.490
It has the statue of Athena that
you can see from the Red Line

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.870
as you cross.

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:51.970
Athenaeum Press was a textbook
publisher for the most part.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:55.420
But they, too, had their
smokestack aspects.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.840
They received their
paper and fuel,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.250
and presumably shipped out
their school books, by rail.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.400
All of this area north
of the Broad Canal

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.370
was laced with
railroad sitings that

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:14.340
served the various
industries until the 1960s.

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:19.650
Then on the other side of
Main Street, where the Charles

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:22.760
River used to come
right up to Main Street

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.530
and where MIT is
today, all of that

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:30.330
had to be filled and enclosed
and the tides kept out.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.910
So this is looking from
the Longfellow Bridge

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.430
down to the Harvard Bridge
where Massachusetts Avenue is

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.390
crossing.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:40.410
MIT is down somewhere
in the far distance.

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.080
These are our schooners that
are bringing blocks of granite

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.860
from Cape Ann and
laying them on the mud,

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.380
actually on pilings
driven into the mud.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.290
So this is the seawall,
the current seawall,

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.660
that comes from the Longfellow
Bridge, curves, around

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:59.340
and goes down past MIT and past
the Bridge, almost to the BU

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.540
bridge.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.410
Then steam power
dredges suck sand

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.630
out of the remaining
basin of the Charles River

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.390
across the seawall to
fill in all of this area

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.340
to make dry ground.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:15.280
So that process works like this.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.420
This is 1889.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.640
There's been a little
bit of filling down here.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:24.300
The original shoreline is back
almost to Brookline Street,

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.490
down here towards the BU Bridge.

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.100
But by Mass Avenue, not
much has been filled.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.260
There's a natural point here.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.140
The Harvard Bridge on
Mass Ave. has been built,

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.420
or is being built at this time.

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.970
And all of this area is mudflat.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.920
Kendall Square is up at the top.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.040
And the next photograph is
taken from this perspective

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.680
going across open water.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.920
So we're standing
on this bulkhead.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.280
That's Main Street.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.450
This is the Firehouse Hotel.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.800
There is the city's coal wharf.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.110
That's where the city
got its fuel for schools

00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.730
and municipal buildings.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.770
And your building is
right in the middle

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:05.670
of that complex of factories and
three deckers on the other side

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.110
of Main Street.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:10.110
So this area, where you
used to be able to--

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.870
Google would probably
do this for you

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.010
now, give you a
landing with a boat

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:16.220
that you could take
out at lunchtime--

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:21.310
except it's a little bit further
of a walk than it used to be.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.900
So this is probably
tide's part way down.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.790
High tide-- you know, it's a
nine foot tidal range here.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.530
So high tide is just below,
and you can see that mark, just

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.260
below the edge of the bulkhead.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.190
But you can sail for a
good few hours a day.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:42.042
So once the seawall was
built, Longfellow Bridge

00:40:42.042 --> 00:40:42.750
is at the bottom.

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.850
And there's Memorial Drive,
MIT in the background.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.130
You're about there.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.910
The firehouse is here.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:53.980
It creates a whole
swath of new land--

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:57.000
buildings like 238 Main,
with a clock tower that's

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.610
designed not so you can
tell time around here,

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:02.730
but so people in Boston
will see it on the horizon,

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.830
and say, oh, that's
where Kendall Square is.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.830
Let's put our
factory over there.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:13.080
But by the 1950s,
this is a area where

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.120
the industry is in decline.

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:20.190
After World War II, a lot of
firms closed up or moved south.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:24.860
And areas, a lot
of Kendall Square,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.240
broadly, Kendall Square,
became parking lots for people

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.410
to take driving in, taking
the subway into Boston.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.600
So there's the clock tower.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.610
Your building's off to the left.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:39.420
This is Third
Street coming down.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:43.530
This is the only building in the
picture that's still standing.

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.570
All of these other
buildings were taken down

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.220
in the urban renewal period.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.350
This is the modern
version of the gas holder

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:54.150
that I showed you from the
1870s that was up on Ash Street.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:59.190
Because the gasworks
moved down here,

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:02.820
coal was brought into the
Broad Canal heated and so on.

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:07.410
Also a lot of oil was
brought in on barges,

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.170
transhipped in the Broad Canal.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:14.310
So there's the clock
tower building.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:17.110
The earlier views looking across
here at these gas holders.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.810
There's the Broad
Canal, which currently

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:23.370
stops right about here, as
it originally extended up

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.300
into the neighborhood.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.550
You guys are about here.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.590
And fuel oil deliveries--

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:35.840
after the Texas
pipelines reached

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:41.200
New England in about 1952,
they stopped making coal gas.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.270
That's why we talk
about natural gas,

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:46.690
because natural gas is coming
by pipeline from Texas.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.310
What they had
previously was coal gas.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:50.810
But they all called it gas.

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:58.680
Then natural gas came in as a
distinctly different product.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.100
The fuel oil deliveries lasted
until about the mid-1980s,

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:07.870
and since then, the Broad Canal
hasn't had any industrial use.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.700
Other landmarks were the
demise of Lever Brothers,

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.800
the soap manufacturers
had their major US factory

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.100
and headquarters
here on Broadway,

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.890
between Broadway
and Main Street.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:27.850
That was taken down in 1958,
replaced by Tech Square.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:30.700
The first chapter in the modern
history of Kendall Square

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.280
is the construction
of Tech Square

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.200
by MIT and a private
real estate developer.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.180
Then NASA came along.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:46.600
NASA was developing its
space program in the 1960s.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.240
They were going to
build a Space Center

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.340
in Houston, where it is today.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:57.010
They wanted an electronics
research center

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.330
that would be close to MIT.

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:02.710
They were looking for
3,200 acres close to MIT.

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:03.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:07.930
They settled for 14
acres in Kendall Square.

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:10.390
That was industrial
land that was going

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.350
to be cleared for this purpose.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.900
So this is looking from--
there's Boston Logan Hose.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.920
This is Hampshire
Street and Broadway.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.947
That's the end, the very end
of the Broad Canal going off

00:44:23.947 --> 00:44:25.030
towards the Charles River.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:29.170
So this area was all designated
as an urban renewal area.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.540
There were 3,000
people working here,

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.460
so it was a major
gamble by the city

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.670
to clear out those
3,000 jobs on the hope

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:41.140
that 20th century jobs
would replace them.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.660
The initial design
for the NASA Center

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.750
was going to be like
this, with three towers,

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.150
for this electronics
research center

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:53.740
and a commercial development
along Main Street.

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:58.540
What happened was that about
half of one tower was built.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.590
That's the building that's
over here now at Volpe.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.610
And part of this building
was built. The rest of it

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:07.480
was never built.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.620
So this is what the city
came up with to replace

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:14.980
all of those parking lots, a
development that you are now

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.320
a part of.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.230
And Kendall Square
then continued.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:21.640
And for the old
guys in the room,

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.800
there's the F&amp;T Delicatessen
and the F&amp;T Diner,

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.160
while the subway is being--

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.565
[LAUGHTER] I knew
that'd get you.

00:45:30.565 --> 00:45:34.210
The subway station's
being extended.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.180
So these buildings are
now being preserved.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.270
So I've got to finish up
quickly with Harvard Square.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:46.250
So Harvard Square joins the 20th
century, in the 20th century.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.220
And it gets a
subway station, gets

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.440
buildings that are
familiar today.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.460
In the 1970s, it becomes a
different kind of a capitol.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.280
Some of you recognize that.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.870
And now you can see this
view recalls the model view.

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.602
There is Massachusetts Avenue.

00:46:05.602 --> 00:46:07.060
That's where the
meeting house was,

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.320
and the cemetery down here.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.800
So what have I not talked about?

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.350
This is a seven
pound, 13 ounce book.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:16.780
So there's a lot more.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.030
There's neighborhood history.

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.680
There's Harvard University.

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.240
There's printing and publishing.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.010
This is from the
Library of Congress.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:27.280
That's the Riverside press
seal in the ceiling of one

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.470
of their buildings.

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.390
Residential
architecture-- you get

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:34.300
Susan to come back and talk
about that, about business

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.490
and commercial architecture.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.650
About river transportation,
the schooners

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:42.220
that went up to wharfs
in Harvard Square

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.730
and even into
Watertown until 1900.

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.010
Mass transportation--
the subway and streetcar

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:53.110
yards that dominated parts of
Harvard Square until the 1960s.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:55.540
And social history, not least--

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.260
Longfellow and his wife.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.560
She's holding Charlie Longfellow
by his neck, so that he--

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:05.980
because you couldn't move.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.140
Charlie was squirmy.

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:14.140
George Washington Lewis and
his wife Penelope Farwell.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.730
The Goodies, who
were cleaning ladies

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:18.910
at Harvard in the 19th century,
and the African-American

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:20.530
waiters at Memorial Hall.

00:47:20.530 --> 00:47:23.880
So all of these folks are
represented in the book,

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:25.317
and that's my last word.

00:47:25.317 --> 00:47:31.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:32.960
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Charlie.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.043
CHARLES SULLIVAN: Come on.

00:47:34.043 --> 00:47:36.250
Did I answer every single
question you might have?

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.960
I know I'm comprehensive.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.580
OK, yes?

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:44.920
AUDIENCE: So some
number of years ago--

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.440
some number of years ago
while I was between jobs,

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.310
I was hanging out at
the Registry of Deeds

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:56.110
doing basically title
search on my property just

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.681
to figure out what
its history was.

00:47:57.681 --> 00:47:58.930
CHARLES SULLIVAN: That means--

00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.780
AUDIENCE: And I got--

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.321
CHARLES SULLIVAN:
--you're hard core.

00:48:01.321 --> 00:48:08.830
AUDIENCE: And I got back as
far as the mid to late 1800s,

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:11.340
where I learned that it was
part of the almshouse lands.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.440
And I wasn't able to get
any further back than that.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.450
And I was wondering if
you had any comments

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:18.844
about the almshouse and
what was there before.

00:48:18.844 --> 00:48:20.260
CHARLES SULLIVAN:
Well, there were

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.107
three different almshouses.

00:48:22.107 --> 00:48:22.940
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.910
AUDIENCE: This would have
been on Prospect Street.

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:26.160
CHARLES SULLIVAN: On Prospect.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.940
Prospect Street?

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.780
Prospect Street?

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:32.500
AUDIENCE: 66.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.500
CHARLES SULLIVAN: OK,
well, here's my card.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.970
AUDIENCE: Almshouse land, I
think between Austin Street

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:40.790
and Harvard Street.

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:42.176
Or maybe [INAUDIBLE] a little.

00:48:42.176 --> 00:48:43.050
CHARLES SULLIVAN: OK.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:44.780
That's a new one.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.540
Here's my card.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.379
Give us a call.

00:48:47.379 --> 00:48:47.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.300
CHARLES SULLIVAN: We'll talk.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.712
Yes?

00:48:51.712 --> 00:48:53.590
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:55.540
AUDIENCE: So it's
kind of interesting

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:59.540
how Cambridge sort of went from
vast expanses of farmland slash

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.160
nothing into house
upon house upon house.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.400
I'm wondering if you could
elaborate a little bit on how

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.190
sort of the ownership
worked for these marshes

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.390
and even the river parts
that got filled in.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:13.660
Was there someone who
just was extraordinarily

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:16.400
lucky who owned all that
land and got to sell it off?

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.440
Or how does ownership work when
they create land like that?

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.590
CHARLES SULLIVAN: Well, if
you remember the slide that

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:28.780
had all the loyalist estates
on it, that one showed you

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.970
areas where real
estate development was

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:35.170
relatively measured and
carefully organized.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:40.360
So that was represented
capital to those land owners,

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.840
and they would carefully lay
out streets and sell off lots

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.060
and try to do it in sequence.

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.580
Other areas where
there were farms,

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:53.080
it was divided up and pretty
much sold off at random.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.120
There's this whole process.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:59.440
There's no central planning
of streets in Cambridge

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.700
until the 20th century.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:05.800
So the streets would be laid
out by the property developers.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.050
They would try to
work with each other.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.990
Typically they'd sell
lots, two or three lots

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:13.360
at a time, at most,
to a carpenter who

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:17.200
would build the houses on spec,
live in one until he sold it,

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.480
and then buy another
two or three lots.

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:23.590
So it's a pretty
disorganized organic process.

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:26.830
It's not centrally
located, centrally planned.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:29.980
Nothing like, you know,
Levittown comes to mind.

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:33.220
But you know nothing like
organized suburban development

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:39.220
except Coolidge
Hill and Larchwood

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.440
in West Cambridge
in the 20th century

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.810
were small, planned suburbs.

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:46.095
Everything else
is kind of random.

00:50:46.095 --> 00:50:47.470
AUDIENCE: How
early would you say

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:51.460
was all of the land privately
owned in some respects?

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.800
CHARLES SULLIVAN: Privately
owned as opposed to?

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:57.230
AUDIENCE: As opposed to land no
one has settled on yet, right?

00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:59.230
Was that back in the
1600s, basically?

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:01.960
CHARLES SULLIVAN:
Land was granted out.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.610
Some of it was owned in common.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:05.850
It was, well, let's say--

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:09.910
in 1630, it was all owned in
common by the Massachusetts Bay

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:10.650
Company.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:13.570
And so it was
divided into towns.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:18.220
Towns would organize
as parishes, actually,

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.190
and as proprietors.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:21.880
In Cambridge, there
were the proprietors

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.500
of common lands, group of
citizens that were authorized

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:31.090
to divide public land and give
it out to existing property

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:31.930
owners.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:37.060
So that was complete by 1750.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:40.300
After that, there was almost
no more public land left.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.486
So every scrap was
privately owned.

00:51:42.486 --> 00:51:44.110
AUDIENCE: So, for
example, the mudflats

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.970
that became MIT,
who were they owned

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:47.560
by before they were drained?

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.518
CHARLES SULLIVAN: Well.

00:51:48.518 --> 00:51:55.390
The flats-- in Massachusetts,
you can own tidelands out

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:57.280
to the low tide line.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.440
And so they didn't
have much value,

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.700
but you could get title to them.

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:05.500
And an individual did.

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.410
A guy named Charles Davenport--

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:11.130
had a factory further
down on Main Street--

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.750
thought he saw a lot of
potential in the tidelands.

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:18.400
And he's the one that organized
a company to build the seawall

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:19.910
and fill in those flats.

00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:24.370
But he was buying them for
pennies in the 1860s and '70s

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:27.100
and assembling all of that
tideland so that then he

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:28.979
could do a major development.

00:52:28.979 --> 00:52:31.270
Where MIT is, it was supposed
to be a neighborhood that

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:33.370
would mirror Boston's Back Bay.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:34.480
That's a whole other talk.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.420
But you know, Back Bay--

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:37.960
same thing.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:42.520
Seawall-- filled in behind the
sea wall, straight streets laid

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:48.285
out, lots sold on a
consistent, planned basis.

00:52:48.285 --> 00:52:50.410
They were trying to do the
same thing in Cambridge,

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:51.970
but didn't work.

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:55.030
And MIT came along
and scooped it up.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.372
Thank goodness.

00:52:56.372 --> 00:52:58.300
AUDIENCE: And south
of east Cambridge,

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.715
it was bought up by a
development company.

00:53:00.715 --> 00:53:02.440
And they planned it all out.

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.890
So it was a bigger area.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.040
And you got more
regular streets,

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:08.760
but then they sold it off.

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.760
SPEAKER 1: Well, let's
thank our speakers again.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:11.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.360
CHARLES SULLIVAN: Thank you.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.510
Thanks a lot.
