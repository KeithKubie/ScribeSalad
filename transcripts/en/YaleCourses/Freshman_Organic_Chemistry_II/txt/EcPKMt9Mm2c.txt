Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, so we're talking about a oxidation oxidizing and reducing reagents and about alcohols and grin yar reactions to make them. And if we have time at the end, we'll get to a little bit about green chemistry. Uh, I've, maybe you should apologize a little bit about the last question on the exam. I, I got carried away. I wanted to have something that was relevant and, uh, at least historically relevant so that I could have chosen a better NMR problem probably. But I wanted to show you why it's a neat story. So I had, I showed you a, during the exam, this, a dissertation from, from the University of Michigan in 1921 and notice it's about the color of free radicals. Uh, it was found originally that the, that the, um, solutions were colored. Have any of you ever had a colored solution in lab?

Speaker 1:          00:56          Have you, had any of you ever not had a colored solution in lab? Right there always colored. So at first people put no, uh, pay no attention to it. But after they got good at doing it, they observed that the solutions were colored sort of a yell, reddish yellow. But when you s swirled the thing, the color went away, it was called this, but then it came back then just swirled it again. It went away and came back, went away, came back, went away, came back several times. And so this was something that required an explanation of what the color was and how it went away. So on page eight of this, of this dissertation, there's this thing up on top that as a sort of a complicated scheme seems so at the time at least, uh, to explain the color, right? So the idea is that a what, what compound is a, in this, can you see what it is?

Speaker 1:          01:54          Hey, up at the top left, let's try fennel, fennel, fennel, ethane, right. That's what Gomberg set out to make. Remember. And then what's to the right of it? What's B? It's to try fennel methyl radicals. Okay. That's what he decided he had made on the basis of their reactivity. But he's drawn something else here. Uh, down below it, he explains the color by drawing what we would regard as a resonance structure of the free radical, which puts the, the radical, uh, out on the para position of one of the benzene rings and draws other double bonds there. Uh, and that's they, the theory then was that when you had that double bond and two double bonds conjugated like that, that caused color, right? So he explained the color by saying that it was, that it was what we would say a resonance form, but he said in equilibrium, a forum that was colored and the idea was that the radical was colored but very reactive, but it was in equilibrium with the dimer and the dimer was not colored light.

Speaker 1:          03:08          Tetra fennel, methane, right. Was not color. Okay. But the, but the monomer reacts quickly with oxygen. So when you swirl the flask and let oxygen get into the solution, it immediately destroys the colored stuff that in his opinion, the Quinn oid form this, these double bonds, right? The resonance structure we would say, but it destroys the free radical then exhausts the oxygen. Right. And then if you let it sit a while, the color comes back cause the equilibrium between the dimer and the monomer reestablishes itself. So the color gets back. But if you swirl it again, you've got oxygen and it destroys it. You can keep doing that until you've used up all the radical. So that was the, that's how color got into the, to the act. Right now, the Nmr I tried, I, I, uh, asked you to explain and the number of people got it is the dimer of trifle mouthful was finally measured by Nmr in, in 1968.

Speaker 1:          04:12          And here's a spectrum of it. And you see, it can't possibly be hex a fan, I'll ethane because it's got one group of 25 hydrogens and other have to another of two and another one, right? So if we look at Hexcel fan, LFA and of course you should have six phenol groups, six times five is 30. There should just be that one peak. So this obviously, isn't that, what is it right that x a fennel ethane is the product of Alpha Alpha coupling, the two radical carbons coming together. But notice what could have happened. It's obviously not that, but if you had the funnel methyl radical up there at B, and if we use a line instead of a.to denote the extra valence that's not being used, and over here draw the the resonance structure, which has its extra valence out at the right, then you could imagine those are of course it just resonance structures. But you could imagine two of them coming together like that to form this dimer. So a different dimer. What advantage would it have over what disadvantage, what had have compared to hexa fennel ethane? How about this ring here?

Speaker 2:          05:25          Right?

Speaker 1:          05:27          We've lost the aromatics stability of the ring, right? What have we gained in what? So that's a way in which this dimer would be worse than x, a fennel ethane. Is there any way in which it would be better?

Speaker 1:          05:45          It's less sterically hindered, right? And Spirit. Kendra's counts for a lot of these things. Although that was much appreciated really until after 1950 so, okay. When people had talked about it since the time of Victor Meyer, but it really didn't convince any one that you should think about another dimer rather than hexa fennel ethane. So anyhow, if you think, if you consider this structure, notice that you have the explanation for uh, two hydrogens here, the blue ones, two hydrogens here, the green ones, a hydrogen here, the the red one. And you have coupling between these two of about 10 hertz. So it's a double doublet, right? And it's distorted that because the, that there's 60 megahertz spectrum, that chemical shift difference isn't large compared to the, to the j coupling. So the inner peaks are large and the outer peaks are small. But if you look even more carefully, you can see that there's a three hertz coupling between the red hydrogen and degree.

Speaker 1:          06:48          And there's a little bit of doublet splitting here in a little bit of doublet splitting here. Just it's hard to see. And in fact, in some related samples, you can see a little coupling between this hydrogen and that one as well. And these therefore are a little bit split, but not enough that you can see it. Why don't you see the splitting in that one? If a splits be, we should split a, because this hydrogen is being split into a triplet by these and into us into a small triplet by these only three hertz and then into even smaller triplets by these, right? So it's just a whole bunch of peaks on top of one another that just looked like a lump out here. So it's quite clear what this structure is at this that it's this Quinoa dimer once you have the Nmr to see it.

Speaker 1:          07:34          Okay, so it's a Alpha to para toppling the central Carbon Alpha, right. Uh, with the Para position of one of the benzene rings, which are for avoids the steric hindrance. Now, how about the color? Remember that the reason Gomberg thought it was this, this, uh, uh, that it was this, was that the radical was colored the stuff that went away rapidly when you swirled it, but the stuff that was in equilibrium with that was not colored. That's why the color went away, but came back again when the equilibrium was reestablished. So the stuff that was in equilibrium with was not colored. This he thought should be colored, right? So he thought it couldn't be that dimer and he was almost right. This is the UV spectrum of that stuff. So it has quite a strong absorbance here at, uh, three 18 nanometers, but it Peters out just at three 95 nanometers.

Speaker 1:          08:36          And as it turns out, the ultraviolet, the invisible part of the spectrum ends at three 95 nanometers. If it had been five nanometers more, he would have seen the color of that with his eye. So he was close, but no cigar on that one. Right? And because of that, for, for this, for a whatever it, uh, uh, 46 years, people had the wrong structure of this important compound. Right now, in fact, that's at minus 60 degrees where the equilibrium lies toward the dimer, away from the monomer. But if you warm the 21 degrees, now you see the, the absorption from the, from the monomer. There's enough of it to see that's at five, 13 nanometers. A S. Okay. And the reason it's colored is not because it has this crinoid structure, which was his theory, but because it has a non bonding. So Mo, so normally you have bonding and anti-bonding orbitals Pi and Pi Star conjugated ones, right? But this one has a non bonding orbital right in the middle. So a much smaller gap. So the, so the energy is much lower of the quantum that gets absorbed by the free radical.

Speaker 1:          09:54          Okay. Now, uh, this was published, did in that, that thesis that appeared here, uh, was published the next year in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Almost word for word about the color of the free radicals, right? And this is the, the passage of that. It says, uh, the relationship between color and constitution to try fennel methyl or briefly stated the following first that you have a colored free radical in equilibrium with the dimer hexa fan. LFA Right. And second, the color is attributed to the Quinn oid tout him, or we would now say resonance structure. See. So the color was attributed to that. But notice what's interesting about taking this paper from the dissertation to the, to the printed form in the Journal of American Chemical Society, the published warm, what got left out,

Speaker 1:          10:55          the correct structure, the diamond. So it was intentionally left out because of this color, the color thing, they, the, the, the correct dimer was dropped for 46 years because they thought it should be colored and it just almost was. So I think that's an interesting application of spectroscopy. Okay. Now, third thoughts on the Friedel crafts reaction. Whenever we had thoughts, we had second thoughts. Uh, now we have third thoughts. And uh, the second thoughts just to, to remind you was that when you do a Friedel crafts reaction, you could imagine benzine me in a nucleophile and displacing chloride from an propyl to give and propyl benzene and [inaudible]. And that would be an sn two reaction. Or, or you could imagine if it broke the bond a little more that the hydride could shift and you'd get ice of pro ball either, either with a aluminum chloride tightly associated with it.

Speaker 1:          11:51          Or since it's a secondary, I and may be much looser. Okay. So that would be like an sn one reaction that allowed the rearrangement. But then we wondered what would happen if we rotated, didn't had a meth. I'd shift if we couldn't have a hydro. If we instead of a hydride shift, then we get the, if we had the rearrangement, we get the same thing back again. It was still given propyl. Uh, so the question is, is it sn two or is it sn one? And then there was this additional complication that if the methyl got stuck halfway in a cycle of propyl protonated, cyclo propane, a structure that still would give the end propylene benzine. And in fact, dino found in 1968 that you did that and that it was randomly distributed because the hydrogen can zip around the periphery of the protonated cycle of propane. Okay. So then I pose to you a way to become famous of problem, how to decide whether the, whether the Friedel crafts reaction really is an sn two where benzene is a nucleophile and displaces chloride from a thing like this. Either before or after the meth I'd shift or whether it's an sn one reaction. Did anyone have an idea how to solve that?

Speaker 2:          13:06          Yeah. Used to Tyrian.

Speaker 1:          13:09          Well, we could label to see where the deuterium ends up in the end pro ball. And what I found, since I've posed you this way, to become a famous, was it somebody actually did that experiment, right? It was done two years later in 1970 and it didn't make them famous, right? That the paper has been cited only twice in the succeeding 40 years or whatever. Okay. And it was done by Lee Ann Woodcock in Saskatchewan in 1970 so they've prepared the one with deuterium here and they did the reaction with aluminum chloride at five degrees for four Centigrade for 45 minutes. That's near the freezing point of benzene. So it's about, it's cold as you can get if you're going to use benzene as a solvent. They also did it with another inert solvent. The idea is that that would slow the nuclear file. Would that be more dilute the benzene that's doing the thing. So it would slow down the displacement reaction if it were an sn two. Okay. So what would you expect

Speaker 2:          14:10          if it had been

Speaker 1:          14:11          an sn two, an sn? Two reaction without any rearrangement. If it had just been benzene being a nucleophile, the only thing aluminum chloride does is help the chloride be a good leaving group. Then where would the deuterium end up

Speaker 2:          14:28          here? Here, here.

Speaker 1:          14:29          One, two, three Australian. What do you say?

Speaker 2:          14:35          We just did the exam. You should fried on this. It should be here, right?

Speaker 1:          14:44          Halted. Benzine just comes to the taxes. Carbon and chloride leaves. Then the deuterium should all be there. What if it undergoes a meth? I'd shift right then where would it be? Ashby.

Speaker 3:          14:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:00          Material. Remember started here, right? And then the meth

Speaker 3:          15:05          side shifted. If that's the maximum. Some, yeah. Then it would be here. Right.

Speaker 1:          15:11          And what if it went through a protonated cycle of propane?

Speaker 3:          15:16          All right? Then it would be scrambled.

Speaker 1:          15:23          I already know what proteinated cycle appropriate it would be. So now by studying where the deuterium is, we should be able to figure out of what the mechanism is with that to give an propyl benzene with an propyl chloride. And what they found was that 90% of the product was die deuterated there and none of it was die deuterated elsewhere. Right? So it really is the case then that there's less than 2% of partial or full meth. I'd shift en route to and propyl benzene, right? It's just the simplest thing. You think that it's forms by of benzene nucleophile doing an sn two reaction. Okay. Now why isn't that a 100%? Uh, because other cad ions are able to abstract hydride from this position to make this cat I had here and then the deuterium to get washed out of the molecule. But anyhow, that's, that's uh, that's what they found.

Speaker 1:          16:21          Uh, so, uh, you'll have to find out some other way to become famous as an organic chemist. Okay. Now at the end last time we were doing oxidation and reduction as bookkeeping. Uh, not because there's anything re real about it, but because it could help us to classify reagents. We've been classifying reagents as high homos, low Lumos, weak bonds, for example, if you want to get a free radical reaction, uh, but there's a completely different way of classify them in a, in us a sense of very artificial way as to whether they're oxidizing or reducing agents. So we went through a whole bunch of reagents and classified them as oxidizing reagents. The elemental halogen die sulfide, uh, uh, chromium trioxide reducing agents. Uh, methane is a reducing agent, but it's, it's not very reactive because didn't have good homos are Lumos, right? Free radicals are what we need to get a foothold on that or lithium aluminum hydride h minus sodium hydroxide, potassium metal which can give up electrons and r s h can give up, uh, uh, can give up a h minus.

Speaker 1:          17:35          And we saw that when you oxidize back and forth between die sulfide and, and uh, thiol okay. But HCL, Casey l the elements are in their normal oxidation states, so they're neither oxidizing, reducing and it just at the end we got to water and showed that in water hydrogen is plus one and oxygen is minus two. So it's neither, right? Although, uh, and in fact you can see that when it, uh, the reaction of water with ethylene catalyzed by acid and the carbon is minus two minus two for ethylene, after you've added it's minus one minus three, right? So one carbon got oxidized but the other carbon got reduced and there's no net change, right? So you don't need either an oxidizing or reducing agent, right? Because there is no net change in the oxidation step. So water can do that. So, but water does a work in oxidizing, reducing, uh, scenarios.

Speaker 1:          18:41          And in particular a very important one. Photosynthesis changes oxidizes water to o two. Right? But at the same time, uh, reduces the hydrogen and water to the equivalent of h minus and that's nad takes up the age to become Nad h and remember we've talked about that being a source of hydride h minus, right? So it gets both oxidized and reduced. Uh, so not all reducing agents would work satisfactorily is for any given reaction, but it's typically few tile to try a reagent from the wrong class. You don't usually use bromine if you need to do reduction, right. Or, or a hydrogen chloride if you needed to do either oxidation and reduction. Right. So it can be a big help in narrowing the field and choosing reagents. Now I wanted to go to the board a little bit to show oxidation states this was done, uh, in the class last year by Professor Siegel from Zurich, but I thought it was handy to do and I will do it again on the board here.

Speaker 2:          19:49          Uh, that one and it, this one? Yeah. Okay. So let me just put this screen up. Okay. And don't, I guess for the far enough, we'll see. I think I can. And can I blank that video mute. Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:23          So we, we've, we've talked about, uh, about arranging a,

Speaker 2:          20:28          uh, uh, let's see there. One other, so there's one other set center. There we go.

Speaker 1:          20:38          Okay. No, he chose to use ch four c h three o h c h to formic acid and CO2 as examples of oxidation levels carbon. Let's just do it a little differently. Not that it's better or worse, but let's just have an r on there. So we get to have our c h three. Okay. What's the oxidation level of the carbon?

Speaker 3:          21:04          Remember how we do with accounting or bookkeeping if you have another car, but attached to it they shared that

Speaker 1:          21:10          the pair of electrons evenly, no contribution to oxidize and state. But if it's hydrogen, hydrogen gives its electron to carbon and making the bond. So this carbon will be plus three minus three minus three. Pardon me. Thanks for being on your toes. Okay. Then we could have our c, h two o h.

Speaker 4:          21:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:43          Okay. So the oxygen cancels one of the carbons. So this'll be minus one. Notice we're going in steps of two here, right? Is the same, but when I went up there, but I've, I've decided to put an r on instead of one of the H's just for variety. So now r, c h double bond o right now it's plus one. Hey, because you have two oxygens, one hydrogen, then we could go r a, c o, o, h, a carboxylic acid, now it's plus three.

Speaker 4:          22:23          All right.

Speaker 1:          22:25          And at the very end you can go to CEO to then you don't have the are in there and that's plus four as it says up there. Okay. Now let's, uh, let's look at different classes of compounds at their levels of oxidation. So we could have alkanes.

Speaker 4:          22:48          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:48          so we could have, uh, uh, let's see, we've already got a r c h three. Okay, so minus three. So we'll check that one. Okay. Now can we have an alkane which has the, the oxidation state of carbon minus one. So it'd be a carbon that has all bonds to carbon, right? Except one bond, the hydrogen. So a way to do that would be to have R, c, h, double bond, O, c, h, r. So on.

Speaker 4:          23:28          He

Speaker 1:          23:37          and then we could go to Al [inaudible], a r c Si are. So this would be

Speaker 4:          23:49          El con

Speaker 1:          23:53          and each of these is is minus one. Overall it's minus two. And each of these is zero.

Speaker 4:          24:02          Okay.

Speaker 2:          24:02          Right now

Speaker 1:          24:07          what this means is

Speaker 2:          24:09          that

Speaker 1:          24:11          that if you wanted to get an alkene, it has the same oxidation level as the alcohol.

Speaker 2:          24:20          Right. I got that right.

Speaker 1:          24:25          Actually, I should have worked this through better ahead of time.

Speaker 2:          24:28          MMM.

Speaker 1:          24:31          It works. That one works better in his scheme. But notice that you could re the ALC, uh, you can get a or another alkene would be r, c h c h two.

Speaker 2:          24:45          Right. Uh,

Speaker 1:          24:47          so this one you can get from here just by a reaction. We know. What's the reaction that would go from the Alkane to the alkene from the alcohol.

Speaker 2:          24:57          Yeah. How do you get there? What do you call that reaction

Speaker 1:          25:07          to start with an Alkane, an apartment. This, this is art. This will be our pride because the sea as part of the are here,

Speaker 2:          25:15          right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:16          So this one involves ill, it's an elimination reaction. You just treat it with acid, you don't need an oxidizing or reducing agent. Right. And if you do, uh, and so, so the idea is that you can go down this way with neither, but if you have to go back and forth this way, you do oxidation.

Speaker 4:          25:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:46          Or reduction.

Speaker 4:          25:54          Right.

Speaker 1:          25:55          So you could have outfield, hey lines,

Speaker 4:          26:03          right?

Speaker 1:          26:04          So here at you at have our x, right? And this would be the, the carbon in the rx would be minus one. Right? The carbon that's attached to do the acts, that is the ex ex nurse of it is minus one. Right. Let me make, I should make an RCH too. Sorry.

Speaker 4:          26:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:31          And how do we get, say the bromide from the alcohol, what reagent do we use?

Speaker 2:          26:41          Pbr three

Speaker 1:          26:43          or that

Speaker 3:          26:44          are the chloride, s o c l two. These are not oxidizing or reducing agents. Right? The, the elements are in there. A normal thing. So we can, we can go down without using an oxidizing or reducing agent. You wouldn't, uh, now how, how could we get from here, from an Alkane over to here. How would you put bromine in? Say what reagent did you use? Alipay in one way can help you overall what reagent? No, that's, that's very good.

Speaker 1:          27:20          If you have an Alkane, so ch bonds and you want to make CBR. Anybody remember a reaction to do that? What's the problem? And reacting an alkane.

Speaker 3:          27:36          They're not reacted. Why. Dot. No high homos. Low Lumos, right? No functional group. How do you get at something that's not a functional group? How do you get up the hydrogens? You can't use combos at Lumos.

Speaker 1:          27:55          How would you change methane in de Methyl Bromide? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          28:02          we are two cl two. What's up?

Speaker 1:          28:04          Free radical chain reaction. Right? But notice the things you're using br two cl l two are oxidizing agents, right? So to go across in this direction from one column to the next, you use, you'd need oxidation, right? Or You could do another oxidation and get r c h x two, right? And that would require from here doing a second free radical substitution. But if you came down from the Aldehyde to get there, it's the same oxidation level. So you don't need something like bromine, right. To get from here down to here. How bout a few, uh, uh, we could do alcohols too

Speaker 1:          28:51          and of course we could not go also to the, to the tribe bromide, r c c a x three say, and that we could get from an acid right? Without using an oxidizing or reducing agent. But if we have to get it from anything over here from an alcohol or from an Aldehyde, we have to do oxidation to get that somewhere. Okay. On the ultimate one is a co two would be carbon tetrachloride for example. That's the company that's completely oxidized for them. Or if we have, uh, uh, Alfio hides alcohols here, we had an alcohol,

Speaker 4:          29:31          right? Uh,

Speaker 1:          29:37          let's suppose we made a dial r a o h taken twice and with h in here, r c h o h taken twice, right? That if we've started from an alcohol to get that we have to do an oxidation, choose an oxidizing agent. But if we could make it from an Aldehyde without, without using an oxidizing and reducing agent. Can you think of any way of going from an Aldehyde to a carbon that has two alcohols on it? Do you remember what you call a carbon that has two o h is on it? Agenda dial. Where do you get it?

Speaker 3:          30:21          MMM, we need to do an observation like rolling or something. No, we immediately see you don't because they're in the same column. Same observation level.

Speaker 1:          30:41          So you remember what the what, how, how do you make

Speaker 3:          30:43          the dial for me? Let's, let's uh,

Speaker 1:          30:48          r c o h and I want to get r, c. O, h. O. H. H. What do I do first? Derek

Speaker 3:          31:03          protonate the oxygen protonate the oxygen plus charge here. And then an o h minus comes in the talks with this. Oh, H minus. So we bad at h plus a h mindless. It's more likely that in,

Speaker 1:          31:16          if you're using acid ketalysis that there's very little low h minus around. Right, because the acid would have reacted with it. So what would you normally use?

Speaker 3:          31:24          Used to come here to make the CEO bond, see the water and the water right. And then lose a proton. So the protons,

Speaker 1:          31:34          just a catalyst. Right? Uh, so, but, but notice what we're using is just water an h plus thousands or Ooh, minus ketalysis eat too. You can have hydroxide ed first and then this pulls a proton off water. Okay. So, so you go up and down using just water and the acid things that aren't oxidizing, reducing agents. So you can see how that might work out, that if you create in your, on your study sheet a list of oxidation levels of, of things. And uh, then you could see it when you're faced with a given problem, uh, weather what kind of reagent you need to choose. And if you can simplify to a third of the reagents, you know, that's a big help. Okay. Now, uh, so that's just the bookkeeping. There's also the question of the mechanism by which you do this. So let's just consider br two as an oxidizing agent. So if you have an owl cane, a r, c h three say and you react it with VR too, to get the an oxidized form, r c h two B are, what's the mechanism by which you do it? We just did this, Chris.

Speaker 1:          32:54          It's a free ride. All right, so we get B R. Dot. Taking the hydrogen and we've, we've done this before. You got the radical and then so free radical chain reactions that bromines oxidizing agent, but acting the somo. It's different with alcohol's. Let's suppose we have VR too.

Speaker 4:          33:14          Yes.

Speaker 1:          33:17          And we want to react with an alcohol. How does the reaction begin? I mean it would be possible to do it by a free radical reaction. Right? If you had, if you put in an initiator, get chains going, it would be possible to do it, but there's a better reaction to react VR too with ethanol. And how does that begin?

Speaker 3:          33:46          Maybe what makes B are too reactive. Hi Hobo. Lumo what's high? What's low? Not many orbitals there. Sigma Star. Okay, so we got signals

Speaker 1:          34:14          star here and what's high homo then of the alcohol?

Speaker 3:          34:20          Yeah, fiction. Lone pair. On the, Oh, okay. So long pair on,

Speaker 1:          34:24          yeah. Let's see how these work.

Speaker 4:          34:28          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          34:28          The Pr, pardon me. Um, attacks the sigma star. That takes about the VR, right? I want to do this.

Speaker 1:          34:39          A red, actually that's no better read than the other one. Okay. So this comes in here and these leave and we've, we've seen things like this forever. So we have h O, B r and that, let me write this with this unshared pair just for, to be cumbersome about it. Okay. And Bromide came away and there's a plus charge here. How do we get rid of the plus charge? Maybe you're doing it

Speaker 3:          35:29          in age. Yep. Perfect Bro.

Speaker 1:          35:34          So now we got, Oh, br. Oh, I was gonna make that

Speaker 4:          35:41          ch two ch three. Okay. And here we got this at fair.

Speaker 1:          35:57          And now can you see anything that this might do?

Speaker 4:          36:07          What reactions, if we see we had, when we have Adam's next to one another, bromine on one hydrogen on the other two reactions. So we have some

Speaker 1:          36:19          base, it doesn't have to be a strong base, it could just be the alcohol,

Speaker 4:          36:24          uh,

Speaker 1:          36:30          or it could be the bromide that we lost here. Okay. So this can take the h, this goes in and these go on the bromine, bromine. So now we have,

Speaker 4:          36:50          yeah,

Speaker 1:          36:51          double bond o. This h is still there, c h three

Speaker 4:          37:00          and bromide,

Speaker 1:          37:05          which has that pair of electrons.

Speaker 4:          37:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:10          So we've oxidized the alcohol to the Aldehyde. Right. We've gone from here to here.

Speaker 4:          37:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:22          And notice what the trick was that the first oxidations and reductions we talked about where electron transfer and actual electron transfer, like from a metal to a, to a sigma star bond about how he'll haylight. Right here we're transferring electrons, but in pairs, the electron start belonging to the oxygen. Then they're shared between the oxygen and the bromine, and then they leave with the bromine. So the bromine came in and took a pee and shared a pair of electrons, then went away carrying them away. Right? So it removed this pair of electrons and that's how the oxidation occurred. Okay. So that's just an, so the, these reactions are just, this is an sn two reaction.

Speaker 4:          38:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:14          And this is an e two reaction.

Speaker 4:          38:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:19          So they're just normal mechanisms, but because of the way we look at it, it's a, it's a oxidation reduction reaction. Uh, okay. And now cro three, chromium six.

Speaker 4:          38:37          Let's see what this way

Speaker 1:          38:44          that reminds you a little bit of a Ketone, right? The CRM. So you could imagine adding water to give cr.

Speaker 3:          38:56          Oh, Oh, oh h. O. H. Okay.

Speaker 1:          39:03          What's the oxidation state if the chromium is oxidation state here? What's its oxidation state here?

Speaker 3:          39:12          What's its oxidation state here? Still still plus six. You know, you could add a photo box to use water to be the same observation state.

Speaker 1:          39:27          All right. Or You could, uh, you could imagine, uh, making having two of these. So these are a little bit like alcohol's you could imagine to make an ether from that. So you could have cr,

Speaker 3:          39:42          oh, CR, right? With a o. O h. O h. O. O. O. O. H.

Speaker 1:          40:00          So this is a chromium trioxide, chromic acid, dichromate and so on. So there are lots of different forms, or you can get, if you reacted it with Hcl,

Speaker 4:          40:14          you could

Speaker 1:          40:16          protonate lose, lose water, add the chlorine instead. So you could get c, r, O, O, c, l, O, h. But all of these are just different disguises of the same thing. Chromium six. Okay. Now let's consider the reaction of any of these with an alcohol like a h o c h, two ch three, right? So we can have the unshared pair and I'll do it in red again,

Speaker 4:          40:54          right? Attack the chromium. So we got

Speaker 3:          41:01          h o

Speaker 4:          41:06          CR, no bond, no double bond. O, uh

Speaker 1:          41:13          Oh minus or Ooh, let's do the o h

Speaker 4:          41:22          right?

Speaker 1:          41:24          And now notice that we're in the same business we were with bromine. We have now, uh, let me, let me write this out so that it looks like the one over there. H H. So now we can bring up some base, uh, take this age. This goes in here and the chromium leaves with that pair of electrons, right? So again, just as before, we'll let, we'll have lost the proton. It looks just like what happened over there. The chromium came in, shared the pair of electrons and then left with them. And the elimination reaction, right? So again, it's a, it's, it's oxidation oxidation. And if you look at the chromium chromium afterwards, it's CR. Oh, oh, Oh age, right? And what's, uh, my right here? A minus.

Speaker 4:          42:24          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:26          So it's got one, two, three, four, five. It's giving to oxygen, but it gets an electron back with the minus. So this is plus four.

Speaker 4:          42:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:36          So chromium goes from plus six plus four in the process of doing this, this, uh, oxidation. Okay. Now there's a problem in doing this to make an Aldehyde. And the problem is that if you're, if you're, uh, when you're working in water, if the pro, the product you're going to get here from this elimination, you've lost this proton, you'll lose this h break this bond. So you have c double Bondo. No. If that's what you want to make, there's a problem because Aldehydes, you know, have an equilibrium constant about one with water. So this is going to add water to make a dial.

Speaker 4:          43:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          43:28          And why is that a problem? Because alcohol's react with chromium trioxide to get oxidized. So you would, you could, you could, uh, uh, uh, lose, lose this, uh, uh, so this option and give up. It's pair of electrons get oxidized. You've lose this age and this age. And then you would have o h c double bond o so you over oxidize.

Speaker 4:          44:07          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          44:08          right. All the way to the carboxylic acid. We go on another step up there. Now how can you avoid that problem?

Speaker 2:          44:17          Let me ask you this one. This one. Okay. You could do

Speaker 1:          44:31          it by making this, the reagent shown here. Whoops. Uh, video pira Denny young chloro chromate so notice you added Hcl to cro three, which made chromic chloro chromic acid, and then the proton has given to parody and to make a Pyridium cad at. Now that is organic enough that it's readily soluble in organic solvents, right? Which the other forms of chromium that we talked about or not now can you see what advantage that PR that might provide to do it in an organic

Speaker 3:          45:12          salt water? So the reagent is called all

Speaker 1:          45:19          period idiom chloro chromate and here's an example where you get a 92% yield of the Aldehyde from an a straight chain alcohol use in period end IOM crow, chloro chromate. The crucial thing is the solvent is methylene chloride ch two cl two, right? No water, no gem dial and therefore no over oxidation because the mechanism requires the alcohol to react with. Okay, I took that example from Loudon's textbook. However, if you, so textbooks often, uh, I have no doubt that, that, that that happened and that they got 92% yield. But as a general reaction, there can be a problem. If you look at what Wikipedia says about this, there seems to be the voice of experience writing. It says in practice, the chromium byproduct deposits with peer Dean is a sticky black tar, which can complicate matters. You've gotten a rose colored picture in your lab.

Speaker 1:          46:22          I mean you're, you've often had frustrations. I know, but those reactions are carefully chosen so you don't get sticky black stars. But you find very often, and when you try to do something in organic chemistry, you get something that's very difficult to filter or deal with and that that can happen in this reaction. But anyhow, period, any employer and chromate is what you use on an exam when it's asked, how are you going to oxidize and alcohol to an Aldehyde without getting a carboxylic acid? Now you can have, oh, sorry. We're going to have to carry on with this next time. Thanks.
