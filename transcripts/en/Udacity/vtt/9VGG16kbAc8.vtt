00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.710
So, here's a, a very simple outermost state chart in which we

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.570
have an unplugged state and a plugged-in state. The pulling the plug causes us

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.840
to go from the plugged-in state to the unplugged state. And I've labeled here,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.720
this is not part of the state chart notation, but

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.810
I've labeled here, what the event number is in our table.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.310
So vent number five is the pulling of the plug. Symmetrically, the,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.320
going from the unplugged to the plugged-in state is plugging in the plug, and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.721
that's, that's event number six, okay? But for the remainder of the,

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:36.520
this exercise, we're only going to, consider sub states of the plugged-in state.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.940
That is, now, imagine that, the rightmost state here has all of those other

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.380
concurrently executing machines which we were, talking about previously.
