00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.758
The answer here is 218/100.

00:00:05.758 --> 00:00:12.270
This number 2.18 hundredths is
the same thing as 218 hundredths,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.135
which using our convention
becomes 218/100.

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:22.844
We should actually have
simplified this to 109/50,

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:25.835
but either one will work for
this answer.
