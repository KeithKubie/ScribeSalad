Okay. So we talked about some of the differences;

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
now let's talk about what happens if you don't obey those rules.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I remember, about--this is probably 6 or 7 years ago now,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
when we first starting Reddit--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
there was a program online called Basecamp,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it's made by a company called 37 Signals--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it's used for organizing To-Do Lists and stuff.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And so the page kind of looked like this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You had like these To-Do items

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and next to each of these To-Do items

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
was a little link that said: Delete.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And this was just a link--and if you recall,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
normal links, with the anchor tag that you would see in Click On--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
those make GET requests.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
To make a POST request you need a form,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and these were just links.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And so if you were logged in, you could create these To-Do items;

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and if you wanted to delete it, you could just click on Delete.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well, there was another program out at the time, called

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
"Google Web Accelerator".

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And what that was, was it was a browser plugin

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that would sit in your browser,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and while you were browsing--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you know--let's say this is the browser you're looking at--

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
let's add a picture here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
While you were browsing, a bunch of text--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
you know--there might be some links throughout the document--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the Google Web Accelerator would make those requests, behind the scene,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so that when you clicked the links, the pages were ready to go.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The problem is, the Google Web Accelerator was hitting these links.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So users would go to their Basecamp page,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
look at their To-Do lists,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and find that their items were deleting on their own,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and that's kind of a big problem.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And that's what happens when you use GET requests to alter the Server state.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Those guys, at the time, just assumed that since we were logged in

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
no bots would ever hit the page; it would only be used as clicking.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But if your browser's behaving funny

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
or if you've got a plugin running that's clicking on all the links for you,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you'd better be certain that those links don't actually change the Server.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So what you should design instead is

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
instead of making links that alter the Server,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you can make little forms--and the form

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
can just have a little button in it that says: Delete

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
or it can have a special link that causes it to submit the form--

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but it should be making a POST request.
