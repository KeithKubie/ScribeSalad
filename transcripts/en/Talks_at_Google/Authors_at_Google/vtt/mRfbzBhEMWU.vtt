LAURA MURPHY: All
right, hello, everyone.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.430
Thank you so much for attending
today's talk at Google here

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.380
in the Birmingham office,
soon to be Detroit office.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.130
We are so fortunate and lucky to
have Aaron Foley with us today.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.390
He is the newly appointed
chief storyteller

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.351
for the city of Detroit
in the mayor's office.

00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:26.850
Why don't I turn it over to you
to give us a little bit more

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.120
about your background?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.250
AARON FOLEY: Sure.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.549
Well, I wasn't born in Detroit,
but I'm a native Detroiter.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.890
And I was raised in the city.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.170
I went to school in the city.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.130
I always wanted
to be a journalist

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.830
and worked at a
couple of places.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.410
I was the editor of a
small magazine here called

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.242
"BLAC," Black Life,
Arts, and Culture,

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:48.540
We distributed it around
our tricounty area

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.500
here in metro Detroit.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.860
And I worked at
Team Detroit right

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.740
before they switched over
to GTB, held another couple

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.870
of writing posts.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.740
I was freelancing.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.640
I was writing essays.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.723
I was just doing a lot of
stuff, and I was really,

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:04.530
really engrossed in
talking about Detroit

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.000
and where Detroit is right now
from the perspective of someone

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.340
who has lived through a
lot of things in Detroit.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.960
So a lot of things that have
been written about Detroit

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.080
vary in perspective.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.210
But there was very--

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.920
in my opinion,
there wasn't a lot

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.620
of native voices
talking about the city.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.880
So I just started doing it.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.630
LAURA MURPHY: And it's
interesting, Aaron,

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.510
that you say you
weren't born in Detroit.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.060
I don't know that
I've read anywhere,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.380
if you've shared where that is.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.400
Do you care to
share that with us?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.785
AARON FOLEY: Yeah, I was
born in Nuremberg, Germany.

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:42.600
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, wow.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.700
AARON FOLEY: So there's
a US Army base there.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.960
My parents were in
the army, and that's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.043
how I ended up born there.

00:01:47.043 --> 00:01:49.860
But I didn't learn to
speak German or anything.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.130
And the year I was born
is when the United States

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.942
changed the laws, in '84.

00:01:55.942 --> 00:01:57.400
I just missed the
cut off where you

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.566
could have dual citizenship.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:02.270
I, unfortunately,
do not have dual.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.687
LAURA MURPHY: Well,
I was actually

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:04.853
going to save this question.

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:06.310
But because you
said Germany, it's

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.060
sparking a thought in my mind.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.570
You wrote your first book,
"How To Live In Detroit

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.910
Without Being a Jackass" right
as the idea of gentrification

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.840
was becoming a social
norm conversation.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.330
But what's interesting is
it's not a new concept.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.890
You can trace it
all the way back

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.160
to, actually, Germany and Berlin
and a couple of other Eastern

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.690
European cities.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.060
That's where the original
premise around it

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.230
became very, very important
to have as a conversation.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.440
When I read your first book, I
get a lot of tips on Detroit,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.500
but I actually see
the bigger structure

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.541
around maybe making this a
guidebook for other cities

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.540
that are going through
gentrification right now.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.920
So I'm just curious.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.980
Do you agree with that?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.440
Do you think that
your first book

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.430
could become a template
for Philly and Oakland

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.950
and some other cities
that are experiencing what

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.339
Detroit has been going through?

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:01.380
AARON FOLEY: It could be.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.390
I think the key thing is that
a book about Detroit, I think,

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.190
can--

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.190
I won't say can only be
written by a Detroiter,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.690
but it helps if you
have someone who

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.000
is very familiar
with what Detroit was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.210
and what direction
it's headed in.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.280
But someone who is
not from Philadelphia,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.070
someone who is not from Oakland
and trying to interpret Oakland

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.830
for other people who are
curious about Oakland,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.040
it may not go over
as well, I think.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.720
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, definitely.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.220
AARON FOLEY: But
then the other part

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.270
of that, too, is every city
has a very unique story.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.594
Every city has its
own unique challenges.

00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:38.010
Gentrification in
Detroit is going

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.410
to look a lot different than
gentrification in Oakland.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.660
It's going to look a lot
different than Philadelphia,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.940
New York, Austin.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.140
It's what the challenges are,
and how do you interpret them?

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.410
So one thing I try
to point out is

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.740
that with Detroit,
we are very far away

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.134
from the kind of gentrification
you've seen in Brooklyn,

00:03:58.134 --> 00:03:59.550
you've seen in
Austin, you've seen

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.591
in San Francisco and
whatnot, because the city is

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:03.200
so very empty, right?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.660
There's currently about 680,000
people living in Detroit.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.540
The population at its
peak was 2 million.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.590
So there's about a million and
a half empty spaces in Detroit.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.880
So it's kind of hard
to gentrify when

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.000
there are very few places
to be pushing people out.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.189
But we do have the concern of
rising rents and rising costs

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:23.480
of living and things like that.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.202
So there's a number
of things going on.

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:27.660
Like I said, I think Detroit
has sort of learned the lesson

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.130
from some of the other cities.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.671
So we're trying to head some of
these things off at the pass.

00:04:31.671 --> 00:04:34.640
So that's sort of what makes
our story different than,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.710
like I said, in Oakland or
Philly or anything like that.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.330
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
and it's funny

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.006
that we are mentioning
all these other cities,

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:43.630
when on the cover of
the book, you say,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.380
"please do not call
us the next Brooklyn."

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.140
AARON FOLEY: Yes.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.014
LAURA MURPHY: So can
you tell us a little bit

00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:49.110
about how that kind of--

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.960
I don't know if got under
your skin was the word,

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.730
but I'd love to know
more about that.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.000
AARON FOLEY: So no offense
to "The New York Times"

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.542
or the BuzzFeeds or the--

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:00.000
rest in peace--
Gawkers or anything

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.311
like that who lots of great
writers and journalists

00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:06.560
worked for these publications.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.351
Don't get me wrong.

00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:10.760
But I feel like a lot of the
especially coastal publications

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.675
are always in search
of the "next Brooklyn"

00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:13.550
and the new Brooklyn.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.420
And they've applied that label
to New Orleans and Austin

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.270
and any city that side
of Cleveland, any city

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.000
that all of a sudden
becomes trendy.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.910
You see a lot of
hipsters moving into it.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.140
LAURA MURPHY: Hipsters,
there's the word.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.070
AARON FOLEY: Moving to
a certain neighborhood.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.450
And I spent time
in Williamsburg.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.950
I know what
Williamsburg looks like,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.830
and Williamsburg does
not look like Detroit.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.700
And so I feel strongly that
Detroit is just Detroit.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.480
We should not be taking on
an identity of another city.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.250
People are trying to call
us the next Silicon Valley,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.090
and I feel like Silicon
Valley should own that label.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.070
Detroit should-- and
Detroit is evolving too.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.970
Don't get me wrong.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:50.840
We were Motown.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.790
We were the Motor City
and things like that.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.250
I'm not saying we have
to banish these labels

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.630
or hold onto them so tight.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.280
But at the same time,
there's a reason

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.779
why we've identified
with these labels.

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:02.820
It's because it's something
that's natural to us.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.180
It's something that we can own
and something we can claim.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.890
And so when you try
to say the Detroit is

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.130
new Brooklyn, and even
Brooklyn 20 years ago,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.640
40 years ago, wasn't the
Brooklyn that it is now.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.500
And what does that say about us?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.170
LAURA MURPHY: It is a
conundrum, for sure.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.882
I'm interested, too,
in the process that you

00:06:20.882 --> 00:06:22.090
used to go through this book.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.210
Because as I was
reading it-- and I know

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.470
we're talking a lot
about the first book.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.500
We'll get to the second
book in a second.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.270
As I was reading
this, almost nothing

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.910
is out of bounds for you.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.230
And I love that you have
how-to chapters in the book,

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.140
like how to party
like a Detroiter,

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.470
how to be gay in Detroit,
how to be a woman in Detroit,

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.820
how to raise a child in Detroit.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.060
But a couple of those things,
I have to just say, point out,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.390
they're not things that you are
very intimately familiar with.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.340
So can you tell us
about the process

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.230
and how you research
things that--

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.230
unless you are a parent.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.030
I believe you're not.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.720
AARON FOLEY: No.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.995
LAURA MURPHY: And I
know you're not a woman.

00:06:58.995 --> 00:06:59.745
AARON FOLEY: Yeah.

00:06:59.745 --> 00:07:01.442
LAURA MURPHY: So--

00:07:01.442 --> 00:07:02.900
AARON FOLEY: Yeah,
I'm not a woman.

00:07:05.522 --> 00:07:07.730
Some of the titles were a
little bit tongue in cheek.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:14.370
Like I know I'm a guy,
and I have no kids,

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.800
and I was born a male.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.620
But when I wrote "how to
be a woman in Detroit,"

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.770
I talked about how
sometimes women in Detroit

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.000
can get the short
end of the stick

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.990
sometimes because Detroit can
be a little misogynist at times.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.220
I really hate to say it.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.940
I mean, that's kind
of a strong word.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.120
But we can treat our
women the wrong way.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.190
I think about how there's
been a few political scandals

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.510
in Detroit, and the women
always go down as the mistress.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.040
And she was the one,
all that type of stuff,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.340
not to get too far into it.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.470
But I look at the way
how women sometimes

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:02.510
get demonized sometimes for
their actions in Detroit, even

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.130
no matter what they do, right?

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.620
So it's just caution as far as--

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.740
here is where we are right
now in terms of culture,

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.870
in terms of attitude.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.760
It's a very
unfortunate statistic

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.840
that domestic violence is
very prevalent in Detroit,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.705
unfortunately.

00:08:21.705 --> 00:08:24.080
But a lot of that can be tied
to a lot of systemic things

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.650
like unemployment and toxic
masculinity and all these types

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.380
of things that are just kind
of intertwined together.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.919
So those are some of the
things that I talk about.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.650
Talking about being
a parent in Detroit,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.140
it's no secret that the
school systems in Detroit

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.070
have undergone a massive
amount of change.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.340
The public school system
I went to 15, 16 years ago

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.170
is not the same as it is now.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.530
In fact, in the three years
since the book came out,

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.080
there were two public
school systems.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.580
When I was in school,
there was one.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.570
Then it split off into two.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.194
Now they folded back
into one, so now I

00:08:57.194 --> 00:08:58.594
have to update the book again.

00:08:58.594 --> 00:08:59.510
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, wow.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.470
Yeah, that's right.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.730
I remember that.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:00.890
AARON FOLEY:
Because there's been

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.310
so much turmoil in the schools,
so again, a lot of people

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.010
come to Detroit with the
idea, oh, the cost of living

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.004
is so affordable.

00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:09.420
And I can afford
to raise a child.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.460
I can afford daycare.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.830
I can have disposable income.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:18.260
But just a great precaution, the
schools may not be up to par.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.180
There's a lot of overcrowding.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.200
There's a lot of, at the time--

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.160
LAURA MURPHY: Lack of teachers,
and resources, and funding.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.590
AARON FOLEY: --lack of
teachers, resources.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.770
At the time when
I wrote it, they

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.110
were dealing with
rats in the schools

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.060
and all these types of things.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.730
And schools are sort
of getting better.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.771
There's a new superintendent
now and all of that.

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.790
But in my opinion, it might
take a whole generation

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.830
before we start to see
some of the changes that

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.376
are being implemented now.

00:09:39.376 --> 00:09:41.000
LAURA MURPHY:
Interesting about gender,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.490
such a hot topic right now.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:45.050
This is just your
opinion, but do you

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.990
think that the
automotive industry can

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.270
be somewhat misogynist
as well just because

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.660
of its origins and its
roots all the way back

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.490
into the early days
of Henry Ford and men

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.760
really becoming the pioneers
behind the automotive industry?

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.400
Do you see that as a
part of the influence

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.490
of the misogynist culture
in Detroit as well?

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.880
AARON FOLEY: Oh, absolutely.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.870
There was that report.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.110
I don't know if you saw.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.330
It was either the "Chicago
Tribune" or "The New York

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.040
Times."

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.886
But it was in Chicago,
which is why I don't

00:10:12.886 --> 00:10:14.010
know which paper it was in.

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.400
But they interviewed-- this
was the height of #MeToo--

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.631
and they interviewed all
these female plant workers,

00:10:19.631 --> 00:10:21.630
and they were just
describing the endless amount

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.630
of abuse and harassment that
they were enduring at a time

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.750
at a plant, a Ford
plant, out in Chicago.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.770
There's no doubt that it happens
across the automotive industry

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.690
as far as what women
have to deal with.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.120
But it is sad.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.220
There's a lot of
things that we have

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.020
to unlearn, especially as men--

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.512
LAURA MURPHY: I
love that, "things

00:10:44.512 --> 00:10:47.310
that we have to unlearn as men."

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:52.320
It requires that huge shift in
thinking, very much so, yeah.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.930
AARON FOLEY: One thing I talk
about a little bit in the book

00:10:54.930 --> 00:11:00.870
is how when we talk about the
concept of unlearning things,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.010
a lot of Detroit's population
has roots in the South.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.245
A lot of Detroit's
population were black people

00:11:07.245 --> 00:11:10.350
that came from the South, and
you're coming from the South

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.212
with this mindset.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.170
And I'm not talking about
in the South in 2018.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.130
I'm talking like 100
years back, where

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.530
there was a lot of survival.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.850
It was survival by
any means necessary.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.410
And sometimes that meant
"the man of the house,"

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.110
and the man of the household
having a very heavy hand,

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.440
being very strict, putting
women in their place and things

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:31.940
like that.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.570
There was also a religious
aspect to it as far as people

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.940
believing that the Bible
says man is the head,

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.590
and women submit, and all
these types of things.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.322
And a lot of that came
up from the South.

00:11:43.322 --> 00:11:45.030
I'm not saying it's
because of the South,

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:50.370
but it came up to the Midwest,
Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.400
especially, Bay City, Saginaw,
Kalamazoo, all these places

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.880
where black people landed
during the Great Migration.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.300
And a lot of that
persists today.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.950
You can go into a
church now and still

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.500
hear people say man is
head of the household,

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.100
women submit to the man, and
all these types of things.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.910
And as Detroit evolves, I hope
some of that thinking evolves

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.524
with it.

00:12:12.524 --> 00:12:14.190
LAURA MURPHY: What
you're talking about,

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.340
too, there is the notion behind
immigration, which we could

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.290
tie back to gentrification.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.580
So I wonder around the
topic of immigration,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:29.970
do you see us being a city that
continues to attract people

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.120
not just from the South
domestically here in the US,

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.050
but globally?

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.950
Do you see city as a global
economies of scale city,

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.080
and we can continue
growing so we can get back

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.340
to that 2 million number?

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.548
AARON FOLEY: I would hope so.

00:12:42.548 --> 00:12:46.440
It's my firm belief that
immigrant populations are not

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.670
only the backbone
of American society,

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.610
but if you look at a city
like Detroit that is so empty,

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.010
it makes more sense
that immigrants

00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:01.200
can fill these empty spaces.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.364
Detroit has always been
a hub for immigration.

00:13:03.364 --> 00:13:05.280
People usually think of
the Ellis Island story

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.490
or coming to your San Franciscos
and LAs and things like that.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.930
But if you look at the first
wave of the Hungarians,

00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:17.500
the Italians, the Polish,
the French that came here,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.965
and then the second wave, the
Latino Americans, and then

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:21.840
you break that down to
the Mexican Americans,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.673
the Salvadorans, the
Venezuelans, and things

00:13:23.673 --> 00:13:26.100
like that, and then the
Arab American population

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.900
that we have here coming from
Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Iran,

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.510
all of these places that sort
of have a commingling here.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.820
Now we have a growing
West African population.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.890
We have a growing West
Indian population.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.820
All of these things contribute
to what Detroit's culture is.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.710
I love the fact that I can
go to a Caribbean restaurant.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.450
I love the fact that I can
go to an African restaurant

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.390
and a Middle Eastern restaurant
all within a few miles

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.100
of each other here in Detroit.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.244
So yeah, let's bring more
immigrants to Detroit.

00:13:55.244 --> 00:13:56.410
LAURA MURPHY: Let's do that.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:56.710
AARON FOLEY: Bangladeshi, too.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.460
LAURA MURPHY: Let's
keep making this city.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.740
AARON FOLEY: I can never forget
we have a whole Banglatown now.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.080
LAURA MURPHY: And that
actually, in the chapter

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.320
where you talk about how to
be a parent in Detroit, one

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.040
thing that struck me that I just
love so much, and I want to--

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.110
hopefully as the chief
storyteller for Detroit,

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.130
you can continue this.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.750
Just continue to educate the
young people, our children,

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.010
in other words, as parents, to
be open to race, to be open.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.880
And diversity and inclusion
at any company, at any school,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.470
in any subculture is the
most important thing.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.890
So has that always
been something

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.490
that you have been keenly aware
of, diversity and inclusion?

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.066
And was it something you
were taught as a child?

00:14:38.066 --> 00:14:39.690
AARON FOLEY: It was
one of those things

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.330
that you don't realize
how much it was taught

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.160
to you until you get older.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.030
So I always went to
mostly black schools

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.070
growing up in a
mostly black city.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.510
And Black History Month
was Black History Month,

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:56.810
but we talked about black
history all year long.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.960
We were reading African-American
literature all year long

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.246
and all these types of things.

00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:03.120
And I didn't realize.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.350
I was just like, oh, gosh.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.200
I didn't have to
wait till February

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.622
to read "The Bluest Eye."

00:15:08.622 --> 00:15:09.830
LAURA MURPHY: It's just life.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:10.996
AARON FOLEY: It's just life.

00:15:10.996 --> 00:15:14.940
And a part of that is writers
like Toni Morrison, Maya

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.190
Angelou, were
speaking of urban life

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:19.740
that can apply to many different
urban cities like Detroit.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.800
But also I think it helps
having teachers that--

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.770
I always credit my English
teachers and things like that--

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.802
who had that forethought
to say, hey, these kids

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.510
are going to go out
into the world, where

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.780
here in Detroit,
everyone looks like us,

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.710
but you go out into
outside of Detroit,

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:35.710
they don't look like us.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.180
So let's instill an
appreciation for their culture

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.590
during their younger years.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.590
But an underlying theme
throughout the book

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.070
is there's going to
be a lot of people

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.650
who are not black moving.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:50.280
It'll be white.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.690
It'll be Asian.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.286
It'll be Latino, whoever, coming
into one of the few cities

00:15:55.286 --> 00:15:56.910
in America, one of
the few major cities

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.284
in America, that
is mostly black.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.460
It kind of goes both ways.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.490
A lot of people may
not be used to that.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.690
A lot of black people--

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.670
again, growing up in
mostly black neighborhoods

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.970
and going to mostly black
schools, when they see someone

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.440
that is not like them, they
may not know how to react,

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.780
but vice versa.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.530
I think the onus also
falls on the newer person.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:23.370
And how do we meet each
other in the middle here?

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.420
I think the end goal is we're
all here in Detroit, right?

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.960
So let's live together.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.979
Let's understand each other, and
let's move this city forward.

00:16:31.979 --> 00:16:33.020
LAURA MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:33.930
I love that.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.400
You said even, too,
just for a baseline--

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.160
as people who grew up in Detroit
from all the different parts

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.650
of Detroit, one of the
things that you all do

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.690
is ask each other what
high school you went to.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.971
AARON FOLEY: Yes.

00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:50.330
LAURA MURPHY: So not as to judge
someone or put them in a box,

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.490
but just to kind of get
their frame of reference

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.600
if you're East Side or
if you're West Side.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.107
I love that you mentioned that.

00:16:56.107 --> 00:16:57.690
But do you think
that that's something

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.470
that's specific to Michiganders
or Detroiters more so?

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.020
AARON FOLEY: I think it's
more specific to Detroiters.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.619
Because Troy, for instance,
one of the suburbs,

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.900
you either went to Athens
or you went to Troy.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.800
LAURA MURPHY: That's it, yeah.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.880
AARON FOLEY: I have friends
from Troy, so I know.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.109
But I feel like--

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:18.970
I won't say all places
outside of Detroit,

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.604
but I feel like a lot of places
outside of Detroit, people

00:17:21.604 --> 00:17:23.520
forget about high school
the moment you leave.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.349
And a lot of people
leave their hometowns.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.170
And it's just like, oh, my high
school friends on Facebook.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.670
I just left them
behind or whatever.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.782
But here in Detroit, you
grow up in the neighborhood

00:17:32.782 --> 00:17:34.740
that you went to high
school, and sometimes you

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.740
end up living in the
neighborhood after that you

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.520
went to high school in.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.804
And you end up still dialoguing
with a lot of people, maybe not

00:17:41.804 --> 00:17:43.470
in your graduating
class, but definitely

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.130
who were in the building
at the same time you were.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.255
So it's kind of like an
unofficial formality.

00:17:51.255 --> 00:17:54.180
It's just like instead of
asking where you're from,

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.370
we can deduce where
you're from by asking

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.180
what high school did you go to.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.900
And it's also the fact
that Detroit is very large,

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.080
but it's very small.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.454
If I go to someone and say,
oh, you went to Mumford,

00:18:07.454 --> 00:18:08.370
do you know so-and-so?

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:08.895
Do you know so-and-so?

00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:10.687
Do you know-- this
is breaking the ice.

00:18:10.687 --> 00:18:11.520
LAURA MURPHY: It is.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.225
It is.

00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:12.910
AARON FOLEY: It's networking.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.175
LAURA MURPHY: It's making
connections and networking,

00:18:14.175 --> 00:18:14.675
absolutely.

00:18:14.675 --> 00:18:15.715
AARON FOLEY: Yeah.

00:18:15.715 --> 00:18:18.270
LAURA MURPHY: It's so true.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.590
You mentioned Facebook.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.060
So I have to take
a chance to talk

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.049
to you a little bit
about using social media

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:25.590
not only to promote yourself
but some of these amazing things

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.810
you're doing.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.600
And I spent some time looking
at some of your social media.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.917
You do an incredible job
with staying above the board.

00:18:34.917 --> 00:18:36.000
I think that's what it is.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.208
You get a lot of comments,
especially on your Twitter

00:18:38.208 --> 00:18:41.520
page, from people who
saw you in a Ted Talk

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.810
or saw you do an interview.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.490
And they maybe
disagree with you.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:45.970
How do you find the balance?

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.960
Because as a parent
and a Googler,

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.785
social media runs through
every thread of my day.

00:18:51.785 --> 00:18:52.910
AARON FOLEY: It does, yeah.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.493
LAURA MURPHY: So how
do you personally

00:18:54.493 --> 00:18:57.540
find the balance with what's
right for social media as Aaron

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.350
Foley as a person and as now
in a big role at the mayor's

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.310
office?

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.630
AARON FOLEY: There's
admittedly been a shift

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.588
since I started working
for the mayor's office,

00:19:05.588 --> 00:19:11.880
because one of the things prior
to working for the mayor's

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:17.920
office, I tried to engage with
everyone, even the trolls.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.979
LAURA MURPHY: Love
them or hate them.

00:19:19.979 --> 00:19:22.020
AARON FOLEY: And you got
to engage with everyone.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.770
And I reached the point.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:26.874
I mean, even before
social media,

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.290
part of my journalism
training was

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.434
you can't convince
everybody what's right.

00:19:31.434 --> 00:19:32.850
There's always
going to be someone

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.950
who will always disagree,
especially if you

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.750
put your opinion out there.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.640
One thing I do appreciate
is that people are

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.075
so passionate about Detroit.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.870
The smallest thing
can set someone off.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:45.870
And that's a good thing.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.230
You should have that same
kind of passion and energy

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.487
about everything in Detroit.

00:19:52.487 --> 00:19:53.820
So I would engage with everyone.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.902
I was just like, hey, this
is where I'm coming from.

00:19:57.902 --> 00:19:59.610
Here are some of the
facts to back it up,

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.068
or here are some
of the things I've

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:03.230
experienced to back this up.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:08.970
And I always say, well, if
you have a different opinion,

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:09.710
state it.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.440
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
I saw you say that.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.480
Great, keep it coming, yeah.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.996
Yeah, you embrace people's
very bad opinions.

00:20:17.996 --> 00:20:20.370
AARON FOLEY: After working
for the mayor's office though,

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.350
you do have to be a
little more diplomatic.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.180
Because one of the
things I said very

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.650
early on is that I'm not
just representing myself

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:27.420
at this point.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.450
Or you can always put in
your Twitter bio or any bio,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.010
"retweets are not opinions."

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.230
But when you are presenting
a local county or state

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.160
government or a
federal government,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:44.400
you just can't pop off
at everybody, especially

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.920
if they're a resident of the
constituency that you serve.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.890
I'm not an elected official,
but I am very public.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.550
So the last thing I want is
to embarrass my colleagues,

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.110
embarrass the administration,
embarrass the city.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.560
Everybody is always looking
for something to go viral,

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.810
and I don't want to be the
person that gets a headline

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.690
and says, "city
official mouths off

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.600
on Twitter against
poor Detroit resident"

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:08.160
or something like that.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.120
LAURA MURPHY: What is your
social media of choice?

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.291
Which one do you find
yourself as an active consumer

00:21:13.291 --> 00:21:14.040
mostly, if you do?

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.130
AARON FOLEY: It's funny.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.640
I pick it based on the audience.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.560
So I'm embracing LinkedIn
a little bit more.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.710
I don't post a lot on LinkedIn,
but I should start doing that,

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.846
because I notice a lot of
professional connections.

00:21:31.846 --> 00:21:33.220
That's what LinkedIn
is made for,

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.160
but it's interface now is
more social and whatnot.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.660
So I need to start posting more
videos and things like that,

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.451
some of the things
we're doing at the city.

00:21:40.451 --> 00:21:45.090
Nextdoor, the team I
manage at the city,

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.010
we signed up for
Nextdoor last week.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.260
And man, don't get me wrong.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.040
It's great.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.370
But it's a different world.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.280
So you can't dialogue
the same on Nextdoor

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.920
as you do with a LinkedIn
or Facebook or Twitter.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.350
I personally love
Twitter the most,

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.310
just because I feel like
Twitter is where you can get--

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.800
and I looked at how other
city officials and how

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.870
other people in other cities use
Twitter-- and it's just like,

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.850
this is everything you're
going to get from me.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.517
You're going to get
updates from my job.

00:22:11.517 --> 00:22:13.641
You're going to get my
thoughts about a few things.

00:22:13.641 --> 00:22:15.000
You're also going to get--

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.140
I want to jump in
in on a hashtag.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.431
I want to live tweet a TV show.

00:22:17.431 --> 00:22:18.836
I want to post a couple of GIFs.

00:22:18.836 --> 00:22:20.460
I want to post a
couple of inside jokes

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:22.900
that only some of
my friends will get.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.470
You can get just a little
bit, a sampling of everything,

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.320
on Twitter.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.090
Facebook, though,
Facebook and Twitter,

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.430
it's kind of half and half.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.270
Facebook is where I do
a lot of the promotion.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.587
And I also use Facebook as
a community engagement tool

00:22:37.587 --> 00:22:40.170
sometimes when I'm just trying
to get and gather some thoughts

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.250
about the city and Detroit.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.350
Like, hey, what do you guys
think about this neighborhood

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.850
name?

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.060
Or hey, what are you guys--

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.020
I saw this.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:49.050
Tell me if you're
seeing the same thing.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.960
Every media has a
different function,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.630
but those are the four,
know Facebook, Twitter--

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.315
I'm going to make sure I
didn't lose anything, because--

00:22:57.315 --> 00:22:58.370
LAURA MURPHY: Insta,
Insta and YouTube.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.536
AARON FOLEY: I can hear our
digital and social media

00:23:00.536 --> 00:23:02.537
manager back over there
saying, but you forgot--

00:23:02.537 --> 00:23:04.786
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, that was
just a question about you

00:23:04.786 --> 00:23:06.150
though, Aaron, so that's good.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:11.460
Going back to the two books,
actually, to the process--

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.210
it's interesting.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.820
Your first book was really
written by a party of one,

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.320
whereas your second
book, I believe,

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.340
you had 32 contributors
to that one.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.370
How did that go?

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.430
How did you even
solicit those stories

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.677
about those neighborhoods?

00:23:24.677 --> 00:23:26.010
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.190
AARON FOLEY: The publisher put
out a call for submissions.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.700
Well, I should back
up a little bit.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.190
So the first book that
came out about Detroit

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.590
through Belt Publishing
was a Detroit anthology.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.150
The second was mine.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.382
But one of the other
cities, Cleveland,

00:23:42.382 --> 00:23:43.590
did a neighborhood guidebook.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.850
And I was thinking to
myself, oh, Detroit

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.510
should have a
neighborhood guidebook.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.610
Why does Cleveland get
to go before Detroit?

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.622
LAURA MURPHY: We're way cooler.

00:23:51.622 --> 00:23:54.390
AARON FOLEY: And Detroit
has so many different kinds

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.680
of neighborhoods.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.130
One of the things that
is pervasive throughout

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.730
the narrative of Detroit
is everything is downtown,

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.970
and then there's nothing
outside of downtown.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.300
And people in Detroit
know that's not true.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.980
So I said to
myself, why don't we

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.189
gather as many different
voices from across the city,

00:24:10.189 --> 00:24:11.730
whether they live
in the city or not?

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.180
But just tell me something
about this far-flung East Side

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:14.640
neighborhood.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.764
So tell me something about
this far-flung West Side

00:24:16.764 --> 00:24:20.129
neighborhood, all these places
in between the two narratives.

00:24:20.129 --> 00:24:20.920
Why don't we do it?

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.380
So we put out a call for
submissions, and we got a lot.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.030
We got a lot.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.340
And we had to narrow it down.

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.530
And actually, two
of the writers said

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.712
they want to do a part two.

00:24:29.712 --> 00:24:31.920
And I was just like, you
guys can handle all of that,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.025
because it was a--

00:24:33.025 --> 00:24:33.380
LAURA MURPHY: Wait.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.129
Do you have an
announcement to make today?

00:24:35.129 --> 00:24:36.750
Are you writing part
two to that book?

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.250
AARON FOLEY: No.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.055
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, I was going
to say you could break it

00:24:39.055 --> 00:24:40.070
here first if you are.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.450
AARON FOLEY: I put the
bug in my publisher's ear,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.380
and she's like, wait.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.754
I do have an
announcement though.

00:24:44.754 --> 00:24:47.789
The second edition of "How To
Live In Detroit Without Being

00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:49.080
a Jackass" comes out this fall.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.540
LAURA MURPHY: Ah, yay.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.580
AARON FOLEY: So, and
it's going to have--

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.920
LAURA MURPHY: You heard
it here first, right?

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.532
Are we first?

00:24:53.532 --> 00:24:54.240
AARON FOLEY: Yes.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.005
LAURA MURPHY: Yes, you
heard it here first.

00:24:56.005 --> 00:24:56.490
Yay, good.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.290
AARON FOLEY: So it'll have
a new cover and all that.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.090
But my publisher said, well, you
got to get through this first

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.798
before you even think
about another book.

00:25:01.798 --> 00:25:05.504
And I'm like, I'm not
thinking about another book.

00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:07.670
LAURA MURPHY: I love this,
because this is obviously

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.920
the Verner's branding
that you used.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.284
And it stands out.

00:25:11.284 --> 00:25:12.950
And I wonder if you
know that, if you're

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:13.950
from outside of Detroit.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.870
But are you doing the same
branding with your second book?

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:17.145
AARON FOLEY: I don't know.

00:25:17.145 --> 00:25:17.790
LAURA MURPHY: Still
working on it?

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.550
AARON FOLEY: I'm working
the designer now,

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.830
and we were like--

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:22.699
Karen Dybis, another
local author,

00:25:22.699 --> 00:25:23.990
wrote a book about Better Made.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.323
And it has the Better Made logo.

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:27.110
And so she already
took that one.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.080
And I was like, well,
maybe it could be Faygo.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.230
And I was just
like, well, no, why

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.190
does it have to be another pop?

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:32.420
And I was thinking about
all these local brands,

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.046
like Motown and
Hudson's and something.

00:25:34.046 --> 00:25:35.378
LAURA MURPHY: Motown, do Motown.

00:25:35.378 --> 00:25:36.440
AARON FOLEY: Yeah.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.250
But then people will think
it's a book about music,

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:39.723
and I don't want them
to think that, so yeah.

00:25:39.723 --> 00:25:40.820
LAURA MURPHY: That's true.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.340
But this wasn't a book
about soda pop, either.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.890
AARON FOLEY: It wasn't.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.740
The Verner's cover was--

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.540
I knew people in
Detroit would get it,

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.040
but I wanted, if it ever got--

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.120
which it ended up doing.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.415
It got sold in Ohio and
Brooklyn and Chicago

00:25:56.415 --> 00:25:57.290
and places like that.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.420
I wanted, if you were from
Michigan or from the Midwest,

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:00.920
and you were in a
bookstore, and you

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.900
saw that, you would
immediately know

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.670
that it's got some
sort of Detroit

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:05.711
or Midwestern connection.

00:26:05.711 --> 00:26:07.485
LAURA MURPHY: Totally, yeah.

00:26:07.485 --> 00:26:09.110
Going back to what
we were just talking

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.760
about with the second
book, the guidebook.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.970
You got tons of submissions.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.330
What was one of the best ones,
if there's just a quick story,

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:20.150
that you couldn't
publish maybe you

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.639
could tell us about here today?

00:26:21.639 --> 00:26:23.930
AARON FOLEY: One of the ones,
honestly, that I couldn't

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.950
publish was a photo essay.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.500
And that was because
to print photo

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.369
through a small press,
and the distributor

00:26:33.369 --> 00:26:35.410
that we were using at the
time and the book press

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.289
that we were using at the time,
it would have cost way more.

00:26:38.289 --> 00:26:39.830
And we probably
would not have gotten

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:41.060
that return on investment.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.080
But now that the
publisher is growing--

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.410
Belt is growing rapidly.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.190
Every time you look
[INAUDIBLE],, the publisher,

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.390
is announcing a new book.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.120
Now I wonder if there's
more funding to actually do

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.780
more photos in books.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.900
But yeah, that was
something that was like,

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.040
ugh, I wish I could.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.080
Because a few of
the contributors

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.940
also included photos with their
essays, and I kept saying,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.724
I really, really wish we
could, but we can't do photos.

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:07.390
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, we
wish you could too.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.970
Maybe part two of
that book we well.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.000
AARON FOLEY: I was going to
say, part two will have to--

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.083
if there is one, I'm not--

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.550
LAURA MURPHY: That's awesome.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.330
All right, well, I
also read somewhere

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.370
that you host pub trivia nights.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.120
AARON FOLEY: Yes.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.310
LAURA MURPHY: Is
there some place

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.290
that you do that regularly so
we can all come and play trivia

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:28.790
with you?

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.370
AARON FOLEY: Yes, every
Wednesday at six o'clock

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.820
at Firebird Tavern in Greektown.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.790
My friend from college is the
operations manager for Quizzo.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.624
LAURA MURPHY: Oh,
yeah, I love Quizzo.

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.040
AARON FOLEY: Yeah,
and I just love

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.456
to pretend to be
a game show host,

00:27:42.456 --> 00:27:44.670
and you get to buy people
beer and all of that.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:50.450
So it gets really
nerdy sometimes.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:52.970
There's a whole team of
local trivia writers, right?

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.250
So they're always talking
about "Star Wars" and "Lord

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.833
of the Rings."

00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:58.340
And I'm not saying that's nerdy,
but they get deep into it.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.320
And sometimes the host
will have to get on them.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.430
We're like, we know what
this means, but some of this

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.040
is going above the
heads of the people that

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.040
just want to play along.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.664
So we had to tone it
down a little bit.

00:28:09.664 --> 00:28:11.810
But they also get into a
lot of local questions,

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.250
like Red Wings
and local history.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.186
LAURA MURPHY: I
was going to say it

00:28:14.186 --> 00:28:16.420
would be so neat to do a
Detroit trivia night sometime.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.050
AARON FOLEY: Yeah, I'm
going to pitch that to Mike

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.340
as soon as I get out of here.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.249
LAURA MURPHY: Perfect.

00:28:21.249 --> 00:28:22.040
We would love that.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.180
That would be so great.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.090
It wasn't shocking
to me when I read

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:29.420
that you do that because,
at least in your first book,

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.030
your first book lends itself
a lot to being a neighborhood

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:34.020
guidebook, like
your second book.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.190
And then when I read that
you host this trivia night,

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:38.900
there were so many
things I learned.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.230
Who knew that the Rencen
had a movie theater in it?

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.550
AARON FOLEY: Yeah.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.840
LAURA MURPHY: That's crazy.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:46.040
Any who knew that there was
over 200 different neighborhoods

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.120
in Detroit?

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.140
So how do you know so much?

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.080
I know you're from Detroit,
but these smaller things

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.690
that go back to the research
process of your book,

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:01.542
was it just a ton of
visiting places and research?

00:29:01.542 --> 00:29:03.500
AARON FOLEY: It was a
little bit of everything.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.290
I was blessed to have a civics
teacher in high school--

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:07.580
her name was Ms. Wyatt--

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.300
who subtly taught us a
lot about Detroit history

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.469
in the grander scheme
of social studies.

00:29:13.469 --> 00:29:15.260
And I was just really
fascinated about some

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.060
of the stuff she was saying.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.260
She was talking about how
certain neighborhoods--

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:19.820
we were in high school, right?

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.100
This is stuff that's kind
of old hat to anybody

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:27.130
over the age of 45 in Detroit,
but talking about how former

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.450
neighborhoods used to be
Jewish before they were black

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.355
and all these types of things.

00:29:32.355 --> 00:29:34.730
I was literally passing by a
church on the Northwest side

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.830
yesterday leaving a
community meeting,

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.500
and I believe it's
a Baptist church

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.090
or a Church of God and Christ.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:46.124
But they still have the same
glass Star of David out front.

00:29:46.124 --> 00:29:47.540
LAURA MURPHY: In
a Baptist church.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.850
AARON FOLEY: And it's
clearly not a synagogue.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:53.360
But I was just absorbing
all of these little bits

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.130
of information about Detroit.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.327
And you go to a party
or something like that,

00:29:57.327 --> 00:29:59.285
and you try to break the
ice with someone else.

00:29:59.285 --> 00:30:00.620
And I'm always a nerd about it.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.620
I'm just like, did you
know that Detroit has this?

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.682
And they're just looking
at me like, what?

00:30:06.682 --> 00:30:08.890
And I was like, OK, I'm not
going to do that anymore.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.970
Let me just write
down everything

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.530
I know and do some
additional research.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.670
Because I say in
the very beginning,

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.900
I don't know everything.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.260
But there's just a lot of stuff.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.280
Detroit is very old.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.930
It's more than 300 years old.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.040
And it's gone through a
lot of different changes.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.640
So there's a lot of different
things that need to be known.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.810
And one of the
things I love to say

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.167
is that Detroit is
truly an American city,

00:30:31.167 --> 00:30:33.250
but we don't think of
Detroit as an American city.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.330
We don't have a Liberty Bell.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:40.825
Or I spent a lot of time
in New York this year.

00:30:40.825 --> 00:30:42.616
And people are always
just like, oh, you've

00:30:42.616 --> 00:30:43.640
got to see the 9/11 Memorial.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.431
You've got to see--

00:30:44.431 --> 00:30:49.960
we don't have one of those
iconic American history things,

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.410
but we're very much part
of the American story.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.340
We're a trading
post and building

00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.940
sort of the backbone of that
economy, the Motor City,

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.942
being the arsenal of democracy,
all these types of things where

00:31:03.942 --> 00:31:06.400
a lot of the American dream
and a lot of the American story

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.570
has played out in
Detroit, but we

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.861
don't get enough credit for it.

00:31:08.861 --> 00:31:10.540
LAURA MURPHY: Right, absolutely.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.180
And you even say
this in your book.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.700
I think places like
the DIA and all

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.740
these wonderful
cultural destinations

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.140
that we have that I
think we take for granted

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.647
now, because we are such a
nice immigration melting pot.

00:31:22.647 --> 00:31:23.980
AARON FOLEY: I was going to say.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.982
The DIA does not
get enough credit.

00:31:25.982 --> 00:31:27.190
LAURA MURPHY: No, it doesn't.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:28.565
AARON FOLEY:
Because like I said,

00:31:28.565 --> 00:31:31.065
people think of the big museums,
the MoMA and the Guggenheim

00:31:31.065 --> 00:31:33.023
and things like that,
and they're always either

00:31:33.023 --> 00:31:34.210
in LA or New York, right?

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:37.150
No one thinks of any city
in between the two biggest

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.730
cities as having world
class art museums.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:44.720
But the DIA has world class art.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.360
LAURA MURPHY: It's
similar to the DSO

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.510
being one of the most
spectacular symphony orchestras

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.220
I have ever been to.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.840
We're just super fortunate.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.930
Along those lines,
I think you are

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.690
familiar that we are moving
the Google office down

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.910
to downtown Detroit.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.620
Curious, I have to
ask this question.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.800
Any tips for Googlers, how to
move to Detroit without being

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.790
a jackass Googlers?

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.580
AARON FOLEY: OK, well,
you can use Google to--

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.630
LAURA MURPHY: You can use
Google, or you can think of--

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.270
I know this question gets asked
to the mayor's office a lot.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:19.090
The biggest job right now
is getting big companies

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.850
like Google to come down, move
your full operations down.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.610
We've seen Microsoft
do it recently.

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.560
We saw QuickenLoans
be one of the first

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.730
to do it several years ago.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.769
So anything along
those topics at mind?

00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:34.060
AARON FOLEY: Like I said,
you've got a world around you

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.559
in Detroit.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.235
At LCA, a lot of
things are going

00:32:39.235 --> 00:32:41.860
to be in walking distance, or in
some cases, the same building.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.510
But you're also going to
be close to Mexicantown

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.880
in southwest Detroit.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.210
So you can take 75
straight down and check out

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.970
all of the different
places down there.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.659
If you're feeling
going out of the way,

00:32:54.659 --> 00:32:56.200
there's a couple of
take out barbecue

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.220
places along the Lodge.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.420
[INAUDIBLE],, or whatever
your preferred term

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.200
is-- it's the Lodge.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.040
LAURA MURPHY: Just
like McNichols, 6 Mile.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.290
AARON FOLEY: Yes.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:12.042
But also, if there's a
chance, I'd also check out--

00:33:12.042 --> 00:33:13.500
I'm passionate
about neighborhoods.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.270
So LCA is right across
from Brush Park,

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.890
which just today
"The New York Times"

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.191
had the whole slide show
called "Detroit Was Crumbling,

00:33:21.191 --> 00:33:21.940
Now It's Reviving.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.350
Here's How."

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.620
The bulk of that slide
show was in Brush Park,

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.962
but also near downtown,
Indian Village, the Gold Coast

00:33:29.962 --> 00:33:31.920
neighborhood, Rivertown
neighborhood, the River

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.110
Walk along Jefferson
Avenue, the upcoming

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.396
things that are coming
to Lafayette Park and all

00:33:38.396 --> 00:33:39.770
of those East Side
neighborhoods.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.930
If you go further north
along Wilbur, the North End--

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.570
the North End is actually
where my family settled

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.884
when they came up north.

00:33:48.884 --> 00:33:50.800
And North End has gone
through its challenges.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.480
A lot of Motown stars lived
there and things like that.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.480
But over the years, the
neighborhood has sort of

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.021
crumbled a little
bit, but it's still

00:33:57.021 --> 00:33:58.180
a very proud neighborhood.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.060
It's home to a lot of the
techno, some of the more

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.700
cutting edge techno
artists here in Detroit.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.580
And they do some of
these underground art

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.270
things over there
and things like that.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.389
It's also a great place
to buy a very cheap house

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:11.060
and restore it.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:17.719
So as development pushes
north, New Center on one side,

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:19.989
North End on the
other, those two areas

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:23.210
are probably going to
become more popular.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.500
But there's always a lot
to explore in Detroit.

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.909
There's no doubt that
a lot of neighborhoods

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:34.210
have a long way to go,
but things are happening.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.940
Things are happening
at a very rapid pace.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.150
It's still not going
to happen tomorrow.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.620
It's not going to
happen next year.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.129
But something is
going to happen.

00:34:44.129 --> 00:34:44.920
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.050
Those are some great tips.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.580
So we'll have to make
sure we take that list

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.980
and get that distributed.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.400
Oh, and then buy your second
book, since it'll be fall.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:55.524
The two will coincide
nicely together.

00:34:55.524 --> 00:34:57.190
One more thing back
to the topic of you,

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.430
because I mentioned that you
were a copywriter at Team

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.400
Detroit, now GTB.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.200
We're very familiar
with that agency.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.860
They're one of our
stellar partners

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.170
in the world of what
we do here at Google.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:14.370
How did you make the
transition out of being--

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.120
did you work on
automotive business there?

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:16.370
AARON FOLEY: Yeah.

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.750
LAURA MURPHY: Probably 100%,
out of being an automotive

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:20.280
copywriter into--

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.070
and I know there is something in
between-- but this awesome job

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:25.240
you have now as the chief
storyteller at the mayor's

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:25.780
office.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.780
AARON FOLEY: It was
a very twisted path

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.449
getting to Team Detroit.

00:35:29.449 --> 00:35:30.990
LAURA MURPHY: Oh,
wow, getting there?

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.740
AARON FOLEY: Yeah.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:37.790
So it was sort of the last
place I thought I would end up.

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:42.570
But I was working as
an automotive reporter

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.630
at "Ward's Auto," which
is a trade publication--

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:47.220
it's in Southfield--

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.570
covering Chrysler.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.342
And I was doing a lot of--

00:35:51.342 --> 00:35:53.550
I wasn't just writing about
the business of Chrysler.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.860
I was reviewing a lot of cars.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.970
I was flying all over
the place and getting

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.700
to know all of the
automotive reporters

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:04.740
across different magazines
and things like that.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.350
Things at "Ward's
Auto" were going great.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:09.540
Then I got laid off from there.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.880
But before I got laid
off from "Ward's Auto,"

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.647
I was freelancing
for "Jalopnik."

00:36:14.647 --> 00:36:16.230
"Jalopnik" used to
be owned by Gawker.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.519
Now it's owned by Univision.

00:36:18.519 --> 00:36:20.310
I was writing about
Detroit for "Jalopnik,"

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.970
and I built an
audience that way.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:25.530
So I used my freelancing
chops at "Jalopnik"

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.500
to wiggle my way into some
other freelancing gigs,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.330
and that was keeping
me afloat for a while.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:35.880
But I was thinking to myself,
I really want a full time job.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.309
So freelancing is great.

00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:40.600
Talking about Detroit is great.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.100
But I missed going to
an office instead of

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:45.760
sitting in my PJs writing.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.590
So I used some of my
automotive experience.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.520
And I don't want to say
used, but I knew someone

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.060
at Team Detroit who
was working there.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.740
And they said they
needed copy writers.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.120
They especially needed
someone who knows

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.370
a little bit about automotive.

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.880
And I said, yeah, I can do that.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.180
So I ended up at Team Detroit.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.800
But copywriting,
while I loved it,

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.330
I liked working on the Ford
account and things like that.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:13.310
I really missed journalism.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:16.050
So I was still freelancing on
the side, kind of moonlighting

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.080
a little bit.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.350
And one of the places
I was freelancing for,

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:23.190
"BLAC" magazine, their
editor's chair opened up.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.469
And I was thinking to myself,
well, I'm going to try this.

00:37:26.469 --> 00:37:29.010
I'm going to put my hat in the
ring and see if I can do this.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:31.940
And I got that job.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.420
So I went from journalism to
advertising back to journalism,

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.269
but then while I was
editing at "BLAC,"

00:37:41.269 --> 00:37:42.810
I got a call from
the mayor's office.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.700
Because all of the
freelancing that I had done,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.658
and the book had just
come out and all of that,

00:37:46.658 --> 00:37:48.016
he was reading a lot of it.

00:37:48.016 --> 00:37:48.974
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, nice.

00:37:48.974 --> 00:37:50.256
Oh, the mayor read your book.

00:37:50.256 --> 00:37:52.080
Wow, that's so
flattering, isn't it?

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.470
AARON FOLEY: Yeah.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:58.934
And I was like, oh,
well, that's cool.

00:37:58.934 --> 00:38:00.350
LAURA MURPHY: I'll
take that call.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.032
AARON FOLEY: Yeah, I'll take--

00:38:03.032 --> 00:38:05.490
the chief of staff from the
mayor's office called and said,

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.540
let's have dinner.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.620
I want to talk to you
about some things.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.880
And I'm thinking
she's wanting to talk

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.370
to me about coverage of the City
of Detroit for the magazine.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:12.786
I'm just like, oh,
yeah, I've been

00:38:12.786 --> 00:38:14.640
waiting for this
conversation for a while,

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.515
because I was trying to
build the magazine up

00:38:16.515 --> 00:38:19.230
to have a little bit more
of a foothold in Detroit

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.616
as much as it did
in the suburbs.

00:38:20.616 --> 00:38:21.990
And she was like,
oh, no, we want

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:24.419
to talk to you about some new
things we've got going on.

00:38:24.419 --> 00:38:26.210
And we think you'd be
perfect for this job.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.560
And I thought about it.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.080
I consulted with my parents.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:33.750
And I was like, ugh, I don't
want to change jobs again.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:34.260
I just--

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.815
LAURA MURPHY: You just
got this editor's job.

00:38:35.815 --> 00:38:36.565
AARON FOLEY: Yeah.

00:38:36.565 --> 00:38:38.700
And I was laid off
before, and it's also

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.936
during an election year.

00:38:39.936 --> 00:38:41.560
And I was like, well,
what if the mayor

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:42.518
doesn't get re-elected?

00:38:42.518 --> 00:38:43.440
What happens then?

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.023
And all these types of things--
and I was like, you know what?

00:38:46.023 --> 00:38:47.490
I'm just going to
jump and do it.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:50.000
You only get one chance
to do a job like this.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.390
So after many, many,
many sleepless nights,

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:56.290
I took the job.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.372
And I came up with
the job title myself.

00:38:58.372 --> 00:38:59.580
LAURA MURPHY: Did you really?

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.260
AARON FOLEY: So there's other
chief storytellers out there,

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.093
but there wasn't one
in the City of Detroit.

00:39:03.093 --> 00:39:04.980
And there was only
a few at the time.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.170
I Googled it, and I think
Microsoft had someone,

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.490
and Delta Airlines has one.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:09.780
But it wasn't a big job title.

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.196
Now, all of a
sudden, I don't want

00:39:11.196 --> 00:39:12.410
to say I kicked off a trend.

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:14.370
But you're starting to see.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.770
I see now either the job
title or storytelling

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.610
is in the job description.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.930
LAURA MURPHY: What were
they hiring you to do?

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:25.110
Were they hiring you to
do something very similar?

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.360
AARON FOLEY: So they needed--

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.530
the mayor really wanted someone
who identified with Detroit

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.200
and could speak to what's
going on in Detroit

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.830
and has an eye for things
going on in Detroit

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.590
and bringing that to our cable
channel and our media services

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.380
department.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:45.360
So that's where I am
housed is with the staff

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.130
that puts out public
access programming

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:49.200
and does the audio visual
engineering and things

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:49.782
like that.

00:39:49.782 --> 00:39:51.490
The city has four
public access channels,

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:53.730
so we brought on two
videographers in addition

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:55.890
to the ones that
were already hired

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.350
to produce content
relating to the mission

00:39:58.350 --> 00:39:59.910
that he had asked me to do.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:03.000
So I send the two
videographers, the two writers,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.070
and a photographer out
to just cover Detroit

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.072
as if we are a newsroom.

00:40:07.072 --> 00:40:08.530
So we talk to
neighborhood leaders.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.815
We talk to business owners.

00:40:09.815 --> 00:40:10.690
We talk to residents.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.652
We talk to churches,
nonprofits, all

00:40:12.652 --> 00:40:14.110
of these different
types of things,

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:17.110
and try to get a full picture
of what's going on Detroit.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:19.120
So we know there's
a lot of stuff

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.210
going on downtown
with the new arena

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.410
and in the QLine and
things like that.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:26.830
And we know that there are
still some challenges that

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.205
need to be addressed in the
way of poverty, unemployment,

00:40:29.205 --> 00:40:29.710
and crime.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:33.370
But we also see the opportunity
to say, hey, let's not

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.310
forget about people who--

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.200
today, we did a
story about a woman

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.140
who's making it her
mission to enroll everybody

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.340
into a block club.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.850
So these small
victories along the way

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.206
is what we also like to talk
about in our media services

00:40:48.206 --> 00:40:50.080
department, and that's
how I ended up telling

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.540
these stories of Detroit.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.290
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
that's so interesting.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.740
And even here at Google, if
you're not a self-promoter,

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.940
you're not really
rising to the top.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.820
So it's interesting
that you've assumed

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.520
the position of
self-promoting Detroit,

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.160
not just domestically
too, but also it

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.430
seems like you've done some
cool things outside of Michigan

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:12.280
even, to really get
people to pay attention

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.775
to our great city.

00:41:13.775 --> 00:41:16.150
AARON FOLEY: But I am very
fortunate that a lot of people

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:18.500
are very interested in the
Detroit story right now.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.690
But I think what's
key is, again,

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:23.960
having someone that can
communicate from a Detroiter's

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.020
perspective.

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.560
I think for a very long time--

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.230
and this is not a
knock on anyone--

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.089
but a lot of Detroit's
story was being

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:33.130
told by people who were
very new to the city, who

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.030
were very green to the city.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.570
And they were telling
their perspectives from--

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.490
I've lived in Detroit
for two years,

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:42.065
and I love my life in
the last two years.

00:41:42.065 --> 00:41:43.940
And it's just like, but
what about the people

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.170
who have lived here for like
20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years?

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.000
It's very important
to have that balance

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.050
and have the dialogue
across the whole city,

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.066
not just a handful of people.

00:41:53.066 --> 00:41:54.940
LAURA MURPHY: We are so
fortunate to have you

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.390
in that position, because you
bring the credibility of having

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.800
grown up here.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.790
You've held a lot of number of
professional and freelance jobs

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:04.600
around the city.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.300
And you just have the right
spirit and the right energy.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.190
So thank you for
representing our city

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:12.040
so well as well as you do.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.000
One last question for
you, Aaron, and tell us

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.080
what you can.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.220
But mentioning the mayor's
office similar to Team Detroit,

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.710
GTB, they've been a
wonderful partner of ours

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.010
here at Google, a big supporter
of us moving downtown.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:30.130
Is there one thing maybe
that we don't know about

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:34.150
that the mayor's office is
doing that's extra special?

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.490
Or maybe something
that we can know about

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.770
that you haven't had a
chance to write about yet

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:41.770
or really get out
there publicly?

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.120
AARON FOLEY: I think--

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.100
we talked about
it earlier as far

00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.196
as gentrification and whatnot.

00:42:47.196 --> 00:42:49.570
I think one of the things that
a lot of people don't know

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:51.880
is that there are a lot of
people in city government

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.650
who are very passionate
against making

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.180
sure gentrification
doesn't happen.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.640
There's a lot of challenges.

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:00.490
You cannot fight the
free market, right?

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.430
But a lot of people don't know
that, for example, our housing

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:05.890
director has gone
to what we call

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:07.780
at-risk properties,
properties that

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.820
are at risk of going from a
fixed income affordable housing

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.120
to a market rate building.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.930
So he's gone
building to building

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:20.590
to convince those landlords
to remain fixed income

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.450
or affordable for
the next 20, 30,

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:24.930
however long the contract is.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:26.930
You have people like our
development team, which

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:31.370
just hired a Google
former employee who

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.610
are securing all of
these grants and things

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.520
like that to try and create
more affordable housing.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.471
Because we know
that, like I said,

00:43:38.471 --> 00:43:40.720
there is a lot of challenges
that have come generation

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.780
to generation to generation,
and we're living with them now.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:48.610
And a lot of people cannot
afford to live in a city with

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:51.020
Chicago rents or
San Francisco rents.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.440
So how do we do everything
we can on the government

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.570
side to make sure
that Detroit remains

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:57.370
affordable to all residents?

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.260
And that's something,
in my opinion, that

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.700
doesn't get out there enough.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.400
The overwhelming fear, and
it's a very legitimate fear--

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.280
don't get me wrong.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.040
It's a very legitimate
fear of getting pushed out.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.260
It's a very legitimate
fear of getting gentrified.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:08.740
LAURA MURPHY: It's scary.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.406
AARON FOLEY: Every
time a new restaurant

00:44:10.406 --> 00:44:13.270
opens, the hairs on the back
of people's necks go up.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:17.410
But I highly encourage
people to understand

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:21.700
that you have people that are
doing everything in their power

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:26.110
to make sure that people
are leaving Detroit faster

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:28.020
than they're coming in.

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.920
And there may not be somebody
ready to take their place.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.830
So what do we do to
retain and preserve

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.220
quality, a better quality
of life for the Detroiters

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.090
that are here?

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.150
A key tenant of that is
creating and preserving

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:41.090
affordable housing.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.381
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:42.381 --> 00:44:43.921
Housing is very important.

00:44:43.921 --> 00:44:46.420
And then all of the shops that
have popped up along Woodward

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.880
too make it just an incredible
place to be right now.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:50.892
It's so exciting.

00:44:50.892 --> 00:44:51.850
AARON FOLEY: I really--

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:53.340
I'm going to put this out there.

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.239
It's not true.

00:44:55.239 --> 00:44:57.280
So there was there was a
report a couple of weeks

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.320
ago that said H&amp;M was coming.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.100
I wouldn't mind if an H&amp;M
comes, and I can neither confirm

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.180
nor deny.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.562
However, you know what I
would love to see in Detroit?

00:45:06.562 --> 00:45:07.520
I was just in New York.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.394
I was just in Denver.

00:45:08.394 --> 00:45:09.450
LAURA MURPHY: Uniqlo.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:09.650
AARON FOLEY: Uniqlo.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:10.955
LAURA MURPHY: It's
my favorite place.

00:45:10.955 --> 00:45:12.240
I was hoping you were
going to say Uniqlo.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:12.950
AARON FOLEY: This
is a Uniqlo shirt.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:13.430
This is a Uniqlo shirt.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:14.450
LAURA MURPHY: Uniqlo
is my favorite store.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:15.560
I'm going to New York tomorrow.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.713
It's on my list of things to do.

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.200
AARON FOLEY: And they only
have like, what, five stores

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.700
in the country?

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:19.130
And I'm just like--

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:20.570
LAURA MURPHY: Can you
help us get a Uniqlo here?

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:22.130
AARON FOLEY: That's why
I'm putting it out there.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.530
So if you guys-- so use
your search engine magic,

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:26.177
and tag them in everything.

00:45:26.177 --> 00:45:27.510
LAURA MURPHY: OK, all right, OK.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.210
We'll work together on this.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.251
AARON FOLEY: I'll say
Detroit is perfect for one,

00:45:31.251 --> 00:45:33.200
because Detroit and
Denver are the same size.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.400
We have the same population.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.750
We have the same square footage.

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.125
And I think about--

00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:38.360
Uniqlo is cheap.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:38.540
LAURA MURPHY: It's amazing.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.160
AARON FOLEY: It's just as cheap
as H&amp;M. And I think about,

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.500
if we're talking about
issues of affordability

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.730
and things like that,
I think about kids

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:46.040
who need school uniforms, and
kids who need play clothes.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:46.970
Put a Uniqlo downtown.

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:48.595
LAURA MURPHY: They
sell uniforms there.

00:45:48.595 --> 00:45:49.710
Yeah, that's a good point.

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.455
And it's for men, women, kids.

00:45:51.455 --> 00:45:52.788
AARON FOLEY: It's for everybody.

00:45:52.788 --> 00:45:54.324
LAURA MURPHY: It's
for everybody.

00:45:54.324 --> 00:45:55.740
Well, actually,
it's a good point.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:56.000
AARON FOLEY: It's very selfish.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.430
LAURA MURPHY: So that's
your retail wish list.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:01.985
If you had-- gosh, we have so
many amazing places to eat,

00:46:01.985 --> 00:46:05.330
even grocery stores that
have retained their heritage.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.330
If you had one wish for, not a
chain, or it could be a chain,

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:11.095
but a type of restaurant that
we're missing or we're lacking,

00:46:11.095 --> 00:46:12.720
what would you like
to see in the city?

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.180
AARON FOLEY: We're missing a
full scale Indian restaurant.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.542
LAURA MURPHY: OK, all right, OK.

00:46:18.542 --> 00:46:20.000
AARON FOLEY: When
I say full scale,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.100
I mean with a bar, a
large amount of seating.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.520
There's one or two.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.984
The one I'm thinking
of is mostly take out.

00:46:27.984 --> 00:46:29.400
If there's a second
one out there,

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.983
I can't think of
what it is right now.

00:46:30.983 --> 00:46:33.500
But we're missing a full
scale Indian restaurant.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.680
What else are we missing?

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.320
That's the main
thing I can think of.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.300
I love Indian food, so.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.310
LAURA MURPHY: I was just
at the Adventure Park,

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:44.405
actually, right along--

00:46:44.405 --> 00:46:45.530
AARON FOLEY: Oh, the river.

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:46.529
LAURA MURPHY: I love it.

00:46:46.529 --> 00:46:49.970
And that, I believe,
the Michigan DNR

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.190
actually sponsors that
along the River Walk.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.530
And it got me to
thinking, Belle Isle

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:57.890
is one of our favorite places
to picnic and go to the aquarium

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.829
and take a walk
and whatever else.

00:46:59.829 --> 00:47:01.370
And now we've got
the Adventure Park.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:05.840
So in my opinion, I think we're
missing more places like that,

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.350
places for like big parties
or birthday parties or group

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:10.590
gatherings, group events.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.770
So I don't know exactly
what that looks like,

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.290
but that would be
on my wish list.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:15.800
AARON FOLEY: There's a few.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.160
I think of Rouge Park
way on the West Side,

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:22.280
how much outdoor
space there is there.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.390
I cannot call--

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.690
Balduck Park, Balduck Park
has a few outdoor activities.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.340
I cannot think of
the name of the park,

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.330
but it's in
Banglatown, I believe,

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:32.690
where there's a Gaga ball park.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.910
And apparently, unless
you have little kids,

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.500
nobody knows unless
you have kids.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.946
And it's like a handball
but on the ground,

00:47:39.946 --> 00:47:41.570
and it's a new sport
that only took off

00:47:41.570 --> 00:47:42.569
in the last three years.

00:47:42.569 --> 00:47:44.920
And there's video and photos
of the mayor playing Gaga.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.015
And he's getting into it.

00:47:47.015 --> 00:47:48.340
He had his sleeves rolled up.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:50.940
I was like, whoa,
whoa, these are kids.

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:55.550
But we're starting to
see the parts turnaround

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:56.480
for the better.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.010
For a long time, the
parks were neglected.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:01.460
The city didn't have a lot of
money and things like that.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.790
But we're starting to see
an uptick, and hopefully,

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:07.710
getting people outside.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:09.470
There's a few parks
near where I live,

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.900
and I'll be honest, I don't
use them as much as I should,

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.140
because I'm a homebody.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.310
But I feel like,
OK, I'm a city boy.

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.600
I should be using the
parks as well, so yeah.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.830
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, it's
interesting with the move

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.480
of all of our sports teams.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.880
All of our sports
teams are downtown now.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.530
But then I love what Detroit has
done for the sport of soccer,

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:35.030
because that Detroit FC team
is just on fire right now.

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.984
It is all the buzz.

00:48:35.984 --> 00:48:37.400
Everyone wants to
go see football.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.290
AARON FOLEY: And I don't
go to the DCFC games,

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:43.580
but I really
appreciate what they've

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.320
done to bring more
awareness to soccer.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.990
We've had interest
in MLB coming here.

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:51.214
And I don't know if we're
in the running for that,

00:48:51.214 --> 00:48:52.130
but it would be great.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.934
LAURA MURPHY: Ooh,
it would be so great.

00:48:52.934 --> 00:48:54.225
AARON FOLEY: It would be great.

00:48:54.225 --> 00:48:56.830
It would be great if we
had a major league and DCFC

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:57.944
peacefully coexist.

00:48:57.944 --> 00:48:59.360
I know there's
some tension there.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:03.140
But I think about the long term.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:06.700
I think about our areas
like Southwest Detroit

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.560
and Banglatown where you
have large soccer-playing

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.150
populations.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.290
And I played soccer
when I was a little kid.

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:15.650
And I'm thinking, the more
soccer we have, the better.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.207
Let's get all
these kids playing.

00:49:17.207 --> 00:49:19.540
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, because
it is an international game.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.660
But we won't show bias
towards our favorite sports.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.380
So thank you so much,
Aaron, for being here today.

00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:26.910
We really appreciate your time.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.330
And if you haven't read his
book or either of his books,

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:30.954
make sure you check
them out as well as

00:49:30.954 --> 00:49:32.830
the one that's on its
way out now this fall.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:34.190
So thank you again.

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:35.092
Appreciate it.

00:49:35.092 --> 00:49:36.050
AARON FOLEY: Thank you.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:39.700
[APPLAUSE]
