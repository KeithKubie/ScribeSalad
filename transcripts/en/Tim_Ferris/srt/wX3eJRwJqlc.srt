00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,413
[inaudible].

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,970
Hi, good morning. We're here
today with Timothy Ferriss,

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:11,910
who's the author of a new book
called the four hour workweek.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,770
Timothy is a CEO of a multinational
company and a guest lecture at Princeton.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,150
Timothy, how do I get a four
hour work week? Is that possible?

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,530
The four hour work week is possible,

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,490
but you need to completely
unplug and reset,

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:32,050
and the reason that's necessary
is because there is an epidemic,

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,850
and I do mean epidemic in this country
of information abuse and information

10
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:41,800
addiction where people have come to
believe that checking email 200 times per

11
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:42,400
day,

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,910
having a blackberry to your head or in
your hand while you're at dinner or on

13
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:49,900
the subway or in your car or with your
friends is the path to becoming more

14
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:51,850
productive and more
successful. I mean, it isn't.

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,400
It isn't because giving everyone
around you, every person in the world,

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,930
immediate access to you is inviting
interruption and inviting minutia to

17
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:06,010
completely invade your life, which is
happening to everyone and happened to you.

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,100
It did happen to me. I had no
intention of writing this book,

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:13,540
but from 2000 to 2004 I was working
at startups in Silicon Valley.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,433
I started my own.

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,970
I'm was CEO and I worked from
7:00 AM to 9:00 PM every day.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,520
I checked outlook hitting send,

23
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:25,630
receive 100 to 200 times per day like
a rat with a cocaine pellet dispenser,

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,800
slept under my cubicle, sent emails
on Thanksgiving to prospects.

25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,160
It was a depressing scene and it's a very
unfortunately common scene and I think

26
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:37,510
everyone is at a point of overwhelm.

27
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,690
There is more information
than we can possibly organize.

28
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,980
Time management is dead.

29
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,300
Turn that, turn that around.

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,030
The way you turn around is you have
to completely unplug and reset.

31
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,040
That means that you need
to take a step back.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,530
Forget about what people expect you to do.

33
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:58,880
Forget about what's popular and really
look at what works and what is consuming

34
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:02,870
your time. So there are four
steps. There's definition,

35
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,550
elimination, automation, and
liberation. Definition is simple.

36
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:09,980
First need to define your ideal lifestyle.

37
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,640
What do you want to be doing from when
you wake up to when you go to sleep?

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,960
And so what do you want to
have? What do you want to be,

39
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:22,160
what do you want to do and how much
does that ideal lifestyle cost?

40
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,060
And that becomes your target
elimination is simple.

41
00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:28,610
It's getting rid of everything,
all the static, all the noise,

42
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:32,180
all the interruptions, all of the
micromanaging, all the people possible,

43
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,760
the interfere with getting
you to the ideal lifestyle.

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,250
The third automation is about taking the
few remaining tasks that are important,

45
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:43,130
the time consuming and either delegating,

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,080
automating or somehow outsourcing
them. So in my particular case,

47
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,960
I have an army of MBAs in India,

48
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,800
that 25 of them who worked for $4 an
hour and take care of tasks that would

49
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:58,430
otherwise consume hundreds of my
hours. And then the last step,

50
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:02,950
liberation is about the final ingredient
in lifestyle design, which is mobility.

51
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,380
And then also how to use
the time once you create it,

52
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,230
which is very difficult for most
people. Okay. This is fascinating,

53
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,090
but that's the point.
It is difficult. I mean,

54
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,980
how do you put the blackberry down had,

55
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,580
aren't you worried that you're not going
to make as much money that you're going

56
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,240
to lose clients? Do you have statistics
that show that that's not the case?

57
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,860
I have statistics that would
absolutely make your head spin.

58
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,770
So if you're interrupted
by email and phone,

59
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:29,550
there was an experiment done at
kings kings college for example.

60
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,550
It showed that people who were stoned
scored six points better on IQ tests and

61
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,230
people who were interrupted
by email and phone

62
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,770
and that good to know at 26% of people
in the American workforce are on the

63
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,200
verge of a nervous breakdown.
The system is not working.

64
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:48,940
So it's not a question of of if I should
do this as a question of when it is the

65
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:49,990
only real alternative.

66
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,530
So one simple step that people can take
a baby step to prove the concept is to

67
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,500
simply use an autoresponder,

68
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,870
set up an autoresponder that
tells everyone who emails you.

69
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,210
I will be checking email twice a day.

70
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,350
It's great idea at 11 and 4:00 PM if you
require a more urgent response before.

71
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:11,780
One of those two times, call
me on my cell phone. Okay.

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,840
If I start losing customers,
I'm going to call you, Tim.

73
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,380
You can call me what's going to
happen instead of losing customers,

74
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:21,310
you'll get more done in the next 48 hours
than you would in the next two weeks.

75
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,970
Well, I appreciate this and I, uh, I
look forward to my four hour work week.

76
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,680
Thank you very much. You're very welcome.
