00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.140
 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.390
Hello, I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.230
This is the second in a series of 12
lectures prepared during the winter

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.090
and spring of 2013 on
the subject of copyright.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.470
The first lecture examined
three aspects of the foundation

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.230
of copyright law-- the set
of multilateral treaties

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.180
that set limits on the freedom
of each country in the world

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.980
to formulate its own laws
on this topic; the concept

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.930
of originality, which is required
for copyright protection;

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.550
and the distinction between
ideas, facts, and expression,

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.850
which operates to exclude important
kinds of intellectual property

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.920
from the ambit of copyright.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.110
This second lecture turns from
copyright law to copyright theory.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.710
By theory, I mean arguments
concerning when and why copyrights

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.360
should be created, and what the scope
or limit of those rights should be.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.550
Next week in the third lecture,
we'll return to the law of copyright.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.890
Specifically, I'll examine
the rules in the United States

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.470
and in other countries that
determine what kinds of works

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.385
fall within the zone of
copyright protection.

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.200
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
Let me remind you briefly of the
format and logistics of these lectures.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.950
Each will last between
60 and 90 minutes.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.330
This one will probably be a bit
shorter than the first lecture.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.540
Each of the lectures will be accompanied
by a fair amount of illustrative,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.810
graphic, and audiovisual materials.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.060
So it's best if you watch the
recordings of the lectures on a computer

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.440
or other device with a fair size screen.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.060
The most important of those
supplementary materials

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.370
will consist of two
maps that I've prepared,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.270
using the MindManager software program.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.010
The map that will accompany this
particular lecture is called,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.710
Theories of IT, which is,
as I'm sure you know by now,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.680
is the customary abbreviation
for intellectual property.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.210
 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.860
The heart of the map is
shown on your screen now.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.485
I'll be displaying the native version
of the map during this lecture.

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:22.710
But I've also prepared
a read-only PDF version,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.950
which can be downloaded from my
home page, the address of which

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.070
is tfisher.org.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.260
That's t, f, i, s, h, e, r dot org.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.990
Because I modify the map frequently,
if you find it useful in the future,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.750
you should check my website
on occasion to ensure

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.970
that you have the most current version.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.980
So now let's turn to the topic for
today, which as I've indicated,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.400
is copyright theory.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.650
As I've just mentioned,
by theory, I mean nothing

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.970
more than arguments concerning when
and why copyrights should be created,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.770
and what the scope or limits
of those rights should be.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.540
Before zeroing in on the
specific theories that

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.980
will occupy us during
this lecture, I should

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.120
say a bit more about what these
theories do and why they matter.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.790
 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.080
Here's the first and most
obvious role of theory.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.460
As you might expect, when expanding
or revising copyright law,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.370
lawmakers frequently
deploy arguments concerning

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.130
how much legal protection
creative works ought to get.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.910
When engaged in debates of these
sorts, lawmakers, or their advisers,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.320
sometimes advert directly
to formal theories developed

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.850
by economists, political theorists, and
philosophers that address that issue,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.870
and even more often to
less formal variants

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.630
of those theories in general
circulation in popular discourse.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.870
The result is that,
in order to understand

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.820
how copyright law has assumed
over time its current form

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.310
and how it's likely to
evolve in the future,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.800
you need to know, among other
things, the content of the theories

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.670
that the lawmakers in
practice attend to.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.330
 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.090
The next role of theory
is more instrumental.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.680
As you saw in the last lecture,
and as you will see frequently

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.310
in future lectures, crucial doctrines
in copyright law remain ambiguous.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.060
As a result, lawyers,
arguing for their clients,

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.800
frequently are obliged to
make normative arguments

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.550
about what the law should look like.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.330
Consequently, to be an effective
advocate, or an informed litigant,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.810
again you need to know the contents
of the available theories that

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.400
pertain to the appropriate
scope of copyrights.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.800
It's not enough to know what the law is.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.170
You have to be able to argue
effectively about what it should be.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.830
 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.580
The third role of theory is,
in my view, the most important.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.570
My goal is to help you make your
own informed judgments concerning

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.680
the respects in which our current
copyright system is socially

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.810
beneficial or pernicious and
where the law should go tomorrow.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.110
This is a subject that everyone
has a stake in, not merely lawyers.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.250
Copyright law is changing very rapidly.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.900
Its impact on the economy
and culture is large.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.630
Public debate, concerning
its appropriate ambit,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.120
is increasingly intense.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.820
My hope is that by the
end of this course,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.170
you will be able to participate in that
debate, intelligently and effectively.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.720
To do so, you need to know some theory.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.590
Historically, there have been four
main clusters of copyright theories.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.660
Theories of the first
type focus on fairness.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.640
They argue that the
law should be crafted

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.700
to give authors what they deserve.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.210
In other words, the rights or rewards
to which authors are morally entitled,

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.640
either because they worked
hard or because they

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.654
have contributed
importantly to our culture.

00:05:58.654 --> 00:06:00.570
Theories of this sort
tend to be somewhat more

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.430
popular and influential in common
law countries, such as Great

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.020
Britain and the United States,
but they have grip everywhere.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.910
Theories of the second
type focus on personality.

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.390
They argue that the law should
be crafted to give people

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.810
the rights or powers or
protections they need in order

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.010
to fully realize or enjoy personhood.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.850
These theories tend to be somewhat
more popular in civil law countries.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.754
But they have increasing
influence in other jurisdictions,

00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:31.920
including the United States.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.810
Theories of the third sort focus not
on the interest or moral entitlements

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.210
of individual creators, but on
the welfare of society at large.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.440
They contend that copyright
laws can and should

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.430
be crafted to produce the greatest
good of the greatest number.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.550
The way that familiar utilitarianism
criterion is usually translated

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.060
is that the law should
create a system of incentives

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.760
that will induce potential authors to
generate works from which we will all

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.870
benefit, and then make the fruits
of those efforts widely available.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.210
In other words, the law should
combine in an optimal mixture.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.620
On the one hand, stimuli for creativity.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.344
And on the other, mechanisms
for distributing creative works

00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:23.885
to consumers.

00:07:23.885 --> 00:07:27.760
 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.140
Theories in the fourth cluster similarly
look to the well-being of society

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.720
at large, but define that
well-being more capaciously.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.060
They contend that the
law should be crafted

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.540
so as to foster a just
and attractive culture.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.020
In determining what a just and
attractive culture would be,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.310
these theories do not limit themselves
to aggregate consumer welfare measured

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.170
by what consumers
themselves currently want.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.010
But instead, seek to
identify and cultivate

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.130
conditions that will support
widespread human flourishing.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.820
 

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.690
So those are the four approaches.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.670
The labels that we will
use for the four clusters

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.930
are fairness, personality,
welfare, and culture.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.820
 

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.790
All four of these
theories, as we will see,

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.932
are branches or variants
of broader theories,

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.640
dealing with intellectual
property rights

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.470
as a whole, which in turn are branches
of even more general arguments dealing

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:31.240
with property rights of all kinds,
including property and land-- commonly

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.610
known as real property-- and
tangible personal property.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.320
 

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.240
The roots of these four
arguments, as we will see,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.430
are old, extending back at least
as far as the 17th century.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.040
But many of the applications of those
theories to intellectual property--

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.630
and specifically to
copyright-- are quite recent.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.550
 

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:59.000
I've been using the term
cluster deliberately.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.570
It's a mistake, as I'll
try to show you, to think

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:05.140
of these theories as
unitary and determinant.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.900
It's an understandable mistake, because
some of the theorists themselves

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.880
claim to have identified
the one true theory

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.680
and to be capable of generating,
from their preferred approach,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:23.730
unique correct answers to every
specific issue that arises in the law.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.890
That's a very ambitious contention.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.560
And in my view, it doesn't hold up.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.700
But the element of
openness, or indeterminacy,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.370
in each of these theories does
not mean that they are pointless.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:41.520
Rather, each one offers a set of
concerns or issues that merit attention

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.080
and deepens our analysis of
those concerns and issues.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.680
This power to set agendas
and to guide and enrich

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.480
analysis-- I'll try to show--
can be extremely helpful.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.310
So with those cautionary
words in mind, let's

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.763
wade into the first of the approaches.
