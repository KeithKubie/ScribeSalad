JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Hi,
I'm Jarek Wilkiewicz,

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.118
and today we'll talk
about how to measure

00:00:03.118 --> 00:00:05.470
the additional engagement
your mobile app's getting

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.800
from Google Search.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.460
Let's say you run a
coffee shop like this one.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.610
People come and go.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.010
Some just hang out and
don't buy anything.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.940
Others spend a small
fortune on coffee or tea

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.380
and muffins every day.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.300
These are your best customers.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.210
When a patron buys
something at the counter,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.931
instead of just hanging
out, how can you

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:24.430
tell where they
came from so you can

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.020
get more customers like that?

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.500
Your coffee shop
has two entrances.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.170
There is the office
side entrance,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.310
where busy workers stream in
to get their caffeine fix,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.280
and the street side entrance.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.920
Are the office
workers more likely

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.050
to buy something than folks who
just walk in from the street?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.530
How could you tell?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.549
Suppose you could tag customers
as they entered the store.

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:47.090
You could then assign
a different tag

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.380
to the office and the
street side entrance

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.820
to see how their
behavior changes,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.660
depending on where the
customer came from.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.050
GIRL SPEAKER: OK, Google.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.730
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Let's say
that some of the customers find

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.715
your store online--for example,
by searching on Google.

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:01.390
It would be nice
if you could tell

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.519
how much money these customers
spend in the store, which items

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.270
are their favorites,
and even offer

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.830
a special discount and
personalized experience

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.490
just for them.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.050
If you're watching
this, you probably

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.800
don't run a coffee shop.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.980
But if you have built an
app, and if you integrate

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.340
with Google Search for
developers-- for example,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.270
through app indexing, voice
actions, or Google Now,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.730
Google Search will start sending
referral traffic your way.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.110
Whenever Google Search invokes
your app, in addition to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.490
the deep link into your
app, a piece of data

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.070
called the "referrer"
is also included.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.580
The referrer is the string,
and it looks like this.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.040
It helps you differentiate
between direct traffic

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.270
and referral traffic to your
app coming from Google Search.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.000
Once the user
enters your app, you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
can look at the value
of the referrer string

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.210
using the API to confirm the
user was sent to your app

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.160
by Google Search, and then
analyze their app activity,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.200
or even build a complete
conversion funnel

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.110
using Google Analytics.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.712
If you are wondering how
to integrate the deep link

00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:59.295
referrer data coming from Google
Search with Google Analytics,

00:01:59.295 --> 00:02:02.550
we've built a quick code
lab for you to get started.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.230
In the code lab,
you'll learn how

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.030
to detect that the user entered
your app through Google Search

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.789
and how to record
this information using

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.930
Google Analytics.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.230
You will see how to build
fancy graphs or slice

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.090
and dice the data
anyway you please.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.770
Follow the link on the
screen to get started.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.730
And thank you for watching.
