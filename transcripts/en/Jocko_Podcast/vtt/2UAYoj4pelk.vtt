00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.990
How do self-awareness,

2
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.290
self assessment and self improvement begin and how do they continue over time?

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.853
Well,

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.100
they're all tied together and it starts with being self aware,

5
00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:24.670
with being able to detach. Because if you,

6
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:27.340
if you cannot detach from yourself

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.700
then you can't see yourself.

8
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.180
And so people ask, well then how do you detach from yourself?

9
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:42.181
How do you learn to do that in a good drill for this is try to imagine the way

10
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:48.331
other people see you and what other people are thinking of you.

11
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.100
And one place where this happens,

12
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:57.850
and it definitely happened to me is when I started getting put in charge of

13
00:00:57.851 --> 00:01:01.300
things, I started thinking about other people's perspectives.

14
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.910
What are they seeing? If you're in charge,

15
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:11.770
then what are your subordinates see you do? What are your subordinates here?

16
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:12.604
You say,

17
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.640
what kind of representation are they receiving?

18
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.890
<v 0>And if you work for someone else, it's the same questions.</v>

20
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.720
What does the boss see me do? What does the boss hear me say?

21
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.400
What kind of representation am I making of myself?

22
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:35.300
To my boss.

23
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.170
<v 0>And then you start thinking about what are your friends and family think?</v>

25
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.980
What do they see? What do they hear?

26
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.490
It's still, the question becomes how well do you represent yourself?

27
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.220
What shortfalls do you have?

28
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.070
Now when you first start looking,

29
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.990
it's like you're looking at an overgrown lawn.

30
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.570
There are some big obvious problems. So you do a broad,

31
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.690
just kind of general cut of the grass.

32
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.790
You fix some of the big easy problems that are obvious.

33
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.490
Once you've done that,

34
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.900
once you've gotten rid of some of those big obvious problems,

35
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:29.610
you notice some more detailed problems. So then you handle them.

36
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.560
And once you've got those handled,

37
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.910
you see even smaller and more detailed issues. So you start trying to fix them.

38
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.500
<v 1>Okay?</v>

39
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.590
<v 0>And that's what you do with yourself.</v>

40
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:47.591
You continually detach and then you look and then you refine and then you detach

41
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:52.550
and then you look and then you refine and then you detach and you look and then

42
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:55.670
you refine. That's what you do.

43
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.390
That's how you get better. And that process doesn't stop.

44
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:08.391
It can't stop because if you stop refining then,

45
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.510
then the weeds grow back in. The next thing you know,

46
00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:16.730
you can't see yourself anymore.

47
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.570
Then when you can't see yourself anymore,

48
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.910
when you stop looking at you as yourself, then you accept,

49
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.480
you accept anything and that's wrong.

50
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.020
Don't accept the faults. Don't give yourself the benefit of the doubt.

51
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:44.890
You've got to be your own harshest critic.

52
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.953
Hold the line

53
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.800
and don't let go.
