00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome,
everyone.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.320
Thank you for coming to this
Pride Month event as we wait

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.940
for what we hope will be
good news from the US

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.010
Supreme Court soon.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.910
I wanted to thank Jimmy
and Pam for

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.329
inviting me to do this.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.605
I am very excited to meet these
three great supporters

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:25.470
of gay marriage and excellent
football players, as well.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.520
We have Chris Kluwe, Brendon
Ayanbadejo, and Scott Fujita.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.410
FEMALE SPEAKER: I will just tell
you a little bit about

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.240
each of these guys.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.100
You probably know most of it,
and then we'll go right into

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.240
some questions that I have
for them and then

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.130
Q&amp;A from the audience.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.570
So Chris joined the Oakland
Raiders recently, after many

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.030
years as the--

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.530
CHRIS KLUWE: That picture.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: --as the
Minnesota Vikings punter.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.790
Chris played for UCLA and went
to high school in California.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.360
He is an avid Guitar Hero and
World of Warcraft player, as

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.370
well as a bassist in a band
he founded in Minneapolis.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.260
His first book, a collection of
essays, is due out at the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.380
end of June and is titled
"Beautifully Unique Sparkle

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.330
Pony."

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.630
We'll ask him little
bit about that.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.200
You probably know where
that comes from.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.540
Chris is well known for the
letter he wrote in September

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.250
of last year to Maryland
State Assembly

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.820
Delegate Emmett Burns--

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: --who had sent
a letter to the owners of the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.590
Baltimore Ravens, requesting
that they keep Brendon from

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.640
speaking out publicly
in favor of

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.330
legalization of gay marriage.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.810
Chris, along with Brendon and
Scott and a number of other

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.240
professional athletes, filed an
amicus brief in the Prop 8

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.510
case before the Supreme Court.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.770
And in March of 2013, Chris
joined Athlete Ally, an

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.540
organization focused on stopping
homophobia and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.600
transphobia in sports,
as an ambassador.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.630
And we'll talk a little
bit more about that

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.080
organization, as well.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.289
Brendon is a linebacker, who
most recently played for the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.300
Super Bowl Champion
Baltimore Ravens--

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.130
sorry to the Niners' fans.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.426
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: He was.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.306
He was a linebacker, he was.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: Brendon also
played for UCLA and went to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.430
high school in California.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.950
Brendon has been a strong
advocate for gay marriage

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.350
since 2009.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.450
And as I mentioned, he wound up
in this firestorm when this

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.790
Maryland State Assembly Delegate
asked the team's

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.570
leadership to keep him from
expressing his opinions.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.120
And he responded that he had
no intention of remaining

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.300
silent on an issue of conscience
and public

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.585
importance.

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:50.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Brendon serves
as Chairman of the Athlete

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.960
Ally advisory board.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.700
He's, also, working on an
MBA at George Washington

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.640
University, and I understand,
hopes to become a university

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.280
athletic director at
UCLA, ideally.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.936
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Down the
line, when I'm a little bit

00:03:05.936 --> 00:03:06.950
more mature, yeah.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: --and
is writing a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.820
column for Fox Sports.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.470
Scott, very recently, retired
after many years as a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.550
linebacker, including with
the Saints when they

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.090
won the Super Bowl.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.730
Scott graduated from
Berkeley--

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.790
go Bears--

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.460
and was born in California.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.260
Scott first vocalized his
support for marriage equality

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.650
in 2009, and then again in
March, 2013, he wrote an

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.320
article in the "New York Times,"
expressing his support

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.150
for LGBT equality, dispelling
the notion that football

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.420
players, football as a sport,
and LGBT acceptance don't mix.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.000
Scott emphasized that he would
embrace a teammate, were the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.300
teammate to come out
of the closet.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.020
Scott is, also, actively
involved in many other causes,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.060
some of which we'll talk about,
such as promoting

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.430
adoption, breast cancer
awareness, the Gulf

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.870
restoration network,
and Team Gleason.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.240
And so with that, I
will start asking

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.034
you guys some questions.

00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:02.002
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:04.906
FEMALE SPEAKER: And thank
you, again, for coming.

00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:06.020
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Can
I say one thing

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.650
about Berkeley, though.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: You can.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.920
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: I love
Berkeley, and they're our

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.590
sister school, and they invented
the quarter system.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.700
And then they dropped it and
went to semesters, but UCLA

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.310
had to keep it, so.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.589
SCOTT FUJITA: And UCLA
is Berkeley's

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.120
little sister school.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.880
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
Right, well--

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.264
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:19.264 --> 00:04:20.839
SCOTT FUJITA: We steal
Berkeley's fight songs.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.783
CHRIS KLUWE: But we play
it much better.

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:24.410
SCOTT FUJITA: And I don't know
if we ever beat them or not.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.440
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: But we
beat them in football.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.386
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:28.278
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
Basketball.

00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:29.697
But we digress.

00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:31.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.020
I went to Michigan, so I think
the Big 10 is better.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.391
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:36.670
CHRIS KLUWE: Boo.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: So starting
with Chris, why don't we,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.110
just, have each of you talk a
little bit about how you got

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.380
involved in advocating for
marriage equality.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.260
CHRIS KLUWE: So essentially, I
got involved in the off season

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.230
last year when a group called
Minnesotans For Marriage

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.130
Equality contacted me on Twitter
and said, hey, would

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.740
you like to help us defeat this
constitutional amendment

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.320
in Minnesota that was going
to ban same sex marriage.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.990
And I said, yeah, that seems
like a great thing to do.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.550
I don't think anyone should
be banned from

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.590
marrying each other.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.880
And so got I involved with them,
recorded a couple of

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.940
radio ads and then did
a fundraising dinner.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.500
And then I saw the letter that
Delegate Burns had written to

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.630
the Ravens about Brendon.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.660
And it made me really upset,
because it was a First

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.420
Amendment violation from elected
US Representative.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.050
And it was also the fact
that, why do you care?

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.420
What does it matter to you if
two people who love each other

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.150
want to get married.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.990
That doesn't affect your
life in the slightest.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.960
And so I wrote a letter back,
which, then, Deadspin

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.872
published, and a lot
of people saw.

00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:36.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.940
CHRIS KLUWE: And then it kind of
broadened the platform that

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.170
I was able to speak on,
and so I said, OK.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.340
Well I have this platform.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.560
Now I have a chance to use it,
and hopefully, make people's

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.090
lives better.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.640
And from that point on, I was,
like, OK, here we go.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.520
Let's make people aware that
you have to have empathy.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.130
You have to treat people the
way you would want to be

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.140
treated in order to have a
functional society, so that's

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.590
how I got involved.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.894
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:02.894 --> 00:06:04.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: Brendon?

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.600
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
Well for me, it's

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.380
a little bit different.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.800
I think, just innately, these
two gentlemen, they understand

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.800
freedom and what this
Constitution guarantees to our

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.920
fellow citizens, but for me,
it was more of a life

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.010
experience type of thing.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.810
So my dad's Nigerian,
and my mom is Irish.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.730
So my dad's as dark
as coffee, and my

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.160
mom's as white as cream.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.480
And I came out this beautiful
caramel macchiato color.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.610
CHRIS KLUWE: Humble, too.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.490
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Yeah,
it's beautiful, I know--

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.340
a lot of mosquito bites.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.100
So there was a time prior
to my parents' meeting--

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.810
the monumental case, Loving
versus Virginia in the late

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.070
'60s, and that prevented
interracial couples, so

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.220
anti-miscegenation laws.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.840
So I had always thought, you
know, man, if my parents had

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.530
met in the '60s, I don't know
if I'd, even, be here today.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.920
And as we progress into the
future, you know, my wife,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.790
here--she's sitting in the front
row-- she's also a mixed

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.000
breed, like myself.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.410
Second row, sorry.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.000
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: And then
my beautiful children, as

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.910
well, that are here, tearing
shit up, like usual.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.800
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: They're,
also, beautiful mixed kids,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080
and eventually, everyone's
going to be mixed.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.920
But could you imagine living
in a society where-- oh no,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.570
there's no racial mixing.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.150
So let's fast forward
to today--

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.180
actually, let's go to 2009.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.590
I felt compelled to
write a letter--

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.420
and open-faced letter
to President Obama--

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.600
and I titled it "Same Sex
Marriage, What's the Big

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.600
Deal." And that got published in
the "Huffington Post," and

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.416
not as many people read
it as Chris' article.

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:40.610
CHRIS KLUWE: You've
got to swear more.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.550
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: It wasn't as
well written, but I was the

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.390
first professional athlete
to publicly

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.070
support marriage equality.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.290
But really what compelled
me to write

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.260
it was Britney Spears.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.020
And she had gone to Vegas, and
she met a young bloke, and

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.230
they hit it off for a couple
of nights, hitched it.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:03.160
And they had, instantly, more
rights than some of my friends

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.070
that had been together
for 25 years.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.020
So I wrote the article,
published it, and all of the

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.024
sudden in 2009, I became gay.

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:15.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.520
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Everyone
said I was gay.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:24.130
And I guess in 2011, I was
bisexual, and in 2013, I think

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.080
they're accepting my
heterosexuality

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.410
after a couple of kids.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.282
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

00:08:29.282 --> 00:08:30.990
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
So-- oh snap,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.570
that's a fine, I'm sorry.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.470
This is definitely a fine.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:34.820
[COUGHING]

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.440
CHRIS KLUWE: That's what
we do in meeting rooms.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.880
You've got to cover
for people who--

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.240
their phones go off.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.070
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: And so for
me, it's kind of a life

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.960
experience thing and just
knowing what it feels like to

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.860
be on the other side and knowing
what our LGBT brothers

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.720
and sisters are going
through, even though

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.900
I'm a straight ally.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.730
So I don't to the fullest
extent, but I totally equate

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.130
this to equal rights
and human rights.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.790
Everyone says why are you so a
champion for gay rights or

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:02.510
LGBT rights.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.410
No, I'm just a champion for
rights, for equal rights, so

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.166
that was the genesis.

00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:11.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.530
SCOTT FUJITA: What
they both said.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.396
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:14.770
SCOTT FUJITA: No, I
mean, I think, why

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.130
do I support equality?

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.560
I think, would common sense not
be a satisfactory answer?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.270
You know, why is common
sense not enough?

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.810
For me, I share a lot
of the same stories.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.420
My father is Japanese-American,
was

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.970
interned during World War II in
an Arizona relocation camp

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:29.170
in the desert.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.610
My mother's Caucasian, so like
these guys, I also have an

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.950
experience with interracial
marriage,

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.280
like Brendon's folks.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.180
Chris is married to someone
of a different race.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.670
So we were all impacted by
Loving versus Virginia.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.770
And I think at its root, for my
family, this is something

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.520
that impacted us.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.635
I'm also adopted.

00:09:43.635 --> 00:09:44.920
That's why I don't
look Japanese.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.170
I got the name, not the blood.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.420
I feel Japanese at
heart, though.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.760
SCOTT FUJITA: When I was living
in Louisiana, I read

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.890
about a measure that was being
proposed in Arkansas, and it

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.960
was something like "The Single
Parent Adoption Ban." And the

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.510
whole idea was to prevent
single parents

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.380
from adopting children.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.390
And this is in a place in the
South where there are

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.540
thousands of foster children
who just become

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.790
institutionalized.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.000
And this law, to me, was code
for "Gay People Can't Adopt."

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.630
And as an adopted child,
I just took a lot

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.430
of offense to that.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.290
And the message that was sending
was it's better to

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.300
have kids, again,
institutionalized in foster

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.890
care without a safe, loving,
permanent home, rather than

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.900
having, you know, one, two
parents, whatever it is, who

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.250
are willing to provide that
permanent home for them.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.980
It just made no sense to me.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.620
So coupling those two things
together-- again, being

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.770
adopted, mixed race parents,
having some friends in the

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.190
LGBT community who have been
impacted by this, as well--

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.030
it, just, became important for
me to talk about this.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.270
I think the first time I
mentioned the idea of marriage

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.440
equality was in a locker room
in an interview in 2007.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.120
The interviewer looked at me
like I was crazy, like what

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.750
the hell is he talking about,
what's marriage equality.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.670
And someone said, oh,
that's gay marriage.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.010
And I said, I don't, even, like
the idea of calling it

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.330
gay marriage, to tell
you the truth.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.730
I mean, I don't call
my marriage to my

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.230
wife straight marriage.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.880
It's just marriage,
and words matter.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.390
Language matters.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:01.520
And when I was at the GLAAD
awards down in Los Angeles in

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.690
2009, at the table I was at,
there was a young lady there.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.390
And she pulls me aside, at one
point with my wife, and shares

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.400
a story with me about her
younger brother who had come

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.860
out, at one point, as gay to
his unsuspecting, very

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.010
unsupportive father.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.920
And the father really,
just, wrote him off.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.160
And her brother ended up
taking his own life.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.910
And she said that her father was
sort of a man's man-- you

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.850
know, whatever that means, a big
football guy-- you know,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.640
really looked up to
me as a player.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.950
And when he heard me talking
about the issue of marriage

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.960
equality and gays, in general,
it started to force him to

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.650
reconsider his feelings
about it.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.540
So she challenged me.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.650
She said, it takes people like
you for people like my dad to

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.520
be able to open their
mind a little bit.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.280
So she said, please keep
talking about this.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.940
And I'm just honored to stand
up, be up here with these guys

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.130
in a growing community and to
have watched the conversation

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.640
evolve the way it has.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.720
Just since 2007, when I first
uttered "marriage equality,"

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.200
no one knew what that meant.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.850
And now it's, finally,
on people's radar.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:59.890
People are talking about it.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:01.380
The conversation has evolved.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.400
And it's to the point now,
where, hopefully, we have a

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.370
landmark hearing, here, in a
little bit, and the decision

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.460
comes through that grants
equality for everybody.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.480
That's what we're
all here for.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.374
That's what we're all
fighting for.

00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:16.278
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:16.278 --> 00:12:18.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: I have another
question for all of you.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.230
Why don't we start with
Brendon, this time.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.870
What's been your experience with
homophobia in the NFL?

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.160
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: It's been
evolving, and that's a

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:28.870
beautiful thing.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.550
So early on--

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.050
I'd say silence is consent--

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.430
and so when you hear these
words, these slurs being

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:39.980
thrown around, I would, always,
say, hey, you know you

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.430
can't say that.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.750
You don't need to
say "no homo."

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.970
You don't need to say
the f word, or

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.220
replace dumb with gay.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.950
So after years and years of
ingraining this into guys'

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.460
heads, I went from 20 times a
day, and then after a couple

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.570
of years, you know, it
was 19.5 times a day.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.080
So I was keeping metrics.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: We like
that in people.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.790
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
Yeah, it wasn't

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.400
working, but it was working.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.000
It's come full circle to, you
know, not really knowing of

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.400
any allies, not really knowing
that, publicly, that he

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.490
supported LGBT rights to, you
know, Kluwe stepping up, to

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.680
other players stepping up.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.590
And now we have this
t-shirt, now.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:29.330
And so this t-shirt, here, the
NFLPA endorsed this shirt.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.290
So DeMaurice Smith, our
Executive Director, he

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.350
supports LGBT rights,
and so does our

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.690
President, Domonique Foxworth.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.890
So I approached them with an
idea, one day, that we need to

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.110
come up with some type of
endorsement for LGBT rights.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.880
And it was something as simple
as a t-shirt, and the proceeds

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.700
will go towards LGBT
advocacy groups.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.100
And that's how far we've come--
from people calling me

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.810
the three-letter f word to,
now, everybody starting to

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.020
build this critical mass.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.460
And they're starting to see
that everybody deserves

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.300
equality, but I think the most
important thing is we are

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.670
having the conversation.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.680
And even if guys don't support
it, we're having the

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.630
conversation.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.550
And guys are learning things
and they're hearing things

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.890
that they never heard before--
from people being born gay--

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:16.750
they've never heard that
before-- to being

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.980
gay is not a sin.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.310
And you know, you've been taught
this, basically, since

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.950
the day you came out via
religion and other things in

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.580
ignorance, that being gay is
perfectly normal, and God

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.740
created you that way.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.730
We're having the conversation,
and that's where we've come.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.240
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah, I'm so glad
Brendon mentioned the

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:32.765
idea for these t-shirts.

00:14:32.765 --> 00:14:34.310
I mean, it's a great
idea by him.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:36.150
I sit on the executive committee
as a Vice President

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.200
for our players' union.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.400
I've been on the board,
now, for four years.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.580
You know, as me, I'm always
viewed as the, sort of,

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.850
gay-loving, tree-hugging
socialist from Berkeley.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.560
SCOTT FUJITA: I like the idea
of the union getting behind

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.490
more social progressive issues,
but I was, also,

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.560
elected to be in this position
where you have to take

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.120
everybody's feelings
into consideration.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.030
And advancing ideas like that--
you know, good for the

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.080
broader membership--

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.890
so to have someone like Brendon,
who is a new player

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.590
rep, come in with this great
idea and have our leadership

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.670
embrace it like that,
it's huge.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.140
It's huge.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.300
And again, it's not so much
about a political issue.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.410
And that's one of the things
that we, always, struggle

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.950
with, trying to convey to, not
just our members in the

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:14.680
players' union, but,
really, everybody.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.770
It's not a political issue.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.150
This is a people issue.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.060
It's a people issue
about people.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.620
And that's the struggle.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.330
It's changing the conversation
so that people

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.530
understand it that way.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.150
And I'm glad we're getting to
the point where we can have

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.486
the conversation.

00:15:27.486 --> 00:15:29.770
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah, and it's,
also, from what I've seen, the

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.470
younger players coming into the
NFL are raised more in an

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.680
environment of tolerance and
respect, and that's just the

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.020
world that they're
growing up in.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.120
And you can, really, see that
in their attitudes, because

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.000
they look at this issue, and
they're like, well, who cares?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.260
Why does anyone care
who you marry?

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.350
And you know, it's not all of
them, because just like

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.010
society, it's not everyone.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.720
But the tide is shifting, and
you're starting to see that

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.080
more and more in the views of
the younger generation.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.760
And that's something that we
just have to keep working at

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.350
it and realize that this is
a generational issue.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.910
It's like suffrage.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.470
It's like segregation.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.510
It's like slavery.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.760
It's something that time
is going to change.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.760
And we have to keep working at
it to keep changing it, but

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.310
it's also going to
take a while.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.400
There are no easy fixes.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.640
And I've said it before, you,
basically, have to wait for

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.860
the old people to
die off, and--

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.560
CHRIS KLUWE: You let the young
people take their place.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.320
That's really what fixes it.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.000
So it's good to see that
happening in the NFL, that you

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.790
see those young people keep
cycling through--

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:30.790
not the dying off part.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.011
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:33.200
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Can I
make a point real quick?

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.900
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please do.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.040
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: One thing
that we do see-- and I can't

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.660
blame the guys themselves,
because the biggest role model

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.070
that we do have is
the government.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.070
And if the government continues
to discriminate, and

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:48.570
if you can still be fired in
38 states for being a part

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.670
LGBT community, if you can still
be evicted from your

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.640
home for being a part of LGBT
community, then you shouldn't

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:59.980
be so shocked when you find
people in our society that are

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.920
bigots and that are saying some
of the things that they

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.300
say and that discriminate.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.079
So it's from the top down
from the bottom up.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.609
The people have to change,
and the government has

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.329
to change with it.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.109
CHRIS KLUWE: And those are the
things that we can work on.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.410
That's what we can change.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.410
I mean, that's the part where we
set the structure in place

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.900
that people know that, hey,
this is where society is

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.040
heading, and my behavior--

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.260
where I'm not tolerating
other people--

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.520
that's not accepted anymore.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.089
That's not proper behavior

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:28.460
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah, I think
Brendon says it best.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.390
It's about rights.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.590
If people can't wrap their heads
around the idea of gay

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.310
rights or calling it
gay rights, just

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.930
call it rights, then.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.535
It's that simple.

00:17:36.535 --> 00:17:39.080
And I think in this country,
it does come down to the

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.650
government.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.270
We discriminate against people
for all kinds of reasons.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.800
But with an issue like this,
you need an evidence-based

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.560
rationale to be able
to discriminate.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.660
I haven't heard one yet.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.820
And we're still discriminating
against

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.110
members of the LGBT community.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.630
It's so hard to say.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.940
It's a mouthful.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:52.917
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Can we come
up with a new acronym?

00:17:52.917 --> 00:17:54.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.970
SCOTT FUJITA: You know, we
discriminate against people

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.320
who are 16 years old.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.080
You have to be 16 to get your
driver's license, because

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.730
evidence suggests that people
under 16 are going to be

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.000
irresponsible and get
into an accident.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.120
We discriminate against people
under 21 and say they can't

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.020
drink, because evidence
suggests they'll be

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.950
irresponsible and get into
some kind of trouble.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:09.850
We discriminate against--

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:10.930
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: They
can go to war, though.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:11.290
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah, right.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.020
They can go to war.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:14.220
We discriminate others who get
to a certain age and say they

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.510
can no longer drive, because
evidence suggests that they'll

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.800
be a hazard on the road.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.680
So again, there is no evidence
to suggest that this will be

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.470
dangerous or harmful
to society.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.850
It's just about rights, as
Brendon always says.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:27.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: Chris, I have a
follow-up question for you,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.900
if you're comfortable
answering it.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.120
CHRIS KLUWE: Sure.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: One of your
former teammates, Adrian

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.210
Peterson, recently came out--

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.240
"came out" is probably the
wrong way of putting it--

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:36.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: --on
the radio--

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:37.640
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Yeah,
that's wrong.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.900
FEMALE SPEAKER: He made a
statement, something to the

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.570
effect of, "I'm not with gay
marriage." And then he

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.500
clarified it, later, by saying
he was OK if other people were

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.240
in favor, but he wasn't.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.640
Have you talked to him
about that at all?

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.640
CHRIS KLUWE: I haven't
talked to Adrian,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.670
recently, about that.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.300
We were good friends
in the locker room.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.870
And for me, the fact that Adrian
is willing to let other

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.110
people have their rights-- while
that's not the ideal

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.860
situation, it's, really, the
best we can hope for from a

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.820
lot of people is the fact that
as long as you're not

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.890
discriminating against people,
you don't have to actually

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:11.410
embrace it.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.090
You know, we would like to get
the point where everyone is

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.110
embracing the idea that you
treat other people the way

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.180
you'd like to be treated.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.450
But while we're working towards
that, avoiding active

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.790
discrimination is one of the
steps to that process.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.570
And so with Adrian, he may not,
personally, agree with

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:27.240
same sex marriage.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.960
He may not, personally, agree
for gay rights, but he's not,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.490
actively, going out his way
to rally against it.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.610
And that's something
that I would

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.100
like to see him embrace--

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.050
gay rights-- because it's
human rights, something

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:42.710
everyone should have,

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.870
But at the end of the day, I'm
not going to crucify him for

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.160
being who he is, being raised
in the environment that

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.280
he was raised in.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.390
And you know, even saying what
he said, that can be tough to

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.320
do if you raised in a very
religious environment.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.260
So I'm not upset at Adrian.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.830
I would wish he would he could
do more, but at the same time,

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:05.700
he's not actively trying to
conspire against LGBT rights.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.016
CHRIS KLUWE: If that makes
sense to anyone.

00:20:08.016 --> 00:20:09.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Brendon, can you
tell us a little bit about

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.490
Athlete Ally?

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.750
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Yes, so
Athlete Ally is a group that

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.620
tries to foster inclusion
of the LGBT

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.050
community into sports.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.520
So we go around, and we speak
at different schools.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.400
And we just talk about
LGBT sensitivity.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.396
The last thing we want is--

00:20:28.396 --> 00:20:30.520
you know, imagine Greg Louganis,
if he didn't

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.850
continue to be the greatest
American diver in history--

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.570
and he's one of my role models
and one of my heroes.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.700
But imagine if he got bullied
out of diving, because there

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.510
were some straight kids, and
they made fun of him, because

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.350
he was a part of the
LGBT community.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.840
So we want to foster kids.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.060
And we want to encourage them
to continue to play sports,

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.200
especially with all the problems
we have with heart

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.950
disease and diabetes and people
being so sedentary.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.580
The last thing we want to see is
our children being bullied

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.120
out of sports.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.780
And so I think once you see
somebody like Jason Collins--

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.620
on that level, 7 foot tall
black dude that's gay--

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.730
it destroys a lot of people's
perception of what

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.840
they think gay is.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.220
And now, oh my god, there's
an athlete in the

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.120
NBA, and he's gay.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.860
And there's Chris Kluwe and
Scott Fujita, and they're

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.270
straight guys, and they believe
in me, and they

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.080
support me.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.980
So we think we can do so much
in helping young people,

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.720
curbing suicide rates, letting
kids stand a little bit taller

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.100
that are part of the
LGBT community--

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:24.988
gosh darn, it is hard.

00:21:24.988 --> 00:21:27.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.360
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: And we'll
curb suicide rates.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.560
And kids, ultimately, they'll
get better educations.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.420
They'll feel better about
themselves, and they'll go on

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.630
to be successful Americans, just
by the littlest thing, a

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.550
little bit of support
and love.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.780
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah,
it's about kids.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.870
It lets them say,
I am not alone.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.830
And like Brendon said,
it will save lives.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:44.810
There's no doubt in my mind.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.200
Like the young lady who I met
down in the GLAAD awards, it

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:47.920
will save lives.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.540
There's no doubt in my
mind about that.

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: So you mentioned
Jason Collins.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.340
I thought it was interesting.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.240
In your brief to the US Supreme
Court, you have the

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.710
quote here, "no active athlete
in any of the major male

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.200
sports has come out, as
professional athletes,

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.760
themselves, feel the impact of
homophobia." And then shortly

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.270
after that, Jason Collins did,
in "Sports Illustrated." And I

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.200
was wondering how you guys
felt about that.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.103
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Yeah,
Robbie Rogers, as well.

00:22:14.103 --> 00:22:14.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.410
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: I, just,
think it's so amazing.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:24.820
And also there's something that,
really, is crazy is that

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.850
Brittney Griner, also, came out,
right and as a backstory,

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.460
she was a first round draft
pick in the WNBA.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.210
She went to Baylor University,
and just, kind of impromptly

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.320
said, oh you know, I'm a
lesbian, or whatever.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.930
And backstory, you don't
hear about it.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.780
That's where we're trying to
get with the male athletes.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.110
We want it to be a backstory.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.940
We don't want it to be first
page of "Sports Illustrated,"

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.070
everybody's looking at it.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.100
It's the biggest talk, and
it's a whole big deal.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.710
Obama, Oprah--

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.295
I mean that's great, we
want the support.

00:22:49.295 --> 00:22:52.320
But at the same time, we just
want people to be who they are

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.740
and to live their lives
and to be happy.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.160
So Jason's going to do so much
for people, and he's going to

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.270
continue to work.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.140
And it'll be, really, great to
see him, actually, play in a

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.580
game next year.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.320
I don't know if happens.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.880
And hopefully, if he does play
in a game, it'll be for the

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.550
right reasons, because a
basketball team needs him, not

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.420
because a basketball team
is trying to have a gay

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.530
athlete on a team.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:14.090
So I think it's amazing.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:17.700
And it, just, shows how far
we've come in such a short

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.600
amount of time, and it really
makes me feel bad for people

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.650
like Martina Navratilova or
Billy Bean or Esera Tuaolo.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.410
These are all athletes that came
out in the '80s and '90s.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.080
And now today, this
is being embraced.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.760
And they lost endorsements.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.970
They couldn't play in
tournaments, and they tried to

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.970
cover up stories and scandals.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.470
And you know, it used
to be a sin.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.110
They were considered sodomites
and all these crazy things.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:45.360
And now today, we get to have
someone that's touted as a

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.020
hero, in large part,
because of the

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.660
people that came before.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.620
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah, while
it's great to have this

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.470
conversation, I think it'll be
even greater when we get to

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.800
the point where this
conversation

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.040
doesn't need to be had.

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.340
I mean you know, how great
of a deal would that be.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.930
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah, and really,
it comes down we're athletes.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:01.620
We're playing a sport.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.280
It shouldn't matter what your
sexuality is, because we're

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.170
out there to do our jobs to the
best of our abilities, and

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.570
sexuality plays no part in that,
except if you're forced

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.700
to cover it up, and you can't
play to the best your

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.580
abilities, because you're
worried about being revealed.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.690
So that's why what Jason
is doing is so great.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.420
He's, like, look, I'm not going
to have to deal with

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.500
this anymore.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.800
Now I'm just going to focus
solely on playing basketball.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.370
And that's awesome, because
that's what everyone should be

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.030
able to do.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: Did any of
you guys have negative

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.520
repercussions from your teams
for being outspoken in favor

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.770
of equality?

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:34.440
SCOTT FUJITA: Talk
to this one.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.194
FEMALE SPEAKER: I though Chris
might want to answer this.

00:24:36.194 --> 00:24:37.628
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
Stop the presses.

00:24:37.628 --> 00:24:38.106
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:38.106 --> 00:24:40.020
CHRIS KLUWE: Oh boy.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.882
I'm happy to be with
Oakland right now.

00:24:41.882 --> 00:24:47.190
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.450
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah, well
I mean, it is

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:49.120
one of those things.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.170
It's unfortunate, in the NFL,
that coaches and management

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.800
view any sort of speaking out
or attention as distraction.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.490
And I don't think that
that's the case.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.820
I think that you can be a
professional athlete, you can

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.500
play at a very high level, and
you can also raise awareness

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.650
for very important issues that
affect a large amount of

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.180
people in this country.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.530
You know, you hear about all
these guys who have either

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.420
their charities or they have
their events or they're doing

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.000
fundraising for the NFL or
awareness for the NFL.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.450
Well those are exactly
the same things.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.800
You're having guys do things
away from football.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.850
What is it about talking
about same sex

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.210
marriage or LGBT rights?

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.430
What does that, all of the
sudden, make a difference that

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:29.870
you can't play football
anymore?

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.490
So I think that's an idea that
we need to move away from-- is

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.280
that athletes, as role models,
have to be, only, about

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.710
sports, because athletes are
so much more than that.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.700
I mean look at the three
of us, up here.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.340
We're not just football
players.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.880
We have so many other
interests.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.840
And it, really, does a
disservice to people if you

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.700
slap a label on them and say
that's all you can be, whether

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.360
it be you're just a football
player, or you're just gay.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.540
It goes for anything
in society.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:56.920
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah, we're people
first, football players

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.900
a very distant second.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.920
And he said it perfectly.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.630
You know, I don't want to say
that speaking out now is

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.270
frowned upon so much like
it was, even three

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.020
or four years ago.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.780
I mean, the conversation,
again, is evolving.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.780
You've got young people coming
up, like Chris just mentioned,

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.820
too, who are just more open,
more tolerant, more accepting.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.690
And you know, the coaches have
got to accept that, because

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:15.560
you know, by and large, we
dictate the coaches' jobs,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.420
too, so they've got
to get on board.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.950
Our successes and failures
dictate their livelihood, so.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.520
CHRIS KLUWE: And that's the
thing that drives me crazy is

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.740
the fact that if you think a
player being gay is going to

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.570
be a distraction--

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.890
well yeah, there will be
some media attention

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:28.430
for a week or two.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.620
But think how much better that
player would play if he didn't

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.690
have to focus on hiding his
entire life from everyone

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:34.480
around him.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.765
You think that's not
a distraction?

00:26:35.765 --> 00:26:38.160
Are you kidding me?

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.800
That's the biggest distraction
you could possibly have.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.190
SCOTT FUJITA: We need to get
past the point where something

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.000
like that would be viewed as
a negative distraction.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.330
I mean, if you can't deal with
distractions in this business,

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:47.540
you don't belong in
this business.

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.736
I mean, you've got guys-- all
kinds of crazy issues, you

00:26:49.736 --> 00:26:53.180
know, in-house fighting and a
potential coaching change in

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.430
the middle of the season--

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:55.490
those are distractions.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.710
Someone being himself is not
a negative distraction.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.680
CHRIS KLUWE: Not at all.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.630
FEMALE SPEAKER: Scott,
why don't I start

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:02.400
with you on this one.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.680
Do you think that the
professional sports leagues

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.860
have gotten better about
disciplining players when they

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.415
do make anti-gay slurs?

00:27:10.415 --> 00:27:12.090
SCOTT FUJITA: Um yeah,
it's complicated.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.400
In the NFL, I don't know
if we have disciplined

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.836
anybody yet for that.

00:27:14.836 --> 00:27:16.600
And I'm sort of torn and on
the fence about that.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.440
I mean, when a player speaks
his mind, do I think they

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.820
should be fined a whole bunch
of money for that?

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.360
I mean, they are exercising
their right to free speech.

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.050
I don't like it.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.530
I have no problem pulling guys
aside to talk about it.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.860
But if nothing else, the good
that comes from that is that

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.480
it starts another
conversation.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.240
And the media jumps on guys,
right now, immediately right

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.430
after they say something.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.880
And I never like
to be that guy.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.050
I prefer a more diplomatic,
behind the scenes, approach.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.240
I pull teammates aside,
talked about it.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.170
I let them know why using the
word like faggot in the locker

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.690
room might be offensive
to so many people.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.880
You never know if the guy
in the locker next to

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.660
you might be gay.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.930
And he might equate that
as you saying, I

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.330
hate gay people, which--

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.580
I know you as a teammate,
I know you as a person--

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.470
you are not that way.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.550
You do not hate gay people.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.685
But again, it's just flipping
the conversation.

00:27:56.685 --> 00:27:58.820
And that could happen so fast.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.510
And a lot of people come from
a climate or a family

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.360
atmosphere or all their boys
back home, who, that's such a

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.990
common part of their
vernacular.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:07.380
And they never thought
about it that way.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:07.665
You know what?

00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:08.210
That's right.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.810
Maybe they do think that I hate
the people when I say

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:11.430
that, and I don't.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.590
Maybe I should stop
saying that.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.190
So it's, just, flipping
the conversation.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.360
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah, and I think
it's also about, not so much

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.540
punishment, it's about
awareness.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.500
It's about making guys aware of,
I've said something that

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.550
can affect a whole group of
people, and I should realize

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.470
why what I said is wrong.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.250
And you know, like, when Chris
Culliver made his statements

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.080
before the Super Bowl.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.580
That's something that you don't
want to jump down his

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.610
throat and immediately
just discard him.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:39.170
You want to help him realize why
what he said makes so many

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:40.780
people's lives so much worse.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.470
And I think that's, really, the
key, like what Scott said,

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.250
is educating these guys and
just making them aware of

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.170
other people's lives.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.660
And you see that a lot in our
Congress, in Republican

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.680
policymakers that, all of the
sudden, they have a family

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.210
member that comes out as gay,
and their voting switches

00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:59.446
dramatically.

00:28:59.446 --> 00:29:01.790
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: He
was 25 years old.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:02.800
He was born that way, but--

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.610
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah right, so as
you see stuff like that.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.380
A lot of times it takes that
personal connection, and a lot

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.250
of that is education.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.250
It's realizing the fact that
there are other people out in

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.315
the world and learning
about that.

00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:16.120
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: I think
it is an education.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:20.540
You bring a concept to somebody
that people are born

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.900
gay, and they, just--

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.400
oh my god, show me the proof,
show me the evidence, no way,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.066
the Bible says--

00:29:27.066 --> 00:29:28.210
I'm, like, damn.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:31.420
It's like, I don't see Muslims
and Jews trying to ban bacon

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.700
double cheeseburgers, but you
zealots are trying to ban

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:35.450
freakin' gay marriage,
you know.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:40.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.140
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: So
it is an education.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.590
And as much as I'm against
religion, I also believe it's

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:46.700
your right to have religion.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.430
I'm always going to fight for
your right to have religion.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.220
Just like you're trying to ban
gay marriage, I'm not going to

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:51.910
try to ban religion.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:52.550
That's you're right.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.570
That's your freedom.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:55.110
It's what this country
was built on.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.670
So the beautiful thing about
it is that when guys make

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.630
stupid-ass comments, and they
say these homophobic slurs,

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:04.870
they become our freakin'
best allies.

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.160
The story goes worldwide, just
like Emmett Burns tried to

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.225
blow me up, my boy Chris Kluwe
put his ass on the spot.

00:30:11.225 --> 00:30:12.326
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:12.326 --> 00:30:14.250
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: And all
of the sudden, I'm getting

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.200
letters from Japan, Brazil, all
these different places,

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.980
and I'm sure Chris did, too.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.800
And it just brought so much
attention to the cause.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.900
And in large part, that's why
we're here, because some

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.880
freakin' jerk that people put
into a position of power to

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.860
help people was trying to take
people's rights away.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.970
So they become our biggest
allies, even though Emmett

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.490
Burns-- we don't have time to
teach old dogs new tricks,

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.970
maybe we'll just wait
for him to die.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.970
But guys like, for example,
Kobe Bryant-- it was so

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.370
amazing, a couple of years ago,
he dropped the "f" bomb

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.950
on national TV, was talking
to a ref, right?

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:52.480
And he was fined, and then
he did some stuff

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.840
with the LGBT community.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.520
And then a couple months ago,
someone on his Twitter feed

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.520
dropped the "f" bomb on his
feed, and he tweets the guy,

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.530
hey man, you can't say that.

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:03.250
It's wrong, and this
is why it's wrong.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.110
And then that tweet goes
worldwide-- oh, Kobe's come

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.630
full circle.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.760
I thought it was so beautiful.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.700
And even Chris Culliver, he
went and worked with the

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.830
Trevor Project, and it was
really crazy, because all that

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:18.425
stuff happened during the Super
Bowl, And I didn't know

00:31:18.425 --> 00:31:19.000
who he was.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.790
I looked him up on Twitter,
and he was following me.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.970
So nobody knows this, I
dropped him a message.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.610
And he never heard back
from me, but I

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:27.610
know he got the message.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.140
And I said--

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.490
it's kind of sick that I love
when the guy makes the

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.230
mistake, because the first thing
I do is I go to reach

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.670
out to them--

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:35.620
I'm an Athlete Ally.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.430
You know, and I'm, also,
a football player.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.920
And I love my athletes, and I
mean, we're all so different.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.740
Athletes are different.

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:44.970
There's so many special
and amazing guys.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.200
Even Adrian Peterson is a
special and amazing guy.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.790
And how do we make
him an ally?

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.175
So the first thing
I do is I go and

00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:51.090
I'll send him a message.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.230
I sent Culliver a message.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.990
I'm like, my man, you have a
chance to make this right, and

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.020
I have your back.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.130
So then he went, and he did
the Trevor Project.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.270
And I didn't know what the
Trevor Project was, so I'm

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.120
like, damn, he's going and
doing the Trevor Project.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.600
I've got to go do the
damn Trevor Project.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.980
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: I can't
let a guy that was a past

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.490
homophobe-- frickin', I'm an
ally, I've got work to do.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:14.100
So I called Abbe Land from
the Trevor Project, and

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.320
now she's my boy.

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.090
You know, we be texting it up.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:19.120
She's also the Mayor
of West Hollywood.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.130
And so we chop it up.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.570
We're cool, and that's all
because of Chris Culliver.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.080
And we're all here because
of Mr. Burns.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:25.650
So thank you.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:29.990
SCOTT FUJITA: Thank you
for your bigotry.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.970
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: You're
changing the world

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:31.710
more than we are.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.770
It's freakin' amazing.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: I wanted to ask
you guys about a few other

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.190
topics, and then I'll
open it up to

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:39.300
questions from the audience.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.160
Scott, I know you're working
on a bunch of other causes.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.030
So I was hoping you could talk
to us about some of those and

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.490
maybe let people, here, know
how Google might be able to

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:49.830
help with those.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.250
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah, I'm
kind of a busybody.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.320
I just retired, like
Stacy said earlier,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.260
a few months ago.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.930
And my plan was to, sort of,
just decompress and catch my

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.450
breath and enjoy the kids.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:00.915
But I don't sit still
very well, at all.

00:33:00.915 --> 00:33:04.460
I'm an up-late-at-night kind of
guy, always ideas circling

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.420
in my head, a million
things I like to do.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.720
But yeah, I have a lot of
causes that I'm very

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.050
passionate about, one of
which you mentioned,

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:11.390
breast cancer awareness.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:13.230
My mother's a two-time breast
cancer survivor, so that's

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:14.970
always been close
to home for me.

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:15.990
Adoption is another one.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.130
Gulf Coast restoration, given
that I got to New Orleans not

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.970
long after Katrina.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.870
I was, actually, the first
free agent to go to New

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:22.830
Orleans after Katrina.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.180
People thought I was nuts.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.576
Oakland was the other
option, though.

00:33:26.576 --> 00:33:28.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.460
SCOTT FUJITA: That would have
been more nuts, at the time.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.885
But one of the groups I work
with right now is a group

00:33:33.885 --> 00:33:35.650
called Team Gleason.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.450
My former teammate in
New Orleans, who

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.820
these guys know well--

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.730
he's just, kind of, really
an iconic figure in New

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.980
Orleans, right now.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.570
Big time special teams player
down for the Saints for about

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:48.280
seven or eight years, blocked
what I call the punt heard

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.100
around the world.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.970
And the Superdome is reopening,
Monday night

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.580
Football, the first
game back in--

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:53.460
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
--a war zone.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.480
SCOTT FUJITA: --after Katrina
against the Falcons.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.300
Steve was diagnosed with ALS,
Lou Gehrig's diseased in

00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.970
January of 2011.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:00.790
And Steve and I are--

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.040
I'm one of his closest
friends.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.230
And he reached out to me not
long after he got the

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.380
diagnosis, right here
in San Francisco.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.985
And it was just devastating.

00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:12.190
He had been having some
symptoms for a while.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.670
We knew that was a possibility,
but here is, 33

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:17.380
years old, we never imagined,
in your wildest dreams,

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.469
someone his age would be
afflicted with a horrific

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:21.650
disease like that.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.540
And I lost my uncle to ALS about
17 years ago, so I knew

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.960
firsthand how difficult this
would be for he and his wife.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.820
So Steve started a group
called Team Gleason.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.790
And our foundation--

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:31.870
I'm on the Board
of Directors--

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.550
we do these crazy, wacky
adventures all the time,

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.389
because that's the kind
of guy Steve is.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:38.889
Kind of the premise and the
mission of the foundation is

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:40.670
to push the envelope
on technologies.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.909
And that's why I'm so happy to
be here on Google's campus

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:46.540
today, because people like
Steve, they need help.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.449
The way he communicates now is
with his eyes through software

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.860
on his wheelchair.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.929
He has a tablet device in front
of him with a bar over

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.070
the top that has these
infrared cameras,

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.820
which scan his eyes.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.815
His eyes lock onto a keyboard
on his screen.

00:35:00.815 --> 00:35:03.630
If they lock onto a letter for
2/10 of a second, that

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.530
registers a letter.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.550
And he could click Speak at the
end typing a word with his

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:09.190
eyes, and then it
comes through a

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.630
program called CereProc.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.540
It's a synthetic voice that
he generated while

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.640
he could still speak.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.720
So it's kind of a new age
version of my good friend

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.630
Steve Gleason's voice.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.730
It still sounds like him, but
the problem is that he can

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:21.960
only type about 10 or
15 words a minute.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.870
And people don't have the
patience for that.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.260
And that's where patients like
Steve are struggling, because

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.230
they're so marginalized.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.970
No one can hear what
they have to say.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.790
No one has the patience to sit
around and wait for him to

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:31.930
complete a sentence.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.260
So you come to a place like
Google, and I think, here are

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.070
some of the brightest tech
minds in the world.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:38.640
There's got to be a way we can
improve technology like that.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.130
And I recognize that, again,
it's a marginalized group.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.190
There's only 30,000 people
really afflicted by this.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.080
But there's got to be ways to
make something like that

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.570
appeal to the mass market.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:49.970
This is a guy who only
has use of his eyes.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:51.720
He can control everything
with his eyes if the

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.390
technology is there.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.490
And there's got to be a way to
make that appeal to the mass

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:58.420
market and get it on the radar
of a place like Google.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:58.910
Why not?

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:01.610
So if there's anybody in here
who's listening or works with

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.130
Google Glass or anything
like that--

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.280
I know there's got
to be a way.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.170
I'd love to talk, afterwards,
with you guys, because there's

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.520
got to be a way to help people
like my friend, Steve, who is,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.750
just, amazing.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.570
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: And just
to interject, we have a

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:16.480
gentleman by the name of O.J.
Brigance, also in the Ravens

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.840
organization, that's suffering
from ALS, as well.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.605
And Stephen Hawking is suffering
from ALS, and you

00:36:21.605 --> 00:36:24.450
see how Stephen operates, and
you see him on TV and stuff.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.090
So you can get a visual
of what our

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.770
brothers are going through.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.640
The rates of ALS are higher in
football players and soccer

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:35.150
players, and so they are kind
of making a correlation

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.610
between repeated blows
to the head.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:38.470
You know, the soccer players are
heading the soccer balls

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:40.190
and whatnot.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:44.150
It's something that actually
I worry about.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.680
For some reason, I just
think, like man, this

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.730
could happen to me.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.910
So it'd definitely be amazing
if some of you geniuses in

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.380
here could figure
out something.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.360
I mean, I'm kind of bummed
out that I have a wire on

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.560
my lav right now.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.890
Like, I was thinking it would
be a wire-free lav.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:36:59.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:00.330
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Anybody?

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:00.615
No.

00:37:00.615 --> 00:37:02.280
CHRIS KLUWE: A holographic
prompt?

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.390
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: Same old
lav from high school, here?

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:07.650
But it's a serious cause, and it
would be so amazing if you

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.380
guys could help in this
arena in this space.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
we have a video--

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.370
do think we have time
for it, Jimmy?

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.580
SCOTT FUJITA: I can queue
it up you're--

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:16.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:16.970
SCOTT FUJITA: --getting ready.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:19.340
So Steve, he came up to the
Cleveland this past season

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.260
when I was in season, and he had
what's called a diaphragm

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.070
pacemaker implanted that helps
his diaphragm function.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.900
That's one of the things-- is
upper respiratory failure with

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.020
this disease.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.540
He's in recovery after
the procedure.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.390
He can't talk anymore.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.010
He could just kind of
mumble a little bit.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:33.540
He's in recovery, and
he pulls me aside.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.885
He nods me over, and he
whispers in my ear.

00:37:35.885 --> 00:37:37.650
He sort of mumbles and he says,
hey what are you doing

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:38.270
this April.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.870
I said, I've got nothing
planned.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.480
He said I want to go
to Machu Picchu.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.640
And I said, as in Peru.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.500
And he says, yeah, I want to
take me to Machu Picchu.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.320
So I said, I have no idea how
in the hell we're going to

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.630
pull that off, but that's just
the kind of guy he is.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.730
We do these crazy expeditions,
and we always bring another

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:52.340
ALS patient with us.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:52.980
So we did it.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.760
We carried two grown men with
ALS to Machu Picchu.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.130
So GoPro sponsored us, and I had
a GoPro camera strapped to

00:37:59.130 --> 00:37:59.980
my chest the whole time.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.210
And this is, kind of, a teaser
reel that Team Gleason put

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.010
together in a full length
feature that will air

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.360
on ESPN this Fall.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.540
So it's about creating
awareness, getting this on

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.250
people's radar, and again,
trying to push the envelope on

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.058
the technologies to make these
people's lives easier.

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:14.557
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:14.557 --> 00:40:07.830
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.327
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:09.327 --> 00:40:16.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:17.710
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah, thank you.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:18.690
It was an epic trip.

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.160
And the way Steve communicated
with me on most of that trip

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.130
was with his eyelids.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:24.050
You know, I leaned him
back, you OK, buddy,

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:25.310
you need some water.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.690
It was with his eyelids-- yes,
no, and that's about it.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.210
So we've got to fix that.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:30.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: Chris,
question for you.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:30.850
CHRIS KLUWE: Mhm.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:31.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can you tell
us about your book that's

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:32.540
coming out?

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.690
Is it this month?

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:35.600
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah, this
month, June 25th.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:41.450
And it kind of builds off this
idea that the struggle for gay

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.500
rights is also a smaller
part of the

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.430
struggle for human rights.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:48.510
And that's something that
societies as a whole have not

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:51.300
found a way to fix throughout
our entire history.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.450
I mean, if you look at every
single civilization throughout

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.120
the span of human history,
they have all failed.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.045
And it's all been due to
a lack of empathy.

00:40:57.045 --> 00:40:59.350
It's been due to a lack of being
able to put yourself in

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.490
someone else's shoes and
realizing that if this course

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:05.450
of action harms someone else,
then it's going to be

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:08.280
detrimental in the long run,
whether you create conflicts

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.890
from within, from oppressing
your own people, or if you

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.990
create conflicts from without,
by trying to take something

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.730
from someone else.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:16.590
And so that's one of the main
ideas in this book is that, as

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:19.120
a civilization, if we want to
stand the test of time, if we

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.740
want to last in geological
terms, we have to figure out

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:27.110
how to preach and teach empathy
to all the members of

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:27.760
our society.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.910
And even if we can't get
everyone, we can

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:30.700
treat it like a vaccine.

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.555
If we get 90% of the people in
our society to have empathy,

00:41:33.555 --> 00:41:35.210
it acts as herd immunity.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:37.360
And then the people who don't
have empathy, you can limit

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.960
the damage that they do.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.570
And so it's this broader look
of what does it mean to be

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.410
successful civilization,
and are we going to

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.410
be able to do that.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:49.130
And then there's also a lot of
random stuff, like funny

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.650
writings, short stories, my
letter to Emmett Burns.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:53.960
There are various
other things.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.620
And it's really, I like to
describe it as a look inside

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.070
my mind, so buyer beware.

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:00.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.880
CHRIS KLUWE: One of the
underlying foundations is this

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.700
idea that we have to treat
people the right way, and it's

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.030
not a hard concept.

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:08.400
It's A very easy philosophical
concept.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.430
It's treat others the way you
would like to be treated.

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.270
I mean, we all learned
it in kindergarten.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.500
It's really simple, so yeah.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: Questions
from the audience?

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.220
Susie?

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.800
Are there efforts to teach the
coaches, so when they're

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.650
coaching young kids, they can
start learning about equality?

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:28.300
CHRIS KLUWE: It's funny you
mention that, because I have

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.550
actually been contacted by
guy called Coach Randy.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:34.540
And he's in the process of
writing a book on how to be a

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.550
better coach.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:39.480
I guess he's spoken in New
York, and he's one of the

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.650
assistant athletic people, I
think, for the softball team

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:43.200
at Rutgers.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.480
So he is well familiar with
the whole bullying thing.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:51.660
And his goal is to write a book
that people can use as a

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:55.390
resource for coaches, in that
there is a right way to coach,

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:59.350
and you don't have denigrate the
kids under your power in

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:00.170
order to coach well.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:03.460
Because that, ultimately,
doesn't teach anyone anything

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.490
useful in life.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.430
It teaches you to scream at
people, that's about it.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:07.820
So he's working on that.

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.440
He's been asking my advice on
kind of, OK, how do I go about

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.050
approaching this
and what to do.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.870
And hopefully, he'll be able
to kind of parlay that into

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.220
something that people pay
attention to and listen to,

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.540
because coaches are a very
important role model,

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.560
especially for young kids.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.700
You know, a lot of your
behavior you pick

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.050
up from your coach.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.460
I think he's doing a great
thing, and I fully plan on

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.540
supporting him in getting that
message out, that bullying is

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.500
not acceptable, whether
it's player to

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:32.830
player or coach to player.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.530
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: For me, I
like to talk to the parents

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.320
and educate the parents.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.800
Before you have your child on
a team, you should talk to

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:40.220
that coach.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:44.830
You should feel out that coach
and let him know that you're

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:48.060
not going to put up with any
type of discrimination on any

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.190
sports teams that your
children play on.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:55.510
And that also opens up the
conversation to their children

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:58.370
and having this conversation
with their children about LGBT

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.180
rights and LGBT inclusion.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:03.430
So when you have those
tough conversations--

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.220
and maybe I'm preaching
to the wrong crowd.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:10.500
Usually, I'm talking to straight
people or sometimes

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.420
even LGBT people, but it really
doesn't have to address

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.870
them in this issue on how to
talk about inclusion, because

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:17.840
they already do.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.920
So you have to bring up tough
issues like molestation or

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.400
bullying or LGBT awareness
and letting

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.180
your kids be sensitive.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:28.220
That's exactly why my kids
are here, today.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.220
I want them to be around
the LGBT community.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.690
I brought them to a black tie
event last night, and they

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.760
were freakin' atrocious--

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.310
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
--and screaming.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:37.720
But I try to tell them--

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:42.150
I want my kids to be around the
smartest, the brightest,

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.520
the best people in the world,
and we all know that that

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.180
comes from the LGBT community.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.550
That comes from society.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:49.000
So it opens the door.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.210
I talk to the parents.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.400
I tell them, you know, exactly
what you should expect from

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.350
your coaches and what you will
not put up and tolerate with.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:59.000
And then have the conversation
with your children, as well,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.368
about some of these other
tough issues.

00:45:02.368 --> 00:45:03.943
SCOTT FUJITA: Well said, guys.

00:45:03.943 --> 00:45:04.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:05.505
SCOTT FUJITA: It's
about teaching

00:45:05.505 --> 00:45:06.410
empathy, like Chris says.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.810
There's so many coaches at the
youth level, high school

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:09.680
level, all over the country.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.030
You can't get your hands
on all of them.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.590
You do your best by speaking
out publicly.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.630
When Chris writes a letter,
like he did,

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.040
everybody sees that.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.620
These coaches see that.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.960
It puts it on their radar.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.460
Again, you can't get your
hands on everybody,

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.070
as hard as we try.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.060
But it's all about flipping
the conversation.

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.920
I know I keep saying that,
but it's about empathy.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.960
Teach empathy.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.120
I mean, you can still
teach toughness

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:29.830
in the game of football.

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.310
This is a tough game, but you
can, also, teach empathy.

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.130
There's nothing wrong
with that.

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:36.130
CHRIS KLUWE: For me, it's
the fact that it is a

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:37.100
generational issue.

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.980
And the fact is older people,
right now, have not grown up

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.590
in an environment where they've
been around gay

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:45.880
people, openly gay people, so
to them that's going to be

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.480
their natural reaction
is that--

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.130
even if they're supportive,
they're going to be, like,

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.120
look, do what you want to do,
but just leave me out of it.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:53.990
I don't want to know about it.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:57.430
The thing is, as our kids grow
up, as the younger generations

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.470
grow up, they have gay friends,
they have gay

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:02.030
siblings, they have gay
teammates, and they

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.880
know about it now.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.090
You have that education, where
that's how society will shift.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.660
And unfortunately,
like I said, it

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.460
is a long term change.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.994
It's not something you can just
flip a switch and all of

00:46:11.994 --> 00:46:13.140
the sudden everyone's like--

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.240
I understand now, I'm being a
dick to someone, I probably

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:17.930
shouldn't do that.

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:19.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:20.620
CHRIS KLUWE: It's going
to take a while.

00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:25.270
And the key is that if you think
someone is receptive

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:28.330
enough, you can tell them, look,
you may not want to know

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.300
about it, but this is part
of someone's life.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:33.100
This is part of my life, and I
would like you to know about

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:37.450
it, so then you can understand
where I'm coming from.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:41.490
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: I. Always,
say that the LGBT community

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:44.400
is, obviously, a disenfranchised
group, so how

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.850
are they going to let people
know that we need rights, we

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.090
need to be treated equal.

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:50.230
You're going to see--

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:52.290
that's why it's a big deal that
Jason Collins comes out.

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.650
It shouldn't be, but it's
something that's never

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:58.370
happened before, and how else
are they going to change

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:01.530
things, unless they get allies,
unless they get the

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:05.220
majority of the population to
believe in their cause, which

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:09.690
is kind of crazy to me that we
even vote for this, that it's

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:12.610
even up to popular opinion.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:15.160
So I just try to explain to
them, what would you do?

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.320
I mean, what did Martin
Luther King do?

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.560
What did Rosa Parks do?

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.990
They screamed for
attention, and

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:22.040
eventually, things changed.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.930
And the LGBT community
is no different.

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:24.930
SCOTT FUJITA: Yeah, change
can be slow.

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.960
At the time of Loving versus
Virginia, I think only 13% of

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.130
the country was on board with
interracial marriage.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:33.620
It wasn't until, I think, 1990
that at least a simple

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.070
majority of this country
was on board

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:36.340
with interracial marriage.

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.000
That's 1990, so change
is slow.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.750
And it can't get at the
whims of the voter.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.910
The fact that we're voting on
something like marriage

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:45.190
equality makes no sense to me.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:46.410
I mean, you can't follow
the whims of the

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.800
voter, the mob mentality.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.930
It's got be the government.

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:51.190
Brendon said that earlier.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.690
BRENDON AYANBADEJO:
And I tell guys--

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:54.800
I'm like, there's countries
where they practice genital

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.400
mutilation.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.480
There are societies where they
ate people and sacrifice them

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.490
to the gods, and that's because
that was the popular

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:01.030
thing to do.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.590
That's what they thought was
the right thing to do.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.170
So it's no different today.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.720
I mean, we think we're
civilized, and we claim to be

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:13.100
the greatest country in
civilization, ever, but yet

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.360
our neighbors in Mexico and our
neighbors in Canada, they

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.030
have marriage equality.

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:21.060
So I just try to educate guys
and let them know this is why

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:21.580
it's like this.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:22.860
We have to make a change.

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.850
There's people that are
yearning, begging to be

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:27.400
treated equally, and we're
not doing that.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.210
And that's what America was
founded on, and quite frankly,

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.765
the Constitution is not living
up to it's end of the bargain.

00:48:32.765 --> 00:48:34.960
So I let them know.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:41.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: So the question
is, essentially, does

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.160
there need to be education for
gay people about whether

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.420
athletes who use terms that
are viewed as hostile are

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.970
really hostile toward
the gay community.

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:55.360
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: I think we
saw, just last week, with Roy

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.130
Hibbert-- are you guys familiar
with the young man

00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:59.850
from the Pacers?

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:04.350
He was talking, and he's like,
yes, my coach at Georgetown, I

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.080
love him, he's a great coach.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.590
My teammates, yada yada
yada, I love them.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.540
So I was, like wow, I'm really
impressed with this young man,

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.740
he's not worried about saying
he loves other men, which

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.230
other guys have a
problem about.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:20.060
But then as soon as I felt that,
he made a compliment or

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.130
something to one of the other
players, and then he said, "no

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:25.790
homo." I was, like, aw, he
doesn't get it, you know.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:30.270
But do I believe that he's
homophobic, that he means any

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:32.010
ill will towards the
LGBT community?

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.240
No, I don't, but that's
what we talk about.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.180
There's education that
needs to take place.

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.800
A conversation needs to take
place, and that's what we're

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.950
here to do, and that's
what we're doing.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:42.670
But we have a long
ways to go, so we

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:43.890
just continue to educate.

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.660
And there are a lot of athletes
that don't have ill

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.670
will towards the LGBT community,
and there are some

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:48.760
that clearly do.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.670
And I think at the end of the
day, I want to get to the

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:53.880
point where we look on
homophobia like we look on

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.430
racism, like, that person
obviously has a problem, and

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.392
how do we address
that problem.

00:49:59.392 --> 00:50:01.350
SCOTT FUJITA: It's funny you
mentioned "no homo." I think,

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.390
about a year ago, I sent out a
tweet that said, whoever the

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:06.700
fifth grader was that coined the
phrase, "no homo," how did

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.845
he gain all that traction?

00:50:07.845 --> 00:50:08.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:09.070
SCOTT FUJITA: People
responded.

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.900
They'd say, really, a fifth
grader coined that?

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.153
I said, no, I was making
a joke about it.

00:50:12.153 --> 00:50:14.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.610
CHRIS KLUWE: Sarcasm
at its best.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:16.980
SCOTT FUJITA: The brightest
minds in the world live on

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.430
Twitter

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:20.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:23.940
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah, I've seen
that, actually, because

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.690
growing up, I was the
nerdy, bookish kid.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.650
Like, my glasses were, like,
that big and probably, about

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:29.320
that thick.

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.310
And I was, always, walking
around reading a book.

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:35.280
So I was more the nerd who
played athletics than the

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.280
athlete who read books.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.660
And so for me, personally,
there's a little bit of a

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.720
label that is justly earned by
athletes in that a lot of

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.580
guys, their entire identity
is wrapped up in--

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.130
I am a football player, or I am
a soccer player, or I am a

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:50.760
baseball player.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:54.000
And anyone else who's not that,
I look down, because

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.110
that's just the way
that I was raised.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:00.330
And so that's something that,
as athletes, we need to show

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:03.900
that we are beyond that, because
that's the way we

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.400
become closer to these other
communities, like the LGBT

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:10.990
community, that we show it's no
longer you're finding the

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:13.600
gay kid and beating him
up during recess,

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.760
because that's happened.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.190
That's been the underlying
story of our society.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:22.060
There's a reason there's that
jock stereotype, so we need to

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.440
work on changing that and
showing that just as gay

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.680
people aren't defined by that
label, being gay isn't all

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.880
that you are, being an athlete
isn't all that you are.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.790
You are much more than that.

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.080
You are a complex human being.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:35.180
You are everything that
goes into you.

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.790
And so that's what we're trying
to show is that we

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:39.740
aren't just football players.

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.260
We are more than that.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.690
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: We have to
get our football players to

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:43.130
believe that, as well.

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.540
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah.

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:47.400
BRENDON AYANBADEJO: That's why
you see a lot of the guys that

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.420
end up, probably, going bankrupt
and losing their

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:54.910
money, it's because after
football's over-- who are

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.670
they, who am I, where do I go.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:58.450
And that's, probably, a lot of
the same guys that are saying

00:51:58.450 --> 00:51:58.890
"no homo" and a lot
of these things.

00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:01.390
CHRIS KLUWE: Yeah, they just
don't know how to identify

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.360
themselves once that athlete
label is gone.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.740
That's all they are, and they
have to move past that.

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:09.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well I wish we
could stay here and talk all

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.250
day, but I'm being told
we need to wrap up.

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:15.510
So I wanted to be sure to thank
you guys on behalf of

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:19.850
everyone at Google for coming
here and for your eloquent

00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.650
advocacy on behalf of
marriage equality.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:23.470
So thanks a lot.

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:24.070
This has been great.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:33.370
