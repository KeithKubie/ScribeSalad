00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
When you’re black, you’re punk rock all the time.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:11.400
[mashup of your favorite punk songs]

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.880
And that is the sound of punk.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.660
Short, fast riffs. Lyrics pushing back against the mainstream mundane.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.460
The original don’t-give-a-f*ck attitude. And a no-rules-allowed genre for self-identifying

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.300
misfits that emerged at a time where music was becoming maybe a little too clean.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.380
But punks – or at least as I saw it, growing up – rarely looked like anything other than these guys.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.660
Hey guys, I’m Sana.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.780
This is AJ+ and today we’re gonna explore the very black history – and present – of punk music.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.980
Now, there was a decent amount of women who led the movement:

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.500
Patti Smith, Joan Jett, Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.500
And they all got major recognition.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.380
But black or Latino or any other shade of punk? Not really.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.000
That doesn’t sound weird if you’ve been taught the history of punk

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.560
as something that emerged from the working-class angst of young, white

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.200
English men. Think the Sex Pistols and The Clash.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.760
But it is weird when you dig a bit deeper into the history

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.600
of punk and find that black and brown punks actually pioneered the movement.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.940
Now, the most popular black American punk band is probably Bad Brains.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.620
[awesome hardcore]

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.040
But first, I wanna talk about Death, the guys who helped pioneer punk without even trying or knowing.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.680
['Keep on Knocking' by Death playing]

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.840
Death was the three Hackney brothers from Detroit.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.440
Their music is what’s been called proto-punk – punk before we knew punk was punk.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:58.260
['Politicians in My Eyes' playing]

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.520
Now, Death broke all the rules

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.800
They were three black men playing what was considered white people’s music

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.260
at a time when black Americans were known for playing things like Motown and R&amp;B.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.220
We felt natural doing it while we were

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.440
in our own quarters, but playing it out means that you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.180
had to answer so many questions.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.480
Yeah, we totally spoke to Death.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.260
Now, the Hackney brothers did start off by playing R&amp;B.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.480
In fact, their band was originally called Rock Fire Funk Express.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.000
But by 1973, they started playing rock and roll.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.940
Well, we were just playing hard-driving rock and roll, man.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.040
We were just really trying to be like the groups of the day that we loved,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.620
like the MC5 and Alice Cooper and all those great rock-and-roll bands of the ’70s.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.140
We really just kind of springboarded off of the sound that they was laying down,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.660
but we were just doing it harder, faster and louder.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.860
Despite their raw sound and unique, intimidating name –

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.680
which, by the way, was totally ahead of its time –

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.700
they didn’t last long as a band.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.600
They just didn’t get the distribution that they needed, with some record labels

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.020
worried about how to market their name and their sound.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.700
And so Death kind of disbanded, but the brothers continued making music.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.480
And it was only 30 years later, in 2008, that Death was rediscovered and thrown onto people’s radar.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.300
Now, even though Death didn’t go mainstream,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.820
their music was known underground and by the most diehard punk fans.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.720
Meaning, they had influence.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.000
There really was no scene or community or culture to embrace them.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.060
And suddenly, kind of in retrospect, people have realized

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.880
realized like, wow, these guys were making punk rock

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.500
rock out of their own inner creative compulsions in Detroit.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.300
Now, while Death is a pioneering band in punk history,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.260
they actually don’t necessarily see what they were doing at the time as punk –

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.720
– in fact, just plain old rock and roll.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.320
We’ve never really considered ourselves a punk band.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.880
I mean, back then, if you called somebody a punk, you know, you got into a fight.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.840
We were playing what we conceived as hard-drive and Detroit rock and roll, man.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.620
It’s also important to note, as writer and musician Greg Tate told me,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.420
the difference in how white and black musicians in the same genre were marketed,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.980
and how that had an impact on who got the credit and who got the fame.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.840
The American music business is made up of gatekeepers on the corporate side, on the radio side.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.480
They very much subscribe to the Jim Crow notions of racial separation and segregation

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.240
which defined American culture throughout most of the 20th century.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.360
It meant that black artists, historically, for most of the 20th century, couldn't make

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.840
as much money playing their own music, didn't have access to the same audiences, the same opportunities.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.680
Now, in the ’70s there was another black punk band that really changed the scene:

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.700
Bad Brains, considered one of the most influential punk bands ever.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.860
[Bad Brains being awesome]

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.580
The group formed in 1976 in Washington, DC, getting its name from a Ramones song.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.020
The punk band dominated in the ’80s with their mix of reggae and a very aggressive punk sound

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.420
known as hardcore.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.060
[Really aggressive punk sound]

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.960
In fact, they – along with Minor Threat and Black Flag – are considered

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.020
the pioneers of hardcore, which is a genre of punk which is, well, pretty damn fast.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.820
And DC was hardcore’s mecca, and also one of the most long-term influential punk scenes.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.040
And there were also other black punk bands like Pure Hell, Fishbone

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.200
and the UK’s X-Ray Spex, whose lead vocalist was a woman.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.380
It's worth noting that these bands weren’t segregated to some “black punk” category –

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.000
they influenced other bands, and vice versa.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.960
Take reggae, for example. Numerous white punk bands used reggae

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.120
in their music in the UK throughout the ’70s, inspired by black punk bands’ use of it.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.100
In my conversation with Tate, he mentioned how this idea that rock or punk as an all-white-boys’ club

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.560
didn’t really exist in the UK.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.020
Black and brown punks were heavily influencing the scene.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.980
Under the Thatcher government, there was a lot of disenfranchisement of white working class

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.480
youth, who were non-racist or anti-racist.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:16.360
They kind of found their voice and their militancy through the political actions and the music

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.620
of their black and South Asian-born classmates and neighbors.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.400
And just like their British counterparts, American punks also were really influenced by politics,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.100
whether U.S. wars in Cambodia and Vietnam in the ’70s, or, well, Ronald Reagan’s

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.300
whole presidency throughout the ’80s.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.860
But punk – especially black punk – isn’t a thing of the past. It’s still a live, budding cultural movement today.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.240
I realized that, like, not only is rock and roll something

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.880
that is native to people like myself and to Honeychild, but it's almost like my birthright.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.620
That’s Honeychild Coleman and Sacha Jenkins of the

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.200
punk band trio The 1865 --

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.740
and yes, their name is referencing exactly what you think it’s referencing.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.580
The “1865” references America in 1865, when the Emancipation Proclamation

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.480
brought a lot of promise of change for black Americans – except the racists had other plans.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.320
Soon after, organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, and other groups who weren't really fans

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.020
of people like myself and this young lady, got together and kind of made it their business

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.740
to get in our business and make it hard for us to live in America.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.180
And so you look at the climate of where we are now –

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.480
I don't want to necessarily be so literal, but it feels like the same kinds of sentiments.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.660
The 1865 makes music that looks at 1865 America from the lens of a runaway slave,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.240
a white Southern soldier, a slave owner who felt no guilt.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.900
The trio is part of a still growing and very visible black presence in the punk scene,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.380
something that was highlighted in the 2003 documentary “Afropunk.”

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.940
The documentary really explored trials and good times faced by black youth

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.000
who were an intimate part of a cultural scene that has always been seen as white by outsiders.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:10.480
The film ended up inspiring a bigger cultural movement, including a festival, started in 2005, by the same name.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.260
The Afropunk festival, which was started in Brooklyn and now is international, basically is

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.220
about celebrating black artists, black creatives and black fans in the alternative scene.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:26.380
Honeychild Coleman, Sacha Jenkins and Shawna Shawnté, who runs a black–brown punk festival

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.940
in Oakland, all say there’s nothing more punk than being black in America.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.520
I'm not saying black people created punk rock. I'm saying we are punk rock, without even trying.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:44.320
The foundations of what people do that creates punk culture, say, going on tour, booking your

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.680
your own tour through an underground network, that's what black musicians had to do

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.100
because we weren't allowed to play in clubs.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.580
When we have been pushed to the margins

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.760
but we create in those margins,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.880
it doesn't get more punk than that.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:07.540
I knew that it was my legacy, and I never believed anyone

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.300
who told me I was trying to be white because I loved rock and I loved guitars.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.520
But even though they all agree that there’s nothing more punk than being black, they

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.180
also raise the point of how different the experience is of being either white or black in the punk scene.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.880
When you're black, you’re punk rock all the time, you're a target all the time.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.300
And I can't change the color of my skin.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.500
There is a level of privilege that goes with, “I'm going to put a safety pin through my

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.620
nose and paint my hair, dye my hair green for three years, and then I'm going to clean

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.220
up and put on a suit and get a corporate job.” We don't really have that luxury.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:50.440
You also get cred for having punk years. But in my experience, working in the corporate world,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:55.720
I can't let everybody know what I do outside of work because it could cost me my job.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:01.640
And for Shawna, it remains super important to keep creating spaces that empower people on the margins.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.240
I think it's important to see people who look like you making music and art.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:11.940
It can feel very isolating and depressing, as a young person, when people are trying to

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:20.600
box you into one sort of identity and tell you how you have to be, based on your ethnicity or your class.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.940
Punk is complicated, even though it’s just simple, raw music.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.480
As a movement, it has this incredibly rich history that, like the people in it, is hard to box.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.200
And if the black history of punk music tells us anything,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.440
it’s how instrumental black musicians have been in the creation of an American pop culture.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.280
Life-changing interview.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.220
[Bemusedly strums guitar]

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.760
And then Sacha smashes the guitar through the door!

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.260
Right.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:51.840
Hey guys! So we actually filmed this piece at 924 Gilman, which is the CBGB of the West Coast

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.560
And if you don't know what CBGB is, you should definitely look that up.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.280
Let us what are some of the punk bands that you grew up listening to and don't forget to

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.740
like, share and subscribe and keep it punk.
