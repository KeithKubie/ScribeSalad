00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.600
Now,
I just finished this other one and I'm working on that one.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.930
And a lot of it has to do with social media and a lot of it has to do with the

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.750
impact that it has on young people.
You know,

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.770
people are not really designed for this and you might be able to handle it if

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.860
your 32 year old man or a 35 year old woman or whatever you are.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.930
But if you're a 15 year old girl,
this might,
it might be overwhelming.
I mean,

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.940
and the angst and the anxiety and you know,
wanting to know,

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.650
saying about the depression,
you know,

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:32.430
they see if they're not at a party where their stuff's not getting liked,

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.290
that has an impact on them.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.320
And ultimately I think the networks need to be helping educate people how to,

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.190
you know,
whether it's this info,
educate people how to research.

13
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.000
I did see that youtube is starting to do like a,

14
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.220
you've been on this for too long type thing.
Really?
Yeah.

15
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.320
Like get a life you fuck yeah.

16
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.780
They tell you that I want to build stuff like that.
That's really important.
Yeah.

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.350
Helping people get off.
Yeah.
I haven't,
I haven't seen that.

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.170
I haven't done enough time on youtube where the kicking me off.

19
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.740
I have,
it's easy.
You know,
I was uh,
I sent,
uh,

20
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.230
Eddie Bravo,
this thing from the Guardian about,
uh,

21
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.930
the upsurge and people that believe in the flat earth and all of it because of

22
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.470
youtube videos and that apparently now youtube is,

23
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.610
they want to censor those.
They want to,
uh,
they,

24
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.290
they feel like flat earth videos and uh,
I think another one,

25
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.350
check this,
check this if I'm wrong about this,

26
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.880
but I think they also want to lean on those anti-vaccination videos.

27
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.340
I think there's a concern with those.

28
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.880
I think they're worried about a bunch of different things along those lines.

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.420
You know,

30
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.530
like they feel like there's disinformation and outright lies to being spread.

31
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.410
How do we combat it?
We own this platform.
What do we do?

32
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.520
They feel like they have a responsibility.
I think there is responsibility.
Okay.

33
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.500
But what is the responsibility?
If there's a debate,

34
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.530
I think it's more to educate people how to research as opposed to saying this is

35
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:07.410
or is not true.
Right?
Because who's deciding that?
Well,

36
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.400
I believe the earth is round,
but,
uh,
um,

37
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.060
I also believe it's such a stupid conspiracy that you should have it.

38
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.510
You should be allowed and it should be something you should show your friends.

39
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:25.590
Like,
dude,
I need you to go look at this.
This has 37,000 thumbs up.

40
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.070
And they really believe that the fucking earth is flat.

41
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.140
They really believe there's an ice wall outside Antarctica.

42
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:35.880
They really believe that the sky doesn't move,
that it's that the,

43
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.100
you know,
that we're in some sort of a,

44
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.220
they think it's like projected images or something.

45
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:44.580
Like there's a bunch of like really,
really wacky theories.

46
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.200
Like I think those are okay.
Yeah,
of course.
Yeah.

47
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.120
But I think freedom of information sort of transcends a lot of these little

48
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.090
debates.
So if there was more freedom of information,

49
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.720
so we actually knew everything.
The government,
yeah.

50
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.120
About all of the different conspiracies and black projects.

51
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:05.450
The black budget.
Yeah.

52
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.320
More information is going to give both sides the ability to understand what is

53
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.340
happening.
That's true.

54
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.240
The reality is that we don't know what's happening and there is lots of secret

55
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:16.720
stuff.
