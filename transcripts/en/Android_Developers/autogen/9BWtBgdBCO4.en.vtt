the trick for the search provider is
 

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.430
the trick for the search provider is
that it needs to return results in that

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440
that it needs to return results in that
 

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.250

does all this work for you
it makes a channel so you have your

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880
it makes a channel so you have your
 

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.930
it makes a channel so you have your
builder you set the name the description

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:52.940

and you think you should set the type

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:58.790
and you think you should set the type
 

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.060
and you think you should set the type
but this class knows that it is a

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.070
but this class knows that it is a
 

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.069
but this class knows that it is a
preview channel so it already knows the

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079
preview channel so it already knows the
 

00:15:04.079 --> 00:15:06.110
preview channel so it already knows the
type of site preview and you don't have

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120
type of site preview and you don't have
 

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.290
type of site preview and you don't have
to set the type instead you can set the

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300
to set the type instead you can set the
 

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.980

helper dot publish channel give it the

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:17.940
helper dot publish channel give it the
 

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.939
helper dot publish channel give it the
channel it figures out all of the work

00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:19.949
channel it figures out all of the work
 

00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:23.470
channel it figures out all of the work
for you and you get the channel ID back

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480
for you and you get the channel ID back
 

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.420
for you and you get the channel ID back
so what it does under the covers it
