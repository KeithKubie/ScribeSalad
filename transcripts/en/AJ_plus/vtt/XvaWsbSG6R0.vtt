00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.320
Every Thanksgiving, Americans eat close to 736 million pounds of turkey.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.820
That’s the weight of almost a thousand 747s at takeoff.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.740
So how does a turkey make it to your plate?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.218
It all starts with an act of love … usually, artificial insemination.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.689
As soon as a day later, you’ve got an egg that travels to a hatchery

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.463
that becomes a baby turkey, that’s shipped off to a barn, often in Minnesota.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.056
If that weren’t hellish enough, after about 18 weeks the now mature turkey

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.208
gets sent to a processing plant.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.615
Hint: Processing is kind of a euphemism.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.620
The turkeys get unloaded in the dark … and is stunned through electrocution or gas.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.437
Next, the throat slitting machine. 
Then scalding, picking and more gross stuff.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.477
Time for packaging – only the prettiest turkeys are packaged whole.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.295
Then the turkey’s shipped to a grocery store.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.580
Where you buy it, take it home and roast it.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.830
At this point, we’d like to ask: white meat or dark?
