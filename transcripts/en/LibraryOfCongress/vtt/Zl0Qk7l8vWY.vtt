00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:19.080
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.950
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.100
and welcome to the African and
Middle East Division of the Library

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.030
of Congress, and to our
noontime lecture series,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.910
with today's program
entitled "Classified as white:

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.160
Historical insights into the
racial classification of Americans

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.940
of African and Middle East decent."

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.660
I'm Joan Weeks, Head of the Near
East section and Turkey Specialist.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.920
On behalf of all my colleagues,
in particular Dr. Mary Jane Deeb,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.490
Chief of the Division, I'd

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.050
like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.100 position:56%
And before we get started, we always
like to give you a little overview

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.660
of the division and the resources
in the hopes that you'll come back

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.240
and use the collections
for your research.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.090
The division is comprised
of 3 sections that build

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.030
and serve the collections to
researchers from around the world.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.870
We cover 75 countries and
more than 2 dozen languages.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.460 position:56%
The Africa section includes the
countries of all sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.450
The Hebraic section is responsible
for Judaica and Hebraic worldwide.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.760
And the Near East section covers
all of the Arab countries,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.580
including North Africa, Turkey,
Turkic Central Asia, Iran,

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.500
Afghanistan, and the Muslims of
Western China, Russia, the Balkans,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.720
and the peoples of the
Caucasus, as well as Armenia.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.450
After the program, we'd
like to invite you to fill

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.150
in the evaluation forms we've
placed in your seats and leave them

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.950 position:56%
at the information desk at the front
of the reading room as you exit.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.620
Now I'd like to invite Dr. Muhannad
Salhi, our Arab World Specialist,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:09.150
to the podium to introduce our
speaker for today's program.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.260
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody,
thank you all for joining us.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.770
Our speaker today, Randa Kayyali,
is a Professorial Lecturer

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.350 position:56%
in Anthropology at George Washington
University's Elliott School

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.770
for International Affairs.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.400
She received her doctorate
from George Mason University

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.690 position:56%
in cultural studies in 2013, and an
MA from American University in Cairo

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.250
in sociology anthropology.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.360
Dr. Kayyali has taught Arab World
Studies at American University

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.330
in Washington DC, and was a
post-doctoral research fellow

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.580
at Ali Vural AK Center
for Global Islamic Studies

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.950
at Georgia Mason University.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.040
She published the Arab-Americans
Greenwood Press 2006,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.640 position:56%
which she received a book award from
the Arab-American National Museum,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.030
and was translated into
Arabic as [foreign language].

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.070
She is the author of a chapter
on family in the edited volume,

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.800
"Daily Life of Arab-Americans
in the 21st Century,"

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.310
and "US Census Classifications
of Arab-Americans, contestations

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.830
and definitions of identity
markers," in the Journal of Ethnic

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.630
and Migration Studies,
published in September of 2013.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.250
She currently serves on
the board and as treasurer

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.850
of the Arab-American Studies
Association and as co-chair

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.270
of the tri-annual convention.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.510
So without further
ado, Dr. Randa Kayyali.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.050
[ Applause ]

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.600
&gt;&gt; I'd like to thank Muhannad
and the staff here at the Library

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.910
of Congress, the Africa Middle
East Division, for their kindness

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.870
and inviting me and welcoming
me to this lecture series.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.900
I'd also like to thank the
Arab-American National Museum

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.240
and Helen Samhan [assumed
spelling] for the images

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.600
that you will see in
this PowerPoint.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.180
This piece is a work in
progress, so I hope --

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.040
and I'm looking forward to the
question-and-answer session.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.260
The classification of Middle
Easterners and North Africans

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.700
in the US as white by race
stretches back over a century ago.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.490
In light of the possibility that
there might be a new Middle Eastern

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.750
and North African box, MENA box,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.820
and I'll use that acronym
throughout my presentation,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.790
on the 20/20 census form.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.950
This historical research has
contemporary significance.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.440
In today's presentation,
we will learn that debates

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.000
of the MENA racial
classifications are not novel,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.160
and that a deeper examination
of history and critique

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.350
of historical narratives offers
the contemporary reader 3

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.450
noteworthy insights.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.780
Firstly, the naturalization
rulings in US courts

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.090
that determine the eligibility of
early MENA's to US citizenship show

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.480 position:56%
that labels of the geographic
region and the perceptions of people

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.610
within them determined race.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.210
While they're ultimately classified
as white, and therefore grouped

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.630
with Europeans, those with
Middle Eastern origins were noted

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.950
as from Asia in terms of
Continental assignments,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.950
but not ultimately Asiatic
or Mongolian by race.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.660
Secondly, I will show
that the judges

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.120
in these cases drew a Christian
Muslim binary and placed a premium

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.270
on their origins in the Mohammed
world, as it was called back then.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.610
Occasionally noting the Eastern
rites of their Christianity,

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.060
and generally grouping Syrian
Christians with Islam by culture,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.740
even if they were recognized
as Christian.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.670
Finally, the history of the US
Census classifications indicates

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.310 position:56%
that MENA's have been identified by
factors other than race and religion

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.810
on official forms issued by the
US government for over a century,

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.360
specifically through
questions relating to ancestry

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.440
and language spoken at home.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.570
In other words, then is now.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.710
There are additional ways
to access ethnic identity

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.970
within a broad racial white
racial classification.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.910
So it's a bit of background.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.870
Since 1977, the US government
and particularly the Office

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.810
of Management and Budget has
classified white as a person --

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.150
in quotes, "a person having origins
in any of the original peoples

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.190
of Europe, the Middle
East, or North Africa."

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.030
Although geographic boundaries
of the MENA region are undefined,

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.570
I consider the main ethnic
groups in MENA to be Iranians,

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.580
Persians, Turks, and Arabs.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.100
But the region also
includes significant numbers

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.860
of minority ethnic groups,
namely the Armazi, the Kurds,

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.840
and Armenians, as wells
as ethno-religious groups,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.470 position:56%
including Chadians, Assyrians,
Syriacs, Maronites, cults, and Jews.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.000
And often language is tied to
each one of these collectivities.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.330
This presentation will focus on
how people from all of these groups

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.960
from the MENA region came to be
classified by the US government

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.920
in official records
before World War II.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.270
Racially, they were classified as
white in 2 batches of legal cases.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.380
The first set, by Syrian
Christians, between 1909 in 1915.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.990
And the second set,
by Muslim Arabians.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:41.770
These are terms that
were used in these cases.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.180
In 1942 and '44.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:49.980
Through an examination of
immigration categories,

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.800
census questions, and racial
prerequisite cases, legal cases,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.870
I will strive to highlight how
geography, race, and religion were,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.040
in fact, intertwined,
and provide insights

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.010
into how mainstream American
society viewed MENA Americans

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.300
as between white and nonwhite.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.060
So I wanted to ask
you as the audience

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.950 position:56%
if there was ever a time you've been
mistaken for a member of an ethnic,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.580
religious, or national group
that you did not belong to.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.360
And how did that make you feel.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.820 position:56%
If you felt that it was a compliment

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:31.120
and positive mistaken
identity, put up your hands.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.420
Okay, nice, 3.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.420
And if you felt that it
was something that hurt you

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.550
or is negative, put up your hands.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.230
Okay, so about even.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.040
We're going to talk a
little bit about that today.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:53.800
Sorry. Okay, so in the first
sort of phase of immigration,

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.260 position:56%
you had the Philadelphia, there were
men from North Africa who traveled

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.770 position:56%
or were brought to the US as slaves.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.780
The Philadelphia World's Fair of
1876 brought people and delegations

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.370 position:56%
from the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, and
Tunisia to showcase their countries.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.470
The Ottoman exhibit heavily
featured Palestinian Christians

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.580
from Bethlehem and Jerusalem
who were marketed as being

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.600
from the Bible land
or the holy land,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.020
with shepherds herding
the flocks and images

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.110
that were called the
Arabian nights fables.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.860
They sold religious items
such as olive wood crucifixes

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.360
from Bethlehem, rosary beads, and
mother-of-pearl decorative items.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.200
This was part of the Ottoman
Empire strategy to show the world

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.430
that they treated their
religious minorities with respect.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.340
And yet there are media
reports, US media reports,

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.300
of surprise that there
were Christians

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.460
who were Ottoman Turkish subjects.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.850
Because Arabs and Turks
were perceived in the US

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.720
to be followers of Mohammed.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.650
Some of these merchants stayed
on such, as Joseph Abien Matter,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.760
who is recorded in the 1880
census as living in Philadelphia.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:10.140 position:56%
so usually I'm just going to cite 5
reasons that are cited for the onset

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:16.160 position:56%
of the first phase of immigration
which began in 1880, or about there,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.380
it's not an exact cutoff
date, of course.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:24.010
And that these immigrants came
from Bilad Al-Sham, or Syria,

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.090
an Ottoman province that encompass
present-day Lebanon, Syria,

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:32.620
Palestine, Israel, and parts of
Jordan, and they came to the US.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.630
The fair had prompted stories
of wealth and success to be had

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.960
from selling goods to Americans
and offered the lure of adventure.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.450
Combined with the economic downturn
of the economy due to the collapse

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.430
of silk factories, or
sericulture, on Mount Lebanon,

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.100
the financial incentives of
living and earning money in the US

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.750
for a few years were strong.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.420
An argument I find
compelling is the influence

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.400
of the Christian missionaries
from the US establishing

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.290
and teaching schools in the region.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.830
Also cited that, in my opinion,
less likely due to the dates,

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.610
is the sectarian violence,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.740
particularly the Drupe Maronite
clashes on Mount Lebanon,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.170
and the riots in Damascus.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.010
However, the deterioration of the
Ottoman Empire and the conscription

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:25.650
of young Christian and Jewish men
into the Army required in 1909

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.810
by the Ottoman Empire were
significant factors in the choice

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.910
of young men to move continents.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:49.100
So I'm going to come back
to the issue of Mallets.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:53.540
Okay, this is a picture of the
Zainea family from Damascus,

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.140
and this is when they
were there in Damascus.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.010
I believe that they are
possibly Orthodox, Rome,

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.240
or Roman Catholic Melkites.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.340
From their dress, they
were definitely urban,

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.600
and probably elite.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.910
A little background though I want
to give you on the Ottoman Empire.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.840
In 1516, the Ottoman Empire
is invaded Bilad Al-Sham,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.440
and continued to rule almost
continuously until World War I.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.590
The Ottoman Empire gave Sunni
Muslims the primary place

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.310
as socially and culturally superior

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.910
to the other communities
in the Empire.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:34.080
In the 19th century, the
state solidified legal

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.150
and sociopolitical
structures for non-Muslims.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.240
In these Millets, which I mentioned
on the last slide, Christian

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.900
and Jewish subjects were permitted
to regulate their own communities

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.500
and given some autonomy in
terms of family laws, taxation,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.980
and collective representation.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.010
The largest Christian millet
in the 18th and 19th century,

00:12:54.010 --> 00:13:00.420
in the Syrian province, was the
Orthodox Christian or Rome Mallets.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.720
You'd write it in English as RUM.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.230
According to their own
ecclesiastical structures,

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.620
these Orthodox Christians
fell under 2 patriarchates,

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.000
the larger Greek-dominated
patriarchate,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.200 position:56%
or Sea of Constantinople, and the
smaller Arabic-speaking patriarchate

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.750 position:56%
of Antioch that was headquartered in
Damascus and had the areas now known

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.980
as Lebanon and Syria
under its jurisdiction.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:31.040
In 1848, the Empire gave Greek
Catholics, called RUM Catholic

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.450
in Arabic, who were in union

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.760
with the Roman Catholic
Church, a millet of their own.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.670
These Greek Catholics,
which, despite the name,

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:43.100
were explicitly Arabic speaking in
services, as well as colloquially,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.600
were also known as
malekites or King's men,

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.170
sir name for their loyalty to
the Byzantine Empires Emperors.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.820
Roman Catholics who were not
part of the Melkites church

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.780
and Protestants were
granted extraordinary status

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.670
as protected foreigners,
and Maronites

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.980
and other Latin rites were
dealt with at the level

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.210
of the local provincial
administrations.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.850
This patchwork of treatment
gave religious minorities

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:12.010
in the Ottoman Empire a
degree of religious freedom,

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.230
but they were also required
to submit to Ottoman demands

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:20.030
and the Islamic character
of the state or Empire.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.460
This is the backdrop against which
many of the immigrants arrived

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.360
in the US and perceived identity.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.710
The Ottoman Millets

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:31.880
and decentralized system ingrained
identity as defined by religion,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.390
broadly Christian, Jewish,
Muslim, and noted the differences

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.520
between religious sects for
Christians, Roman Catholic,

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.220
Roman Catholic, Protestant,
and Maronite, for example.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.570
And that underlined which
areas and sects were answerable

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.900
to which patriarchs, to which
religious figures, to which rabbis.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.810
Whether or not the existence
of Mallets created the violence

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.320
and discrimination against
Christians in Mount Lebanon

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.830 position:56%
or the riots in the city of Damascus

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.260
in the late 19th century
became less important

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.010
for the immigrants upon their
arrival in their new countries

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.740
in South and North
America then the fact

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.240
that they'd come from
the Ottoman Empire.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.880
So going back to my question,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.830
the migrants from below Bilad
Al-Sham were recorded as Ottoman,

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:28.060
or from Turkey in Asia, and
sometimes from Palestine or Syria,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.220
in official immigration
records in the US,

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:36.580
until the end of the Ottoman Empire
officially dissolved in 1923.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.500
Religion was not recorded and so
estimates of religious breakdowns

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.820
of the Syrian migrants are
problematic, but we can assume

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.410
that many of the non-Turkish
Ottoman subjects might object

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.860
to classification as Ottoman.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.870
Because Ottoman was seen
as synonymous with Turkish,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.170
which was ethnically

00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:00.790 position:56%
and linguistically
differentiated from Arabic speakers.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.850
Back home, these immigrants had
informally used the term Turk

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:06.260
to refer to Muslims.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.970
And in the US, Turk and even Syrian
connoted an Islamic identification.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.700
This popular assumption in the US

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.380
in the early 19th century was
well-founded, was well illustrated

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:26.710
by a pulp fiction story that
appeared in the American Magazine

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:33.010
in 1912 that I found nestled in the
NAF archives at the Smithsonian.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.480
In the story, Emily, a
curious young farm girl,

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.140
asked a self-described
peddler from Syria,

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.160
aren't they Mohammedans,
your people?

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.360
And when he explains that his
mother belonged to the Greek church

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.760
but that he was Presbyterian,
Emily was incredulous.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.020
Emily was impressed with
how exotic this peddler was,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.800
different from her
family in every way,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.250
because of his backgrounds
in a far-off land.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.660
Even if he was Christian,
he seemed Mohammedan.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.810
Today, of course, we do
not use the term Mohammedan

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.750
because Muslims don't
worship Mohammad,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.270
but back then it was sort
of standard practice.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.110
The blurring of the East with Islam
follows a traditional Orientalist

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:21.760
binary that posits the Orient
as defined in opposition

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.410
to the Occident and
Western Christianity.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:30.600
In his critique of
Orientalis, Edward Siad pointed

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.210
out that those Orientalist
scholars, such as Masagnul,

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.180
saw Eastern Christians
as subsumed within Islam,

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.310
and as part of a monolithic East

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.030
which had Islam as
the superstructure.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.140
At a time when the US was
increasingly xenophobic,

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.510
this association with Islamic
other was particularly problematic,

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.630
especially for immigrants from the
East who wanted to gain material

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:58.950
and social status in the US.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:04.600
Alixa Naff, authored a
seminal history book called

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.430
"Becoming American, the
early Arab experience,"

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.160
and it was published in 1985.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.090 position:56%
And it truly began a deeper interest
in the history of the Syrians,

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.370 position:56%
in particular, but Arabs in general.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.680
Though her book in large collection
is housed at the Smithsonian,

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.620
she initiated a dominant
narrative of the early experience

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.970
as she called it, meaning
before World War II.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.510
Within Arab-American studies, there
is a dominant historical narrative

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.610
of the poor illiterate farmer
from a village in Mount Lebanon

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.150
or Syria who came to the US.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.840
First arriving in New York at Ellis
Island, and then staying or living

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.870 position:56%
for a few days or possibly longer in
what was called the mother colony,

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:51.700
which was the Syrian colony that
existed at the tip of Manhattan.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.610
And then that traveler would
possibly travel by train

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.780
to meet family members or friends
and start peddling with the goods

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.480
that he bought, because most of
this discourse is for single men,

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.020
with the goods in New York.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:12.460
This photo of a peddler is
somewhat iconic to that narrative.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.130
NAF estimated that as much
as 95% of the immigrants

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.390
from Syria were Christian
before World War II.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.530
While another historian
calculated that nearly 90%

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.420
of all Arabic-speaking immigrants
arriving the US before 1924 were

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.890
Syrian Christians from
Mount Lebanon.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.090
According to these historians,
the Arabic-speaking immigrants

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.530
to the US would have been
Christian with a minority

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.940
of Drupe and Sunni Muslims.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:45.530
This is a young fellow
that is an example

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.510
that the dominant narrative does
contain some truths, in my mind.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.650 position:56%
Toufic here was all of those things.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.840
He was a single male
who immigrated in 1914.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:01.160
Was a Maronite Christian from
the village in Mount Lebanon,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.460
Bqaatouta, east of Beirut.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.190 position:56%
He was a farmer in that village and
was unschooled, probably illiterate,

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.510 position:56%
and became a laborer and a peddler
in the US, where he changed his name

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.400
by adding Ellis, after
his father Ellis.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.070
In 1919, he opened a cigar
store with his uncle,

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.560 position:56%
and later produced arak, an aniseed
flavored spirit, during prohibition.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.430
In 1925, Toufic returned to
Lebanon to fetch a bride.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.460 position:56%
Returning to the US a year later,
where he and his wife had his family

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:40.190
and lived out the rest
of their days.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.750
This photo may represent
the marginalized narrative

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.760
of early Arab-American history.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.190
There is a dearth of information,
or even ongoing research,

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:52.650 position:56%
regarding Egyptian, Iranian, Yemeni,
and North African immigrants.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.150
This photo shows an
allegiance to the Ottoman Empire

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:02.160
through the fezzes, which are the
hats that are shaped like a cone,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.960
and the Star and Crescent on what
looks like to me a water pipe

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:11.140
or possibly a decorative silver
or brass vase, it's at the top

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.860
of the vase you can see the Star.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.480
These were possibly
Egyptians, possibly Muslim.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.680
And the alternative
discourse I believe needs

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.200
to be further researched.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.550
Who were these immigrants?

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:27.260
How do they fit in or differ from
the narratives on the Syrians?

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.940
Why did their race never come
up in legal cases until the end,

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:40.910
where you hear Yemeni
debates, debates on the Yemeni?

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:44.690
However, Syrian identity was
recognized in the US Census.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:49.360
In the 1900, 1910,
and 1920 censuses,

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.950
Syrian were a recognized group

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.900
within the population
statistics of foreign-born whites.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:02.000 position:56%
In the 1910 in 1920 censuses, Syria
was listed as a separate birthplace,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.930
even though it was still officially
part of the Ottoman Empire.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:10.040
During World War I, 1914
to 1918, being associated

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.030
with the Ottoman Empire became
more of a political problem rather

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.610
than just an identification issue.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.090
Because the US sided with the
Allies against the Axis powers,

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.420
including the Ottoman Empire.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.960 position:56%
This solidified a move away from
associations with the Ottoman Empire

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:29.880
for the Syrians, a shift
in identity, supported

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.000
and recognized by the
US Census Bureau.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.560
By 1930, the census, the
Ottoman Empire had collapsed,

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:42.070
a new country of birth
appellations became necessary.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.530
The Census Bureau asked its
census takers or enumerators

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.550
to record the country
of birth according

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:51.480
to present geopolitical
locations in 1930.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:57.260
This is specifically mentioning,
as you can see, the list up there.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:00.450
This indicates to the researcher
that there were other types

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.120
of MENA's present in the US
and that the Census Bureau was

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.140
also recognizing.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:12.280
And another way that
Syrians were recognized was

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.260
through language spoken at
home, which was recorded.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:21.210
And the 1910 census asked, can
the person speak English, if not,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.390 position:56%
what language does the person speak.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.600
And both Syrian and
Turkish were listed

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.600
as principal foreign languages
spoken in the US, but not Arabic.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.880
I don't know the reason for that.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.260
But that's something
that is interesting.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.530 position:56%
And yet, in 1920, the options on the
respondent's mother tongue expanded

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:46.600
to include Arabic, and
then again in 1930,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.280
the options included Egyptians.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:57.720
So in 1930, they had
Syrian, Arabic, and Egyptian.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.050
However, the Syrian
community was not monolithic,

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:03.670
even if we just take it as Syrian.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:13.880 position:56%
An Academic Philip Carey Hitti,
published a study in 1924 on Syrians

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.700
in America that found
that most were Christian.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.800
Most numerous among the
Syrians were the Maronites,

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.940
followed by the Orthodox
and Greek Catholics,

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.400
Melkites, and then Protestants.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.140
While these churches
indicated a healthy community,

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.500
the divisions between sects

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.600
and nations were becoming
increasingly prevalent.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:41.360 position:56%
New countries were being established
under colonial powers by the 1920,

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.600
divided between British and
French colonial authorities.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:52.420
Coming back to the US, in 1910, the
census enumerators were instructed

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.780
to note down their nativity.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.760
And if the respondent said
that their parents nativity was

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:04.800
in Turkey, they were asked
to note the Asia part.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.490
Although the Syrian province is
located in Asia, they did not want

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.150
to be considered Asian due to
the prevailing Asian exclusion

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.430
and restrictions, which
were well-known.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:20.860
Until 1909, MENA's had assumed
the privileges of whiteness.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.330
They were granted citizenship
without much deliberation.

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.240
They held political offices.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.240
And they owned property, even in
states where property ownership

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:37.060
by aliens was prohibited.

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.160
The Naturalization era began --

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.850
I'm moving but I'll
come back to this topic.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.680
The Naturalization era began
with the 1790 Naturalization Act,

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.670
which stipulated that only
free white persons could become

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:51.970
US citizens.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:55.380
The racial designation as
white became a prerequisite

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.560
for naturalization and for
full rights as a US citizen.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.350 position:56%
The question then became, who
qualified to be a free white person.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.510
And this decision was
determined by the courts,

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:10.190
and in particular, by judges.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:15.210
Armenians, Mexicans, Indians, and
Sikhs all faced racial, and others,

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:20.330
all faced racial prerequisite
cases between 1909 and 1923.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.890
But 1 in 3 racial prerequisite
cases heard

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.980
in the US federal courts
were of Syrians.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.610
Obviously this number far
exceeds the percentage of Syrians

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:34.760 position:56%
or even MENA's in the US population,

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.390
indicating that the racial
ascription of Syrians was

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.730
in question legally and
perhaps socially at the time.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.130
After the Syrian Christians white
racial ascription had been finally

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:49.540
determined in 1915, and
I'm going to go over these,

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.980
in overturning the
case of George Dow,

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.180
other cases popped up in the 1940s.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.410 position:56%
These were of 2 men who were Muslim.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.490
One, an Amen man whose petition
for naturalization was rejected.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.240
And one of a Saudi whose petition

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.160
to be naturalized in
the US was permitted.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.560
At issue in these cases
was not just race

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.960
and religion, as we will discover.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:26.110
According to Ian Hani Lopez, a
critical race and legal scholar,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.400
there are 4 main types
of arguments for

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.450
and against determining
whether the Syrians were white.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:36.950
Scientific evidence,
congressional intent,

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.920
common knowledge, and
legal precedent.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.430
The scientific evidence
claims were rooted

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:46.310
in racial development theories
that examine the biological origins

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.360
of the human and white race.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.530
Judges deliberated over and weighed
arguments over the differences

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.920
between white and Caucasian.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.290 position:56%
And in the case of Nojor and Madari,
Syrians were found to be Semites.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.680
Semites were Caucasian,
and Caucasians were white.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.160 position:56%
In the congressional intent
arguments, the intent of the authors

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.090
of the Naturalization
Act were examined.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.810
Since most free white
persons in 1790 were European,

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.310
the question revolved around
whether Syrians were qualified

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.750
to be free white persons
as Congress had attended

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.300
or whether common knowledge
of today dictated

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.300
that the Syrians were
or were not white.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.120
I will argue that there were
more significant factors

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.120
in determining the race of the
Syrians, and later the Arabians.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.610
Primary among these was a choice,
a strategy, to distance themselves

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:46.280
from Asian-ness, even though
Syria was technically located

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:51.160
in Western Asia, and to place
their origins closer to Europe.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.340
The mental geography of
this choice was a key

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.070
in establishing their
legal claims to whiteness.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:02.350
For the Syrians, there was also a
distancing from traits associated

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.450
with Islam that were believed
at the time to be unassailable

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:16.250
into the American polity, namely
polygamy and a Democratic mind.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.940
So there were alternative framings

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.840
for racial determinations,
in my analysis.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.100
In 1909, George Shishim, a
policeman in Venice, California,

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.550
arrested a young man for
disturbing the peace.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:33.320
The young man's father, a prominent
lawyer, challenged Shishim's right

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.170
to arrest his son on the
basis that Shishim was not

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.320
and could not be a US citizen.

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.860
Although Shishim had lived in
California for about 20 years,

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.280
his naturalization was in
question due to his origins

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.640
in the Ottoman Empire's
lands called Turkey, in Asia.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.690
Friends pulled their resources
and hired a lawyer, Byron Hanna,

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.970
a fellow countrymen,
to defend Shishim.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:02.660
As part of their case, they wrote
to academics and universities

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.900
to inquire about the ethnological
background of their ancestry,

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.950
and argued that Syrians
were Christians --

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.450
Syrians were Caucasian, sorry.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:14.770
In the final court hearing,
Shishim declared to the judge,

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:19.940
and I do love this quote, "If I
am Mongolian, then so was Jesus,

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.220 position:56%
because we came from the same land."

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:27.240
In fact, the way in which Shishim
articulated his origins claimed a

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.490
more authentic Christianity,
rooted in the land of the Bible.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.400
A Christianity that
was more authentic

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.860
than the judge's presumed
Christianity as a Protestant.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.480
This line of reasoning dovetailed
with the racial ideology in the US

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.530
that had hallmarked Jesus
as white at the time.

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.320
The judge dismissed religion as
a factor that determined race.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.860
But Shishim's declaration convinced
the judge that he was not Asian.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.610 position:56%
And he ruled that Shishim was white,

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.430
and therefore eligible
for citizenship.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:02.450
After the decision was read, George
Shishim took his oath of allegiance

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.990
to the United States
before he left the court.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:11.520
Despite this ruling, the
Bureau of Immigration

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.580
and Naturalization continued

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.690
to deny some Syrian
Americans US citizenship,

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.590
and naturalization therefore.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.780
Many of the legal arguments in
the early cases regarding the race

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.160
of Arab-Americans centered
on being from the holy land

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.490
and a practicing Christian of good
morals, sober, and industrious.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.850 position:56%
There's many legal cases about this.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.420
By indicating to the court
that they were Christians,

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.910
early Arab-Americans were
distancing themselves from Islam.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:42.200
This was a strategy based on the
negative image of Islam in the eyes

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:45.320
of immigration specialists
and judges

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.090
who were practically
concerned with the polygamy

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.370
and its associative immorality.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:55.710
In these cases, polygamy
was associated with Muslim,

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.600
and was considered unassailable.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.930
In fact, some Syrians had been
turned away at Ellis Island

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.640
and other ports of entry
because they were Muslim,

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.740
and therefore potentially
polygamists, regardless of whether

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.460
or not they were married.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.080
There's a story of a 15-year-old
boy who was turned away

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.610
because he was Muslim, because
he could become polygamist.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.040
These laws were originally
put on the books actually

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:24.690
to exclude Mormons, not
Muslims, in another note.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.810
In some ways I agree with the
legal scholar Khaled Beydoun

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.660
that there were clear cognitive
links made in these cases.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.000
He argues, Muslims were
presumed to be nonwhite,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.480
and Arabs were presumed
to be Muslims.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:41.670
Arabs were presumptively
ineligible for citizenship.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:46.030
There was a conflation
of Arab and Muslim,

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.910
a conflation that persists
today despite many efforts

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.150
at educating the public at large.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.620
In the 1910s, these petitioners,
Syrian Christians all of them,

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.660
did invoke their religion
to secure citizenship,

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:03.890
but they were often believed to not
be real Christians by the judges.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.440
This was due to the
presumption that every immigrant

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.950
from the Arab world was
Muslim, as Bethune argues.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:13.830
However, I maintain that
religion was not the legal proxy

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.490
for race, culture was.

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.470 position:56%
The perceived culture of the
immigrants and the perceived culture

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:23.530
of America in which the
immigrants were determined

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:27.100
to be assimilable or
not assimilable.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.440
These Christians, Eastern
Christians, if I may,

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.800
were presumed to be
culturally Muslim.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.520
They had come from an Islamic
empire and had customs similar

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.570
to their neighbors who
were and are today Muslim.

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:40.870
They were not considered

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:45.130
to be religio-culturally
American in their Christianity.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.310
Many of the Christians followed
Eastern rites and liturgies

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:52.020
in their services, forms of
worship that were unfamiliar

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.670
to Americans accustomed to
Latin, Roman Catholics services,

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.680
or English language
Protestant churches.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.370
Occasionally, as in
the case of Ellis,

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:06.160
the petitioner's sect were
referred to by the judges.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.450
Ellis was Maronite.

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:09.870
Even when they determined

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:13.880
that religion was not
a factor in the ruling.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.930
These cases persisted in coming up.

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:21.910
Costanozure and Ellis were ruled
to be white and were naturalized.

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:29.170
Until in 1913, Farez Shahid
was denied naturalization.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:34.050
After all these legal
precedents by fellows Syrians,

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:37.310
Syrian Christian countrymen,
why was Shahid's petition

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.000
for naturalization denied?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.910
Although the judge does state in
his ruling that he was a Christian,

00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:47.090
and that he is coming from
the very cradle of the Jewish

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:52.710 position:56%
and Christian religions, his
origins were in Zile, in Asia minor,

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:58.240
in Syria, and he uses the term
Asia minor here, and Syria.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.380
And the judge noted, he
writes his name in Arabic

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.330
but cannot read or write English.

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:09.850
Most significantly, he's accused
of potentially being a polygamist

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.120
and a disbeliever in
organized government.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:15.980
Because it seems he could
not understand the questions

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:20.130
which were posed in English,
this is my assessment.

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.190
These last 2 points are
substitutes for claiming

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.590
that he is Muslim by culture.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.550
Polygamy and a lack of
Democratic mind were 2 reasons

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:31.460
that Muslims were turned
away from Ellis Island.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.340
The judge even asks and answers,
what is the race or color

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.580
of the modern inhabitant of Syria.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.130
It is impossible to say.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.030
But then the judge reasoned
that complex history

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:48.440
and the Arabian Mahatma eruption,
and I'm not sure what he means

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:53.870
by that, has meant that the
race of Syrians is inconclusive.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:59.750
He wrote, one Syrian may be of pure
or almost pure Jewish, Turkish,

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:03.480
or Greek blood, and another,
the pureblooded descendent

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.720
of an Egyptian, an
Abyssinian, or a Sudanese.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.510
Presumably the former grouping
would be considered white,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:13.670
and the latter, nonwhite.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.750
Flummoxed, the judge rejected
Shahid's application based

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.320
on his own personal
disqualifications.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.670
Which I interpret to mean his
illiteracy but also his inability

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:31.560
to deny cultural traits
associated with Islam in English.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.690
Now, the final case was George Dow.

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.750
He was rejected for
naturalization twice,

00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:42.890
and in the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals was granted citizenship.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:45.680
In the first 2 petitions,
judge Smith stated

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:49.050
that although Dow was
Maronite, a Christian,

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.640
religion should not
be the basis for race.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:58.450 position:56%
His petition was denied by Judge
Smith twice because he was Asiactic,

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:03.310
and therefore not white, and so
not eligible for US citizenship.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:08.050
This geographic, continental
even, association was the focus

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:11.040
of the appeal case, and the
ruling that overturned Dow

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.750
and stopped the questioning
of the Syrian's whiteness.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.790
In Dow versus the United
States in 1915,

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:22.090
the judge ruled certain Asiatics
near the Mediterranean Sea,

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:26.500
including Syrians, were
generally classed as white people.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.270
Their physical attributes tipped
the scale on not being Asian.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:34.440
Listen to the judge's
reasoning in this case.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.650
Physically, the modern
Syrians are of mixed Syrian,

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.780
Arabian, and even Jewish blood.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:43.000
They belong to the Semitic
branch of the Caucasian race,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.050
thus widely differing from
their rulers, the Turks,

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.090
who were in origin Mongolian.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.860
The Syrians did not look Asian and
so were not classified as Asian,

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.740
and this is in the
American mind, right.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.790
And were therefore
considered white by default.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.520
It's as if white was the
leftover bucket category

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.830
when one deducted black,
Native American, and Asian.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:10.880
The sheer number of cases in
proportion to their population

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.370
in the US indicates that Syrian
whiteness was not a slam-dunk

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.920
race categorization.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.610
This was highlighted, once
again, in the second set of cases

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.870
that I mentioned in the
introduction, in 1942,

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.760
when a Yemeni man petitioned
for his right to naturalize

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.550
and become a US citizen

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:36.120
and was rejected again while his
religion was not on trial, per se,

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.150
his geographic religious
origins were.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.050
Listen closely again
to the judge's words.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.630
Apart from the dark
skin of the Arabs,

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:49.570
so this typical association
here, apart from the dark skin

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.040
of the Arabs, it was well
known that they are part

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.120
of the Mohammedan world, and that
a wide gulf separates their culture

00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.620
from that of the predominantly
Christian peoples of Europe.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.930 position:56%
It was a cultural and civilizational
divide that made Afan Hassan

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:07.640
of Detroit, Michigan, nonwhite.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.380
The judge wrote, the court finds
that the petitioner is an Arab,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:15.590 position:56%
and that Arabs are not white persons
within the meaning of the act.

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:21.230 position:56%
Not only are Arab, Muslim, and
nonwhite intertwined in this ruling,

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:26.370
but also the binary of Christian
West and Islamic East looms large.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:30.650
The ruling was overturned when
a Saudi man, Mohamed Maharez,

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:34.510
was granted naturalization in 1944.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:39.450
The judge wrote, the Arab
passes muster as a white person.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:42.240
And reflected that the
rigid exclusion of persons

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.740
of Chinese nationality and of the
yellow race, and this is his term,

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:49.930
went against our vital
interests as a world power

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.970
and of a democratic liberalism.

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.210
It was clear from the
racial ruling in this case,

00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:59.200
which cemented all
peoples from MENA as white,

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.260
that global politics played a role.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.110
And that specifically there was
a desire, this in the ruling,

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:09.490
to promote friendlier relations
between the United States

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:14.260
and other nations,
specifically Saudi Arabia,

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:17.140
in this case in the early '40s.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.890
Just prior to that moment in 1933,

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:24.120
the Arabian American oil company
now had brought together the US

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:28.110
and Saudi interests in drilling
for oil in the Arabian Peninsula.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:34.290
The fact that there were racial
prerequisite cases for MENA's

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:39.200 position:56%
until 1944 indicates that the racial
classification, almost to the end

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:45.880
of the Naturalization era
in 1952, were significant.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:54.970
In 1952, the Immigration and
Naturalization Act was passed,

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:59.520
thus ending the Naturalization era.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.730
This presentation works towards
answering why and how the Syrians,

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:10.330 position:56%
and later Arabians, came to be white
by race in the 1977 OMB ruling.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:13.260
The placement of MENA's
and the ordering of races

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.030
and their associative geographies
was complicated and contested

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:19.490
in the Naturalization era.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:28.790
At the turn-of-the-century, there
were considered as from Turkey

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:32.490 position:56%
and Asia or Turkey in brackets Asia.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.660
And through the court cases,
they were determined not

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.750
to be Asiatic or Mongolian.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.200
This led them away from the
constraints of Asian exclusion laws

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.920
but towards the appellation
of a province, Syria,

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.140
that would shortly break
up into colonial states

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.700
with the end of the Ottoman Empire.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:55.760 position:56%
Later, this would be re-grouped into
a new geographic label, Middle East

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.800
and North Africa, and was
included with Europeans

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.990
in the broad white racial category.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:08.910
Religion and race are not
always intertwined in reality.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:10.510
Immigrants and their descendants

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.350
from the region have
been characterized

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:16.880
by Islamic culture civilization.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.020
Historically, the majority of
these immigrants were Christian.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.070
And there continues to be
large percentages of Christians

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:28.820 position:56%
in the immigrant populations from
Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Palestine.

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:32.230
I estimate that approximately
half, or possibly more,

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:36.180
of the MENA population in
the US today is Christian.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.700 position:56%
This includes many Christian
groups, including Chadians, Syrians,

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.750
Maronites, Orthodox, and others.

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:45.730
The historical and ongoing
conflation of Arab and Muslim,

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:52.340
and MENA and Muslim, is inaccurate,
and perhaps especially in the US.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.180
If there is a MENA category in the
2020 census, care must be taken not

00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:01.140
to typify this category
as most Muslim.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.960 position:56%
While population figures on
religious identity are not tabulated

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.120
by federal agencies, official
classifications, have historically

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.540
and continue to, count more
than race for MENA Americans.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.830
While nativity is no longer
collected by the census,

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:21.630
national origins are tabulated
in naturalization statistics.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.900
The American community
survey administered annually

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.750
by the US Census Bureau
tabulates both language spoken

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.880
at home and ancestry.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.720
These indicators are important
to better understand the needs

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.190
of the MENA populations
and remain ways

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:38.710 position:56%
in which identities alternatively
formed through subnational groupings

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:43.910
and even colloquial dialects
that are increasingly written

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.460
in fiction and in literature more.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.420 position:56%
These changes, however, are not new,

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.460
and many of these lessons can be
learned from historical research.

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:55.510
Thank you.

00:43:55.510 --> 00:44:01.040
[ Applause ]

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Dr. Randa.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.690
We not have a few minutes
for questions and answers.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.180
Just a quick note to the audience,
this program is being recorded,

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:14.130
so while we encourage your
participation, by asking questions,

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.460
you are consenting to you
having your voice recorded

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.760
in later webcasts.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.780
&gt;&gt; I hope it was scintillating.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.580
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:39.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.740
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if I can answer it.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:44.750
The question was, in 1977,
what was the situation

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.510
with the Census Bureau before that,

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:50.100
and then why was race
classified that way.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:56.100
I mean, my whole talk is sort of
preparing us to understand why

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.800
in 1977, it was included like that.

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.800
There was that shift by
the Syrians at first,

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.710
and then even in the later cases
as well, to classify Middle East

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:13.360
and North African with
white, with Europeans.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.870
And I think that was a strategy.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:21.570
I'm not sure how the Census
Bureau calculated it before.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:25.670
I know in 1960, it turned
to self-enumeration,

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:28.670
so you didn't have an enumerator,
unless you didn't fill it out.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:33.440
Come by and like fill it out for
you, which you did before 1960.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.190
So there was a switch in
terms of empowering people

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:39.400
to answer how they self-identified.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:46.220
And I believe in 1970, it was
still the case that Syrians

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:50.620
or MENA's were classified as
white, because in the 1910 census,

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.810
they were classified
as foreign-born white.

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:57.860
So I would assume that in
1970, that was true as well.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.740
But as I argue in this
paper, there's other ways

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:04.610
in which ethnicity
is accessed, right.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:07.340
So through ancestry
questions, language spoken.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.510
Yes?

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:49.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.050
Okay, the first question is, what
were the numbers in this period

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.410
that we we're looking at.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.730
And this is really the only
piece that we really have,

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.280
that I put up on the screen,
in terms of the numbers.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.180
There are some estimates that
think this is a little bit wrong,

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:10.620
and it's about 220,000 in the
1920s, but that's about it.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.950
So in 1924, there was a law passed
that restricted immigration.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:21.330
So these numbers, the Syrians were
given quotas, it's a longer story,

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.650
and so only 100 were
allowed to come in per year

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:27.470
if it wasn't a family
reunification issue.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.920 position:56%
That doesn't mean that there weren't
more, because there were people

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.070
that were able to sponsor
other family members

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:33.590
through family reunification.

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:39.350
But in terms of new immigrants,
only 100 a year after 1924.

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:43.740
So this number wouldn't
have grown exponentially.

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:48.670
So I would say about 220,000.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.570
In terms of your question
about how did the English

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.670
and French categorize immigrants,

00:47:54.670 --> 00:48:00.280 position:56%
I'm not sure if they really
calculated that they were immigrants

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.850
within an "E" right, from
the colonial territories

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:06.150
that they administered.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:12.510
So in particular France had
control over Lebanon, Syria,

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.910
and the British had control over
Iraq, Palestine, and Jordan,

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:19.900
as they were called
at or Transjordan.

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:25.900
And I'm not sure what
they would've calculated,

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.310
but they definitely
would've preferred probably

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.070
for people not to leave.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.690
So they may not have made
those figures official.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:40.830
But that's something that I
could research a bit more.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.760
Thank you, Dominick.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.560
Yes, Mary Jane?

00:48:44.560 --> 00:49:30.050
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:33.560
So the question is, was religion
an issue for non-MENA peoples,

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.460
and the answer would
be yes in total.

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.420
I mean, it depended on what
religion we're talking about,

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:45.660
but religion was pretty much a
very prominent concern for people.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.030
This is a quite xenophobic
era that I'm talking about,

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:54.170
sort of 1890 to about 1920,
1925, it was really a moment

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.520
that the US was very concerned
about other religions.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:03.400
So for example, the Chinese
Exclusion Act definitely had to do

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.930
with believing them to
be Confusion, right.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.300 position:56%
So you know, there was that concern.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.440
There was also religions
within the US

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.050
that were a concern
to sort of xenophobic.

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:17.650
So like I said, the polygamist
law was passed in 1892,

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:22.770
and it was against Mormons who
were coming in through Mexico.

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:26.260
So and it was to bar them
from entering the US.

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.700
So I mean, if you take this sort
of writ large, there were concerns,

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:34.490
there were strong concerns against
Catholics, even, from Italy,

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:38.930
and from Ireland, even though at
that point the Irish had lived

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.410
in the US for a longer time.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:45.940
And from Eastern Europe, you have
Slavs, some of whom are Muslim,

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.540
some of whom are Eastern Orthodox.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:51.740
All, even the Eastern Orthodox,
and that's what sort of interesting

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.400
to me when I'm reading this,
were really considered outsiders.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:02.800
That there was a fear of Eastern
Orthodox, not to the extent maybe

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:09.070
of Muslims, but there were fears
that a WASP nation was changing.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:13.210
So the quotas that I was just
mentioning that were enacted,

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:19.740
were based on the 1890 census,
which is a long time before 1924.

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:21.970
And the reason that they
were picking that is

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:27.810 position:56%
because the Congress wanted the type
of immigrants that came in in 1890,

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:31.560
who were traditionally
Western Northern Europeans.

00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:36.360
So that plays into your question
about religion, because, in fact,

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.980
religion was a factor in excluding
people, and particularly Asians.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:43.870
I mean, I think that although
I'm looking at MENA's,

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.890
Asians really had it really rough.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:49.190
In the back?

00:51:50.510 --> 00:52:30.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.600
So the question is, how did the
Armenian racial prerequisite cases,

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:40.320
the one in 1920, impact the
racial classifications of Syrians.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:45.520
And they did borrow a little
bit from the Armenian success.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.020
So there were 2 cases,
one was earlier

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.890
and then one was in the 1920s.

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:52.980
And the Armenians were
very successful, right,

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:55.700
in not having it come back.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:59.780
So they petitioned, and they
were granted naturalization,

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.550
and they became US citizens
through these cases.

00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:05.410
And it is similar to the MENA
cases that I'm looking at,

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:07.300 position:56%
particularly Syrian Christian cases.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.350
Because once again, their
Christianity is not sort

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.390
of accepted as being the norm.

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:15.760
And the norm meaning a Protestant,

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.510
a vague Protestant norm,
a WASP type of norm.

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:24.120
And so as Eastern Christians,

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:27.090
they also faced discrimination
on the same basis.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.550
I believe they used the
same anthropologists.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:35.730
So the anthropologists would go in
and look at where the peoples were

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.290
and how that related to
the Caucus Mountains.

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:42.850
So that actually kind of served
the Armenians quite well, right.

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:46.340
But there was also this
proximity to the Caucus Mountains

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:50.560
that was also used,
especially in the earlier cases,

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.620
where biological origins
were emphasized more.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.420
Yes?

00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:07.330
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:11.690
The question is, how do I classify
polygamy as cultural or religious.

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:16.960
I mean, I actually believe it's
more cultural, not because --

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.800
for a few reasons, I'll explain.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.010
There is no cases where
there was actually a Muslim

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.220
who was polygamist, right.

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:28.760
So it's not the reality of being
polygamist, it was the concept

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.960
that Muslims could be polygamist,

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.250
because the religion
permitted up to 4 wives.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:36.170
Well, this was the argument.

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:40.060
And so I believe that it wasn't
the practice of religion,

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.050
I believe it was the
perception of religion.

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:47.330
And that's why I consider
it more cultural.

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:52.330
Now, they can go back to the Koran
and say, oh, but it says this.

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:56.380
It's based on a religious
tenant, but there were no cases

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.460
where there really was a
Muslim who was polygamist,

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:03.340
who was turned away, right.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.960
So that's why I sort of think it's
the way in which Islam was viewed

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:15.510
from the outside, rather than
experienced within the US.

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:31.150
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:35.670
The question was, is there
research done between the Columbus

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:39.140
and the 1876 Philadelphia
World's Fair Exhibition.

00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.440
There is some.

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.520
There's a recent book by I think
it's Laila Latamee [assumed

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:49.050
spelling], and I forget the title
now, on Zamora, who was a slave,

00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:50.350
who was brought as a slave

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:53.550
from North Africa, but
a very educated man.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.100
And I haven't read the book yet.

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:58.070
But there's not that much
research, I have to say.

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:03.240
The closest the only book that
really has anything from this

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.590
in it is, Adell Unisys [assumed
spelling] book, which is listed

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:10.600
as the last reference here.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.240
And it would only be
the first chapter or 2.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.580
I would be very interested

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.690
in reading something
that was on that period.

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:20.650
Because what it does is it
emphasizes the North African,

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:23.710
which is something that's
missing from the literature,

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:29.630
and the experience of slaves, which
is part of the experience of MENA's

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:33.840
in America, if we take it
a bit more holistically.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.430
So yeah, that would be interesting.

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.230
Yes?

00:56:38.230 --> 00:57:22.050
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:28.730
So the question is, is MENA
too broad, right, sort of.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:33.320
I mean, I think that race
is problematic, anyway.

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.110
So I think all of them
are too broad,

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:38.120
if you want my honest
opinion, you know.

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:43.160
So I mean, there are plans
to have categorizations

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.830
that are underneath MENA, so
especially with technology,

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:50.910
you can add in Arab or you can
add in Armenian from Lebanon,

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:52.630
you can add in whatever you want.

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:57.010
And I think that that's an
important factor in showing

00:57:57.010 --> 00:58:02.250
that there is sub-identities
after checking a box

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:03.550
or not checking a box, right.

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:07.060
And that's going to be the same
for whites, so you can check white

00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:12.510
and put in Lebanese if
you wanted or Armenian.

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:30.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.600
The question is, is religion
included in the census,

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.930
and is it included in
the immigration records.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:40.530
So in the immigration records,
no, it is not included.

00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:45.430
Although the immigration officers
could ask, right, they could ask.

00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:56.180
But we don't have it written
down, we don't know what was said.

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:59.400
[inaudible] Well, they would
ask in the question like,

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:02.360
where are you from and where
are your papers from, right.

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:06.370
So the papers would be from
the Ottoman Empire, right,

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:08.030
or they wouldn't have papers.

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:11.410
And actually what's interesting,
just as British subjects had

00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:18.010
to swear that they no longer had an
allegiance to the British monarchy,

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:20.120
the Ottoman subjects, when
they became naturalized,

00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:24.740
had to swear that they did not have
allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan.

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.860
But they would just cross out
British and they would put

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:29.590
in Ottoman, I mean, it
wasn't a special form.

00:59:29.590 --> 00:59:32.740 position:56%
So that shows that there's probably
not enough to create a special form.

00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.280
But I think that that's sort
of an interesting anecdote

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.490
in terms of becoming naturalized.

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:44.780
And in the census, there is
some tracking of religion

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:51.420
until World War II, when it ceases.

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:55.920
Any more questions?
