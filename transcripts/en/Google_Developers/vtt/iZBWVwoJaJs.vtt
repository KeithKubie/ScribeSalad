IT'S A HUGE HELP WHEN YOU'RE
 STARTING OUT.  SO AS STEPH CAN

01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:55.975
 ATTEST, I CAN LITERALLY SET FOR
 THREE HOURS AND TELL YOU ALL 

01:01:55.976 --> 01:01:57.886
THE
 THINGS I LOVE ABOUT KOTLIN.  WE

01:01:57.887 --> 01:02:00.117
 DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THEM. 
 INSTEAD I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM

01:02:00.118 --> 01:02:02.339
 ALL TO COME TO OUR EXCELLENT
 TALKS ON FRIDAY WHERE YOU LEARN

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:05.068
 EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO
 GET STARTED WITH KOTLIN.  I

FOR US ON ANDROID, ADDING  

01:02:15.057 --> 01:02:18.448
KOTLIN
FEELS LIKE A MOMENT IN  HISTORY.

01:02:18.449 --> 01:02:21.245
WE'RE EXCITED TODAY.  IT'S  JUST
THE BEGINNING, THOUGH.   WE'RE

01:02:21.611 --> 01:02:24.497
EVEN MORE EXCITED ABOUT  THE
POSSIBILITIES THAT KOTLIN 

01:02:24.498 --> 01:02:28.343
CREATES FOR THE FUTURE.
BUT THERE'S MORE.

01:02:28.604 --> 01:02:31.341
OUR SECOND THEME IS MAKING 
DEVELOPMENT FASTER AND EASIER 

01:02:31.699 --> 01:02:35.306
WITH OUR TOOLS AND LIBRARIES.
ANDROID STUDIO'S OUR OFFICIAL

SO LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO A  DEMO.

01:02:55.338 --> 01:03:00.353
THIS IS MORE FUN.
ALL RIGHT.  SO HERE I HAVE 

01:03:00.354 --> 01:03:04.719

JUST BUILT AND DEPLOYED MY  APP.

01:03:11.306 --> 01:03:14.720
SO I'M JUST GOING TO OPEN THE 
APP.

01:03:15.832 --> 01:03:18.417
AND LET ME DO A LITTLE BIT OF 
NETWORK HERE SO YOU CAN SEE  IT

01:03:18.418 --> 01:03:22.831
ON THE GRAPH.
WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THE  NETWORK

01:03:23.137 --> 01:03:26.087

THAT YOU CAN SEE  ALL OF THE

01:03:26.088 --> 01:03:27.511
REQUESTS.  BUT  PARTICULARLY 
COOL

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:31.978
WOULD BE IF  YOU COULD CLICK AND
SEE THE  ACTUAL PAYLOAD OF THE 

01:03:32.535 --> 01:03:33.714
REQUEST.
EVEN BETTER THAN THAT WOULD  BE

01:03:33.715 --> 01:03:37.231
IF YOU COULD LOOK AND SEE  THE
HEADERS.  BUT I ACTUALLY  THINK

01:03:37.485 --> 01:03:40.120
IT WOULD BE VERY COOL  IF YOU
COULD CLICK ON THE  CALL STACK

01:03:41.075 --> 01:03:43.668
AND SELECT AND GO  TO THE LINE 
OF

 THE ASSISTANT'S REACH TO MORE
 SURFACES, THE DEVELOPER

01:11:14.666 --> 01:11:18.693
 PLATFORM WILL FOLLOW.
 WITH APPS FOR THE ASSISTANT

01:11:18.694 --> 01:11:21.824
 NOW AVAILABLE ON THE PHONE,
 YOU'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:11:21.825 --> 01:11:25.039
 TO GROW YOUR USER BASE, BUT
 MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU'LL BE

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.682
 ABLE TO BUILD APPS FOR
 ENTIRELY NEW ASSISTIVE USE

01:11:30.683 --> 01:11:33.214
 CASES, THINGS THAT PREVIOUSLY
 WEREN'T WELL SUITED TO A

01:11:33.215 --> 01:11:36.645
 VOICE-ONLY INTERFACE, SUCH AS
 SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES OR

01:11:36.646 --> 01:11:39.550
 ORDERING FOOD FROM A LENGTHY
 MENU.

01:11:39.551 --> 01:11:43.572
 IN ADDITION, WITH OUR NEW UI
 ELEMENTS SUCH AS IMAGE

01:11:43.573 --> 01:11:46.803
 CAROUSELS, LISTS, AND
 SUGGESTION CHIPS, USERS CAN

01:11:46.804 --> 01:11:51.226
 EASILY GET THINGS DONE WITH
 YOUR APP.  THEY CAN

01:11:51.227 --> 01:11:54.260
 SEAMLESSLY TRANSITION BETWEEN
 VOICE, TYPING, AND TAPS, ALL

01:11:54.261 --> 01:11:59.793
 IN THE SAME CONVERSATION.
 YOU CAN BUILD AND DEPLOY APPS

01:11:59.794 --> 01:12:03.912
 FOR THE ASSISTANT ON THE
 PHONE STARTING TODAY.

01:12:03.913 --> 01:12:07.245
 [ CHEERING ]
 THANK YOU.

01:12:07.246 --> 01:12:10.058
 WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT EASY
 TO COMPLETE PURCHASES THROUGH

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:13.996
 THE ASSISTANT TO HELP YOU
 GROW YOUR BUSINESS.  WE

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.907
 DESIGNED THE TRANSACTION
 EXPERIENCE ON THE ASSISTANT

01:12:15.908 --> 01:12:20.132
 TO BE EASY AND LIGHTWEIGHT
 FOR USERS AND DEVELOPERS

01:12:20.133 --> 01:12:22.635
 ALIKE.
 YOU HEARD ABOUT TRANSACTIONS

01:12:22.636 --> 01:12:27.409
 THIS MORNING FROM VALERIE,
 BUT LET ME EXPAND A LITTLE

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:30.805
 BIT FROM A DEVELOPER POINT OF
 VIEW.

01:12:30.806 --> 01:12:34.928
 FOR PAYMENTS, YOU CAN CHOOSE
 TO USE GOOGLE-FACILITATED

01:12:34.929 --> 01:12:37.950
 PAYMENTS WHICH ARE EASY TO
 INTEGRATE, ALLOW YOU TO

01:12:37.951 --> 01:12:40.663
 LEVERAGE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS
 OF CARDS THAT USERS HAVE

01:12:40.664 --> 01:12:43.892
 ALREADY STORED WITH GOOGLE,
 AND ARE AVAILABLE TO

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:50.231
 DEVELOPERS FOR FREE.
 OR YOU CAN CHOOSE TO USE A

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:53.155
 PAYMENT METHOD THAT USERS
 HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED YOU. 

01:12:53.156 --> 01:12:57.703
 TO DO SO, WE RECOMMEND USING
 OUR NEW SEAMLESS ACCOUNT

01:12:57.704 --> 01:13:00.709
 LINKING SUPPORT.  THAT ALLOWS
 USERS TO SIGN IN TO AN

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:05.139
 EXISTING ACCOUNT OR EVEN
 CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT IN JUST

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.140
 TWO

01:13:08.257 --> 01:13:10.875
 TAPS.
 HOWEVER, THE TRANSACTION

01:13:10.876 --> 01:13:13.790
 ISN'T OVER WHEN THE USER
 PAYS.  USERS MAY WANT TO

01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:16.413
 CHECK ON THE STATUS OF AN
 ORDER, MODIFY AN ORDER, OR

01:13:16.414 --> 01:13:20.341
 EVEN RE-ORDER AN ITEM. 
 THAT'S WHY THE ASSISTANT NOW

01:13:20.342 --> 01:13:24.272
 ALLOWS USERS TO SEE ALL THEIR
 TRANSACTIONS IN A SINGLE

01:13:24.273 --> 01:13:31.107
 HISTORY VIEW.
 FINALLY, WE BUILT A NEW

01:13:31.108 --> 01:13:37.154
 ORDERS-UPDATE FEATURE TO
 ALLOW USERS TO MAKE IT EASIER

01:13:37.155 --> 01:13:43.290
 TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR APP.  YOU
 ARE NOW ABLE TO SEND STATUS

01:13:43.291 --> 01:13:46.826
 UPDATES ASYNCHRONOUSLY FOR
 EXAMPLE WHEN THEIR CAR

01:13:46.827 --> 01:13:50.943
 ARRIVES OR A PRESCRIPTION IS
 READY.   YOU CAN BUILD AND

01:13:50.944 --> 01:13:54.479
 TEST TRANSACTIONAL APPS TODAY
 AND THEY'LL BE AVAILABLE TO

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.381
 GOOGLE ASSISTANT USERS ON THE
 PHONE SOON.

01:13:56.382 --> 01:14:00.709
 BUT WHAT GOOD ARE THESE
 TRANSACTIONAL FEATURES IF

01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:03.543
 USERS CAN'T DISCOVER YOUR
 APP?

01:14:03.544 --> 01:14:06.963
 TODAY WE'RE ROLLING OUT A NEW
 APP DIRECTORY.  USERS CAN

01:14:06.964 --> 01:14:11.184
 ACCESS IT WITH A SINGLE TAP
 FROM THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT. 

01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:14.623
 IT NOT ONLY HAS CATEGORIES
 AND USER RATINGS, IT ALSO

01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:19.245
 ALLOWS USERS TO TRY YOUR APP
 RIGHT FROM THE DIRECTORY

01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:21.054
 PAGE.
 USERS CAN ALSO CREATE A

01:14:21.055 --> 01:14:24.988
 SHORTCUT TO YOUR APP FOR AN
 EASY WAY TO INVOKE IT.  FOR

01:14:24.989 --> 01:14:28.913
 EXAMPLE, INSTEAD OF SAYING, 
SAYING,

01:14:28.914 --> 01:14:31.649
 "OKAY, GOOGLE, ASK FORE
 CASTER JOE WHAT ELSE THE SURF

01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:35.664
 REPORT FOR THE OUTER BANKS,"
 YOU CAN JUST SAY YOUR

01:14:35.665 --> 01:14:39.499
 SHORTCUT, "OKAY, GOOGLE, IS
 THE SURF UP?"

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.110
 EACH APP'S DIRECTORY PAGE IS
 ALSO SHAREABLE ON THE WEB SO

01:14:42.111 --> 01:14:44.525
 THAT YOU CAN PROMOTE YOUR APP
 TO NEW USERS AND YOUR

01:14:44.526 --> 01:14:49.258
 EXISTING USERS CAN SHARE IT
 WITH THEIR FRIENDS.

01:14:49.259 --> 01:14:52.883
 AND TO MAKE FINDING YOUR APP
 EASIER, THE ASSISTANT IS ALSO

01:14:52.884 --> 01:14:55.402
 LEARNING FROM THE DIRECTORY
 AND OTHER INFORMATION

01:14:55.403 --> 01:14:59.930
 PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER.
 THANKS TO THESE ADDITIONAL

01:14:59.931 --> 01:15:03.261
 SIGNALS, THE ASSISTANT CAN
 OFTEN PRESENT USERS WITH A

01:15:03.262 --> 01:15:06.778
 FEW DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR
 GENERAL REQUESTS LIKE, "PLAY

01:15:06.779 --> 01:15:10.718
 A GAME."
 WHILE WE'RE CONFIDENT THESE

01:15:10.719 --> 01:15:13.528
 FEATURES WILL HELP IMPROVE
 DISCOVERABILITY OF YOUR APPS,

01:15:13.529 --> 01:15:18.168
 OUR WORK IS NOT DONE. 
 IMPROVING DISCOVERABILITY IS

01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:22.489
 IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US, AND
 YOU CAN EXPECT ONGOING

01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:26.326

 PREBUILT AGENTS, AND
 IN-DIALOGUE ANALYTICS.

01:16:28.155 --> 01:16:32.183
 WHILE WE'RE STILL AT THE
 EARLY DAYS OF THE ACTIONS ON

01:16:32.184 --> 01:16:34.791
 GOOGLE PLATFORM, WE'RE
 FOCUSED ON MAKING IT ROBUST

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:37.920
 AND EXPANDING ITS REACH AND
 CAPABILITIES.  WE'RE SOON

 LEARNING AT GOOGLE CLOUD.
 WHAT AN EXCITING DAY.

01:17:46.201 --> 01:17:50.329
 I'VE BEEN DOING AI RESEARCH
 FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES, AND I

01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:54.352
 CAN HONESTLY SAY THESE LAST
 FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN THE MOST

01:17:54.353 --> 01:18:01.461
 EXCITING OF MY ENTIRE CAREER.
 AI IS TRANSFORMING EVERYTHING

01:18:01.462 --> 01:18:06.322
 GOOGLE DOES.  AND AS WE
 SPEAK, INDUSTRIES FROM

01:18:06.323 --> 01:18:11.563
 FINANCE TO HEALTHCARE ARE
 AUGMENTING HUMAN CAPABILITIES

01:18:11.564 --> 01:18:17.493
 WITH MACHINE INSIGHTS.
 BUT BUILDING AI EXPERTISE IS

01:18:17.494 --> 01:18:22.933
 A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT, AND
 WE KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU

01:18:22.934 --> 01:18:26.160
 SIMPLY HAVEN'T HAD THE
 OPPORTUNITY.

01:18:26.161 --> 01:18:32.087
 I JOINED GOOGLE PRECISELY FOR
 THIS REASON, TO ENSURE THAT

01:18:32.088 --> 01:18:36.826
 EVERYONE CAN LEVERAGE AI TO
 STAY COMPETITIVE AND SOLVE

01:18:36.827 --> 01:18:40.548

 CHROME TEAM AND I'M EXCITED TO
 TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE 

01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:20.400
GREAT
 IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE MADE ON THE

01:25:20.401 --> 01:25:21.622
 WEB OVER THE LAST YEAR.  THE 
WEB

01:25:21.623 --> 01:25:24.948
 IS BIG.  WITH OVER 2 BILLION
 INSTANCES OF CHROME, WE KNOW

01:25:24.949 --> 01:25:28.880
 THAT THE WEB HAS TREMENDOUS
 REACH.  BUT ONE OF THE REAL

01:25:28.881 --> 01:25:31.982
 STRENGTHS OF THE WEB IS THAT
 IT'S BIGGER THAN A SINGLE

01:25:31.983 --> 01:25:35.642
 BROWSERS.
 BROWSER.  VARIOUS ESTIMATES 

01:25:35.643 --> 01:25:37.261
SHOW
 THAT THERE ARE WELL OVER

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:39.496
 5 BILLION ACTIVELY USED 
DEVICES,

01:25:39.497 --> 01:25:42.918
 AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT
 DEVICE IS A SMARTPHONE OR A

01:25:42.919 --> 01:25:45.540
 LAPTOP OR A DESKTOP OR A 
TABLET,

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:50.604
 THEY ALL HAVE A BROWSER.  AND
 THAT MEANS THAT ANY WEB APP IS

01:25:50.605 --> 01:25:54.637
 AVAILABLE ON THESE BILLIONS OF
 DEVICES TODAY.  AND WE'VE SEEN

01:25:54.638 --> 01:25:58.980
 THIS HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON HOW
 MANY USERS WEB APPS ARE

01:25:58.981 --> 01:26:00.292
 REACHING.
 WEAVES ALL SEEN HOW QUICKLY

01:26:00.293 --> 01:26:04.322
 MOBILE HAS BEEN GROWING.  AND
 NATIVE APPS HAVE BEEN GROWING 

01:26:04.323 --> 01:26:05.744
AT
 A TREMENDOUS PACE WITH IT.  BUT

01:26:05.745 --> 01:26:06.952
 WHAT'S REALLY REMARKABLE IS 
THAT

01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:10.384
 EVEN WITH THE WEB'S LARGE
 INITIAL REACH, WE'VE SEEN THE

01:26:10.385 --> 01:26:14.236
 AVERAGE MONTHLY WEB AUDIENCE
 GROWING EVEN FASTER.  AND

01:26:14.237 --> 01:26:17.966
 BECAUSE OF THIS GROWTH, WE'RE
 SEEING THE WEB EXPAND INTO NEW

01:26:17.967 --> 01:26:22.516
 AREAS WITH EXPERIENCES LIKE
 WEBVR BEING BUILT ON THE WEB

01:26:22.517 --> 01:26:23.620
 PLATFORM.  AND THE WEB 
CONTINUES

01:26:23.621 --> 01:26:27.764
 TO POP UP IN MORE AND MORE
 PLACES.  EVEN SOME WE DIDN'T

01:26:27.765 --> 01:26:30.489
 REALLY EXPECT.
 A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO McDONALD

01:26:31.705 --> 01:26:34.626
 McDONALD'S ANNOUNCED THAT THEY
 USED THE WEB AND POLYMER TO

01:26:34.627 --> 01:26:37.652
 BUILD THEIR NEW MENU BOARDS. 
 NOW WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE

01:26:37.653 --> 01:26:40.685
 MENU AT McDONALD'S, THAT'S
 BUILT ON THE WEB AS WELL.  SO

01:26:40.686 --> 01:26:43.326
 WITH THE WEB PRETTY MUCH
 EVERYWHERE, WE ARE CONSTANTLY

01:26:43.327 --> 01:26:44.729
 TRYING TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES 
OF

01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:47.058
 WHAT IT CAN DO.
 IF YOU LOOK AT ALL OF OUR

01:26:47.059 --> 01:26:51.301
 LAUNCHES SINCE LAST YEAR'S I/O,
 WE'VE SHIPPED 215 ADDITIONAL

01:26:51.302 --> 01:26:55.238
 APIs THAT COVER A RANGE OF
 CAPABILITIES, FROM MAKING IT

01:26:55.239 --> 01:26:58.165
 EASIER TO INTEGRATE PAYMENTS
 INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE, TO MAKING

01:26:58.166 --> 01:27:02.002
 IT POSSIBLE TO BUILD FULLY
 CAPABLE OFFLINE MEDIA

01:27:02.003 --> 01:27:03.825
 EXPERIENCES DIRECTLY ON THE 
WEB.

01:27:03.826 --> 01:27:06.355
 AND WITH ALL OF THESE NEW
 CAPABILITIES, WE'VE SEEN A

01:27:06.356 --> 01:27:11.090
 MASSIVE GROWTH IN EXPERIENCES
 BUILT ON THE WEB.  ACCELERATED

01:27:11.091 --> 01:27:17.766
 MOBILE PAGES OR AMP PAGES MAKE
 IT REALLY EASY FOR PUBLISHERS 

01:27:17.767 --> 01:27:19.470
TO
 CREATE FAST ARTICLES.  SINCE

01:27:19.471 --> 01:27:21.499
 LAUNCH WE'VE SEEN THIS GROW 
FROM

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:26.763
 OVER 2 BILLION AMP PAGES FROM
 ACROSS 900,000 DOMAINS.  BEYOND

01:27:26.764 --> 01:27:28.477
 AMP PAGES, THE MODERN MOBILE 
WEB

01:27:28.478 --> 01:27:31.719
 ALSO ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO BUILD
 DEEP, RICH MOBILE EXPERIENCES

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.995
 WITH SOMETHING WE CALLED
 PROGRESSIVE WEB APPs OR PWA.

01:27:38.093 --> 01:27:43.011
 PWAs.  PWAs ARE ABOUT
 HELPING DEVELOPERS LEVERAGE

01:27:43.012 --> 01:27:45.951
 BUILD HIGH-CLASS EXPERIENCES
 THAT FEEL IMMERSIVE.  THEY CAN

01:27:45.952 --> 01:27:49.578
 LOAD QUICKLY AND WORK OFFLINE
 AND CAN EVEN SEND NOTIFICATIONS

01:27:49.579 --> 01:27:52.514
 TO USERS.  WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER
 OF AMAZING EXPERIENCES TAKING

01:27:52.515 --> 01:27:55.036
 ADVANTAGES OF THESE NEW
 CAPABILITIES.  AS JUST ONE

01:27:55.037 --> 01:27:58.477
 EXAMPLE, THERE'S TWITTER WHO
 RECENTLY REBUILT THEIR MOBILE

01:27:58.478 --> 01:28:02.852
 WEB EXPERIENCE.  HERE THEY HAVE
 A POLISHED, FAST, IMMERSIVE

01:28:02.853 --> 01:28:06.675
 EXPERIENCE THAT WORKS ON ANY
 CONNECTION TYPE.  AND IT CAN

01:28:06.676 --> 01:28:09.180
 SEND USERS NOTIFICATIONS AND
 IT'S COMPLETELY BUILT ON THE

01:28:09.181 --> 01:28:12.215
 MOBILE WEB, SO IT'S ALREADY
 ACCESSIBLE ON BILLIONS OF

01:28:12.216 --> 01:28:15.973
 DEVICES.
 AND WITH AN IMMERSIVE 

01:28:15.974 --> 01:28:17.460
EXPERIENCE
 LIKE THIS, WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

01:28:17.461 --> 01:28:22.009
 SURE THAT USERS CAN GET BACK TO
 IT EASILY.  ADD TO HOME SCREEN

01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:26.861
 HAS ALWAYS ALLOWS USERS TO ADD
 ANY EXPERIENCE TO THEIR HOME

01:28:26.862 --> 01:28:29.286
 SCREEN.  BUT WITH OUR IMPROVED
 ADD TO HOME SCREEN FLOW, WHEN

01:28:29.287 --> 01:28:32.914
 YOU ADD A PWA TO YOUR HOME
 SCREEN, IT'S FULLY INTEGRATED

01:28:32.915 --> 01:28:34.635
 INTO THE PLATFORM.  SO TO 
USERS,

01:28:34.636 --> 01:28:38.072
 IT FEELS LIKE ANY OTHER APP
 EXPERIENCE ON THEIR DEVICE.

01:28:38.073 --> 01:28:41.213
 IT WILL APPEAR IN THE ANDROID
 LAUNCHER ALONGSIDE YOUR ANDROID

01:28:41.214 --> 01:28:43.431
 APPS, AND IT WILL EVEN APPEAR 
IN

01:28:43.432 --> 01:28:46.663
 ANDROID STORAGE SETTINGS.  BUT
 SINCE IT'S A PWA, IT'S

01:28:46.664 --> 01:28:50.313
 INHERENTLY SMALLER WITH
 TWITTER'S PROGRESSIVE WEB APP 

01:28:50.314 --> 01:28:51.918
AT
 UNDER 1 MEGABYTE.  SO USERS ARE

01:28:51.919 --> 01:28:56.372
 GETTING A COMPARABLE EXPERIENCE
 THAT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANTLY 

01:28:56.373 --> 01:28:57.467
LESS
 STORAGE SPACE.  AND THE FACT

01:28:57.468 --> 01:29:01.607
 THAT IT'S SO SMALL DOESN'T JUST
 REDUCE ITS STORAGE SIZE BUT 

01:29:01.608 --> 01:29:03.165
ALSO
 MEANS THAT IT LOADS ALMOST

01:29:03.166 --> 01:29:06.261
 INSTANTLY ON ANY CONNECTION
 TYPE.

01:29:06.262 --> 01:29:10.094
 AND THIS FAST, INTEGRATED,
 IMPROVED ADD-TO-HOME SCREEN 

01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:12.527
FLOW
 IS ROLLING OUT NOW.

01:29:12.528 --> 01:29:15.353
 WITH ALL OF THESE NEW
 CAPABILITIES, WE'VE ALSO BEEN

01:29:15.354 --> 01:29:17.077
 WORKING TO MAKE SURE IT'S 
REALLY

01:29:17.078 --> 01:29:18.696

 HEY, EVERYONE.
 LAST YEAR AT I/O, WE INTRODUCED

01:31:31.691 --> 01:31:34.916
 AN EXPANDED FIREBASE, A MOBILE
 DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM THAT HELPS

01:31:34.917 --> 01:31:38.257
 YOU WITH THINGS LIKE STORING
 DATA IN THE CLOUD AND

 PINPOINTING APP CRASHES, 
SENDING

01:31:42.606 --> 01:31:45.832
 TARGETED NOTIFICATIONS TO JUST
 THE RIGHT USERS, SERVING ADS IN

01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:49.168

 ALL OF THIS IS BUNDLED TOGETHER

01:31:49.169 --> 01:31:54.116
 IN A SINGLE EASY-TO-USE
 CROSS-PLATFORM SDK.  FIREBASE

01:31:54.117 --> 01:31:58.762
 ALSO INCLUDES A POWERFUL FREE
 AND UNLIMITED ANALYTICS TOOL

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:04.257
 PURPOSE-BUILT FOR THE NEEDS OF
 NATIVE APPS AND NEW THIS YEAR,

01:32:04.258 --> 01:32:05.436
 ANALYTICS GIVES YOU REALTIME
 VIEWS INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING

 NEEDS GROW.  FOR EXAMPLE,
 ANALYTICS CONNECTS SEAMLESSLY

01:32:21.879 --> 01:32:23.879
 WITH BIGQUERY WHICH MEANS YOU
 CAN

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:29.243
 EXECUTE FAST SQL-LIKE QUERY
 AT DATA AT SCALE.  SINCE LAST

01:32:29.244 --> 01:32:31.682
 YEAR'S LAUNCH OVER A MILLION
 DEVELOPERS ARE USING FIREBASE. 

01:32:31.683 --> 01:32:34.915

 CRASH LYTICS

01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:57.691
 IN 2011, THE FABRIC
 TEAM HAS BEEN A SIMILAR MISSION

01:32:57.692 --> 01:32:59.061

REMARKABLE

01:32:59.062 --> 01:33:01.385

 ACHIEVED WIDESPREAD DEVELOPER

 AFRICA TEAMS ARE HARD AT WORK

 INTEGRATING THESE TWO PLATFORMS
 TOGETHER IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY TO

01:33:06.535 --> 01:33:09.885
 BRING YOU THE BEST OF BOTH.
 WE'LL HAVE MORE TO SHARE ON 

01:33:09.886 --> 01:33:12.695

 FRONT IN THE COMING MONTHS.

01:33:12.696 --> 01:33:16.090
 OVER THE PAST YEAR, WE'VE BEEN
 CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVING AND

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.253
 EXPANDING FIREBASE.  AND TODAY 
I

01:33:18.254 --> 01:33:19.478
 WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF 
OF

01:33:19.479 --> 01:33:20.978
 THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE'VE 
MADE

01:33:20.979 --> 01:33:25.721
 STARTING WITH CLOUD FUNCTIONS.
 ONE OF OUR GOALS WITH FIREBASE

01:33:25.722 --> 01:33:28.669
 IS FREEING YOU FROM HAVING TO
 THINK ABOUT SERVERS AND

01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:31.790
 INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU CAN FOCUS
 ON CREATING GREAT APPS.  BUT

01:33:31.791 --> 01:33:35.524
 SOMETHING'S BEEN MISSING FOR US
 TO TRULY ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL,

01:33:35.525 --> 01:33:38.445
 AND IT'S A GAP THAT WE'RE NOW
 ABLE TO FILL WITH CLOUD

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.863
 FUNCTIONS FOR FIREBASE, WHICH 
WE

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:43.086
 JUST RECENTLY RELEASED INTO
 BETA.

01:33:43.087 --> 01:33:48.034
 CLOUD FUNCTIONS GIVES YOU AN
 EASY WAY TO DEPLOY JAKE WHARTON

01:33:48.035 --> 01:33:52.174
 CODE INTO THE CLOUD AND THIS --
 GENTLEMAN HAVE ASCRIPT CODE 

01:33:52.175 --> 01:33:53.903
INTO
 THE CLOUD AND IT CAN INTEGRATE

01:33:53.904 --> 01:33:56.726
 INTO FIREBASE EVENS.  THESE
 FUNCTIONS RUN IN AN MAD NODE.JS

01:33:56.727 --> 01:34:00.854
 ENVIRONMENT SO YOU CAN EASILY
 TAP INTO THE VAST NODE APACHEJ

01:34:00.855 --> 01:34:04.796
 ECOSYSTEM.  YOU CAN USE THESE
 FUNCTIONS TO DO THINGS LIKE

01:34:04.797 --> 01:34:07.736
 RESPOND TO A DATABASE UPDATE BY
 SENDING NOTIFICATION WITH CLOUD

01:34:07.737 --> 01:34:11.175
 MESSAGING OR YOU CAN RESIZE
 IMAGES UPLOADED BY YOUR USERS

01:34:11.176 --> 01:34:13.914
 BEFORE SAVING THEM WITH CLOUD
 STORAGE.

01:34:13.915 --> 01:34:17.247
 AND TODAY, WE'RE OPENING UP A
 NEW INTEGRATION BETWEEN

01:34:17.248 --> 01:34:20.166
 FUNCTIONS AND FIREBASE HOSTING.

01:34:20.167 --> 01:34:24.706
 NOW, HOSTING LET'S YOU SERVE
 STATIC CONTENT LIKE HTML AND 

01:34:24.707 --> 01:34:25.932
CSS
 FILES THAT ARE AUTOMATICALLY

01:34:25.933 --> 01:34:30.870
 BACKED BY A GLOBAL CACHING
 NETWORK, BY COMBINING THOSE 

01:34:30.871 --> 01:34:31.987
WITH
 CLOUD FUNCTIONSES, YOU CAN NOW

01:34:31.988 --> 01:34:34.804
 GENERATE DYNAMIC WEB CONTENT
 THAT YOU CAN SERVE ON OUR OWN

01:34:34.805 --> 01:34:37.132
 DOMAIN WITH A STATIC CONTENT 
AND

01:34:37.133 --> 01:34:41.176
 IS BOTH ACCELERATED BY THIS
 GLOBAL CACHING NETWORK.

01:34:41.177 --> 01:34:44.725
 SO AS WITH CLOUD FUNCTIONS, YOU
 CAN DEPLOY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OF

01:34:44.726 --> 01:34:48.757
 CODE AS YOU NEED THEM, WHICH
 GIVES YOU A REALLY ELEGANT WAY

01:34:48.758 --> 01:34:51.897
 TO FACTOR CODE OUT FROM YOUR
 APPS AND SHARE THEM ACROSS YOUR

01:34:51.898 --> 01:34:55.023
 WEB AND NATIVE APPS AS YOU NEED
 WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT

01:34:55.024 --> 01:35:01.069
 APP SERVERS OR SERVER-SIDE
 APPLICATIONS.  AND IT ENABLES

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:02.283
 TRUE SERVERLESS DEVELOPMENT.  
WE

01:35:02.284 --> 01:35:05.112
 ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS.
 ALL RIGHT.  I HAVE GOT ONE MORE

01:35:05.113 --> 01:35:06.227
 THING I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU.

01:58:25.885 --> 01:58:27.712
Chet Haase:  LET'S MOVE BACK.  
THERE WE GO.

01:58:27.713 --> 01:58:29.999
Romain Guy:  IT'S REALLY EASY  
TO

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.639
IMPLEMENT IN YOUR  APPLICATION. 
YOU JUST HAVE  TO MODIFY YOUR

01:58:33.093 --> 01:58:36.042
MANIFEST.  AND  STOP PLAYING THE
ANIMATION,  PLEASE.

01:58:36.204 --> 01:58:38.785
YOU JUST HAVE TO SAY SUPPORT 
PICTURE IN PICTURE TRUE, YOU 

01:58:39.497 --> 01:58:42.796
DON'T NEED TO RESIZE THE 
ACTIVITY PICTURE TRUE  ANYMORE,

01:58:42.797 --> 01:58:45.636
AND YOU SHOULD ALSO  TEST
CONFIGURATION CHANGES.

01:58:45.843 --> 01:58:48.442
AND IN YOUR CODE, WHEN YOU  WANT
TO ENTER THE PICTURE IN  PICTURE

01:58:48.746 --> 01:58:52.386
CODE, YOU HAVE ONE  CALL, YOU
CALL ENTER PICTURE  IN PICTURE. 

01:58:52.638 --> 01:58:56.307
SUPER SIMPLE AND  IT'S GOING TO
MAKE YOUR USERS  SUPER HAPPY.

01:58:56.308 --> 01:59:02.183
A FEATURE DEAR TO MY HEART, 
MANAGEMENT, ADDING SUPPORT --  

01:59:02.184 --> 01:59:05.276
IT
WILL ONLY BE ON DEVICES  THAT --

01:59:05.437 --> 01:59:08.072
WE'LL ENABLE IT FOR  YOUR
APPLICATION.  ADDING  SUPPORT 

01:59:08.073 --> 01:59:12.234
FOR
16-BIT PNG FILES,   WIDER 

01:59:12.235 --> 01:59:15.236
COLORS,
MORE SATURATED.   WE SUPPORT ICC

01:59:16.810 --> 01:59:20.733
PROFILES,  COLORS IN --
IF WILL ENSURE ACCURATE 

01:59:20.734 --> 01:59:22.807
RENDITION OF COLORS ACROSS 
MULTIPLE SCREENS.

01:59:22.967 --> 01:59:25.809
WE ALSO HAVE A BUNCH OF NEW 
APIs WHICH WE'RE GOING TO  TALK

01:59:26.064 --> 01:59:28.199
ABOUT MORE AT THE END OF  THE
WEEK IN A DIFFERENT TALK.

01:59:28.401 --> 01:59:31.245
SO BECAUSE A PICTURE IS WORTH  A
THOUSAND WORDS, THIS IS  COLOR

01:59:31.501 --> 01:59:34.199
MANAGEMENT AND HOW IT  WORKS. 
HOPE IT'S CLEAR.

01:59:34.402 --> 01:59:35.509
 .
[ LAUGHTER ]

01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:39.276
BUT, REALLY, THE COLOR 
MANAGEMENT IS ABOUT SOMETHING 

01:59:39.588 --> 01:59:41.155
YOU'VE PROBABLY EXPERIENCED  
WITH

01:59:41.156 --> 01:59:43.948
YOUR OWN APPLICATION,  YOUR
COLORS LOOK DIFFERENT  ACROSS  

01:59:44.355 --> 01:59:46.900
DEVICES, SO WE HAVE  SOLUTIONS
FOR YOU IN ANDROID  O.  SO IF 

01:59:46.901 --> 01:59:48.214
YOU
WANT TO KNOW  MORE, THERE'S 

01:59:48.215 --> 01:59:49.840
GOING
TO BE A  TALK THAT I'M GOING TO

01:59:49.841 --> 01:59:53.359
GIVE  ON FRIDAY AT 11:30 ONSTAGE
2.   IT'S CALLED UNDERSTANDING 

01:59:54.215 --> 01:59:56.215
COLOR.
NEXT, WE'RE ALSO ADDING  SUPPORT

01:59:56.746 --> 02:00:01.480
FOR MULTIPLE  DISPLAYS.  IF RUR
APPLICATION   IF YOUR  

02:00:01.481 --> 02:00:03.105
APPLICATION
IS ALREADY --  CLICKER IS

02:00:03.106 --> 02:00:05.691
HORRIBLE -- IF  YOUR APPLICATION
SUPPORTS  MULTIPLE WINDOWS

02:00:05.692 --> 02:00:08.485
ALREADY, THE  MULTIWINDOW MODE,
IT ALREADY  SUPPORTS MULTIPLE

02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:12.799
DISPLAY IN  O.
WHEN THE PHONE IS CONNECTED  OR

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.933
AN ANDROID DEVICE IS  CONNECTED
TO MULTIPLE  DISPLAYS AND YOU

02:00:15.141 --> 02:00:18.704
HAVE AN  APPLICATION THAT IS 
COMPATIBLE, THE USER CAN SEND 

02:00:18.904 --> 02:00:21.142
THE APPLICATION ON A  DIFFERENT
DISPLAY.  WHEN THIS  HAPPENS,

02:00:21.387 --> 02:00:23.779
YOU'RE GOING TO GET  RESIZING
CONFIGURATION  CHANGE.  YOU CAN

02:00:24.235 --> 02:00:27.328
ALSO CONTROL  ON WHAT DISPLAY
YOUR ACTIVITY  SHOWS UP.  YOU 

02:00:27.329 --> 02:00:29.329
CAN
USE THE  ACTIVITY OPTIONS FOR

02:00:29.778 --> 02:00:30.798
THAT.
AND YOU SHOULD REALLY TEST  YOUR

02:00:30.799 --> 02:00:32.325
APP IF YOU WANT TO  SUPPORT THIS
FEATURE.

02:00:32.326 --> 02:00:35.879
TO HELP YOU WITH TESTING, WE 
HAVE TWO NEW DEVELOPER TOOLS, 

02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:40.652
YOU CAN RUST ABD SHELL  DUMPSYS.

02:00:40.653 --> 02:00:43.996
IF YOU CALL ABD  SHELL START 
WITH

02:00:43.997 --> 02:00:46.247
YOUR  ACTIVITY INTENT.  YOU
CAN --  IT'S A VERY EASY WAY FOR

02:00:46.454 --> 02:00:49.708
YOU  TO TEST THIS.
  THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THOSE 

02:00:50.063 --> 02:00:54.468
APIs, SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU  TO
GO TO  THE OFFICE HOURS ON 

02:00:54.469 --> 02:00:59.591
FRIDAY AND THURSDAY, THE  OFFICE
HOURS FOR WINDOWS AND 

02:00:59.592 --> 02:01:01.592
ACTIVITIES.
NEXT, MEDIA.

02:01:04.107 --> 02:01:06.996
[ LAUGHTER ]
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF VERY  USEFUL

02:01:07.359 --> 02:01:12.189
CLASSES IN THE MEDIA  PACKAGE,
THE RECORDER, THE  EXTRACTOR AND

02:01:12.376 --> 02:01:18.377
THE CODEC, WE  ADDED A NEW GET
METRICS API,  IT HELPS TO QUERY

02:01:18.584 --> 02:01:21.535
ABOUT THE  MEDIA YOU'RE DEALING
WITH,  THE BIT RATE, THE CODEC,

02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:24.996
THE  DURATION, THIS KIND OF DATA
.   IT'S SUPER EASY TO USE, JUST

02:01:26.417 --> 02:01:28.407
THOSE
OBJECTS AND YOU GET THE 

02:01:28.408 --> 02:01:31.688
PERSISTIBLE BUNDLE AND YOU  CAN
LOOK UP THE DOCUMENT ON 

02:01:31.689 --> 02:01:34.902
DWEP.ANDROID.COM TO KNOW WHAT 
KIND OF QUERIES ARE  AVAILABLE.

02:01:34.903 --> 02:01:36.329
PLAYBACK IS ALSO MUCH  IMPROVED.

02:01:36.330 --> 02:01:39.263
YOU NOW HAVE  CONTROL OVER THE
BUFFERING  NEW APPLICATION.  SO

02:01:39.264 --> 02:01:42.215
YOU CAN  SPECIFY A LOW AND A 
HIGH 

02:01:42.216 --> 02:01:44.811
WATERMARK.
SO THE PLAYBACK OF THE VIDEO 

02:01:45.621 --> 02:01:48.621
WILL NOT START UNTIL YOU  REACH
THE LOW WATERMARK, AND  THE

02:01:48.622 --> 02:01:52.230
SYSTEM WILL DO ITS BEST  TO KEEP
CACHED DATA BETWEEN  THE SLOW 

02:01:52.231 --> 02:01:54.562
AND
THE HIGH  WATERMARK.  AND YOU 

02:01:54.563 --> 02:01:55.938
CAN 
SPECIFY THE WATERMARKS IN 

02:01:55.939 --> 02:01:59.184
DURATION OR AMOUNT OF DATA IN 
SIZE.

02:01:59.532 --> 02:02:03.611
  WE ALSO IMPROVED SEEKING.   SO
WHEN YOU SEEK INTO A  VIDEO, YOU

02:02:03.905 --> 02:02:06.967
CAN NOW CHOOSE THE  BEHAVIOR, DO
YOU WANT TO SEEK  TO THE CLOSEST

02:02:07.576 --> 02:02:09.903
FRAME, THE  NEXT KEY FRAME, TO
THE  PREVIOUS KEY FRAME, OR TO

02:02:10.222 --> 02:02:14.889
THE  CLOSEST SYNC FRAME.
FINALLY, WE MADE THE DRM PLAY 

02:02:16.608 --> 02:02:19.499
PLAY  BACK IN WIDEVINE A LOT
EASIER  IN ALL OF YOUR

02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:21.799
APPLICATIONS.
FOR RECORDING, UNTIL NOW, THE 

02:02:21.952 --> 02:02:26.605
MEDIA MIXER ONLY LETS YOU 
HAVE -- SORRY, ADD ONE VIDEO 

02:02:26.814 --> 02:02:30.623
TRACK AND/OR ONE AUDIO TRACK.  
NOW YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY  AUDIO

02:02:30.895 --> 02:02:33.637
ENGINEER TRACKS AS YOU  WANT. 
YOU CAN ALSO CREATE  CUSTOM

02:02:33.638 --> 02:02:34.596
TRACKS.  THE  (INDISCERNIBLE) 
HAS

02:02:34.597 --> 02:02:36.469
TO START  WITH APPLICATION 
SLASH,

02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:39.424
AND  IT'S BASICALLY A SIDE BAND 
WHERE YOU CAN INVOKE ANY KIND  

02:02:39.425 --> 02:02:43.938
OF
DATA YOU WANT.  TO -- TO  

02:02:43.939 --> 02:02:45.355
REPLACE
UP TO 16 VIDEO OR  SOMETHING 

02:02:45.356 --> 02:02:46.734
LIKE
THAT.

02:02:46.735 --> 02:02:50.749
WEBVIEW COMES WITH  REALLY 
USEFUL NEW APIs.  WE'VE  ADDED

02:02:51.106 --> 02:02:54.610
THE ABILITY TO DO SAFE  BROWSING
THAT YOU KNOW AND  LOVE FROM

02:02:54.611 --> 02:02:58.527
CHROME THAT DETECTS  MALWARES 
AND

02:02:58.528 --> 02:03:01.623
UNSECURE WEB  PAGES.  SO IF YOU
ADD THIS  TAG IN YOUR MANIFEST,

02:03:01.934 --> 02:03:03.811
THIS  METADATA TAG, IT'S GOING 
TO 

02:03:03.812 --> 02:03:07.668
USE THE SAME BACK END AND API 
THAT CHROME ITSELF USES TO 

02:03:07.669 --> 02:03:09.752
SECURE THE BROWSING  EXPERIENCE
FOR YOUR USERS.

02:03:10.223 --> 02:03:12.997
THE WEBVIEW USES NOW MULTIPLE 
PROCESSES.  AND, IN  PARTICULAR,

02:03:14.826 --> 02:03:18.637
THERE'S A RENDER  PROCESS.  WE
HAVE A NEW API  TO DEAL WITH

02:03:18.638 --> 02:03:21.235
THESE MULTIPLE  PROCESSES.  IF
THE RENDERS  PROCESS CRASHES, 

02:03:21.236 --> 02:03:22.856
YOU
CAN USE  THE TERMINATION HANDLE

02:03:22.857 --> 02:03:25.709
API TO  DETECT THE CRASH AND
DECIDE  WHAT TO DO IN YOUR 

02:03:25.710 --> 02:03:26.456
APPLICATION.  YOU CAN CRASH  
YOUR

02:03:26.457 --> 02:03:28.701
APPLICATION IF YOU  WANTED.  YOU
CAN TRY TO  RESTART THE WEBVIEW,

02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:31.139
OR YOU  CAN JUST LOG SOMETHING
AND  SHOW A MESSAGE TO THE USER.

02:03:34.343 --> 02:03:35.921
BEFORE.
YOU CAN USE THE RENDER 

02:03:35.922 --> 02:03:38.814
(INDISCERNIBLE) API TO BETTER 
DEAL WITH THE LOW MEMORY 

02:03:38.815 --> 02:03:40.855
SITUATIONS.  SO WHEN THE  SYSTEM
IS LOW ON MEMORY, IT'S  GOING TO

02:03:40.998 --> 02:03:43.455
TRY TO RECLAIM RAM  FROM
SOMEWHERE, AND YOU CAN  TELL THE

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:46.849
SYSTEM WHETHER YOUR  WEBVIEW IS
VERY IMPORTANT OR  NOT THAT

02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:50.044
IMPORTANT TO YOUR  APPLICATION.
SO IF THE WEBVIEW IS CRITICAL  

02:03:50.045 --> 02:03:51.469
TO
YOUR APPLICATION, YOU  SHOULD

02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:53.470
DEFINITELY TAKE A LOOK  AT THIS
API.

02:03:55.233 --> 02:03:57.419
Chet Haase:  SO YOU KNOW IT'S 
THE RIGHT BUTTON; RIGHT?

02:03:57.420 --> 02:03:58.848
Romain Guy:  YES, I KNOW  THAT.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:03:58.849 --> 02:04:01.690
Chet Haase:  SO THERE WERE A 
COUPLE OF LONG-REQUESTED 

02:04:01.691 --> 02:04:04.218
FEATURES FOR ANIMATORS, 
SPECIFICALLY FOR ANIMATOR  SETS.

02:04:08.349 --> 02:04:11.076
CEPTIVELY TRICKY TO  IMPLEMENT,
SO IT TOOK A  WHILE.  IN ANDROID

02:04:11.441 --> 02:04:14.956
O, WE HAVE  THE CAPABILITY IN
ANIMATOR  SETS OF HAVING 

02:04:14.957 --> 02:04:16.380
SEEKING.
IF  YOU HAVE AN ANIMATOR THAT'S 

02:04:16.381 --> 02:04:17.911
A 
COLLECTION OF CHILD  ANIMATORS,

02:04:17.912 --> 02:04:21.564
YOU CAN SEEK  WITHIN THOSE CHILD
ANIMATORS  IN THE OVERALL

02:04:21.565 --> 02:04:25.529
ANIMATORSET.   SO YAY.
WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY  --

02:04:25.554 --> 02:04:29.062
[ LAUGHTER ]
-- TO REVERSE.

02:04:29.063 --> 02:04:31.154
Romain Guy:  DIDN'T YOU TRY  TO
IMPLEMENT THOSE APIs A  WHILE

02:04:31.613 --> 02:04:32.465
AGO?
Chet Haase:  MAYBE.

02:04:32.466 --> 02:04:35.513
Romain Guy:  UH-HUH.  AND WHO 
IMPLEMENTED THE APIs IN THE 

02:04:35.514 --> 02:04:36.282
END?
Chet Haase:  NOT ME.

02:04:36.283 --> 02:04:37.706
Romain Guy:  EXACTLY.
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:04:37.707 --> 02:04:40.360
Chet Haase:  OKAY.  SO NEW 
CAPABILITY, AGAIN, IN 

02:04:40.361 --> 02:04:43.362
ANIMATORSET TO REVERSE.  SO  YOU
NO LONGER HAVE TO ,YOU  KNOW, 

02:04:43.363 --> 02:04:45.393
SET
UP A SEPARATE  ANIMATORSET WITH

02:04:45.591 --> 02:04:48.027
ALL THAT  FUNCTIONALITY AND GET 
A 

02:04:48.028 --> 02:04:50.674
LISTEN AND ALL THAT.  WE DO  ALL
OF THAT TEDIOUS WORK FOR  YOU. 

02:04:51.144 --> 02:04:53.220
SO YAY.
AUTOFILL, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY 

02:04:53.535 --> 02:04:55.535
TEDIOUS TO GET ALL THIS 
INFORMATION CORRECT OVER AND 

02:04:55.717 --> 02:04:57.389
OVER, WE SAW THIS IN THE  
KEYNOTE

02:04:57.390 --> 02:04:59.674
EARLIER.  IT'S THE  ABILITY TO 
--

02:04:59.675 --> 02:05:02.450
YOU'VE GOT A  FORM TO FILL IN. 
THERE'S A  PROVIDER THAT CAN 

02:05:02.451 --> 02:05:04.406
GIVE
YOU  THAT INFORMATION.  SO WHEN 

02:05:04.407 --> 02:05:06.999
YOU GET THOSE TEXT FIELDS, WE 
CAN AUTOMATICALLY ENTER THAT 

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:10.855
INFORMATION FOR YOU.  AND  THERE
ARE A COUPLE OF  DIFFERENT

02:05:10.856 --> 02:05:13.341
ASPECTS TO THIS.   ONE IS THAT
YOU CAN CERTAINLY  IMPLEMENT 

02:05:13.342 --> 02:05:15.342
YOUR
OWN SERVICE  AND PROVIDE THAT

02:05:16.341 --> 02:05:21.286
CAPABILITY  OR DEPEND ON SERVICE
THAT  QUEER PROVIDING -- THE 

02:05:21.425 --> 02:05:25.547
STANDARD VIEWS JUST WORK, IF 
YOU'RE USING TEXTVIEW, IF  

02:05:25.548 --> 02:05:27.058
YOU'RE
USING EDIT TEXT, WE  KNOW HOW TO

02:05:27.059 --> 02:05:28.951
RECEIVE THIS  INFORMATION,
INTERACT WITH  THE SERVICE

02:05:28.952 --> 02:05:31.434
ALREADY.  SO YOU  DON'T NEED TO
DO ANYTHING FOR  STANDARD VIEWS.

02:05:31.435 --> 02:05:34.893
IF YOU'RE USING CUSTOM VIEWS  OR
IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE  MORE

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:38.408
INFORMATION ABOUT  STANDARD
VIEWS, WE HAVE  APIs FOR

02:05:38.409 --> 02:05:40.128
PROVIDING HINTS TO  US ABOUT 
WHAT

02:05:40.129 --> 02:05:43.220
THE VALUE TYPES  ARE, AS WELL AS
APIs TO  TELL US MORE ABOUT

02:05:43.221 --> 02:05:45.825
YOUR  CUSTOM VIEWS AND HOW YOU
WANT  TO INTERACT WITH THAT.

02:05:46.282 --> 02:05:49.420
ALSO, IF YOU HAVE A CUSTOM  VIEW
HIERARCHY, LET'S SAY YOU  HAVE A

02:05:50.231 --> 02:05:52.879
SURFACEVIEW, WHERE YOU  HAVE
VIEWS INSIDE OF THERE,  BUT ALL

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.831
WE KNOW IS THAT  THERE'S A
SURFACEVIEW, THEN  THERE ARE

02:05:55.832 --> 02:05:57.905
APIs FOR YOU TO  TELL US ABOUT
THE VIRTUAL  HIERARCHY THAT YOU

02:05:58.060 --> 02:06:01.007
WANT US TO  INTERACT WITH.
THERE IS GOING TO BE MORE  ABOUT

02:06:01.202 --> 02:06:03.940
THIS IN A SESSION ON  FRIDAY
MORNING.  SO GO TO  THAT IF YOU

02:06:04.107 --> 02:06:06.799
WANT TO LEARN  MORE ABOUT
AUTOFILL.

02:06:06.987 --> 02:06:09.490
AND NOW LET'S TALK A LITTLE  BIT
ABOUT TEXT.  THERE'S BEEN  A

02:06:09.491 --> 02:06:12.940
BUNCH OF STUFF GOING ON IN  THE
TEXT ARENA THIS TIME.  I  THINK

02:06:12.941 --> 02:06:14.748
WE CAN REWRITE THIS.   THERE WE
GO.

02:06:14.749 --> 02:06:16.749
[ LAUGHTER ]

02:06:18.533 --> 02:06:22.144
I ONLY USE THAT FONT BECAUSE  IT
HURTS DAN.  IT JUST  PHYSICALLY

02:06:22.343 --> 02:06:25.082
HURTS HIM.  IT'S  AWESOME.
Romain Guy:  I THINK YOU  BROKE

02:06:25.456 --> 02:06:26.724
HIM.
Chet Haase:  ALL RIGHT.  SO, 

02:06:26.725 --> 02:06:28.725
FIRST OF

02:06:29.908 --> 02:06:33.061
 ALL, YOU CAN USE XML  TO
DECLARE FONT INFORMATION  USING

02:06:33.062 --> 02:06:36.519
SORT OF A NEAT HACK  WITH DATA
BINDING.  BUT IT'S  KIND OF

02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:38.702
TRICKY TO DO.  AND  WHY 
SHOULDN'T

02:06:38.703 --> 02:06:40.703
WE ACTUALLY  PROVIDE THAT
CAPABILITY FOR  YOU?

02:06:40.737 --> 02:06:43.985
SO NOW WE DO.  SO YOU CAN NOW 
ACTUALLY PUT A FONT FILE 

02:06:43.986 --> 02:06:47.439

02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:33.509
 ANDROID STUDIO.  AND IF YOU
 SET AN INTENT OUTSIDE YOUR

02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:35.345
 APPLICATION AND YOU NEED TO
 GRANT PERMISSION, YOU CAN

02:15:35.346 --> 02:15:38.487
 ALSO BE WARRANTED.  SO IT'S
 FAIRLY EASY TO USE.  IT LOOKS

02:15:38.488 --> 02:15:40.847
 LIKE THE PREVIOUS APIs WE
 HAD.

02:15:40.848 --> 02:15:44.589
 MEDIA FILE ACCESS.  SO WE
 INTRODUCED A DOCUMENT PRIFERS

02:15:44.590 --> 02:15:47.111
 A WHILE AGO, A COUPLE
 RELEASES AGO AND THEY'RE

02:15:47.112 --> 02:15:50.338
 EXTREMELY USEFUL EXCEPT WHEN
 YOU HAVE LARGE DOCUMENTS.  IF

02:15:50.339 --> 02:15:54.213
 YOU HAVE A LARNG DOCUMENT YOU
 NEED IT TO DOWNLOAD THE

02:15:54.214 --> 02:15:57.306
 ENTIRE DATA BEFORE YOU CAN
 PASS IT TO THE USERS OF THE

02:15:57.307 --> 02:16:00.877
 DOCUMENT PROVIDER.  SO NOW
 YOU CAN USE SEEKABLE FILE

02:16:00.878 --> 02:16:06.697
 SCRIPTERS.  IT'S USEFUL FOR
 VIDEO, AUDIO OR ANY CONTENT. 

02:16:06.698 --> 02:16:10.743
 YOU GET THE STORAGE MANAGER,
 YOU OPEN THE PROXY FILE

02:16:10.744 --> 02:16:15.016
 SCRIPTER, YOU INVOKE A CALL
 BACK TO REQUEST SOME AMOUNT

02:16:15.017 --> 02:16:21.275
 OF DATA IN THE BAT ARRAY, AND
 THEN WE'RE GOING TO TELL TELL

02:16:21.276 --> 02:16:29.048
 YOU WHEN TO CLOSE IT.
 CACHED DATA.  SO THIS IS NEW

02:16:29.049 --> 02:16:31.738
 API THAT THE SYSTEM GIVES YOU
 TO BE A BETTER CITIZEN.  SO

02:16:31.739 --> 02:16:35.299
 EACH APP HAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT
 OF DATA IT CAN USE IN THE

02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:38.508
 CACHE PARTITION.  AND WHEN
 THE SYSTEM RUNS OUT OF SPACE,

02:16:38.509 --> 02:16:40.543
 OUT OF STORAGE SPACE, IT'S
 GOING TO START DELETING SOME

02:16:40.544 --> 02:16:44.669
 OF YOUR CACHED DATA.  SO IF
 YOU STAY BELOW THE QUOTA THAT

02:16:44.670 --> 02:16:47.600
 YOU'RE GIVEN, YOU CAN AVOID
 YOUR DATA BEING DELETED.

02:16:47.601 --> 02:16:50.321
 FOR THIS YOU CAN USE THE
 STORAGE MANAGER.  YOU CAN

02:16:50.322 --> 02:16:53.640
 QUERY THE NUMBER OF BYTES
 THAT ARE ALLOCATED TO YOUR

02:16:53.641 --> 02:16:56.508
 APP.  YOU SHOULD QUERY THAT
 FROM TIME TO TIME BECAUSE THE

02:16:56.509 --> 02:17:00.224
 QUOTA CAN CHANGE DEPENDING ON
 HOW MUCH OF THE QUOTA YOU USE

02:17:00.225 --> 02:17:04.363
 OR HOW OFTEN THE USER USES
 THE APPLICATION.  THEN WHEN

02:17:04.364 --> 02:17:07.489
 YOU WANT TO ALLOCATE DATA YOU
 CAN JUST USE ALLOCATE BYTES. 

02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:10.623
 YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF.  YOU
 CAN CREATE A FILE, CREATE AN

02:17:10.624 --> 02:17:12.773
 OUTPUT STREAM BUT IT'S MUCH
 BETTER TO DO IT THIS WAY

02:17:12.774 --> 02:17:15.667
 BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO THROUGH
 ALLOCATE BYTES IF NEEDED IT

02:17:15.668 --> 02:17:19.269
 WILL DELETE ANOTHER APPS
 CACHED DATA TO MAKE SPACE FOR

02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:23.295
 YOUR DATA.  SO THAT MEANS IT
 COULD BE BIGGER THAN THE FREE

02:17:23.296 --> 02:17:24.557
 SPACE THAT'S LEFT ON THE
 DEVICE.

02:17:24.558 --> 02:17:27.596
 YOU CAN ALSO USE SOMETHING
 CALLED SET CACHE BEHAVIOR

02:17:27.597 --> 02:17:30.634
 TOMBSTONE.  SO THIS IS VERY
 USEFUL TO -- FOR YOUR APP TO

02:17:30.635 --> 02:17:33.355
 BE ABLE TO TELL THE
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FILE

02:17:33.356 --> 02:17:35.790
 THAT WAS NEVER CACHED AND A
 FILE THAT WAS CACHED BUT

02:17:35.791 --> 02:17:37.822
 DELETED.
 SO WHEN YOU SET THAT BEHAVIOR

02:17:37.823 --> 02:17:40.634
 AND THE SYSTEM DELETES SOME
 OF YOUR FILES IN YOUR KAMP,

02:17:40.635 --> 02:17:43.475
  CACHE
 IT WILL TRUNCATE THE FILE. 

02:17:43.476 --> 02:17:45.792
 SO THE FILE WILL STILL BE
 THERE BUT THE SIZE WILL BE

02:17:45.793 --> 02:17:49.073
 SET TO ZOA.  THAT TELLS

02:17:53.069 --> 02:17:55.902
 ZERO.  THAT TELLS YOU
 IT WAS DELETED BY THE SYSTEM.

02:17:55.903 --> 02:17:59.129
 Dan Sandler:  THERE'S A LOT
 GOING ON IN ANDROID SECURITY

02:17:59.446 --> 02:18:01.876
 IN THIS RELEASE AND WE ONLY
 HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO

02:18:01.877 --> 02:18:04.316
 TALK ABOUT T I WANT TO
 HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE PRIVACY

02:18:04.317 --> 02:18:07.108
 IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE NEW IN
 ANDROID O.  IF YOU HAVE BEEN

02:18:07.109 --> 02:18:10.139
 USING ANDROID I.D., YOU NEED
 TO KNOW NOW THAT IT IS GOING

02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:13.305
 TO BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY
 APP, FOR EVERY USER ON THE

02:18:13.306 --> 02:18:16.756
 DEVICE.  SO IT CAN'T BE USED
 TO TRACK USERS BETWEEN APPS

02:18:16.757 --> 02:18:19.879
 ON THE SAME DEVICE ANYMORE.
 SIMILARLY, IF USB YOU'VE BEEN

02:18:19.880 --> 02:18:22.889
 REFLECTING IN THE SYSTEM
 PROPERTIES TO GET NET.HOST

02:18:22.890 --> 02:18:25.903
 NAME, IT IS EMPTY NOW.  SO IF
 YOU ARE SAYING I REALLY NEED

02:18:26.090 --> 02:18:30.230
 ADVERTISING IDs TO BE ABLE
 TO SEND USERS THE CORRECT

02:18:30.231 --> 02:18:33.061
 CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISEMENTS,
 THAT IS WHAT THE ADVERTISING

02:18:33.062 --> 02:18:35.889
 ID API IN PLAY GOOGLE PLAY SFS 
IS

02:18:35.890 --> 02:18:38.105
 FOR SO GO CHECK IT OUT IN
 GOOGLE PLAY BUT YOU CANNOT

02:18:38.106 --> 02:18:41.196
 USE AN ANDROID ID.  YOU CAN'T
 TRUST IT ANYMORE IN THE SAME

02:18:41.197 --> 02:18:43.993
 WAY YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE.
 I HAD A SLIDE HERE ABOUT

02:18:43.994 --> 02:18:47.147
 WEBVIEW BUT THEN ROMAIN TOOK
 IT.  ONE THING I WANTED TO

02:18:47.148 --> 02:18:50.026
 MENTION ABOUT SAFE BROWSING
 IN WEBVIEW IS BECAUSE WEBVIEW

02:18:50.027 --> 02:18:53.273
 IS NOW PUSHED TO THE PLAY
 STORE EVERY SIX MONTHS YOU'LL

02:18:53.274 --> 02:18:56.982
 BE ABLE TO OPT INTO SAFE
 BROWSING FEATURES AS FAR ACAS

02:19:00.129 --> 02:19:01.568
 BACK
 AS LOLLYPOP WHICH IS

02:19:01.569 --> 02:19:04.063
 FANTASTIC.
 WE ALSO SAW IN THE KEYNOTE

02:19:04.064 --> 02:19:07.007
 SOMETHING CALLED GOOGLE PLAY
 PROTECT WHICH IS A LOT OF THE

02:19:07.008 --> 02:19:09.319
 TECHNOLOGIES WE HAD IN PLACE
 BEFORE BUT NOT GIVEN THE

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:13.648
 VISIBILITY THEY TRULY DESERVE
 BECAUSE WE ARE WATCHING OUT

02:19:13.649 --> 02:19:17.019
 FOR PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.  SO
 ANY APP THAT GETS UPLOADED TO

02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:19.643
 PLAY IS PRESCREENED AND
 CONTINUOUSLY RESCREENED FOR

02:19:19.644 --> 02:19:22.247
 EACH NEW VERSION THAT'S
 UPLOADED.  AND EVERY TIME YOU

02:19:22.248 --> 02:19:25.742
 INSTALL AN APP WHERE YOU HAVE
 PLAY PROTECT SET UP, THAT APP

02:19:25.743 --> 02:19:29.422
 IS GOING TO BE SCREENED AS
 WELL EVEN IF YOU GOT IT FROM

02:19:29.423 --> 02:19:34.067
 ANOTHER STORE OR FROM, YOU
 KNOW, ADB INSTALL.  AND WE'RE

02:19:34.068 --> 02:19:37.091
 REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS. 
 THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO TALK

02:19:37.092 --> 02:19:40.837
 ABOUT, SO MUCH MORE TO TALK
 ABOUT IN ANDROID SECURITY,

02:19:40.838 --> 02:19:43.852
 THEY GAVE ME A WHOLE, LIKE,
 SLIDE DECK OF STUFF SO I SAID

02:19:43.853 --> 02:19:46.483
 WHY DON'T YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
 TALK.  I ACTUALLY DIDN'T SAY

02:19:46.484 --> 02:19:50.027
 THAT.  THEY HAD THEIR OWN
 TALK ANYWAY.  ON THURSDAY AT

02:19:52.948 --> 02:19:56.278
 WHAT'S NEW IN ANDROID
 SECURITY EVERYTHING FROM SOUP

02:19:56.279 --> 02:19:57.707
 TO NUTS.
 Romain Guy:  LANGUAGE AND

02:19:57.708 --> 02:19:59.531
 RUNTIME.  I THINK YOU ALREADY
 KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY. 

02:19:59.532 --> 02:20:02.958
 SO THIS MORNING WE ANNOUNCE
 OFFICIAL SUPPORT FOR KOTLIN.

02:20:02.959 --> 02:20:04.959
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE

02:20:08.087 --> 02:20:10.142
 ]
 YOU SAW STEPH ON STAGE, AND I

02:20:10.143 --> 02:20:12.400

02:20:26.063 --> 02:20:29.900
 IT'S AVAILABLE TODAY IN
 ANDROID STUDIO 3.0.  THERE'S

02:20:29.901 --> 02:20:34.145
 A LOT OF DOCUMENTATION
 ONLINE.  I COULD SPEND HOURS

02:20:34.146 --> 02:20:36.998
 TALKING ABOUT KOTLIN AND WHY
 IT'S GOOD FOR YOU, WHY IT'S

02:20:36.999 --> 02:20:39.011
 GOOD FOR US.
 Chet Haase:  HE DOES, IN

02:20:39.012 --> 02:20:39.892
 FACT.
 Romain Guy:  BUT

02:20:39.893 --> 02:20:41.419
 UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE
 THAT MUCH TIME IN THIS

02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:44.654
 SESSION.  SO INSTEAD I INVITE
 YOU TO COME ON FRIDAY AT

02:20:44.655 --> 02:20:47.574
 10:30 HERE ON THIS STAGE. 
 THERE'S GOING TO BE A TALK

02:20:47.575 --> 02:20:51.820
 CALLED INTRODUCTION TO KOTLIN
 FROM ANDREY BRESLAV, THE TECH

02:20:51.821 --> 02:20:59.300
 -- LEAD LANGUAGE DESIGNER AT
 JETBRAINS, AND HADI, VP AT

02:20:59.301 --> 02:21:01.228
 JETBRAINS. 
 AND THEN IN THE AFTERNOON --

02:21:01.229 --> 02:21:04.654
 AND THEN IN THE AFTERNOON ON
 STAGE 4, WE'LL HAVE LIFE IS

02:21:04.655 --> 02:21:07.970
 GREAT AND EVERYTHING WILL BE
 OKAY, KOTLIN IS HERE, BY

02:21:07.971 --> 02:21:11.221
 CHRISTINA LEE FROM PINTEREST
 AND JAKE WHARTON FROM SQUARE.

02:21:11.222 --> 02:21:15.647
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 AND THIS IS IMPORTANT TO US

02:21:15.648 --> 02:21:18.168
 BECAUSE THE REASON WHY WE
 BROUGHT YOU KOTLIN IS BECAUSE

02:21:18.169 --> 02:21:21.538
 YOU THE COMMUNITY IS USING
 KOTLIN.  WE LISTENED, WE

02:21:21.539 --> 02:21:23.830
 HEARD YOU.  WE'RE BRINGING
 YOU WHAT YOU WANTED SO WE

02:21:23.831 --> 02:21:25.880
 WANTED TO HAVE YOU THE
 COMMUNITY ON STAGE TO TALK

02:21:25.881 --> 02:21:29.501
 ABOUT IT BETTER THAN WE CAN.
 ALSO, IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

02:21:29.502 --> 02:21:33.323
 YOU CAN COME TO THE DEVELOPER
 SANDBOX AT THE ANDROID CORE

02:21:33.324 --> 02:21:37.475
 PLATFORM BOOTH TODAY FROM
 3:00 TO 4.30 ON THURSDAY FROM

02:21:37.476 --> 02:21:43.388
 TWO TO FOUR, AND ON FRIDAY
 FROM NOON TO 2:00 P.M, ANDREY

02:21:43.389 --> 02:21:46.264
 THE LANGUAGE DESIGNER WILL BE
 THERE TO ANSWER YOUR

02:21:46.265 --> 02:21:48.560
 QUESTIONS.  SO ANYTHING YOU
 WANT TO KNOW ABOUT KOTLIN,

02:21:48.561 --> 02:21:49.874
 PLEASE GO THERE AND ASK YOUR
 QUESTIONS.

02:21:49.875 --> 02:21:52.608
 NOW, LIKE STEPH MENTIONED
 WE'RE ALSO DOUBLING DOWN ON

02:21:52.609 --> 02:21:54.644
 THE OTHER LANGUAGES, SO THE
 JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND

02:21:54.645 --> 02:21:59.766
 WE ALSO 72C AND COMPLUS SOY
 FOR THE JAVA PROGRAMMING

02:21:59.767 --> 02:22:04.854
 LANGUAGE WE HAVE JAVA.TIME
 THAT MAKES MANIPULATING TIME

02:22:04.855 --> 02:22:08.449
 AND DATES EASY AND IT MAKES
 SENSE.  IT MAKES A LOT MORE

02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:12.022
 SENSE THAN THE OTHER APIs. 
 IT'S ABOUT TIME.  WE'RE ALSO

02:22:12.023 --> 02:22:19.762
 BRINGING YOU JAVA.NOI.FILE. 
 IT IMPROVES ON THE.  IT GIVES

02:22:19.763 --> 02:22:23.708
 YOU THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE
 FILE.  IT LETS YOU EASILY

02:22:23.709 --> 02:22:26.330
 MANIPULATE PATHS.  WIELDS
 GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.  AND

02:22:30.363 --> 02:22:33.694
 SLIGHT REFOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS
 AN APPROXIMATION BUT IT'S

02:22:33.695 --> 02:22:37.455
 REALLY COOL BECAUSE IT LET'S
 YOU TRANSFORM AND WRAP METHOD

02:22:37.456 --> 02:22:40.362
 HANDLES IN YOUR APPLICATION.
 SO HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE

02:22:40.363 --> 02:22:43.123
 NEW FILES API.  SO YOU CAN
 USE THE PATH CLASS TO GET A

02:22:43.124 --> 02:22:46.841
 PATH.  AND THEN YOU CAN JUST
 CALL FILES THAT LINES, IT

02:22:46.842 --> 02:22:49.369
 WILL READ THE ENTIRE CONTENT
 OF THE FILE.  YOU ARE GOING

02:22:49.370 --> 02:22:53.328
 TO GET A STREAM.  SO IN THIS
 EXAMPLE I AM USING

02:22:53.329 --> 02:22:56.545
 (INDISCERNIBLE) AND STRING
 STRING APIs TO REMOVE ALL

02:22:56.546 --> 02:22:58.592
 THE LINES THAT START WITH THE
 POUND SIGN AND I COLLECT

02:22:58.593 --> 02:23:01.783
 EVERYTHING BACK INTO A SINGLE
 STRING AT THE END.  SO IT'S A

02:23:01.784 --> 02:23:05.423
 LOT EASIER THAN IT WAS
 BEFORE.

02:23:05.424 --> 02:23:08.548
 Chet Haase:  WE HAVE SOME
 CHANGES IN RUNTIME.  WE HEARD

02:23:08.549 --> 02:23:11.279
 ABOUT SOME OF THESE THIS
 MORNING AND.  NEW CONCURRENT

02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:14.016
 COPYING COLLECTOR MAKING
 EVERYTHING FASTER AND BETTER. 

02:23:14.017 --> 02:23:17.209
 IT MEANS NO PAUSE TIME EXCEPT
 WHEN THERE'S A FULL TPUS C SO

02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:19.367
 IT CAN DO ALL THE STUFF IT
 NEEDS TO DO THE BACKGROUND

02:23:19.368 --> 02:23:21.303
 WHILE YOU'RE DOING OTHER
 STUFF.  IN PARTICULAR, ONE OF

02:23:21.304 --> 02:23:24.705
 THE REALLY COOL THINGS THAT
 IT CAN DO IS ACTUALLY COMPACT

02:23:24.706 --> 02:23:28.997
 THE HEAP IN THE FOREGROUND. 
 SO PREVIOUSLY IN R, I BELIEVE

02:23:28.998 --> 02:23:33.394
 IN THE PREVIOUS RELEASE, IT
 HAD THE ABILITY TO COMPACT

02:23:33.395 --> 02:23:37.076
 THE HEAP, IT CAN MAKE THE
 HEAP SMALLER, IT CAN MAKE

02:23:37.077 --> 02:23:38.870
 ALLOCATIONS AND COLLECTIONS
 FASTER BUT ONLY WHEN

02:23:38.871 --> 02:23:41.183
 ACTIVITIES WERE IN THE
 BACKGROUND.  SO IT WILL GO

02:23:41.184 --> 02:23:44.715
 INTO AN IDLE STATE AND DO IT
 WHEN IT WAS IN THE IDLE STATE

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:49.865
 BUT WHEN IT WAS IN THE
 FOREGROUND, THERE WAS NOTHING

02:23:49.866 --> 02:23:52.593
 IT CAN DO.  NOW IT CAN
 COLLECT AND DEFRAG IN THE

02:23:52.594 --> 02:23:54.612
 FOREGROUND AND EVERYTHING IS
 FASTER.  THERE'S ALSO A NEW

02:23:54.613 --> 02:23:57.534
 FASTER MECHANISM FOR
 ALLOCATIONS SO IT CAN US J DO

02:23:57.535 --> 02:24:00.273
 BUMP POINTER ALLOCATIONS
 WHICH IS MUCH, MUCH FASTER. 

02:24:00.274 --> 02:24:02.224
 COLLECTIONS ARE FASTER AND
 ALL OF THIS ESSENTIALLY

02:24:02.225 --> 02:24:05.519
 RESULTS IN LESS JANK FOR YOU. 
 SO FASTER TO ALLOCATE STUFF,

02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:08.366
 FASTER TO COLLECT STUFF MEANS
 THAT JUST DEALING WITH

02:24:08.367 --> 02:24:12.048
 GARBAGE AND MEMORY IN GENERAL
 IS MUCH FASTER USING ART IN

02:24:12.049 --> 02:24:14.049
 THE O RELEASE.
 VARIOUS

02:24:17.432 --> 02:24:23.472
 OPTIMIZATION SES. 
 DALVIK WITH REN JAITD WITH

02:24:23.473 --> 02:24:26.003
 MEMORY SCYTHE TIGHT
 CONSTRAINTS.  EVERYTHING WAS

02:24:26.004 --> 02:24:29.234
 ABOUT SAVING MEMORY WITH
 DALVIK WHICH MEANS IT CAN

02:24:29.235 --> 02:24:34.994
 ONLY DO SO MUCH OPTIMIZE MIEZ
 SAYINGS.  WHEN ART CAME

02:24:34.995 --> 02:24:37.904
 ONLINE THEY PUT IN A PLATFORM
 UPON WHICH WE COULD BUILD

02:24:37.905 --> 02:24:40.640
 FUTURE OPTIMIZATIONS.  SO
 WE'RE STARTING TO REAP THOSE

02:24:40.641 --> 02:24:43.972
 BENEFITS NOW WHERE WITH EVERY
 RELEASE, INCLUDING O AND

02:24:43.973 --> 02:24:46.131
 FUTURE RELEASES, WE'RE GOING
 TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE AND

02:24:46.132 --> 02:24:48.729
 MORE.  AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF
 THEM IN THIS RELEASE AND YOU

02:24:48.730 --> 02:24:50.644
 SHOULD CHECK OUT A SESSION
 LATER IN THE WEEK FOR MORE

02:24:50.645 --> 02:24:53.676
 INFORMATION ON THAT.  ALSO
 THERE'S DEX LOCALITY.  THIS

02:24:53.677 --> 02:24:56.120
 IN PARTICULAR IMPROVES LAUNCH
 TIME FOR ACTIVITIES BECAUSE

02:24:56.121 --> 02:24:59.132
 WE CAN COLLECT ALL THE MEMORY
 IN THE SAME SPACE.  SO IT'S

02:24:59.133 --> 02:25:01.860
 EASIER AND FASTER TO ACCESS
 AS YOU'RE APPLICATION IS

02:25:01.861 --> 02:25:03.783
 STARTING UP.
 SO THERE'S A SESSION ON

02:25:03.784 --> 02:25:07.217
 FRIDAY MORNING, PERFORMANCE
 AND MEMORY IMPROVEMENTS.  SO

02:25:07.218 --> 02:25:09.441
 CHECK THAT OUT FOR MORE
 PARTICULARS THERE.

02:25:09.442 --> 02:25:12.770
 SO BEYOND THE PLATFORM, WE
 HAVE SUPPORT LIBRARY, WE HAVE

02:25:12.771 --> 02:25:14.702
 OTHER MECHANISMS FOR
 DELIVERING THINGS THAT AREN'T

02:25:14.703 --> 02:25:17.127
 JUST ABOUT THE O RELEASE.  WE
 WANTED TO CALL OUT SOME OF

02:25:17.128 --> 02:25:20.872
 THOSE.  THERE'S THE v26
 BETA RELEASE THAT COMES OUT

02:25:20.873 --> 02:25:23.284
 WITH DEVELOPER PREVIEW TWO. 
 THE STUFF WE ALREADY TALKED

02:25:23.285 --> 02:25:27.714
 ABOUT IN TEXT.  FONTS IN XML,

02:25:27.715 --> 02:25:30.349
 DOWNLOADABLE FONTS AS WELL AS
 AUTO SIZING TEXTVIEW.  THOSE

02:25:30.350 --> 02:25:32.766
 ARE ALL IN THERE.  YOU CAN
 CHECK THOSE OUT.  IN ADDITION

02:25:32.767 --> 02:25:34.795
 THERE'S SOMETHING WE CALL
 MOIJ COMPAT.  SO

02:25:37.817 --> 02:25:40.832
 EMOJICOMPAT.  ONE OF THE BIG
 PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH EMOJIS

02:25:40.833 --> 02:25:44.584
 IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS SENDING
 YOU SOMETHING FROM EMOJIS

02:25:44.585 --> 02:25:47.712
 FROM A FUTURE STANDARD,
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THOSE

02:25:47.713 --> 02:25:50.762
 AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE TOFUS
 INSTEAD.  WHICH GIVEN SOME OF

02:25:50.763 --> 02:25:54.894
 THE EMOJIS, MAY BE MORE
 ATTRACTIVE BUT NOT VERY

02:25:54.895 --> 02:25:58.315
 MEANINGFUL.  SO WOULDN'T IT
 BE GREAT IF YOU COULD GET

02:25:58.316 --> 02:26:00.135
 UPDATED MOIDGES ON YOUR
 DEVICE.  SO NOW WE HAVE TWO

02:26:00.136 --> 02:26:03.976
 MECHANISMS THAT DEVICES CAN
 USE TO GET UPDATED EMOJIS. 

02:26:03.977 --> 02:26:07.208
 ONE IS IT CAN BUNDLE WITH
 UPDATED MOIFNLINGS SO THEY

02:26:07.209 --> 02:26:09.327
 CAN UPDATE THE APPS TO THE
 PLAY STORE AND THEN TO THEIR

02:26:09.328 --> 02:26:12.777
 USERS SO THE USERS GET MORE
 TIMELY UPDATES OF THESE

02:26:12.778 --> 02:26:15.892
 EMOJIS.  THE OTHER, AND
 PROBABLY BETTER CERTAINLY

02:26:15.893 --> 02:26:19.844
 LONG-TERM SOLUTION, IS TO
 ACTUALLY USE A SERVICE WE CAN

02:26:19.845 --> 02:26:21.856
 PROVIDE THROUGH DOWNLOADABLE
 FONTS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER

02:26:21.857 --> 02:26:25.274
 WHERE THEY CAN AUTOMATICALLY
 GET UPDATED FONTS THROUGH

02:26:25.275 --> 02:26:28.530
 DOWNLOADABLE FONTS; RIGHT?
 SO THEY CAN -- THE APP CAN

02:26:28.531 --> 02:26:32.554
 BUILD IN THE CAPABILITY TO
 USE THE DOWNLOADABLE FONTS

02:26:32.555 --> 02:26:34.780
 CAPABILITY TO HAVE UPDATED
 EMOJIS AS WE PROVIDE THEM

02:26:34.781 --> 02:26:38.119
 INTO THE SERVICE.
 SO AGAIN, GO TO THE WHAT'S

02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:40.936
 NEW IN SUPPORT LIBRARY TALK
 TOMORROW MORNING TO LEARN

02:26:40.937 --> 02:26:44.795
 MORE ABOUT ALL OF THOSE.
 WE ALSO HAD MORE STUFF GOING

02:26:44.796 --> 02:26:48.234
 ON IN ANIMATION BESIDES THE
 SMALL STUFF IN ANIMATORSET I

02:26:48.235 --> 02:26:51.040
 TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.  WE
 HAVE THE ABILITY TO NOW HAVE

02:26:51.041 --> 02:26:54.183
 PHYSICS-BASED ANIMATION
 STUFF.  SO IF WE WANT TO SEE

02:26:54.184 --> 02:26:57.005
 THAT IN ANIMATION FORM.  THE
 ABILITY TO HAVE ESSENTIALLY

02:26:57.006 --> 02:27:00.632
 ANIMATIONS DRIVEN THROUGH
 VELOCITY, ALL THE ANIMATION

02:27:00.633 --> 02:27:02.165
 ABILITIES WE HAVE IN THE
 PLATFORM TO DATE HAVE BEEN

02:27:02.166 --> 02:27:04.585
 DRIVEN AROUND THE IDEA OF A
 DURATION.  YOU TELL IT HOW

02:27:04.586 --> 02:27:07.709
 LONG YOU WANT IT TO RUN FOR,
 BUT MANY ANIMATIONS, YOU

02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:11.247
 REALLY WANT TO DRIVE IT BY
 THE VELOCITY IN PARTICULAR,

02:27:11.248 --> 02:27:13.482
 ANIMATIONS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY
 USER INTERACTIONS.  YOU'RE

02:27:13.483 --> 02:27:15.002
 DRAGGING SOMETHING ON THE
 SCREEN AND YOU LET GO. 

02:27:15.003 --> 02:27:17.847
 WOULDN'T IT BE NICE IF IT
 TOOK OFF FROM YOUR FINGER AT

02:27:17.848 --> 02:27:22.283
 THE SAME VELOCITY THAT YOU
 ARE WERE CRAGGING IT DRAGGING 

02:27:22.284 --> 02:27:24.015
IT WHEN YOU
 LET GO.  SO FLINGS, SCROLLS,

02:27:24.016 --> 02:27:27.633
 ALL THAT STUFF, IT REALLY
 REQUIRES A VELOCITY-BASED

02:27:27.634 --> 02:27:30.560
 ANIMATION SYSTEM INSTEAD. 
 YOU CAN DO THAT WITH THE

02:27:30.561 --> 02:27:32.990
 ANIMATORS BUT IT'S REALLY
 TEDIOUS.  IT REQUIRES MATH. 

02:27:32.991 --> 02:27:36.123
 MATH IS HARD.  AND SO WE
 BAKED IN THAT CAPABILITY TO

02:27:36.124 --> 02:27:40.275
 THIS NEW PHYSICS ANIMATION
 SYSTEM THAT IS MORE NATURAL,

02:27:40.276 --> 02:27:42.677
 MORE INTERACTIVE AND MORE
 INTERRUPTIBLE BECAUSE IT WAS

02:27:42.678 --> 02:27:49.646
 REALLY INTENDED TO WORK WITH
 THAT USER INTERACTIVITY

02:27:49.647 --> 02:27:52.685
 MODEL.  HERE IS A DEMO OF
 THIS.  SO AS WE'RE DRAGGING

02:27:52.686 --> 02:27:56.018
 THE TOP THING AROUND, THE
 OTHER CIRCLES ARE HINGED TO

02:27:56.019 --> 02:27:59.650
 THE TOP ONE THROUGH SPRINGS
 YOU DEFINE SO THEY FOLLOW IT

02:27:59.651 --> 02:28:02.403
 IN SPACE.  THEY'RE NOT LOCK
 STEP FOLLOWING IT BUT THEY'RE

02:28:02.404 --> 02:28:04.506
 BASICALLY ON SPRINGS THAT ARE
 ATTACHED AND THEY IMMEDIATELY

02:28:04.507 --> 02:28:11.469
 BENEFIT FROM THAT INTERACT
 ACTIVITY.  SO THERE'S A TALK

02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:13.726
 BASED ON THIS FRIDAY
 AFTERNOON, ALL ABOUT THE NEW

02:28:13.727 --> 02:28:16.325
 PHYSICS BASED ANIMATION
 STUFF.  PLEASE COME THAT IF

02:28:16.326 --> 02:28:19.556
 YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT
 THAT.

02:28:19.557 --> 02:28:22.978
 ART-BASED, THIS WAS MENTIONED
 IN THE KEYNOTES.  WE THOUGHT

02:28:22.979 --> 02:28:25.405
 SOMETIMES ANDROID DEVELOPMENT
 IS A LITTLE HARDER THAN IT

02:28:25.406 --> 02:28:28.043
 NEEDS TO BE SO WE TOOK A STEP
 BACK AND SAID OKAY WHAT ARE

02:28:28.044 --> 02:28:31.872
 SOME OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WE
 SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER RUN AT TO

02:28:31.873 --> 02:28:35.900
 START TO SIMPLIFY THIS TO FOR
 APP VERLTS AND A COUPLE OF

02:28:35.901 --> 02:28:39.655
 THESE WE HAVE TAKEN RUNS AT
 RIGHT NOW ARE AROUND LIFE

02:28:39.656 --> 02:28:42.681
 CYCLE.  IT'S APPARENTLY HARD
 TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT

02:28:42.682 --> 02:28:45.295
 YOUR ACTIVITIES CAN DIE
 ANYTIME WHEN YOU ROTATE THE

02:28:45.296 --> 02:28:46.723
 STREEN OR GOES IN THE
 BACKGROUND OR WHATEVER AND

02:28:46.724 --> 02:28:50.053
 FINDING OUT EXACTLY WHAT
 STATE YOU'RE IN CAN BE A BIT

02:28:50.054 --> 02:28:53.371
 TEDIOUS.  IT IS AN ONGOING
 ISSUE ALL APP DEVELOPERS NEED

02:28:53.372 --> 02:28:57.320
 TO DEAL WITH SO WE'VE TAKEN
 ANOTHER APPROACH TO THAT TO

02:28:57.321 --> 02:29:00.034
 MAKE IT MUCH EASIER AND IN
 ADDITION TO THAT WE'VE TAKEN

02:29:00.035 --> 02:29:04.788
 A LOOK AT PERSISTENCE SO.  SO
 WE HAVE A NEW WAY OF DOING

02:29:04.789 --> 02:29:06.816
 THAT THAT BUILDS ON THAT
 CAPABILITY AND MAKES IT

02:29:06.817 --> 02:29:08.651
 EASIER AND MORE POWERFUL. 
 AND WE'RE GOING TO YOU CAN AT

02:29:08.652 --> 02:29:12.285
 THAT ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THIS
 WEEK.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN

02:29:12.286 --> 02:29:14.729
 INTRODUCTION TO ARCHITECTURE
 COMPONENTS I WOULD ENCOURAGE

02:29:14.730 --> 02:29:17.024
 YOU TO GO TO THIS AFTERNOON. 
 THAT'S ACTUALLY IMMEDIATELY

02:29:17.025 --> 02:29:20.146
 AFTER THIS SESSION.  AND THEN
 TOMORROW MORNING WE'RE GOING

02:29:20.147 --> 02:29:22.872
 TO HAVE ONE ON THE LIFE CYCLE
 PROBLEM AND HOW WE'VE SOLVED

02:29:22.873 --> 02:29:25.623
 THAT AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO
 HAVE ONE ON PERSISTENCE AND

02:29:25.624 --> 02:29:27.718
 OFFLINE.  AND ALL OF THESE
 ARE BITS THAT YOU CAN

02:29:27.719 --> 02:29:31.359
 ACTUALLY TRY OUT IN AN EARLY
 RELEASE FORM ALREADY.  SO

02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:33.696
 CHECK THOSE OUT.  HOPEFULLY
 IT WILL MAKE YOUR DEVELOPER

02:29:33.697 --> 02:29:35.493
 LIVES EASIER.
 THERE ARE SOME BEHAVIOR

02:29:35.494 --> 02:29:37.830
 CHANGES SOME OF WHICH YOU'RE
 GOING TO CARE ABOUT MORE THAN

02:29:37.831 --> 02:29:40.547
 OTHERS.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
 CHANGES TO THE BEHAVIOR OF

02:29:40.548 --> 02:29:46.098
 BACKGROUND APPLICATIONS; IN
 PARTICULAR, ROGUES LOCATION.  

02:29:46.099 --> 02:29:48.025
IF YOU
 ARE RUNNING AS A BACKGROUND

02:29:48.026 --> 02:29:50.853
 APPLICATION YOU ARE ONLY
 GOING TO GET COARSE GRAINED

02:29:50.854 --> 02:29:53.979
 LOCATION INFORMATION.  ALL OF
 THESE THINGS ARE BEING DONE

02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:57.530
 NOT TO NEIGHBORING IT HARDER
 BUT TO MAKE THE DEVICE

02:29:57.531 --> 02:30:01.452
 BETTER.  IF ALL APPLICATIONS
 HAVE LOCATION AT ANY TIME AND

02:30:01.453 --> 02:30:04.685
 THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY
 WANT TO AT ANY TIME THEN

02:30:04.686 --> 02:30:07.532
 ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE GOING TO
 RUN THE BATTERY DOWN BECAUSE

02:30:07.533 --> 02:30:10.247
 EVERYBODY USING BARYT BATTERY 
ALL

02:30:10.248 --> 02:30:13.577
 THE TIME.  SO WE'RE TRYING TO
 BE JUDICIOUS ABOUT WHICH

02:30:13.578 --> 02:30:15.711
 APPLICATION NEEDS IT AT WHAT
 TIME SO YOU CAN MAKE THE

02:30:15.712 --> 02:30:17.962
 EXPERIENCE FOR YOUR USERS
 MUCH BETTER AS HE WILL.  SO

02:30:17.963 --> 02:30:20.357
 ONE OF THOSE IS IN LOCATION,
 COARSE GRAINED INFORMATION

02:30:20.358 --> 02:30:21.984
 WHEN YOU'RE IN THE
 BACKGROUND.  ANOTHER ONE IS

02:30:21.985 --> 02:30:26.218
 ONEBOX.  WE
 WAKELOCKS.  WE NOTICED IT IS

02:30:26.219 --> 02:30:30.754
 COMMON FOR AN APPLICATION TO
 GO INTO A CACHE STATE AND TO

02:30:30.755 --> 02:30:33.083
 WOULD JUST KEEP THAT WAKELOCK
 AND IT WOULD HOLD IT FOR A

02:30:33.084 --> 02:30:35.406
 REALLY LONG TIME AND THAT
 REALLY RUNS THE BATTERY YOU

02:30:35.407 --> 02:30:38.759
  DOWN. 
 SO NOW SOMETIME AFTER YOU GO

02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:41.863
 INTO A CACHE STATE THE
 WAKELOCK IS AUTOMATICALLY

02:30:41.864 --> 02:30:44.597
 RELEASED SO IT DOESN'T PUT
 THE DEVICE INTO THAT UNSEEMLY

02:30:44.598 --> 02:30:46.310
 STATE.
 AND ALSO THERE ARE LIMITS TO

02:30:46.311 --> 02:30:48.642
 EXECUTION WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING
 IN THE BACKGROUND.  THERE

02:30:48.643 --> 02:30:51.572
 HAVE ALSO BEEN CHANGES TO
 ALERT WINDOWS.  IN

02:30:51.573 --> 02:30:54.088
 PARTICULAR, THERE'S THIS NEW
 TYPE OF WINDOW CALLED TYPE

02:30:54.089 --> 02:30:58.134
 APPLICATION OVERLAY.  IF YOU
 ARE TARGETING THE O SDK, THEN

02:30:58.135 --> 02:31:01.186
 THIS IS THE WINDOW TYPE YOU
 MUST USE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE

02:31:01.187 --> 02:31:04.486
 AN ALERT WINDOW CAPABILITY. 
 IF YOU'RE ON EARLIER

02:31:04.487 --> 02:31:06.231
 RELEASES, OBVIOUSLY THAT
 DIDN'T EXIST, YOU'RE NOT

02:31:06.232 --> 02:31:10.156
 GOING TO USE THIS.  JUST KNOW
 THAT WHATEVER WINDOW TYPE

02:31:10.157 --> 02:31:13.188
 YOU'RE USING IS GOING TO BE
 LAYERED UNDER ONE OF THESE

02:31:13.189 --> 02:31:15.514
 TYPE OVERLAY WINDOWS BECAUSE
 WE HAVE A MORE CLEARLY

02:31:15.515 --> 02:31:17.744
 DEFINED LAYERING POLICY NOW
 WITH THAT.

02:31:17.745 --> 02:31:20.861
 THERE IS MORE INFORMATION
 ABOUT THIS THIS AFTERNOON AT

02:31:20.862 --> 02:31:24.195
 5:00, BACKGROUND CHECK AND
 OTHER INSIGHTS.  SO PLEASE

02:31:24.196 --> 02:31:26.109
 COME TO THAT IF YOU WANT TO
 KNOW ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT

02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:28.636
 THAT.
 AND THEN FINALLY, WE PROMISED

02:31:28.637 --> 02:31:30.167
 TO GET BACK TO THIS, DIDN'T
 WE?

02:31:30.168 --> 02:31:33.805
 Dan Sandler:  WE DID.  THIS
 IS ONE ONE MORE THING; RIGHT?

02:31:33.806 --> 02:31:36.316
 Chet Haase:  SO WE WERE GOING
 TO TALK ABOUT "THIS."  AND I

02:31:36.317 --> 02:31:38.942
 MEAN, WE HAVE TO HAVE A DRUM
 ROLL, DON'T WE?  HOW ABOUT

02:31:38.943 --> 02:31:42.696
 LIKE A THIGH ROLL?  CAN WE
 HAVE A THIGH ROLL?

02:31:42.697 --> 02:31:45.908
 ALL RIGHT.
 Dan Sandler:  THAT SOUNDS

02:31:45.909 --> 02:31:47.121
 NICE.
 Chet Haase:  UNFORTUNATELY

02:31:47.122 --> 02:31:49.755
 I'M LOOKING AT THE TIMER ON
 STAGE AND I'M GOING TO SAY

02:31:49.756 --> 02:31:53.274
 THAT O STANDS FOR -- OH, NO,
 WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

 GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY.  MY
 NAME IS SRIDHAR.  THANK YOU FOR

02:48:16.805 --> 02:48:21.070
 JOINING ME HERE TODAY.
 IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HAVE I/O

02:48:21.071 --> 02:48:24.675
 RIGHT IN OUR BACKYARD AT
 SHORELINE AGAIN.

02:48:24.676 --> 02:48:27.407
 IT'S A REAL HIGHLIGHT FOR ME.  
I

02:48:27.408 --> 02:48:31.862
 GET TO MEET OTHER ENGINEERS,
 DEVELOPERS, AND PRODUCT

02:48:35.994 --> 02:48:37.320
WORLD
 AND CHECK OUT ALL THE AMAZING

02:48:37.321 --> 02:48:38.428
 THINGS THAT YOU ARE BUILDING.  
I

02:48:38.429 --> 02:48:43.379
 HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO
 SOME OF YOU.  AND I'M IN AWE OF

02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:47.311
 ALL THE CREATIVITY THAT iOS
 SEEN. I'VE

02:48:47.312 --> 02:48:48.831
 SEEN.
 YOU REPRESENT THE BEST

02:48:48.832 --> 02:48:53.878
 DEVELOPERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. 
 I'M SURE THAT THE CREATORS OF

02:48:53.879 --> 02:48:59.572
 THE NEXT POKEMON GO, FLIPKART,
 OR AIRBNB ARE RIGHT HERE IN 

02:48:59.573 --> 02:49:02.976
THIS
 AUDIENCE.  BUT CREATING A

02:49:02.977 --> 02:49:07.318
 SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS TAKES MORE
 THAN JUST AN AWESOME PRODUCT. 

02:49:07.319 --> 02:49:11.857
 ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT.
 I KNOW OF MANY GREAT PRODUCTS

02:49:11.858 --> 02:49:14.081
 THAT, LIKE, AREN'T REALLY 
AROUND

02:49:14.082 --> 02:49:16.149

 PROFITABLE BUSINESSES?  TODAY
 WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THREE

02:49:35.269 --> 02:49:39.519
 THINGS YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON TO
 GET THERE.

02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:43.646
 NUMBER ONE IS DEVELOPING
 SEAMLESS PAYMENT EXPERIENCES. 

02:49:43.647 --> 02:49:48.835
 NUMBER TWO, EARNING MORE FROM
 YOUR APPS.  AND NUMBER THREE,

02:49:48.836 --> 02:49:53.661
 GROWING BY FINDING MORE OF YOUR
 BEST CUSTOMERS.

02:49:53.662 --> 02:49:56.064

 FOR ALL OF YOUR COMPETITION,
 TOO.  AND PEOPLE HAVE WAY MORE

02:50:34.327 --> 02:50:39.596
 CHOICE NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. 
 OVER 5 MILLION APPS, MANY, MANY

02:50:39.597 --> 02:50:43.518
 MORE SITES THAN THAT, HUNDREDS
 OF TV CHANNELS, SOCIAL MEDIA, 

02:50:43.519 --> 02:50:45.255
IT
 GOES ON AND ON.  SO HOW ARE YOU

02:50:45.256 --> 02:50:48.271
 GOING TO STAND OUT IN THIS SEA
 OF AMAZING CHOICES?

02:50:48.272 --> 02:50:55.441
 JIM LYSKI, THE CMO OF CARMAX,
 RECENTLY PUT IT THIS WAY: 

02:50:55.442 --> 02:50:57.357
 CONSUMERS USED TO EVALUATE 
THEIR

02:50:57.358 --> 02:51:04.234
 EXPERIENCES IN SILOS.  I'LL
 COMPARE CARMAX AGAINST ALL 

02:51:04.235 --> 02:51:06.784
OTHER
 USED CAR DEALERS, AND I'LL

02:51:06.785 --> 02:51:10.183
 COMPARE NORDSTROM AGAINST ALL
 OTHER CLOTHING RETAILERS.

02:51:10.184 --> 02:51:12.316
 LET'S GO BACK ONE SLIDE, 
PLEASE,

02:51:12.317 --> 02:51:14.740
 ONE SLIDE FORWARD.
 BUT NOW PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY

02:51:14.741 --> 02:51:19.574
 TAKING THOSE BEST EXPERIENCES
 FROM ONE INDUSTRY AND DEMANDING

02:51:19.575 --> 02:51:25.140
 THAT THEY RECEIVE THE SAME OR
 BETTER EVERYWHERE.  IF THEY CAN

02:51:25.141 --> 02:51:29.671
 ORDER A VERY SPECIFIC CUP OF
 COFFEE AND GET IT EVERY 

02:51:29.672 --> 02:51:32.503
MORNING,
 WHY CAN'T THEY HAVE AN

02:51:32.504 --> 02:51:36.042
 EXPERIENCE THAT'S BESPOKE AND
 CUSTOMIZED FOR THEM WHEN THEY

02:51:36.043 --> 02:51:41.085
 BUY A CAR?  THAT MAKES SENSE.
 WITH SO MUCH COMPETITION AND

02:51:41.086 --> 02:51:44.017
 INCREASING CUSTOMER
 EXPECTATIONS, YOU CAN'T WIN

02:51:44.018 --> 02:51:48.152
 CUSTOMERS WITH A ONE SIZE FITS
 ALL APPROACH.

02:51:48.153 --> 02:51:51.584
 THIS REALLY CALLS FOR NEW
 STRATEGIES THAT PUTS THE FOCUS

02:51:51.585 --> 02:51:54.714
 ON EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER.  
IT

02:51:54.715 --> 02:51:58.645
 MEANS UNDERSTANDING YOUR
 CUSTOMERS AND HOW THEY DIFFER.

02:51:58.646 --> 02:52:02.189
 IT MEANS CREATING GROWTH AND
 MONETIZATION STRATEGIES THAT

02:52:02.190 --> 02:52:05.925
 REFLECT THOSE INSIGHTS.
 AND IT MEANS USING TOOLS THAT

02:52:05.926 --> 02:52:08.645
 ARE POWERFUL AND FLEXIBLE 
ENOUGH

02:52:08.646 --> 02:52:14.188
 TO ACT ON THAT INFORMATION.
 AND THIS IS WHERE WE THINK WE

02:52:14.189 --> 02:52:18.229
 CAN HELP.  ONLY GOOGLE CAN
 PROVIDE YOU WITH THE TOOLS AND

02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:22.363
 TECHNOLOGY THAT HELP YOU PUT
 YOUR CUSTOMERS AT THE CENTER OF

02:52:22.364 --> 02:52:27.613
 HOW YOU DEVELOP, EARN, AND GROW
 FROM YOUR PRODUCT.

02:52:27.614 --> 02:52:29.842
 TO START WITH, WE'RE HELPING 
YOU

02:52:29.843 --> 02:52:35.093
 DEVELOP EASIER WAYS TO PAY FOR
 YOUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  

02:52:35.094 --> 02:52:37.106
HOW
 MANY OF YOU HAVE ABANDONED A

02:52:37.107 --> 02:52:40.548
 SHOPPING CART ONLINE?  I DID
 JUST YESTERDAY.  SOMETIMES IT

02:52:40.549 --> 02:52:43.985
 TAKES REALLY LONG TO CHECK OUT
 OR YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR CREDIT

02:52:43.986 --> 02:52:48.031
 CARD HANDY.  EITHER WAY, IT'S A
 PRETTY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE,

02:52:48.032 --> 02:52:51.761
 BOTH FOR YOU, YOU DIDN'T GET
 WHAT YOU WANT DONE, AND FOR THE

02:52:51.762 --> 02:52:54.383
 BUSINESS THAT LOST YOUR MONEY. 
 PAYING ONLINE SHOULD BE EASY.

02:52:54.384 --> 02:52:58.234
 AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
 WHY WE'VE MADE THIS A TOP

02:52:58.235 --> 02:53:03.170
 PRIORITY FOR GOOGLE.  OUR OPEN
 PLATFORM APPROACH MAXIMIZES THE

02:53:03.171 --> 02:53:08.417
 WAY IN WHICH PEOPLE CAN PAY AND
 THE WAYS YOU CAN GET PAID.  WE

02:53:08.418 --> 02:53:12.159
 WANT TO PROVIDE A SEAMLESS,
 CONSISTENT EXPERIENCE ACROSS

02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:17.495
 DEVICES AND ACROSS PLATFORMS.
 HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

02:53:17.496 --> 02:53:21.249
 HAVE ALREADY SAVED THEIR
 PREFERRED PAYMENT METHOD, LIKE 

02:53:21.250 --> 02:53:24.082
A
 CREDIT CARD OR A DEBIT CARD, TO

02:53:24.083 --> 02:53:26.183
 THEIR GOOGLE ACCOUNT.  AND 
TODAY

02:53:26.184 --> 02:53:28.513
 WE'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE A
 DEVELOPER SOLUTION THAT WILL

02:53:28.514 --> 02:53:31.744
 ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE THESE SAVED
 CARDS WHEN CHECKING OUT IN YOUR

02:53:31.745 --> 02:53:37.399
 APPS, SITES, AND MORE WITH JUST
 ONE SINGLE BUTTON.

02:53:37.400 --> 02:53:40.338
 PAYMENTS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF
 THE CONVERSION PROCESS, AND WE

02:53:40.339 --> 02:53:45.600
 WANT TO HELP YOU MAKE IT AS
 QUICK AND AS EASY AS POSSIBLE.

02:53:45.601 --> 02:53:49.718
 AND WHEN YOU MAKE IT EASIER FOR
 PEOPLE TO PAY FOR WHAT THEY

02:53:49.719 --> 02:53:55.980
 WANT, YOU WIN.
 IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

02:53:55.981 --> 02:53:59.925
 NEXT UP, EARNING MORE FROM YOUR
 APPS.

02:53:59.926 --> 02:54:03.857
 WHILE SOME OF YOUR USERS MIGHT
 MAKE IN-APP PURCHASES, LET'S

02:54:03.858 --> 02:54:08.658
 FACE IT, THE MAJORITY NEVER
 REALLY DO.  AND THAT'S WHY

02:54:08.659 --> 02:54:09.323
 EARNING MONEY WITH IN-APP ADS 
IS

02:54:09.324 --> 02:54:14.194
 THE MOST COMMON REVENUE MODEL
 FOR MOBILE BUSINESSES.

02:54:14.195 --> 02:54:17.496
 ADMOB HELPS YOU DO THAT.  
TODAY,

02:54:17.497 --> 02:54:20.228
 OVER A MILLION APPS USE ADMOB 
TO

02:54:20.229 --> 02:54:25.474
 MAKE MONEY ON iOS AND ON
 ANDROID.  IN FACT, TO DATE,

02:54:25.475 --> 02:54:29.511
 WE'VE PAID OUT OVER $3.5 
BILLION

02:54:29.512 --> 02:54:35.354
 IN ADS REVENUE TO ADMOB
 DEVELOPERS, LIKE YOU, MORE THAN

02:54:35.355 --> 02:54:40.314
 ANY OTHER AD NETWORK.
 AND A TRULY CUSTOMER-CENTRIC

02:54:40.315 --> 02:54:42.933
 MONETIZATION STRATEGY MEANS YOU
 MONETIZE DIFFERENT USER GROUPS

02:54:42.934 --> 02:54:47.186
 IN DIFFERENT WAYS.  FOR THAT,
 YOU NEED A SOLUTION THAT'S

02:54:47.187 --> 02:54:51.529
 POWERED BY INSIGHTS, ONE THAT
 OFFERS GREAT AD FORMATS,

02:54:51.530 --> 02:54:53.944
 EASY-TO-USE TOOLS, AND HELPS 
YOU

02:54:53.945 --> 02:54:57.573
 SCALE TO MEET INCREASING GLOBAL
 DEMAND.

02:54:57.574 --> 02:55:00.728
 AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO SHOW
 YOU A COMPLETELY REIMAGINED

02:55:00.729 --> 02:55:03.947
 ADMOB, REBUILT FROM THE GROUND
 UP, BASED ON YOUR FEEDBACK TO

02:55:03.948 --> 02:55:08.915
 GIVE YOU ALL OF THAT AND MORE
 FOR YOUR APPS.

02:55:08.916 --> 02:55:11.405
 AND LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, 
GROWING

02:55:11.406 --> 02:55:17.663
 YOUR USER BASE.  FINDING
 VALUABLE USERS ISN'T EASY.  LET

02:55:17.664 --> 02:55:23.211
 ME EXPLAIN.  I STILL LOVE
 PLAYING WORDS WITH FRIENDS.  I

02:55:23.212 --> 02:55:26.157
 KNOW!  AND PART OF WHAT I LOVE
 ABOUT THE APP IS THAT MY WIFE

02:55:26.158 --> 02:55:30.089
 AND I PLAY AGAINST EACH OTHER
 PRACTICALLY EVERY DAY.  USUALLY

02:55:30.090 --> 02:55:33.637
 HAVE MULTIPLE GAMES GOING ON ON
 ANY GIVEN MOMENT.  AND AFTER

02:55:33.638 --> 02:55:37.163
 PLAYING A TURN IN ONE GAME, YOU
 HAVE TO VIEW AN AD BEFORE BEING

02:55:37.164 --> 02:55:39.691
 ABLE TO PLAY A TURN IN ANOTHER
 GAME.

02:55:39.692 --> 02:55:43.538
 MY WIFE, WHO IS BLESSED WITH A
 LOT OF PATIENCE, WILL WAIT

02:55:43.539 --> 02:55:45.248
 BETWEEN EACH GAME.  ON THE 
OTHER

02:55:45.249 --> 02:55:49.908
 HAND, I PAID FOR THE PREMIUM
 VERSION OF THE GAME THAT LET ME

02:55:49.909 --> 02:55:52.105
 SWITCH BETWEEN UNLIMITED GAMES.

02:55:52.106 --> 02:55:55.241
 MY WIFE AND I ARE TWO USERS WHO
 INTERACT WITH APPS IN VERY

02:55:55.242 --> 02:55:58.464
 DIFFERENT WAYS, BOTH VALUABLE
 BUT QUITE DIFFERENT.

02:55:58.465 --> 02:56:03.008
 AND AS A DEVELOPER, YOU NEED TO
 VALUE US DIFFERENTLY.  TO THAT

02:56:03.009 --> 02:56:06.648
 END, YOU NEED A MARKETING TOOL
 THAT KNOWS AND CAN HELP YOU PAY

02:56:06.649 --> 02:56:10.880
 THE RIGHT AMOUNT WHEN ACQUIRING
 NEW CUSTOMERS WHO ARE LIKE ME 

02:56:10.881 --> 02:56:12.919
OR
 LIKE MY WIFE.

02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:17.654
 THAT'S WHY WE INTRODUCED
 UNIVERSAL APP CAMPAIGNS, WE 

02:56:17.655 --> 02:56:20.480
CALL
 IT UAC FOR SHORT.  UAC MAKES IT

02:56:20.481 --> 02:56:23.413
 EASY TO FIND USERS WHO NOT ONLY
 INSTALL YOUR APP BUT ACTUALLY

02:56:23.414 --> 02:56:28.761
 TAKE ACTIONS WITHIN THE APP. 
 UAC REACHES USERS ACROSS iOS

02:56:28.762 --> 02:56:35.327
 AND ANDROID ON EACH OF GOOGLE'S
 BILLION-USER PROPERTIES LIKE

02:56:35.328 --> 02:56:38.041
 GOOGLE PLAY, GOOGLE SEARCH,
 YOUTUBE, GMAIL, AS WELL AS THE

02:56:38.042 --> 02:56:42.492
 MILLIONS OF SITES AND APPS THAT
 ARE ON OUR DISPLAY NETWORK.

02:56:42.493 --> 02:56:43.897
 AND RATHER THAN HAVING TO 
MANAGE

02:56:43.898 --> 02:56:48.239
 MULTIPLE CAMPAIGNS AND MANUALLY
 OPTIMIZING EACH ONE ACROSS 

02:56:48.240 --> 02:56:50.148
THESE
 CHANNELS AND CONTEXTS, UAC DOES

02:56:50.149 --> 02:56:53.680
 THIS AUTOMATICALLY WITH ONE
 SINGLE CAMPAIGN.

02:56:53.681 --> 02:56:58.418
 IT USES MACHINE LEARNING, AND
 AI, TO IMPROVE AND MAKE YOUR

02:56:58.419 --> 02:57:02.666
 CAMPAIGN SMARTER WITH EVERY
 SINGLE APP.  AND IT LEARNS FROM

02:57:02.667 --> 02:57:05.789
 COUNTLESS SIGNALS LIKE WHERE
 PEOPLE ARE ENGAGING MOST WITH

02:57:05.790 --> 02:57:09.020
 YOUR APP AND WHICH CREATIVE
 WORKS BEST, ALL IN REALTIME.

02:57:09.021 --> 02:57:12.260
 AND WITH OVER HALF A DOZEN
 BILLION-USER PROPERTIES, WE 

02:57:12.261 --> 02:57:14.364
HAVE
 THE POWER TO FIND YOUR USERS

02:57:14.365 --> 02:57:17.645
 WITH BOTH SIMPLICITY AND 
MASSIVE

02:57:17.646 --> 02:57:22.222
 SCALE.  AND IT'S WORKING.
 AT I/O LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED

02:57:22.223 --> 02:57:26.567
 THAT OUR APP ADS HAD DELIVERED
 OVER 2 BILLION APP INSTALLS. 

02:57:26.568 --> 02:57:28.585
 THIS YEAR, I'M PRETTY EXCITED 
TO

02:57:28.586 --> 02:57:33.432
 SHARE THAT THIS HAS GROWN BY A
 FACTOR OF 2.5 TO OVER 5 PLUS

02:57:33.433 --> 02:57:38.080
 BILLION APP INSTALLS.
 BETTER YET, WE'RE NOW HELPING

02:57:38.081 --> 02:57:41.114
 ADVERTISERS DRIVE OVER 3 
BILLION

02:57:41.115 --> 02:57:43.724
 IN-APP ACTIONS PER QUARTER. 
 THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE TAKING

02:57:43.725 --> 02:57:49.665
 REAL ACTIONS INSIDE YOUR APP.
 UNIVERSAL APP CAMPAIGNS ARE

02:57:49.666 --> 02:57:52.588
 TRANSFORMING THE WAY DEVELOPERS
 AND MARKETERS REACH AND ACQUIRE

02:57:52.589 --> 02:57:56.636
 THE RIGHT USERS, AND WE TRULY
 THINK THIS IS THE FUTURE OF APP

02:57:56.637 --> 02:57:59.666
 GROWTH.
 AND TO DELIVER MORE VALUE TO

02:57:59.667 --> 02:58:01.270
 DEVELOPERS AND MARKETERS, WE 
ARE

02:58:01.271 --> 02:58:04.821
 BUNDLING ALL FUTURE APP GROWTH
 INNOVATIONS RIGHT INTO UAC,

02:58:04.822 --> 02:58:07.838
 MAKING IT A ONE-STOP SHOP TO 
GET

02:58:07.839 --> 02:58:10.870
 STUFF DONE.
 I'M AN ENGINEER.  I'M REALLY

02:58:10.871 --> 02:58:12.988
 PROUD OF THESE NEW INNOVATIONS.

02:58:12.989 --> 02:58:16.523
 AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT HOW THEY
 CAN HELP YOU UNDERSTAND AND

02:58:16.524 --> 02:58:20.660
 BETTER SERVE YOUR CUSTOMERS IN
 ORDER TO STAND OUT IN WHAT'S A

02:58:20.661 --> 02:58:24.800
 REALLY COMPETITIVE ECOSYSTEM.
 SO WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO BRING

02:58:24.801 --> 02:58:28.638
 UP MY TEAM TO DIVE DEEPER INTO
 THESE INNOVATIONS.  AND WE'RE

02:58:28.639 --> 02:58:32.683
 GOING TO KICK IT OFF WITH PALI
 BHAT.  THANK YOU.

02:58:32.684 --> 02:58:34.684
 [ APPLAUSE ]

02:58:38.841 --> 02:58:43.993
 Pali Bhat:  THANKS, SRIDHAR.
 HELLO, EVERYONE.  I'M PALI, AND

02:58:43.994 --> 02:58:46.632
 I'M THE PRODUCT LEAD FOR
 PAYMENTS AT GOOGLE.  TODAY I

02:58:46.633 --> 02:58:49.848
 WANT TO SHARE HOW YOU CAN MAKE
 IT EASY FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS TO

02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:53.791
 PAY FOR YOUR PRODUCTS AND
 SERVICES WHILE GIVING THEM A

02:58:53.792 --> 02:58:58.242
 DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE.
 NOW, YOUR CUSTOMERS EXPECT TO

02:58:58.243 --> 02:59:03.072
 ENGAGE WITH YOU WHEREVER THEY
 ARE, WHETHER IT'S ON YOUR 

02:59:03.073 --> 02:59:07.526
MOBILE
 WEB SITE OR ON YOUR APP OR IN

02:59:07.527 --> 02:59:08.833
 THE FUTURE THROUGH THE
 ASSISTANT.

02:59:08.834 --> 02:59:14.593
 NOW, ACROSS ALL THESE SURFACES,
 THEY EXPECT CHECKOUT TO BE FAST

02:59:14.594 --> 02:59:21.137
 AND EASY.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE
 CHECKOUT SCREEN IS A SINGLE

02:59:21.138 --> 02:59:25.880
 BIGGEST SOURCE OF FRICTION IN
 THE PURCHASE EXPERIENCE TODAY.

02:59:25.881 --> 02:59:31.752
 IN FACT, THE PROBLEM IS EVEN
 MORE ACUTE ON MOBILE WHERE

02:59:31.753 --> 02:59:34.778
 CONVERGENCE ARE A FULL 1/3 
LOWER

02:59:34.779 --> 02:59:39.813
 RELATIVE TO DESKTOP.  AND A
 LARGE REASON FOR THAT IS 

02:59:39.814 --> 02:59:41.838
BECAUSE
 THE EXISTING DESKTOP CHECKOUT

02:59:41.839 --> 02:59:44.978
 EXPERIENCE, WHICH HAS BEEN
 OPTIMIZED OVER A PERIOD OF

02:59:44.979 --> 02:59:48.704
 20 YEARS, SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK
 WELL ON MOBILE.

02:59:48.705 --> 02:59:55.975
 NOW, LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED OUR
 FIRST SET OF SOLUTIONS TO THIS

02:59:55.976 --> 03:00:01.015
 COMPLEX ISSUE WITH ANDROID PAY
 SERVING AS YOUR PASSPORT TO 

03:00:01.016 --> 03:00:02.430
GIVE
 YOUR CUSTOMERS A STREAMLINED

03:00:02.431 --> 03:00:05.159
 CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE.  WE HAVE
 SEEN TREMENDOUS PROGRESS OVER

03:00:05.160 --> 03:00:07.899
 THE LAST TEN MONTHS WITH 
ANDROID

03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:12.141
 PAY NOW BEING AVAILABLE IN TEN
 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD.

03:00:12.142 --> 03:00:17.423
 I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE
 ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING 

03:00:17.424 --> 03:00:18.992
ANDROID

 THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, INCLUDING
 BRAZIL, CANADA, RUSSIA, SPAIN,

03:00:24.736 --> 03:00:26.736
 AND TAIWAN.

03:00:29.288 --> 03:00:31.288
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

03:00:35.027 --> 03:00:37.754
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN TREMENDOUS
 MOMENTUM ON THE APP SIDE WITH

03:00:37.755 --> 03:00:44.314
 THOUSANDS OF TOP DEVELOPERS
 HAVING ADOPTED ANDROID PAY TO

03:00:44.315 --> 03:00:50.566
 DELIVER A SEAMLESS CHECKOUT
 EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR USERS.

03:00:50.567 --> 03:00:53.799
 BUT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
 BRING THIS EXPERIENCE TO EVEN

03:00:53.800 --> 03:00:58.161
 MORE USERS, AND WE CAN DO THAT
 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF YOU

03:00:58.162 --> 03:01:01.784
 IN THE PAYMENTS ECOSYSTEM.  SO
 I'M EXCITED TO SHARE ONE OF THE

03:01:01.785 --> 03:01:06.322
 FIRST COLLABORATIONS THAT IS
 GOING TO DELIVER A VERY, VERY

03:01:06.323 --> 03:01:11.821
 MEANINGFUL NUMBER OF USERS A
 MUCH, MUCH BETTER CHECKOUT

03:01:11.822 --> 03:01:16.132
 EXPERIENCE.  WE'VE DONE THIS IN
 COLLABORATION WITH OUR FRIENDS

03:01:16.133 --> 03:01:19.238
 AT PAYPAL WHERE PAYPAL USERS 
ARE

03:01:19.239 --> 03:01:23.474
 GOING TO GET THE STREAMLINED
 ANDROID PAY EXPERIENCE SIMPLY 

03:01:23.475 --> 03:01:25.552
BY
 LINKING THE PAYPAL ACCOUNT TO

03:01:25.553 --> 03:01:30.345
 ANDROID PAY.  SO VERY EXCITED
 ABOUT THIS.

03:01:30.346 --> 03:01:34.601
 SO LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THIS IS
 GOING TO WORK ON THE MOBILE 

03:01:34.602 --> 03:01:35.703
WEB. 
 SO THINKING THROUGH WHAT I'M

03:01:35.704 --> 03:01:39.954
 GOING TO SHOW YOU ALL IN TERMS
 OF, LIKE, BUYING SOMETHING,

03:01:39.955 --> 03:01:45.702
 USING PAYPAL AND ANDROID PAY IN
 ACTION, I THOUGHT OF MY

03:01:45.703 --> 03:01:52.880
 8-YEAR-OLD.  EARLIER THIS WEEK
 HE HAD A "DRESS YOUR COLOR" DAY

03:01:52.881 --> 03:01:55.703
 AT SCHOOL.  "DRESS YOUR COLOR"
 MEANS YOU HAVE TO PICK YOUR

03:01:55.704 --> 03:01:59.037
 FAVORITE COLOR AND WHERE YOUR
 ENTIRE OUTFIT IN THAT COLOR. 

03:01:59.038 --> 03:02:05.303
 HIS FAVORITE COLOR IS BLUE.  SO
 HE HAD ON BLUE JEANS.  HE HAD A

03:02:05.304 --> 03:02:08.078
 BLUE TOP.  HE HAD A BLUE 
HOODIE. 

03:02:08.079 --> 03:02:12.718
 AND, OF COURSE, BECAUSE IT
 WASN'T BLUE ENOUGH, HE EVEN HAD

03:02:12.719 --> 03:02:16.909
 A HOMEMADE BLUE CAPE.  THE ONLY
 THING THAT WAS MISSING WAS BLUE

03:02:16.910 --> 03:02:22.244
 SHOES.  SO I FIGURED I WOULD
 SURPRISE HIM AND BUY HIM SOME

03:02:22.245 --> 03:02:25.907
 BLEW SHOES TODAY ON NIKE.COM. 
 LET ME SHOW YOU HOW THIS WORKS.

03:02:25.908 --> 03:02:32.679
 LET ME SWITCH TO THE PHONE,
 PLEASE, FOR PAYPAL.

03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:37.432
 WONDERFUL.
 SO I'M GOING TO BRING UP

03:02:37.433 --> 03:02:40.344
 NIKE.COM ON THE CHROME BROWSER.

03:02:40.345 --> 03:02:47.933
 AND I'VE ALREADY PICKED OUT THE
 SHOES.  I'VE GOT SOME SUEDE 

03:02:47.934 --> 03:02:48.737
BLUE
 SHOES.  WHEN I'M READY TO CHECK

03:02:48.738 --> 03:02:50.344
 OUT, I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT 
WITH

03:02:50.345 --> 03:02:59.434
 PAYPAL AS USUAL.  AND YOU'LL
 NOTICE THAT THAT GETS ANDROID

03:02:59.435 --> 03:03:03.813
 PAY GOING.  AND INSTEAD OF
 HAVING TO HAVE TO ENTER MY USER

03:03:03.814 --> 03:03:09.226
 NAME OR PASSWORD, ALL I NEED TO
 DO IS USE MY FINGERPRINT,

03:03:09.227 --> 03:03:14.074
 AUTHORIZE, AND I'M DONE.; 
RIGHT? 

03:03:14.075 --> 03:03:16.075
 NO MORE ENTERING YURN

03:03:18.935 --> 03:03:19.911
 USERNAMES OR
 PASSWORDS OR HAVING TO CREATE 

03:03:19.912 --> 03:03:21.668
AN
 ACCOUNT.  YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO 

03:03:21.669 --> 03:03:22.954
USE
 YOUR FINGERPRINT.  NOW, THIS

03:03:22.955 --> 03:03:25.683
 EXPERIENCE IS GOING TO BE 
COMING

03:03:25.684 --> 03:03:29.627
 TO MANY OF THE PAYPAL'S 
MILLIONS

03:03:29.628 --> 03:03:33.046
 OF SITES OVER THE COMING FEW
 MONTHS AND EVENTUALLY ROLL OUT

03:03:33.047 --> 03:03:37.188
 TO ALL OF THEIR SITES THAT HAVE
 IMPLEMENTED PAYPAL.

03:03:37.189 --> 03:03:39.709
 NOW, LET'S SWITCH BACK TO THE

03:03:42.836 --> 03:03:44.836
SCREEN.
 THE SLIDES,

03:03:46.972 --> 03:03:48.785
 PLEASE.
 CAN YOU SWITCH BACK TO THE

03:03:48.786 --> 03:03:50.786
 SLIDES, PLEASE?

03:03:53.031 --> 03:03:56.466
 HMM.
 AWESOME.

03:03:56.467 --> 03:04:04.829
 WE WANT TO BRING THE SAME
 EXPERIENCE TO VISA CHECKOUT AND

03:04:04.830 --> 03:04:09.278
 MASTERPASS USERS.  VERY EXCITED
 ABOUT THAT.  AS EXCITED AS WE

03:04:09.279 --> 03:04:15.031
 ARE WITH ALL OF THE PROGRESS
 THAT WE'VE SEEN IN ANDROID PAY,

03:04:15.032 --> 03:04:22.697
 WE KNOW THAT OUR OVER 1 BILLION
 PLUS GOOGLE USERS DON'T ALL 

03:04:22.698 --> 03:04:23.411
HAVE
 ANDROID PAY.  OR FOR THAT

03:04:23.412 --> 03:04:31.483
 MATTER, ANY DIGITAL WALLET.
 HOWEVER, THESE GOOGLE USERS

03:04:31.484 --> 03:04:33.216
 FREQUENT POPULAR GOOGLE 
PRODUCTS

03:04:33.217 --> 03:04:37.533
 LIKE GOOGLE PLAY AND YOUTUBE,
 AND AS SRIDHAR MENTIONED HAVE

03:04:37.534 --> 03:04:41.811
 SAVED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
 CREDIT CARD AND DEB AT THIS 

03:04:41.812 --> 03:04:44.304
TIME
 CARDS TO THEIR GOOGLE ACCOUNTS.

03:04:44.305 --> 03:04:48.754
 SO TODAY WE WANT TO ANNOUNCE A
 SIMPLE API FOR ALL OF YOU

03:04:48.755 --> 03:04:52.485
 DEVELOPERS OUT THERE TO BE ABLE
 TO ACCEPT ALL OF THESE PAYMENT

03:04:52.486 --> 03:04:56.433
 METHODS THROUGH

03:04:59.941 --> 03:05:03.060
 GOOGLE.
 AND DEVELOPERS WHO ADOPT THIS

03:05:03.061 --> 03:05:08.044
 API CAN ENABLE AN EASY-TO-USE
 CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE FOR THEIR

03:05:08.045 --> 03:05:13.774
 CUSTOMERS.  AND, OF COURSE, AS
 WE DISCUSSED EARLIER, REDUCE 

03:05:13.775 --> 03:05:14.673
THE
 AMOUNT OF FRICTION WHICH CAN

03:05:14.674 --> 03:05:20.625
 LEAD TO HIGHER CONVERGENCE AND
 MORE REVENUES.  BEST OF ALL,

03:05:20.626 --> 03:05:23.161
 THIS NEW DEVELOPER API, WHICH 
WE

03:05:23.162 --> 03:05:28.711
 CALL THE GOOGLE PAYMENT API, IS
 GOING TO BE FREE FOR 

03:05:28.712 --> 03:05:30.712
DEVELOPERS.
 [ APPLAUSE

03:05:34.157 --> 03:05:36.783
 ]
 NOW, USERS DON'T NEED TO DO ANY

03:05:36.784 --> 03:05:40.307
 ADDITIONAL SETUP IF THEY'VE
 ALREADY SAVED THEIR PAYMENT

03:05:40.308 --> 03:05:44.954
 METHOD TO GOOGLE.  THEY SIMPLY
 SIGN IN AND GET THIS 

03:05:44.955 --> 03:05:46.563
STREAMLINED
 CHECKOUT EXPERIENCE.  NOW, 

03:05:46.564 --> 03:05:48.525
WE'VE
 BUILT THIS GOOGLE PAYMENT API 

03:05:48.526 --> 03:05:50.404
ON
 TOP OF THE PAYMENT REQUEST

03:05:50.405 --> 03:05:55.646
 STANDARD WHICH IS NOW A W3C
 SPEC.

03:05:55.647 --> 03:06:00.892
 NOW, DEVELOPERS CAN SIMPLY ADD
 THIS PAYMENT GOOGLE BUTTON TO

03:06:00.893 --> 03:06:04.435
 THEIR FAVORITE WEB SITES OR 
APPS

03:06:04.436 --> 03:06:07.163
 BY INTEGRATING WITH THE GOOGLE
 PAYMENT API.

03:06:07.164 --> 03:06:10.087
 I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A
 LITTLE STORY ABOUT THIS PAYMENT

03:06:10.088 --> 03:06:12.919
 GOOGLE BUTTON THAT YOU SEE 
HERE. 

03:06:12.920 --> 03:06:16.950
 THIS BUTTON IS VERY SIMILAR TO
 THE SIGN-IN WITH GOOGLE BUTTON

03:06:16.951 --> 03:06:20.486
 THAT USERS ARE ALREADY USED. 
TO. 

03:06:20.487 --> 03:06:23.010
 AND OUR TEAM WAS BRAINSTORMING
 ALL OF THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS

03:06:23.011 --> 03:06:26.865
 THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE ON
 THIS BUTTON, AND ONE OF MY

03:06:26.866 --> 03:06:33.107
 ABSOLUTE FAVORITE VARIANTS WAS
 "TREAT YOURSELF WITH GOOGLE."

03:06:33.108 --> 03:06:35.108
 [ LAUGHTER

03:06:37.046 --> 03:06:39.580
 ]
 NOW, WE DIDN'T LAND ON THAT, 

03:06:39.581 --> 03:06:42.200
BUT
 I THINK WE'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD

03:06:42.201 --> 03:06:45.932
 ALTERNATIVE WITH "PAY WITH
 GOOGLE."

03:06:45.933 --> 03:06:52.027
 SO SPEAKING OF TREATING MYSELF,
 I WANTED TO BUY SOME COOL NEW

03:06:52.028 --> 03:06:53.315
 HEADPHONES.  AND WISH IS 
EXACTLY

03:06:53.316 --> 03:06:56.136
 THE PLACE TO GET IT.  SO WE'VE
 BEEN DOING SOME WORK WITH OUR

03:06:56.137 --> 03:07:00.580
 FRIENDS OVER AT WISH TO ENABLE
 THIS COOL PAYMENT GOOGLE

03:07:00.581 --> 03:07:02.184
 EXPERIENCE.  LET ME SHOW YOU 
HOW

03:07:02.185 --> 03:07:05.930
 IT WORKS WITHIN THE APP.
 CAN WE SWITCH TO THE WISH 

03:07:05.931 --> 03:07:07.931
PHONE,
 PLEASE?  THANK

03:07:11.480 --> 03:07:16.623
 YOU.
 SO LET ME BRING UP THE WISH 

03:07:16.624 --> 03:07:19.074
APP. 
 I'VE ALREADY ADDED THE COOL

03:07:19.075 --> 03:07:21.208
 BLACK HEADPHONES THAT I WANTED
 TO MY CART.

03:07:28.138 --> 03:07:32.868
  AND WHENEVER I'M
 READY TO PAY, I SIMPLY NEED TO

03:07:32.869 --> 03:07:38.576
 PICK MY FORM OF PAYMENT AND
 HERE'S THE SPECIAL PART; RIGHT?

03:07:43.780 --> 03:07:48.622
 METHODS ALREADY ATTACHED TO MY
 GOOGLE ACCOUNT.  YOU SEE THAT

03:07:48.623 --> 03:07:52.466
 PAYPAL ACCOUNT THAT I JUST USED
 TO BUY THOSE COOL BLUE SHOES, I

03:07:52.467 --> 03:07:56.056
 HAVE THAT.  I HAVE THE
 MASTERCARD THAT I HAVE ADDED TO

03:07:56.057 --> 03:07:57.618
 ANDROID PAY AND, OF COURSE, I
 HAVE MY AMERICAN EXPRESS THAT I

03:07:57.619 --> 03:07:59.540
 HAVE SAVED TO MY GOOGLE 
ACCOUNT.

03:07:59.541 --> 03:08:05.906
 SO I'M GOING TO CONTINUE AND
 THAT'S IT.  I SLIDE TO PAY.;

03:08:05.907 --> 03:08:11.744
 RIGHT?  I DON'T NEED TO ENTER
 ANY USERNAMES, REMEMBER

03:08:11.745 --> 03:08:18.104
 PASSWORDS, OR HAVE TO CREATE A
 NEW ACCOUNT ON THE WISH SITE.

03:08:18.105 --> 03:08:20.942
 PAY WITH GOOGLE MAKES IT THAT
 SIMPLE.  NOW, THE WISH TEAM IS

03:08:20.943 --> 03:08:24.468
 GOING TO BE ROLLING OUT THIS
 "PAY WITH GOOGLE" EXPERIENCE TO

03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:27.101
 ALL OF THEIR USERS IN THE 
COMING

03:08:27.102 --> 03:08:31.355
 WEEKS.  BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN
 WORKING WITH A LOT OF THE TOP

03:08:31.356 --> 03:08:35.589
 DEVELOPERS TO ENABLE THIS PAY
 WITH GOOGLE EXPERIENCE TO MORE

03:08:35.590 --> 03:08:38.721
 USERS.  SO LET'S SWITCH TO THE
 SLIDES, PLEASE.

03:08:42.992 --> 03:08:44.268
 SO I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE  
THAT

03:08:44.269 --> 03:08:51.158
WE ARE SOON GOING TO  HAVE
AIRBNB, DELIVEROO,  DOORDASH, 

03:08:51.159 --> 03:08:53.251
AND
E24, INTEGRATED  WITH THE PAY

03:08:53.709 --> 03:08:54.832
WITH GOOGLE  EXPERIENCE, AND 
MANY

03:08:54.833 --> 03:08:56.239
MORE  DEVELOPERS ARE GOING TO BE

03:08:56.240 --> 03:08:59.381
COMING SOON.
 SO AS YOU SAW, THIS  EXPERIENCE

03:08:59.689 --> 03:09:02.079
IS SOMETHING  THAT'S GOING TO BE
AVAILABLE  NOT JUST IN THE 

03:09:02.080 --> 03:09:04.068
UNITED 
STATES, BUT ALSO 

03:09:04.069 --> 03:09:06.414
INTERNATIONALLY.  SO WE'RE  VERY
EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

03:09:06.706 --> 03:09:08.636
AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN  
THIS

03:09:08.637 --> 03:09:10.705
API, YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR  EARLY
ACCESS.

03:09:14.167 --> 03:09:19.352
SO THAT WAS PAY WITH GOOGLE,  IN
ACTION ACROSS   BOTH THE  MOBILE

03:09:19.751 --> 03:09:23.502
WEB AND WITHIN APPS.
BUT WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW  

03:09:23.503 --> 03:09:25.940
THE
ASSISTANT IS GOING TO BE  A HUGE

03:09:25.941 --> 03:09:31.932
NEW PLATFORM FOR  COMMERCE.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE  DONE

03:09:32.382 --> 03:09:35.728
IS WORK CLOSELY WITH THE 
ASSISTANT TEAM TO BRING THE  

03:09:35.729 --> 03:09:37.913
SAME
GREAT PAY WITH GOOGLE  

03:09:37.914 --> 03:09:40.305
EXPERIENCE
TO THE GOOGLE  ASSISTANT.

03:09:40.492 --> 03:09:42.625
NOW, IF YOU WERE AT THE  
KEYNOTE,

03:09:42.626 --> 03:09:47.616
I THINK YOU MIGHT  HAVE SEEN A
DEMO ALREADY OF  HOW THIS

03:09:47.617 --> 03:09:51.021
ORDERING EXPERIENCE  WOULD LOOK
ON PANERA.  NOW,  LET'S SEE THAT

03:09:51.205 --> 03:09:54.610
DEMO IN ACTION  AGAIN.
SO LET'S SWITCH TO THE DEMO  

03:09:54.611 --> 03:09:56.611
THAT
WE HAVE.

03:09:57.055 --> 03:09:59.055
 FOR THE  ASSISTANT.

03:10:02.570 --> 03:10:05.710
AND NOW, I'M GOING TO BE  TRYING
THIS ON THE ASSISTANT.   IT'S A

03:10:05.711 --> 03:10:10.443
LITTLE BIT NOISY IN  HERE, SO IF
EVERYONE CAN BEAR  WITH ME AND

03:10:10.737 --> 03:10:13.425
KEEP REAL QUIET,  WE'RE GOING TO
DO THIS LIVE.   OKAY?

03:10:15.319 --> 03:10:17.319
SO I'M GOING TO BRING UP THE 

03:10:19.674 --> 03:10:24.440
ASSISTANT AND THEN TRY TO  ORDER
A SANDWICH AND SOME  SMOOTHIES

03:10:24.706 --> 03:10:28.915
FROM PANERA.
YOU YOU HAD.

03:10:28.916 --> 03:10:30.945
Google:  THESE CAME BACK FROM  A

03:10:36.367 --> 03:10:38.192
SEARCH.
Pali Bhat:  TALK TO PANERA.

03:10:38.193 --> 03:10:40.162
Google:  I FOUND A COUPLE OF 
PLACES.

03:10:40.163 --> 03:10:43.426
Pali Bhat:  I THINK IT'S A  BIT
NOISY.  SO I'M GOING TO  TRY

03:10:43.427 --> 03:10:47.784
AGAIN.
TALK TO PANERA.

03:10:47.785 --> 03:10:50.520
Google:  I FOUND A COUPLE OF 
PLACES.

03:10:50.521 --> 03:10:53.923
Pali Bhat:  MM.
FEELS LIKE WE HAVE A LOT OF 

03:10:53.924 --> 03:10:55.502
NOISE IN HERE.  MAYBE WE CAN  
ALL

03:10:55.503 --> 03:10:59.659
DO IT TOGETHER.
LET ME TRY ONCE MORE, 'CAUSE 

03:10:59.863 --> 03:11:04.378
THIS DEMO IS REALLY COOL.
TALK TO PANERA.

03:11:05.957 --> 03:11:08.548
Google:  I FOUND A COUPLE OF 
PLACES.

03:11:08.549 --> 03:11:12.554
Pali Bhat:  AHH!
THE DEMO GODS ARE NOT SMILING  

03:11:12.555 --> 03:11:13.367
ON
US.

03:11:13.368 --> 03:11:15.848
SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO 
GIVE IT ONE MORE SHOT,  BECAUSE

03:11:15.849 --> 03:11:18.440
ALL OF YOU, I THINK,  WILL BE
INTERESTED IN THIS.   AND THEN

03:11:18.846 --> 03:11:23.457
WE'LL SWITCH TO A  COOL VIDEO WE
HAVE IN CASE  THIS EXACTLY

03:11:23.458 --> 03:11:28.726
HAPPENED.
TALK TO PANERA.

03:11:28.727 --> 03:11:32.617
Google:  I FOUND A COUPLE OF 
PLACES.

03:11:32.618 --> 03:11:35.244
Pali Bhat:  SO YOU KNOW WHAT?  
WHY DON'T WE ACTUALLY SWITCH  TO

03:11:35.543 --> 03:11:39.303
THE VIDEO, AND I'LL SHOW  YOU A
LITTLE BIT OF HOW THIS  WORKS ON

03:11:40.117 --> 03:11:44.210
THE VIDEO.
SO THE COOL THING ABOUT THIS  

03:11:44.211 --> 03:11:46.211
IS,
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN A  LESS

03:11:46.323 --> 03:11:49.920
NOISY ENVIRONMENT THAN  THE
SHORELINE AMPHITHEATER,  WHICH

03:11:50.113 --> 03:11:55.455
HOPEFULLY NOT MANY OF  YOU ARE
TRYING TO ICANN USE THE 

03:11:55.456 --> 03:11:57.990
ASSISTANT IN, THEN YOU CAN 
ACTUALLY GET THIS EXPERIENCE 

03:11:58.284 --> 03:12:02.036
WHERE YOU CAN INTERACT WITH  THE
ASSISTANT ACROSS BOTH  VOICE OR

03:12:02.291 --> 03:12:04.680
BY INTERACTING WITH  YOUR TOUCH
SCREEN.

03:12:04.707 --> 03:12:08.646
AND THE COOL THING ABOUT IT  IS,
YOU CAN SWITCH SEAMLESSLY 

03:12:08.647 --> 03:12:12.086
BETWEEN BOTH THE VOICE AND  
USING

03:12:12.087 --> 03:12:14.382
THE PROMPTS THAT THE  ASSISTANT
GIVES YOU.

03:12:14.620 --> 03:12:16.752
SO IN THIS PARTICULAR  EXAMPLE, 
I

03:12:16.753 --> 03:12:20.864
COULD ACTUALLY  START ORDERING,
LET'S SAY,  THE STRAWBERRY POPPY

03:12:21.159 --> 03:12:22.940
SEED  SALAD WITHOUT CHICKEN, AND

03:12:22.941 --> 03:12:27.206
THEN SWITCH TO PICKING OUT MY 
FAVORITE SMOOTHY, AND THEN 

03:12:27.207 --> 03:12:29.393
CHECKING OUT.
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS 

03:12:29.394 --> 03:12:32.442
INTEGRATED THE PAY WITH  GOOGLE 

03:12:32.443 --> 03:12:37.146
EXPERIENCE INTO THE  ASSISTANT,
SO DEVELOPERS LIKE  YOU CAN HAVE

03:12:37.772 --> 03:12:41.665
A SEAMLESS  EXPERIENCE FOR ALL 
OF

03:12:41.666 --> 03:12:44.056
YOUR  CUSTOMERS.
AND, OF COURSE, JUST LIKE YOU 

03:12:44.504 --> 03:12:49.589
SAW WITH BOTH THE PAYPAL 
PURCHASE I SHOWED YOU AND THE 

03:12:50.057 --> 03:12:53.195
WISH PURCHASE I SHOWED YOU, I 
SIMPLY CONFIRM WITH A 

03:12:53.196 --> 03:12:56.196
FINGERPRINT, AND YOU'RE DONE.
SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT  ALL

03:12:56.197 --> 03:12:58.462
OF THESE NEW EXPERIENCES  THAT 
WE

03:12:58.463 --> 03:13:02.379
ARE BRINGING TO  DEVELOPERS LIKE
YOU.  SO WE  LOOK FORWARD TO

03:13:02.380 --> 03:13:06.111
SEEING ALL OF  YOU INTEGRATING
PAY WITH  GOOGLE INTO YOUR WEB

03:13:06.599 --> 03:13:09.429
SITES,  APPS, OR EXPERIENCING IT

03:13:09.430 --> 03:13:13.600
THROUGH THE ASSISTANT.
WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO  WELCOME

SISSIE HSIAO, WHO'S  GOING TO
TELL YOU A LITTLE  BIT MORE 

03:13:16.494 --> 03:13:18.977

YOUR APPS.

03:13:20.175 --> 03:13:22.175

03:13:35.165 --> 03:13:38.255
HELP YOU BUILD A  MORE 
SUCCESSFUL

03:13:38.256 --> 03:13:40.493
MOBILE APPS  BUSINESS.
AS SRIDHAR TALKED ABOUT  

03:13:40.494 --> 03:13:43.278
EARLIER,
THERE ARE OVER 5  MILLION APPS

03:13:43.588 --> 03:13:47.948
ACROSS ANDROID  AND iOS.  AND
IF I TELL YOU  THAT THE VAST

03:13:47.949 --> 03:13:49.582
MAJORITY ARE  FREE, I'M SURE 
MOST

03:13:49.583 --> 03:13:53.647
OF YOU  WON'T BE SURPRISED.
SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR YOU, 

03:13:53.648 --> 03:13:55.568
TRYING TO BUILD A GREAT  
BUSINESS

03:13:55.569 --> 03:13:59.928
THAT USERS WANT BOTH  FREE AND
AMAZING APPS?

03:14:01.194 --> 03:14:04.304
IT MEANS THAT YOU NEED TO  THINK
VERY CREATIVELY ABOUT  HOW TO

03:14:05.058 --> 03:14:06.276
MONETIZE YOUR APPS AND  MAKE 
SURE

03:14:06.277 --> 03:14:13.225
THAT YOU'RE USING  EVERYTHING IN
YOUR ARSENAL,  INCLUDING IN

03:14:13.226 --> 03:14:15.302
IN-APP PURCHASES,  
SUBSCRIPTIONS,

03:14:15.303 --> 03:14:17.303
AND NOW,  INCREASINGLY,
ADVERTISING.

03:14:17.407 --> 03:14:19.881
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE USING  
ADMOB

03:14:19.882 --> 03:14:25.415
KNOW THAT PUTTING  IN-APP ADS IS
A PRIMARY AND  EFFECTIVE WAY TO

03:14:25.709 --> 03:14:27.994
MONETIZE  YOUR APPS.  AND WE AT
GOOGLE  HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON 

03:14:28.213 --> 03:14:32.366
CONNECTING YOU TO MILLIONS OF 
GOOGLE ADVERTISERS AND OVER  40

03:14:32.622 --> 03:14:35.497
AD NETWORKS.
BUT JUST PUTTING ADS INTO  YOUR

03:14:35.761 --> 03:14:40.371
APPS ISN'T ENOUGH.  HOW  DO YOU
BUILD A PRODUCT THAT  DELIGHTS

03:14:40.825 --> 03:14:45.084
YOUR USERS WITH ADS  EXPERIENCES
THAT ARE JUST AS  GOOD?

03:14:45.112 --> 03:14:48.476
IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL,  YOU
NEED TO BE AS THOUGHTFUL  ABOUT

03:14:48.680 --> 03:14:51.526
PUTTING ADS INTO YOUR  APP AS 
THE

03:14:51.527 --> 03:14:53.527
CORE USER  EXPERIENCE

03:14:56.649 --> 03:14:59.340
 ITSELF.
LET'S TAKE A MAJOR GAME 

03:14:59.341 --> 03:15:02.790
DEVELOPER, ZEPTOLAB.  I THINK 
THEY MADE CUT THE ROPE, WHICH 

03:15:02.791 --> 03:15:04.508
I'M SURE MOST OF YOU HAVE  
PLAYED

03:15:04.509 --> 03:15:07.308
AT ONE POINT IN TIME.   AND THEY
HAVE A NEW AWESOME  GAME CALLED

03:15:08.134 --> 03:15:11.574
CATS.  THEY'VE  BEEN USING THE
ADMOB PLATFORM  FOR OVER FIVE

03:15:11.997 --> 03:15:14.524
YEARS TO  MONETIZE THEIR APPS. 
AND  THEY USE OUR FULL SUITE OF 

03:15:15.186 --> 03:15:18.022
FORMATS, INCLUDING 
INTERSTITIALS, REWARDED VIDEO 

03:15:18.374 --> 03:15:22.091
ADS, AND NOW NATIVE ADVANCED.
AND WHEN THEY'RE DOING THAT 

03:15:22.092 --> 03:15:24.092
ADVERTISING, THEY'RE VERY,  VERY
CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE  THAT THE

03:15:24.372 --> 03:15:27.773
ADS ARE NATIVE TO  THE GAME AND
THAT THEY'RE  BLENDING 

03:15:27.774 --> 03:15:29.398
SEAMLESSLY
SO THAT  USERS WHO ARE PLAYING

03:15:29.399 --> 03:15:34.169
ARE  STILL HAVING A DELIGHTFUL
AND  FUN EXPERIENCE AND IT'S 

03:15:34.384 --> 03:15:37.217
WORKING FOR THEM.
SINCE THEY'VE ADDED REWARDED  AD

03:15:37.639 --> 03:15:40.824
UNITS TO CATS, THEY HAVE  MORE
TRIPLED THEIR ADMOB  REVENUE IN

03:15:41.133 --> 03:15:43.133
THE PAST FEW 

03:15:45.401 --> 03:15:47.481
 MONTHS.
ZEPTO LABS IS JUST ONE  EXAMPLE.

03:15:51.843 --> 03:15:55.788
APPS USING ADMOB  ACROSS ANDROID
AND iOS TO  MONETIZE THEIR

03:15:55.789 --> 03:15:58.228
APPS.  AND WE  HAVE PAID OUT 
MORE

03:15:58.229 --> 03:16:02.540
THAN $3.5  BILLION TO DATE TO 
APP 

03:16:02.541 --> 03:16:06.045
DEVELOPERS, MORE THAN ANY AD 
NETWORK.

03:16:06.255 --> 03:16:09.683
BUT WE KNOW YOU NEED MORE.  
WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO YOUR 

03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:11.529
FEEDBACK VERY CLOSELY, AND  
WE'VE

03:16:11.530 --> 03:16:14.558
HEARD THAT YOU NEED  MORE FROM
THIS PRODUCT.  YOU  NEED THREE

03:16:15.282 --> 03:16:17.860
THINGS.
NUMBER ONE, YOU WANT A  HOLISTIC

03:16:18.167 --> 03:16:22.337
PICTURE OF YOUR  REVENUE, NOT
JUST ADS, BUT  HOW DOES ADS

03:16:22.338 --> 03:16:25.385
RELATE TO THE  OTHER REVENUE
STREAMS, LIKE  IN-APP PURCHASES

03:16:26.392 --> 03:16:29.437
AND  SUBSCRIPTIONS.
NUMBER TWO, YOU WANT  INTEGRATED

03:16:29.952 --> 03:16:33.607
APP ANALYTICS.   YOU WANT TO SEE
HOW ADS WORKS  AND HOW THEY

03:16:33.608 --> 03:16:37.667
AFFECT THE CORE  USER EXPERIENCE
OF YOUR APP  ITSELF.

03:16:37.968 --> 03:16:40.923
AND, FINALLY, NUMBER THREE,  YOU
WANT BETTER AND MORE  POWERFUL

03:16:41.526 --> 03:16:45.233
TOOLS TO MANAGE AND  MAXIMIZE
YOUR REVENUE.

03:16:45.259 --> 03:16:48.588
BECAUSE OF THESE NEEDS,  THAT'S
WHAT SPURRED MY  ENGINEERING 

03:16:48.589 --> 03:16:51.515
TEAM
TO EMBARK ON  A MISSION AND

03:16:51.516 --> 03:16:53.516
REBUILD ADMOB  FROM THE GROUND
UP.

03:16:54.985 --> 03:16:58.264
AND THAT'S WHY TODAY I AM 
INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO SHARE  

03:16:58.265 --> 03:17:00.655
WITH
YOU THE LAUNCH OF A  COMPLETELY

03:17:01.902 --> 03:17:03.902
REBUILT,  REIMAGINED

03:17:05.597 --> 03:17:05.829
 ADMOB.
[ APPLAUSE ]

03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:07.830
THANK YOU.

03:17:09.370 --> 03:17:13.480
WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE  TOOLS
YOU NEED TO BUILD A  SUCCESSFUL

03:17:13.636 --> 03:17:15.151
MOBILE APPS  BUSINESS.  AND 
WE'RE

03:17:15.152 --> 03:17:17.483
FOCUSED  ON BUILDING AN
END-TO-END  MONETIZATION 

03:17:17.484 --> 03:17:20.296
PLATFORM
THAT  WORKS FOR YOU.

03:17:20.557 --> 03:17:24.499
OUR GOALS HERE ARE PRIMARY 
TWOFOLD.  NUMBER ONE, WE WANT  

03:17:24.500 --> 03:17:26.433
TO
GIVE YOU DEEPER INSIGHTS  INTO

03:17:26.434 --> 03:17:28.044
HOW YOUR ADS BEHAVE AND  HOW 
THEY

03:17:28.045 --> 03:17:31.000
AFFECT THE REST OF  YOUR CORE
APP.  AND I'LL SHOW  YOU THAT IN

03:17:31.198 --> 03:17:33.774
A SECOND.
AND NUMBER TWO, WE BUILT 

03:17:33.775 --> 03:17:37.216
ADVANCED CONTROLS SO THAT YOU 
CAN -- AND REPORTING, SO THAT 

03:17:37.241 --> 03:17:40.199
YOU CAN MAXIMIZE AND OPTIMIZE 
YOUR ADS REVENUE.

03:17:40.448 --> 03:17:44.249
AND, FINALLY, WE BUILT ALL OF 
THESE FEATURES ON A CLEAN AND 

03:17:44.813 --> 03:17:48.843
MODERN, REDONE USER  INTERFACE. 
HOWEVER, INSTEAD  OF JUST 

03:17:48.844 --> 03:17:50.844
TALKING
ABOUT IT,    LET ME SHOW YOU A

03:17:51.027 --> 03:17:53.112
FEW SCREENS  FROM THE REAL --
REALLY NEW 

03:17:56.393 --> 03:17:58.011
 ADMOB.
LET ME STORY TELL FOR A  SECOND.

03:17:59.674 --> 03:18:02.156
AT
A MID-SIZED  COMPANY, BUILDING

03:18:02.158 --> 03:18:05.227
HEALTH AND  FITNESS APPS.  AND
WHEN I  FIRST LOG INTO THE NEW

03:18:05.765 --> 03:18:08.184
ADMOB,  I SEE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT  USER EXPERIENCE.  AND

03:18:08.185 --> 03:18:10.970
WHAT I  SEE HERE IS A HOME
DASHBOARD.   THIS HOME DASHBOARD

03:18:11.224 --> 03:18:14.972
IS A  QUICK SNAPSHOT OF ALL THE 
APPS IN MY ADMOB ACCOUNT.   AND

03:18:15.215 --> 03:18:17.340
IT'S TELLING ME IMPORTANT 
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH  I'M

03:18:17.592 --> 03:18:21.235
MAKING IN EACH OF THESE  APPS
ACROSS MY ENTIRE  BUSINESS.

03:18:21.548 --> 03:18:24.282
IF YOU SEE AT THE TOP, I'M 
SHOWING A NEW SCORECARD,  WHICH

03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:27.015
IS TELLING ME HOW MUCH  I'VE 
MADE

03:18:27.016 --> 03:18:30.857
TODAY, THIS WEEK,  YESTERDAY,
THIS WEEK, AND  THIS MONTH.  SO

03:18:31.106 --> 03:18:33.839
IT SEEMS TO  BE A REALLY USEFUL
WAY FOR ME  TO CHECK HOW MY

03:18:33.840 --> 03:18:37.031
BUSINESS IS  DOING.
IF I SCROLL DOWN, I'M GOING  TO

03:18:37.481 --> 03:18:40.713
SEE A NEW CARD ON THE LEFT 
CALLED THE APP PERFORMANCE  

03:18:40.714 --> 03:18:42.714
CARD.
AND HERE, WE'RE  BREAKING OUT

03:18:42.842 --> 03:18:44.511
EACH OF THE APPS  IN THIS 
ACCOUNT

03:18:44.512 --> 03:18:49.308
AND TELLING  ME HOW MUCH MONEY
I'M MAKING  ACROSS MY BUSINESS.

03:18:49.309 --> 03:18:53.559
IF I LOOK CAREFULLY, THOUGH,  IT
LOOKS LIKE FITMOBBER,  WHICH IS

03:18:53.810 --> 03:18:59.119
MY BEST APP, HAS  BEEN TANKING. 
IT'S DROPPED  OVER $200

03:18:59.120 --> 03:19:01.610
YESTERDAY, WHICH IS  A DISASTER,
BECAUSE THIS IS  THE ONE THAT'S

03:19:02.017 --> 03:19:04.184
GROWING THE  BEST.  I NEED TO
FIGURE OUT  EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING

03:19:04.684 --> 03:19:06.684
ON.
I DIG IN, I DRILL IN AND  CLICK

03:19:06.716 --> 03:19:08.746
ON THAT.  AND LET ME  JUMP OUT 
OF

03:19:08.747 --> 03:19:12.845
STORY FOR A SEC  TO EXPLAIN WHAT
YOU'RE SEEING  NOW.

03:19:13.079 --> 03:19:16.217
YOU'RE NOW SEEING A  COMPLETELY
NEW APP OVERVIEW  DASHBOARD.  

03:19:16.218 --> 03:19:18.096
AND
THIS APP  OVERVIEW DASHBOARD IS 

03:19:18.097 --> 03:19:19.761
A 
DASHBOARD DESIGNED TO SHOW  YOU

03:19:19.762 --> 03:19:21.939
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON  WITHIN 
A

03:19:21.940 --> 03:19:25.073
PARTICULAR APP.  IN  THIS CASE,
IN OUR DEMO, THIS  IS THE

03:19:25.074 --> 03:19:27.309
FITMOBBER APP.  AND  YOU CAN SEE
ON BOTH THE  LEFT-HAND AND THE

03:19:27.611 --> 03:19:30.496
TOP THAT  IT'S SHOWING YOU THAT
ALL THE  NUMBERS YOU'RE SEEING

03:19:30.657 --> 03:19:33.794
ARE  RELATED TO FITMOBBER.
AND FURTHERMORE, IN THE  MIDDLE,

03:19:33.796 --> 03:19:38.544
I SEE TWO NEW  REPORTS.  ON THE
LEFT, WITH  THE COLORED BARS, A

03:19:38.842 --> 03:19:43.386
TOTAL  REVENUE REPORT.  AND THIS
IS  SHOWING ME NOT JUST ADS 

03:19:43.387 --> 03:19:47.577
REVENUE FROM ADMOB.  IT'S  ALSO
LAYERING IN IN-APP  PURCHASES,

03:19:48.441 --> 03:19:50.925
SUBSCRIPTIONS, OR  OTHER IN-APP
MONETIZATION  MODELS RIGHT INTO

03:19:51.282 --> 03:19:54.956
THAT BAR  CHART, SO YOU CAN SEE
AT A  GLANCE HOW MY OVERALL

03:19:54.957 --> 03:19:59.720
REVENUE  IS TRENDING ACROSS ALL
OF  THESE DIFFERENT REVENUE 

03:19:59.721 --> 03:20:02.841
STREAMS.
ON THE RIGHT, I SEE ALSO A 

03:20:02.842 --> 03:20:05.513
COMPLETELY NEW USER METRICS 
CARD.  AND THIS CARD IS  SHOWING

03:20:05.922 --> 03:20:09.403
ME IMPORTANT HEALTH  METRICS OF
MY CORE APP,  INCLUDING SESSIONS

03:20:09.653 --> 03:20:11.653
AND 

03:20:13.654 --> 03:20:15.654
 RETENTION.
WHAT WE'VE DONE TO ENABLE  THIS

03:20:16.529 --> 03:20:20.118
IS WEAVE TOGETHER GOOGLE 
ANALYTICS FOR FIREBASE  DIRECTLY

03:20:20.268 --> 03:20:23.356
INTO THE CORE OF  ADMOB.  WE 
KNOW

03:20:23.357 --> 03:20:26.550
THAT ADS ARE  A CRITICAL PART OF
YOUR  USERS' EXPERIENCE.  YOU 

03:20:27.295 --> 03:20:30.894
CANNOT BUILD AN AMAZING APP 
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW ADS 

03:20:31.296 --> 03:20:35.533
BEHAVE IN THE APP.  AND YOU 
CAN'T MONETIZE WELL WITHOUT 

03:20:35.534 --> 03:20:37.534
UNDERSTANDING HOW USERS  BEHAVE
IN YOUR APP.

03:20:38.318 --> 03:20:43.360
SO FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, 
ADMOB AND FIREBASE CAN SHARE 

03:20:43.624 --> 03:20:46.153
DATA ACROSS THESE TWO  PLATFORMS
TO HELP YOU GAIN  DEEPER 

03:20:46.154 --> 03:20:48.030
INSIGHTS
AND BUILD A  MORE SUCCESSFUL

03:20:48.031 --> 03:20:51.827
MOBILE APPS  BUSINESS.
COOL.  LET ME GET BACK TO MY 

03:20:52.032 --> 03:20:53.514
STORY AND TELL YOU HOW I CAN  
USE

03:20:53.515 --> 03:20:57.156
THIS TO FIX MY FITMOBBER  ISSUE.
SO IF I LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS  

03:20:57.157 --> 03:20:59.079
ON
THE LEFT, IT LOOKS LIKE  THE 

03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:01.004
BLUE
BARS HAVE BEEN  SHRINKING.  AND

03:21:01.005 --> 03:21:04.201
THE BLUE BARS  ARE ACTUALLY MY
ADS REVENUE.   SO THAT MAKES

03:21:04.202 --> 03:21:06.895
SENSE.  THAT'S  WHY I SAW THE
$200 DROP  YESTERDAY.

03:21:07.507 --> 03:21:10.155
AND IF I LOOK ON THE RIGHT,  
USER

03:21:10.156 --> 03:21:13.951
METRICS HAVE ALSO TAKEN  A TURN
FOR THE WORSE.  IN  FACT,

03:21:13.952 --> 03:21:16.342
SESSIONS PER USER AND  SESSION
DURATION ARE BOTH  DOWN.  THAT

03:21:16.551 --> 03:21:21.518
MEANS THAT USERS  ARE USING THE
APP LESS AND  WALKING AWAY MORE.

03:21:21.519 --> 03:21:25.433
I GO TALK TO MY TEAM AND ASK 
THEM WHAT IS GOING ON.  AND I 

03:21:25.551 --> 03:21:28.282
LEARN THAT THEY PUT A NEW AD 
UNIT RIGHT AT THE SCREEN IN  THE

03:21:29.047 --> 03:21:31.941
APP THAT IS RIGHT BEFORE  USERS
WORK OUT, WHICH MEANS  THAT THEY

03:21:32.812 --> 03:21:39.264
WERE JUST DETERRED  ENOUGH TO
STOP WORKING OUT  AND STOP

03:21:39.265 --> 03:21:40.426
SUBSCRIBING TO MY  APP.  THAT 
WAS

03:21:40.427 --> 03:21:43.036
A REALLY BAD  PLACEMENT FOR THAT
AD FOR  SURE.

03:21:43.240 --> 03:21:47.032
I MOVE IT, AND I WAIT A WEEK.
I HOP BACK INTO THE SAME  SCREEN

03:21:47.033 --> 03:21:53.032
IN THE NEW MACINTOSH.   AND,
ADMOB.   AND, WOW, EVERYTHING IS

03:21:53.186 --> 03:21:58.471
BACK  AND UP TO THE RIGHT.
BUSINESS IS NOW BOOMING AT 

03:21:58.472 --> 03:22:01.268
FITMOBBER, AND I AM A GLOBAL 
COMPANY.  I'M ALSO USING AN 

03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:03.801
ADVANCED FEATURE CALLED 
MEDIATION.  AND MEDIATION IS 

03:22:03.953 --> 03:22:06.545
VERY SIMPLE.  IT'S BASICALLY  A
SET OF RULES THAT ALLOW ME  TO

03:22:06.802 --> 03:22:09.544
SEND MY AD UNITS TO  DIFFERENT 
AD

03:22:09.545 --> 03:22:11.937
NETWORKS.
AND IF YOU'RE A BIGGER APP 

03:22:11.938 --> 03:22:13.810
PUBLISHER BUSINESS, THIS IS 
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO  USE

03:22:13.811 --> 03:22:18.896
AND TO MAXIMIZE YOUR  REVENUE.
MANAGING MEDIATION IN THE NEW 

03:22:19.141 --> 03:22:23.561
ADMOB IS EASIER THAN EVER,  WITH
A FEATURE CALLED  MEDIATION

03:22:23.562 --> 03:22:26.316
GROUPS.    AND WHAT  MEDIATION
GROUPS LETS YOU DO  IS IT LETS

03:22:26.515 --> 03:22:29.516
YOU SET UP A  SINGLE SET OF
MEDIATION RULES  AND THEN APPLY

03:22:29.930 --> 03:22:33.126
IT ACROSS  APPS, AD UNITS, OR 
GEOGRAPHIES.

03:22:33.380 --> 03:22:36.920
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
LET'S SAY THAT FITMOBBER IS 

03:22:36.921 --> 03:22:39.561
DOING REALLY WELL, ESPECIALLY  
IN

03:22:39.562 --> 03:22:41.349
JAPAN.  AND IN JAPAN  
ESPECIALLY,

03:22:41.350 --> 03:22:45.405
YOU WANT TO SEND  YOUR ADS TO
DIFFERENT  REGIONAL AD NETWORKS,

03:22:45.617 --> 03:22:48.093
BECAUSE  THERE ARE A FEW AD
NETWORKS  THERE THAT WANT TO BUY

03:22:48.453 --> 03:22:52.107
ADS  JUST FOR USERS THERE.
USING MEDIATION GROUPS, IT'S  

03:22:52.108 --> 03:22:53.984
NOW
VERY EASY TO DO THIS.  I  SET UP

03:22:53.985 --> 03:22:58.101
ONE MEDIATION GROUP  FOR JAPAN
WITH MY RULES.  AND  AFTER THAT,

03:22:58.408 --> 03:23:02.114
IT'S QUITE  TRIVIAL TO ADD AD
UNITS.  I  CAN ADD AD UNITS TO

03:23:02.280 --> 03:23:05.313
THIS  GROUP, AND IT WILL START 
AUTOMATICALLY OBEYING THE 

03:23:05.314 --> 03:23:06.944

VERY SIMPLE AND VERY  POWERFUL.

03:23:26.397 --> 03:23:28.994
AT THIS POINT, I'VE TALKED TO 
YOU A LOT ABOUT HOW GOOGLE IS 

03:23:29.281 --> 03:23:31.718
HELPING YOU BUILD A GREAT  
IN-APP

03:23:31.719 --> 03:23:34.269
ADVERTISING BUSINESS.
I WANT TO PIVOT COMPLETELY  AND

03:23:35.030 --> 03:23:38.833
TALK ABOUT ANOTHER  EXTREMELY
CRUCIAL PART OF  BUILDING A

03:23:38.834 --> 03:23:42.594
SUCCESSFUL  BUSINESS, MAYBE THE
MOST  CRUCIAL PART.  AND THAT IS

03:23:45.099 --> 03:23:48.422
YOU CANNOT HAVE A SUCCESSFUL 
MOBILE APPS BUSINESS WITHOUT 

03:23:48.877 --> 03:23:51.816
HAVING A SUCCESSFUL GROWTH 
STRATEGY.  AND IN ORDER TO DO 

03:23:52.225 --> 03:23:56.234
THAT, YOU HAVE TO ANSWER TWO 
QUESTIONS.  NUMBER ONE IS,  WHO

03:23:56.489 --> 03:24:00.501
ARE MY BEST USERS?
AND NUMBER TWO IS, WHERE CAN  I

03:24:00.703 --> 03:24:04.505
FIND THEM?  WHERE ARE THE  MOST
EFFECTIVE CHANNELS THAT  I CAN

03:24:04.708 --> 03:24:06.437
SHOW THEM MY APP AND  GET THEM 
TO

03:24:06.438 --> 03:24:10.202
DOWNLOAD AND TRY  IT?
I'M EXCITED TO SHARE THAT  

03:24:10.203 --> 03:24:11.628
GOOGLE

03:24:11.629 --> 03:24:14.112
PROBLEMS.  AND WE HAVE  QUITE A
FEW FEATURES TO SHARE  TO SOLVE

03:24:14.416 --> 03:24:20.302
THESE GROWTH  CHALLENGES.
LET ME START WITH GOOGLE  PLAY. 

03:24:20.647 --> 03:24:26.283

WE
FIND  INCREASINGLY, THAT BESIDES

03:24:42.940 --> 03:24:45.023
WHICH THEY DEFINITELY STILL  DO,
THEY SEARCH FOR THE APPS  THAT

03:24:45.427 --> 03:24:48.269
THEY WANT, THEY ARE ALSO 
RESPONDING AND DOWNLOADING  APPS

03:24:48.635 --> 03:24:51.114

UNIVERSAL APP  CAMPAIGNS, OR 
UAC,

03:25:34.908 --> 03:25:39.832

PER INSTALL.  AND  YOU GIVE US A
LITTLE BIT OF  INFORMATION TO

03:26:00.726 --> 03:26:05.238
HELP US CREATE  ADS, LIKE TEXT,
IMAGES,  VIDEOS.

03:26:06.148 --> 03:26:10.207
WE THEN TAKE ALL OF THAT 
INFORMATION IN UAC, AND WE  USE

03:26:10.208 --> 03:26:13.621
MACHINE LEARNING TO  DELIVER THE
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF  INSTALLS TO

03:26:14.066 --> 03:26:16.302
YOU AT THE PRICE  THAT YOU'VE
SPECIFIED.

03:26:16.910 --> 03:26:19.862
AND WE DO THIS BY AUTOMATING  
AND

03:26:19.863 --> 03:26:22.414
OPTIMIZING EVERY SINGLE  BIT OF
THE ADVERTISING  ITSELF,

03:26:22.415 --> 03:26:26.304
INCLUDING WHAT THE  ADS LOOK

03:26:26.867 --> 03:26:30.877

CLICK SO  THAT WE HIT THAT 
TARGET

DELIVERING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER  

03:26:34.929 --> 03:26:36.929

INSTALLS FOR YOU.

03:26:37.103 --> 03:26:40.273
SO WHEREVER YOUR USERS ARE  AND
WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING,  WHETHER

03:26:40.519 --> 03:26:42.596
THEY'RE SEARCHING    ON GOOGLE 
OR

03:26:42.597 --> 03:26:44.831
WATCHING VIDEOS  ON YOUTUBE, 
ONLY

03:26:44.832 --> 03:26:47.835
GOOGLE HAS  THE BREADTH OF
CHANNELS TO  HELP YOU FIND YOUR

03:26:48.190 --> 03:26:51.383
MOST  VALUABLE USERS RIGHT WHEN 
THEY WANT TO DOWNLOAD YOUR  APP.

03:26:55.743 --> 03:26:58.273
UNIVERSAL AD CAMPAIGNS HAS  BEEN
HELPING COMPANIES LIKE  HEAD

03:26:58.274 --> 03:27:02.427

MEDITATION APP,  IMPROVE HEALTH

03:27:03.195 --> 03:27:03.896
AND HAPPINESS  AROUND THE WORLD.

03:27:03.897 --> 03:27:07.128
AND  ACCORDING TO ROBERT FROM
HEAD  SPACE, UNIVERSAL APP 

03:27:07.129 --> 03:27:11.519
CAMPAIGNS HAS SAVED THEIR  TEAM
TIME AND DRIVEN RESULTS.

03:27:12.174 --> 03:27:15.680
TRANSLATION:  MORE USERS THAT 
USE AND LOVE THE APP IN LESS 

03:27:15.926 --> 03:27:19.199
TIME.
HOWEVER, LIKE HEADSPACE, WE  ALL

03:27:19.478 --> 03:27:23.001
KNOW THAT GROWTH ISN'T  JUST
ABOUT INSTALLS.  MANY  USERS 

03:27:23.002 --> 03:27:27.190
WILL
INSTALL YOUR APP  AND NOT GO

03:27:27.191 --> 03:27:31.742
ALONG AND SPEND OR  ENGAGE OR
POTENTIALLY EVEN  OPEN IT.  YOU

03:27:31.744 --> 03:27:35.741
NEED TO SPEND  YOUR ACQUISITION
DOLLARS  WISELY TO FIND YOUR 

03:27:35.742 --> 03:27:37.252
MOST 
VALUABLE USERS, THE ONES THAT 

03:27:37.253 --> 03:27:40.693
WILL ENGAGE AND SPEND AND 
ACTIVATE AND ENJOY YOUR APPS.

03:27:40.694 --> 03:27:46.706
BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M ALSO 
EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT WE'RE 

03:27:46.707 --> 03:27:51.101
ANNOUNCING TWO NEW BIDDING 
OPTIONS IN UNIVERSAL APP 

03:27:51.102 --> 03:27:56.819

PER ACQUISITION, AND  TARGET

03:27:56.820 --> 03:27:59.300
ROAS, OR RETURN ON AD  SPEND.
AND THESE BIDDING STRATEGIES 

03:27:59.554 --> 03:28:02.398
WILL HELP YOU PROFITABLY  
ACQUIRE

03:28:02.399 --> 03:28:05.270
HIGH-VALUE USERS.  OR  PUT MORE
SIMPLY, HELPS YOU  PAY MORE FOR

03:28:05.537 --> 03:28:08.411
USERS WHO WILL  PAY YOU MORE AND
PAY LESS FOR  USERS WHO WE THINK

03:28:08.613 --> 03:28:12.820
WILL PAY  YOU SO I GIVE YOU A 
VERY

03:28:12.821 --> 03:28:16.461
 CONCRETE EXAMPLE.  MY HUSBAND
 AND I LESS ARE BOTH MOBILE 

03:28:16.462 --> 03:28:18.377
GAMERS,
 AND WE BOTH LOVE THIS NEW

03:28:18.378 --> 03:28:22.013
 GAME BY NINTENDO CALLED FIRE
 EMBLEM HEROES.  I DON'T KNOW

03:28:22.014 --> 03:28:25.250
 IF YOU PLAYED IT OR NOT. 
 IT'S TACTICAL RP TPUS AND

03:28:25.251 --> 03:28:28.680
 BASICALLY IN THIS GAME YOU
 COLLECT HEROES AND THE WAY

03:28:28.681 --> 03:28:32.118
 YOU COLLECT HEROES IS THROUGH
 EXCHANGING A VIRTUAL CURRENCY

03:28:32.119 --> 03:28:35.355
 CALLED ORBS.  NOW, I'M SURE
 MOST OF YOU WHO PLAY GAMES

03:28:35.356 --> 03:28:37.667
 KNOW THE WAY TO GET ORBS IS
 BASICALLY TWO WAYS.  ONE IS

03:28:37.668 --> 03:28:40.397
 YOU BUY THEM WITH REAL MONEY,
 AND NUMBER TWO IS YOU CAN

03:28:40.398 --> 03:28:42.629
 SORT OF GRIND IT OUT IN THE
 GAME AND EARN THEM OVER THE

03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:45.749
 COURSE OF PLAYING.
 NOW, I AM REALLY VERY

03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:49.179
 IMPATIENT AND ALSO VERY
 COMPETITIVE, SO I HAVE NO

03:28:49.180 --> 03:28:52.308
 ISSUES SPENDING OVER A
 HUNDRED DOLLARS BUYING ORBS

03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:55.129
 TO COLLECT MY FAVORITE
 HEROES.

03:28:55.130 --> 03:28:59.159
 MY HUSBAND, ON THE OTHER
 HAND, IS MORE PRINCIPLED AND

03:28:59.160 --> 03:29:01.886
 WANTS TO GRIND IT OUT, AND
 HE'S JUST A LITTLE CHEAP, SO

03:29:01.887 --> 03:29:06.234
 HE'S WILLING TO SPEND MAYBE,
 AT MOST, $5.

03:29:06.235 --> 03:29:09.162
 FOR AN APP DEVELOPER LIKE
 NINTENDO, THEY SHOULD BE

03:29:09.163 --> 03:29:12.789
 THINKING ABOUT ACQUIRING
 PLAYERS LIKE ME AT THE HIGH

03:29:12.790 --> 03:29:16.225
 PRICE POINT, AT A HIGHER
 PRICE POINT THAN PLAYERS LIKE

03:29:16.226 --> 03:29:19.462
 MY HUSBAND WHO SPEND A LOWER
 PRICE POINT.  AND WITH THESE

03:29:19.463 --> 03:29:23.505
 NEW BIDDING STRATEGIES, THEY
 CAN DO EXACTLY THAT.

03:29:23.506 --> 03:29:28.148
 AND FINALLY, AT THE CORE OF
 ANY SMART GROWTH STRATEGY IS

03:29:28.149 --> 03:29:30.869
 MEASURING WHETHER YOU'RE
 SPENDING YOUR ACQUISITION

03:29:30.870 --> 03:29:35.624
 DOLLARS WISELY.  AND WHEN WE
 KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU ARE

03:29:35.625 --> 03:29:37.836
 USING THIRD-PARTY MEASUREMENT
 PROVIDERS TO MEASURE THE

03:29:37.837 --> 03:29:40.458
 ATTRIBUTION OF YOUR INSTALLS. 
 AND THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M

03:29:40.459 --> 03:29:44.650
 HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT GOOGLE
 IS LAUNCHING A COMPLETELY NEW

03:29:44.651 --> 03:29:48.544

 WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES IS

03:29:48.545 --> 03:29:51.366

 THE THEME OF TODAY, AND
 SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO

 HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN, IS THAT
 THE MODERN MOBILE WEB IS NOW

03:48:23.765 --> 03:48:31.436
 MAINSTREAM.  AND THIS IS
 REALLY AN AM AMAZING SHIFT.  SO

03:48:31.437 --> 03:48:34.059
 I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ALL
 ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING

03:48:34.261 --> 03:48:37.200
 AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU. 
 IT'S THE MOBILE WEB STATE OF

03:48:37.201 --> 03:48:39.328
 THE UNION.  SO LET'S DIVE
 RIGHT

03:48:42.954 --> 03:48:46.085
 IN.
 THE WEB HAS INCREDIBLE REACH. 

03:48:46.086 --> 03:48:51.314
 JUST CHROME ALONE RUNS ON
 OVER 2 BILLION DEVICES FROM

03:48:51.315 --> 03:48:56.376
 PHONES TO TABLETS TO PCs. 
 AND THE WEB IS MUCH BIGGER

03:48:56.377 --> 03:49:00.495
 THAN CHROME.  THERE ARE OVER
 5 BILLION DEVICES OUT THERE

03:49:00.496 --> 03:49:06.260
 THAT CAN ACCESS WEB CONTENT. 
 5 BILLION!  THAT IS A LARGE

03:49:06.261 --> 03:49:12.416
 NUMBER.  AND THIS DIDN'T
 HAPPEN BECAUSE OF LUCK.  THIS

03:49:12.417 --> 03:49:16.551
 WIDE REACH IS A DIRECT
 CONSEQUENCE OF HOW THE WEB

03:49:16.552 --> 03:49:23.403
 OPERATES.  IT IS AN OPEN,
 DECENTRALIZED PLATFORM.  IT

03:49:23.404 --> 03:49:30.052
 HAS NO GATEKEEPERS. 
 DEVELOPERS GET WIDE REACH. 

03:49:30.053 --> 03:49:34.090
 USERS GET LOW FRICTION.
 AND ON THE CHROME TEAM, OUR

03:49:34.091 --> 03:49:38.926
 MISSION HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO
 MOVE THE WEB PLATFORM

03:49:38.927 --> 03:49:41.848
 FORWARD.  WE SPEND A LOT OF
 TIME WORKING ON MAKING THE

03:49:41.849 --> 03:49:45.390
 WEB PLATFORM BETTER.  LOTS OF
 THINGS ON THE FOUNDATIONS. 

03:49:45.391 --> 03:49:48.515
 THINGS THAT JUST HAPPEN UNDER
 THE HOOD THAT YOU MAY NOT

03:49:48.516 --> 03:49:52.856
 EVEN RECOGNIZE, BUT AT EVERY
 SEARCH CHANGE, THE WEB

03:49:52.857 --> 03:49:56.595
 PLATFORM JUST GETS BETTER.
 TO TAKE ONE EXAMPLE, OVER THE

03:49:56.596 --> 03:50:00.427
 LAST YEAR, WE FOCUSED OUR
 JAVASCRIPT PERFORMANCE ON

03:50:00.428 --> 03:50:05.771
 REAL-WORLD WEB USAGE.  IT'S
 SORT OF LIKE WHAT KIND OF CAR

03:50:05.772 --> 03:50:09.195
 WOULD YOU RATHER DRIVE?  A
 CAR THAT'S BEEN ROAD TESTED

03:50:09.196 --> 03:50:11.718
 IN REAL-WORLD DRIVING
 CONDITIONS OR A CAR THAT'S

03:50:11.719 --> 03:50:15.455
 BEEN TESTED IN AN ARTIFICIAL
 LAB SETTING?

03:50:15.456 --> 03:50:21.007
 WE WANT OUR CAR, AND OUR
 JAVASCRIPT ENGINE IS

03:50:21.008 --> 03:50:24.358
 LITERALLY CALLED V8, WE WANT
 OUR CAR TO BE GREAT ON THE

03:50:24.359 --> 03:50:27.170
 ROADS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY
 DRIVE ON.  AND CURRENTLY WE

03:50:27.171 --> 03:50:33.114
 THINK THE SPEEDOMETER
 BENCHMARK BEST CAPTURES THIS

03:50:33.115 --> 03:50:36.077
 REAL-WORLD USAGE SO I'M
 PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT

03:50:36.078 --> 03:50:41.689
 CHROME ON ANDROID IS NOW 35%
 FASTER ON THE SPEEDOMETER

03:50:41.690 --> 03:50:45.423
 BLARK COMPARED TO A
 BENCHMARK COMPARED TO A YEAR

03:50:45.424 --> 03:50:46.337
 AGO.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

03:50:46.338 --> 03:50:49.686
 AND WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR GAINS
 ON OTHER OS'S AS WELL.

03:50:49.687 --> 03:50:52.711
 TO TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE, I'M
 SURE ALL OF US HAVE

03:50:52.712 --> 03:50:56.955
 EXPERIENCED THE ANNOYANCE OF
 LOADING A WEB PAGE AND

03:50:56.956 --> 03:50:59.990
 STARTING TO READ SOME CONTENT
 ONLY TO HAVE IT JUMP TO A

03:50:59.991 --> 03:51:03.595
 DIFFERENT LOCATION.  AND THIS
 USUALLY HAPPENS BECAUSE SOME

03:51:03.596 --> 03:51:08.839
 OFF-SCREEN CONTENT IS LOADED
 IN AND PUSHED DOWN THE

03:51:08.840 --> 03:51:10.777
 VISIBLE CONTENT.
 NOW, TO IMPROVE THIS USER

03:51:10.778 --> 03:51:13.689
 EXPERIENCE, WE LAUNCHED A NEW
 FEATURE CALLED SCROLL

03:51:13.690 --> 03:51:17.126
 ANCHORING.  AND SCROLL
 ANCHORING WORKS BY LOCKING

03:51:17.127 --> 03:51:20.465
 THE SCROLL POSITION TO AN
 ELEMENT THAT IS VISIBLE ON

03:51:20.466 --> 03:51:24.601
 THE PAGE, SO THE USER SAYS IN
 THE SAME POSITION EVEN AS OUR

03:51:24.602 --> 03:51:27.627
 SCREEN CONTENT GETS LOADED
 IN.

03:51:27.628 --> 03:51:31.572
 SO TO SHOW YOU WHAT IT LOOKS
 LIKE IN ACTION, ON THE LEFT

03:51:31.573 --> 03:51:36.208
 IS CHROME WITHOUT SCROLL
 ANCHORING, AND ON THE RIGHT

03:51:36.209 --> 03:51:39.030
 IS CHROME WITH SCROLL
 ANCHORING ENABLED.  AND THIS

03:51:39.031 --> 03:51:42.563
 IS A LONG PAGE, AND AS WE
 SCROLL DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF

03:51:42.564 --> 03:51:46.711
 THIS PAGE, YOU'LL SEE ON THE
 RIGHT THE PAGE STAYS LOCKED

03:51:46.712 --> 03:51:49.730
 IN POSITION WHILE ON THE LEFT
 THE PAGE IS JUMPING ALL OVER

03:51:49.731 --> 03:51:53.669
 THE PLACE AS OUR SCREEN
 CONTENT GETS LOADED IN.

03:51:53.670 --> 03:51:56.705
 NOW, THIS IS A BIT OF A
 CONTRIVED DEMO JUST TO SHOW

03:51:56.706 --> 03:52:00.041
 YOU EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON. 
 BUT SINCE WE LAUNCHED THIS

03:52:00.042 --> 03:52:03.569
 FEATURE, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS
 THAT ON AVERAGE, SCROLL

03:52:03.570 --> 03:52:08.330
 ANCHORING PREVENTS THREE
 JUMPS PER PAGE LOAD.  SO THIS

03:52:08.331 --> 03:52:10.741
 HAS HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON THE
 QUALITY OF THE USER

03:52:10.742 --> 03:52:15.473
 EXPERIENCE.
 AND THERE ARE MANY MORE SUCH

03:52:15.474 --> 03:52:17.613
 CHANGES.  THINGS THAT DON'T
 NEED ANY ACTION FROM

03:52:17.614 --> 03:52:20.426
 DEVELOPERS OR USERS BUT THAT
 JUST MAKE THE WEB PLATFORM

03:52:20.427 --> 03:52:25.363
 BETTER.
 SO THAT'S THE FOUNDATION. 

03:52:25.364 --> 03:52:28.287
 NEXT COME ALL OF THE FEATURES
 AND APIs THAT ENABLE YOU

03:52:28.288 --> 03:52:31.115
 ALL TO DO GREAT THINGS, TO
 BUILD GREAT EXPERIENCES ON

03:52:31.116 --> 03:52:35.055
 TOP OF THAT FOUNDATION.  AND
 TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT

03:52:35.056 --> 03:52:39.310
 THE AMAZING MOMENTUM WE'VE
 SEEN ACROSS THE CORE PILLARS

03:52:39.311 --> 03:52:41.721
 OF THE MODERN MOBILE WEB. 
 I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

03:52:41.722 --> 03:52:48.077
 WE ARE DOING TO MAKE WEB APPS
 MORE POLISHED AND FEEL FOR

03:52:48.078 --> 03:52:50.230
 INTEGRATED INTO THE DEVICE,
 AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT

03:52:50.231 --> 03:52:53.737
 ALL THE WAYS WE'RE WORKING ON
 TO MAKE BUILDING WEB APPS

03:52:53.738 --> 03:52:57.676
 EASIER THAN EVER BEFORE.
 SO LET'S START WITH MOMENTUM. 

03:52:57.677 --> 03:53:02.425
 ONE OF THE CORE PILLARS OF
 THE MODERN MOBILE WEB IS

03:53:02.426 --> 03:53:05.960
 ACCELERATED MOBILE PAGES OR
 AMP FOR CONTENT-FOCUSED

03:53:05.961 --> 03:53:08.691
 EXPERIENCES.  NOW, WE ALL
 KNOW THAT CONTENT EXPERIENCES

03:53:08.692 --> 03:53:11.729
 ON THE WEB CAN SOMETIMES BE
 QUITE PAINFUL, AND WE

03:53:11.730 --> 03:53:15.461
 SPEARHEADED THE AMP PROJECT
 LAST YEAR, THE OPEN SOURCE

03:53:15.462 --> 03:53:18.793
 AMP PROJECT LAST YEAR, TO
 IMPROVE THIS EXPERIENCE.

03:53:18.794 --> 03:53:24.325
 AND THE BENEFITS THAT AMP
 BRINGS ARE STARK.  ON

03:53:24.326 --> 03:53:28.762
 AVERAGE, AN AMP PAGE LOADS IN
 LESS THAN A SECOND, AND IT

03:53:28.763 --> 03:53:30.763
 USES TEN TIMES LESS

03:53:32.692 --> 03:53:34.104
 DATA. 
 AND AS A RESULT, THE GROWTH

03:53:34.105 --> 03:53:39.045
 OF AMP HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL. 
 LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME, THERE

03:53:39.046 --> 03:53:44.287
 WERE 125 MILLION AMP
 DOCUMENTS OUT THERE, AND

03:53:44.288 --> 03:53:48.918
 TODAY THERE ARE OVER 2
 BILLION AMP PAGES FROM OVER

03:53:48.919 --> 03:53:50.919
 900,000 DIFFERENT

03:53:53.670 --> 03:53:55.670
 DOMAINS.
 [ APPLAUSE

03:53:57.693 --> 03:53:59.917
 ] AMAZING MOMENTUM
 MANY AND MORE AND MORE

03:53:59.918 --> 03:54:02.536
 PLATFORMS ARE NOW LINKING OUT
 TO AMPs.  AND THEY'RE DOING

03:54:02.537 --> 03:54:05.480
 THIS BECAUSE THEY FIND THAT
 USERS ARE MORE ENGAGED WHEN

03:54:05.481 --> 03:54:07.991
 THEY CAN GET TO THE CONTENT
 FASTER.

03:54:07.992 --> 03:54:11.218
 FOR EXAMPLE, LINKEDIN HAS
 FOUND THAT PEOPLE SPEND 10%

03:54:11.219 --> 03:54:14.561
 MORE TIME READING AN ARTICLE
 WHEN IT'S AN AMP PAGE VERSUS

03:54:14.562 --> 03:54:17.986
 WHEN IT'S NOT.
 AND TODAY I'M EXCITED TO

03:54:17.987 --> 03:54:20.311
 ANNOUNCE THAT SEVERAL NEW
 PARTNERS ARE GOING TO BE

03:54:20.312 --> 03:54:25.147
 SUPPORTING THE AMP PROJECT IN
 THE COMING WEEKS.  TWITTER

03:54:25.148 --> 03:54:29.491
 WILL BEGIN LINKING OUT TO
 AMPs ACROSS ALL OF THEIR

03:54:29.492 --> 03:54:34.430
 MOBILE WEB AND NATIVE APP
 PROPERTIES.  TUMBLR WILL

03:54:34.431 --> 03:54:39.981
 BEGIN USING AMP FOR THEIR
 BLOGS.  WE GOA AND

03:54:44.104 --> 03:54:46.225
 QZONE HAD
 ALSO BEGIN LINKING OUT TO AMP

03:54:46.226 --> 03:54:50.571
 AS WELL.  AND FINALLY AMP IS
 SEEING  SUCCESS IN NEW

03:54:50.572 --> 03:54:55.125
 VERTICALS LIKE eCOMMERCE
 WITH COMPONENTS SUCH AS

03:54:55.126 --> 03:55:00.357
 AMP-BIND YOU CAN BUILD
 ENGAGING EXPERIENCES AND MANY

03:55:00.358 --> 03:55:02.165
 MERCHANTS  ARE DOING JUST
 THAT.

03:55:02.166 --> 03:55:05.695
 SO THAT'S AMP, A GREAT WAY TO
 BUILD CONTENT-FOCUSED

03:55:05.696 --> 03:55:09.124
 EXPERIENCES FOR THE MODERN
 MOBILE WEB.

03:55:09.125 --> 03:55:13.354
 THE SECOND PILLAR OF THE
 MODERN MOBILE WEB IS

03:55:13.355 --> 03:55:16.292
 PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS OR
 PWAs.  PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS

03:55:16.293 --> 03:55:20.527
 ARE A WAY TO BUILD AP-FOCUSED
 EXPERIENCES THAT ARE

03:55:20.528 --> 03:55:26.167
 RELIABLE, FAST, AND ENGAGING. 
 AND WE WERE INSPIRED TO START

03:55:26.168 --> 03:55:28.992
 THIS JOURNEY BASED ON OUR
 BELIEF THAT WEB EXPERIENCES

03:55:28.993 --> 03:55:33.634
 CAN AND SHOULD BE RADICALLY
 BETTER.

03:55:33.635 --> 03:55:36.061
 AND USERS LOVE THESE
 EXPERIENCES, WHICH MEANS THAT

03:55:36.062 --> 03:55:39.998
 THEY'RE MORE ENGAGED, WHICH
 MEANS CONVERSIONS ARE HIGHER,

03:55:39.999 --> 03:55:42.118
 WHICH MEANS BUSINESS METRICS
 ARE BETTER.  SO THIS IS JUST

03:55:42.119 --> 03:55:46.855
 A GOOD THING ALL AROUND.
 BUT RATHER THAN ME TELL YOU

03:55:46.856 --> 03:55:49.683
 ABOUT HOW AWESOME OUR
 PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS ARE,

03:55:49.684 --> 03:55:52.124
 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE THAT
 JUST LAUNCHED RECENTLY.  IT'S

03:55:52.125 --> 03:55:55.432

 IN THE WORLD, AND OVER 80% OF
 OUR USERS ARE ON MOBILE

03:56:53.060 --> 03:56:56.687

 WE WERE SEEING HEALTHY GROWTH

03:56:56.688 --> 03:56:58.814
 IN MOBILE WEB USAGE AT
 TWITTER SO WE WANTED TO MAKE

03:56:58.815 --> 03:57:01.733
 SURE THAT THIS EXPERIENCE WAS
 TOP NOTCH.

03:57:01.734 --> 03:57:04.356

 YOU ABOUT TWITTER LITE, WHY

03:57:04.357 --> 03:57:07.987
 DON'T WE GIVE YOU A LIVE

 WHEN USERS VISIT TWITTER LITE
 ON ANDROID, THEY'RE PROMPTED

03:57:18.211 --> 03:57:20.615
 TO ADD IT TO THEIR HOME

 TO GET THE LATEST NEWS AND
 TAP ON PUBLISHING LINKS WE

03:57:59.785 --> 03:58:07.345
 HAVE BEEN  BIG FANS OF AMP.

04:00:39.122 --> 04:00:42.555
 YOU, KATIE.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

04:00:42.556 --> 04:00:45.676
 IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO
 DELIVER A FAST, ENGAGING

04:00:45.677 --> 04:00:48.799
 EXPERIENCE WHILE CONSUMING
 LESS MOBILE DATA.  TWITTER

04:00:48.800 --> 04:00:52.537
 LITE ALREADY CONSUMES LESS
 DATA AS COMPARED TO OUR

04:00:52.538 --> 04:00:55.160
 NATIVE APPS, BUT ON TOP OF
 THAT WE LAUNCHED A NEW

04:00:55.161 --> 04:00:59.815
 FEATURE CALLED DATA SAVER. 
 WHEN A USER IS IN DATA SAVER

04:00:59.816 --> 04:01:06.464
 MODE THEY CAN SAVE UP TO AN
 ADDITIONAL 70% ON THEIR DATA. 

04:01:06.465 --> 04:01:11.102
 EVERYONE.
 NOW, TWITTER LITE  DELIVERS

04:01:11.103 --> 04:01:14.730
 ALL OF THE KEY FEATURES AT A
 FRACTION OF THE SIZE COMPARED

04:01:14.731 --> 04:01:17.966
 TO OUR NATIVE APPS.  HERE YOU
 CAN SEE THE SIZE DIFFERENCE

04:01:17.967 --> 04:01:23.722
 OF TWITTER LITE COMPARED TO
 OUR ANDROID AND iOS APPS.

04:01:23.723 --> 04:01:26.553
 AND OF COURSE THE MOBILE WEB
 IS MORE THAN JUST A LANDING

04:01:26.554 --> 04:01:31.504
 PAGE.  WE'RE EXCITED TO
 PROVIDE A FAST, FEATURE-RICH

04:01:31.505 --> 04:01:34.927
 EXPERIENCE AND OUR USERS FROM
 AROUND THE WORLD, FROM

04:01:34.928 --> 04:01:38.958
 NIGERIA TO JAPAN TO ECUADOR,
 THE PHILIPPINES, THEY LOVE IT

04:01:38.959 --> 04:01:42.179
 AS WELL.
 AND WE SEE IT IN OUR METRICS,

04:01:42.180 --> 04:01:47.423
 TOO.  WE'RE SEEING INCREASES
 IN PAGES-PER-SESSION AND

04:01:47.424 --> 04:01:49.957
 TWEETS SENT FROM TWITTER
 LITE.  AND LIKE KATIE SAID,

04:01:49.958 --> 04:01:52.677
 WE'RE SEEING MORE THAN 1
 MILLION LAUNCHES FROM THE

04:01:52.678 --> 04:01:56.614
 HOME SCREEN EVERY DAY.
 MOST IMPORTANTLY, OUR USERS

04:01:56.615 --> 04:02:02.467
 ARE HAPPY.  TWITTER LITE IS
 OUR NEW, STANDARD MOBILE WEB

 Rahul Roy-Chowdhury:  GREAT. 
 THANK YOU,  PATRICK AND KATIE.

04:02:19.738 --> 04:02:24.476
TWITTER.COM IS A PWA, FOLKS. 
 THE MODERN MOBILE WEB IS TRULY

04:02:24.477 --> 04:02:30.401
 MAINSTREAM.  AND IT'S NOT JUST
 TWITTER.  LAST YEAR WE TALKED

04:02:30.402 --> 04:02:36.348
 ABOUT SOME EARLY ADOPTERS OF
 PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS.  AND 

04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:37.761
SINCE
 THEN THE MOMENTUM AND GROWTH 

04:02:37.762 --> 04:02:39.189
HAS
 BEEN PHENOMENAL.  THESE 

04:02:39.190 --> 04:02:40.688
LAUNCHES
 ARE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE 

04:02:40.689 --> 04:02:42.521
WORLD
 AND THEY'RE HAPPENING ACROSS 

04:02:42.522 --> 04:02:45.333
ALL
 INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.

04:02:45.334 --> 04:02:49.638
 LARGE TRAVEL COMPANIES, LIKE
 EXPEDIA AND TRIVAGO AND WEGO

04:02:50.563 --> 04:02:58.517
 HAVE ALL LAUNCHED PROGRESSIVE
 WEB APPS.  PUBLISHERS LIKE

04:02:58.518 --> 04:03:00.743
 INFOBAE AND FORBES HAVE 
LAUNCHED

04:03:00.744 --> 04:03:03.551
 PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS.  FORBES
 HAS SEEN THEIR USER ENGAGEMENT

04:03:03.552 --> 04:03:05.313
 DOUBLE SINCE THE LAUNCH OF 
THEIR

04:03:05.314 --> 04:03:10.604
 PROGRESSIVE WEB APP.
 eCOMMERCE SITES LIKE FANDANGO,

04:03:10.605 --> 04:03:15.952
 RAKATAN AND ALIBABA ARE ALL
 INVESTING IN PWAs.  AND EVEN

04:03:15.953 --> 04:03:20.153
 NEW SERVICES THAT WE TEND TO
 THINK OF AS APP-ONLY LIKE RIGHT

04:03:20.154 --> 04:03:22.712
 SHARING SERVICES HAVE GOTTEN IN
 ON THE ACTION.

04:03:22.713 --> 04:03:27.049
 LYFT LAUNCHED THEIR PROGRESSIVE
 WEB APP LAST FALL AND OLA CABS,

04:03:27.050 --> 04:03:31.371
 INDIA'S LARGEST RIDE SHARING
 SERVICE JUST RECENTLY LAUNCHED

04:03:31.372 --> 04:03:35.603
 THEIR PWA.  AND, IN FACT, OLA
 WILL BE UP ON STAGE IN JUST A

04:03:35.604 --> 04:03:38.534
 BIT TO SHOW IT OFF TO YOU.
 NOW, ONE REASON PROGRESSIVE WEB

04:03:38.535 --> 04:03:43.285
 APPS IS SO SUCCESSFUL IS THAT
 MULTIPLE BROWSERS ARE COMMITTED

04:03:43.286 --> 04:03:50.216
 TO THEM.  SO WHILE DEVELOPER
 ADOPTION IS GROWING, SO IS

04:03:50.217 --> 04:03:53.642
 BROWSER SUPPORT.  AND IF A
 BROWSER YOU CARE ABOUT ISN'T ON

04:03:53.643 --> 04:03:55.643
 THIS LIST YET

04:03:58.089 --> 04:03:59.376
, PROGRESSIVE WEB
 APPS ARE DESIGNED TO WORK WELL

04:03:59.377 --> 04:04:03.009
 EVERYWHERE.  SO YOU CAN ALWAYS
 COUNT ON REACHING THE USERS 

04:04:03.010 --> 04:04:05.525
THAT
 ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU.  TAKE THE

04:04:05.526 --> 04:04:11.671
 EXAMPLE OF LUXURY COSMETICS
 BRAND LANCOME.  LANCOME 

04:04:11.672 --> 04:04:12.921
RECENTLY
 LAUNCHED A PROGRESSIVE WEB APP

04:04:12.922 --> 04:04:16.011
 AND IT WORKS GREAT ON ALL
 BROWSERS AND THEY HAVE SEEN

04:04:16.012 --> 04:04:17.825
 GREAT STATS.  BUT WHAT I WANT 
TO

04:04:17.826 --> 04:04:22.159
 CALL OUT HERE IS THAT iOS IS
 PARTICULAR IMPORTANT FOR 

04:04:22.160 --> 04:04:26.086
LANCOME
 BECAUSE 65% OF THEIR MOBILE WEB

04:04:26.087 --> 04:04:31.672
 USERS ARE ON iPHONES.  AND
 WHAT LANCOME OBSERVED WAS THAT

04:04:31.673 --> 04:04:37.076
 THOSE iOS USERS HAVE A SESSION
 LENGTH THAT IS NOW 53% HIGHER

04:04:37.077 --> 04:04:39.997
 THAN IT WAS BEFORE THEIR 
LAUNCH.

04:04:39.998 --> 04:04:43.213
 AND THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT
 THAT SOME PWA FEATURES ARE NOT

04:04:43.214 --> 04:04:47.156
 SUPPORTED ON THAT PLATFORM.
 NOW, THE

04:04:50.972 --> 04:04:51.274
 PROGRESSIVE IN
 PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS REALLY

04:04:51.275 --> 04:04:54.918
 REFERS TO PROGRESSIVE
 ENHANCEMENT.  BUT WHAT IT 

04:04:54.919 --> 04:04:56.011
REALLY
 MEANS IS YOU CAN COUNT ON

04:04:56.012 --> 04:04:58.438
 REACHING THE USERS THAT ARE
 IMPORTANT TO YOU NO MATTER WHAT

04:04:58.439 --> 04:05:00.439
 BROWSER MIX YOU CARE

04:05:02.667 --> 04:05:04.372
 ABOUT.
 SO THE MOMENTUM AND GROWTH

04:05:04.373 --> 04:05:11.756
 ACROSS THE CORE PILLARS OF THE
 MODERN MOBILE WEB, ACROSS AMP

04:05:11.757 --> 04:05:13.655
 AND PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS HAS
 BEEN TRULY INCREDIBLE OVER THE

04:05:13.656 --> 04:05:18.385
 LAST 12 MONTHS.
 THE MODERN MOBILE WEB IS NOW

04:05:18.386 --> 04:05:20.386
 TRULY

04:05:22.917 --> 04:05:25.045
 MAINSTREAM.  NOW, WHILE
 ALL OF THIS MOMENTUM IS

04:05:25.046 --> 04:05:26.549
 HAPPENING ALL AROUND US, WE 
HAVE

04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:28.802
 BEEN HEADS DOWN WORKING ON
 MAKING PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS 

04:05:28.803 --> 04:05:30.890
EVEN
 BETTER.

04:05:30.891 --> 04:05:35.558
 OUR GOAL IS TO MAKE WEB APPS
 FEEL MORE INTEGRATED INTO THE

04:05:35.559 --> 04:05:42.380
 OVERALL DEVICE SO USERS GET A
 ROBUST NO-COMPROMISES

04:05:42.381 --> 04:05:45.594
 EXPERIENCE.
 HOW ARE WE DOING THIS?  WE'RE

04:05:45.595 --> 04:05:49.024
 ADDING A LOT OF NEW APIs TO
 THE WEB PLATFORM.  IN FACT, WE

04:05:49.025 --> 04:05:54.369
 ADDED 215 NEW APIs JUST SINCE
 GOOGLE I/O LAST YEAR.

04:05:54.370 --> 04:05:57.383
 BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS
 NOT THE NUMBER OF APIs WE

04:05:57.384 --> 04:06:00.816
 SHIP.  WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
 IS WHAT USE CASES CAN THESE

04:06:00.817 --> 04:06:05.046
 APIs UNLOCK FOR YOU.  AND I
 WANT TO TALK ABOUT THREE USE

04:06:05.047 --> 04:06:09.091
 CASES TODAY.
   INSTALLING WEB APPS TO YOUR

04:06:09.092 --> 04:06:11.199

THE

04:06:11.200 --> 04:06:15.527

 LET'S START WITH 
INSTALLABILITY.

04:06:18.460 --> 04:06:20.680
 WE ALREADY HAVE A WAY TO ADD 
WEB

04:06:20.681 --> 04:06:25.414
 APPS TO YOUR HOME SCREEN.  BUT
 WE'VE MADE IT A LOT BETTER. 

04:06:25.805 --> 04:06:28.327
 NOW, FIRST OF ALL, WE'VE HEARD
 FROM MANY OF YOU THAT YOU WOULD

04:06:28.328 --> 04:06:32.575
 LIKE THE INSTALL PROMPT TO BE
 MORE RELIABLE AND PREDICTABLE. 

04:06:32.576 --> 04:06:37.991
 AND WE'VE HEARD YOUR FEEDBACK
 LOUD AND CLEAR.  SO I'M HAPPY 

04:06:37.992 --> 04:06:40.918
TO
 REPORT THAT NOW YOU CAN SHOW 

04:06:40.919 --> 04:06:42.132
THE
 INSTALL PROMPT TO YOUR USERS

04:06:42.133 --> 04:06:44.133
 WHEN YOU WANT.
 [ APPLAUSE

04:06:49.066 --> 04:06:50.891

 AND ONCE A USER HAS INSTALLED

04:06:50.892 --> 04:06:52.796
 YOUR WEB APP TO THEIR DEVICE, 
IT

04:06:52.797 --> 04:06:57.327
 SHOWS UP EVERYWHERE YOU EXPECT
 AN APP TO SHOW UP.  THEY SHOW 

04:06:57.328 --> 04:06:59.241
UP
 IN THE APP LAUNCHER, NOT JUST

04:06:59.242 --> 04:07:02.369
 THE HOME SCREEN.
 [ APPLAUSE ]

04:07:02.370 --> 04:07:04.370
 THEY'RE INTEGRATED INTO ANDROID
 SETTINGS.

04:07:07.698 --> 04:07:10.217
  THEY PARTICIPATE IN
 THE ANDROID INTENTS SYSTEM LIKE

04:07:10.218 --> 04:07:14.455
 ALONGSIDE ANY OTHER NATIVE APP.

04:07:14.456 --> 04:07:17.376
 THEY CAN HANDLE NOTIFICATIONS
 NATIVELY RATHER THAN THROUGH

04:07:17.377 --> 04:07:19.377
 CHROME.

04:07:22.402 --> 04:07:25.936
  AND WEB APPS CAN LAUNCH
 IN FULL-SCREEN MODE JUST LIKE

04:07:25.937 --> 04:07:28.248
 ANY NATIVE ANDROID APP CAN AS
 WELL.

04:07:28.249 --> 04:07:33.586
 SO IT'S EASIER THAN EVER BEFORE
 TO INSTALL WEB APPLICATIONS TO

04:07:33.587 --> 04:07:37.711
 YOUR DEVICE.  SO FROM 
INSTALLING

04:07:37.712 --> 04:07:41.442
 WEB APPS TO YOUR DEVICE, LET'S
 LOOK AT OUR SECOND USE CASE: 

04:07:41.443 --> 04:07:45.291
 PAYING FOR THINGS ON THE WEB.
 MOBILE PAYMENTS ARE A BIG DEAL.

04:07:47.698 --> 04:07:52.336
 $123 BILLION LAST YEAR JUST IN
 THE U.S. ALONE.  AND TO MAKE

04:07:52.337 --> 04:07:54.665
 PAYMENT FLOWS ON THE WEB 
BETTER,

04:07:54.666 --> 04:07:59.293
 WE LAUNCHED A ONE-TAP PAYMENTS
 API CALLED PAYMENT REQUEST.

04:07:59.294 --> 04:08:04.842
 AND IT WORKS WITH CREDIT CARDS,
 AND IT WORKS WITH GOOGLE FORMS

04:08:04.843 --> 04:08:08.868
 OF PAYMENT SUCH AS ANDROID PAY.
 AND MANY MERCHANTS ARE ACTIVELY

04:08:08.869 --> 04:08:12.289
 USING THIS API TODAY, BUT WE
 KNOW THAT CREDIT CARDS ARE JUST

04:08:12.290 --> 04:08:14.611
 PART OF THE PUZZLE HERE.  
PEOPLE

04:08:14.612 --> 04:08:18.239
 HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO
 PAY FOR THINGS, AND WE WANT TO

04:08:18.240 --> 04:08:20.571
 MAKE SURE THAT A USER ON THE 
WEB

04:08:20.572 --> 04:08:25.511
 CAN PAY FOR THINGS USING THE
 PAYMENT APPS THEY ALREADY USE.

04:08:25.512 --> 04:08:30.138
 SO I'M VERY PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE
 THAT NOW YOUR WEB SITE CAN

04:08:30.139 --> 04:08:34.464
 INTEGRATE WITH ANY SUPPORTED
 PAYMENT APP USING PAYMENT

04:08:34.465 --> 04:08:38.587
 REQUEST.  SO IF A USER HAS A
 NATIVE PAYMENT APP INSTALLED,

04:08:38.588 --> 04:08:41.009
 YOU CAN INTEGRATE THAT RIGHT
 INTO YOUR PAYMENT PLOW ON THE

04:08:41.010 --> 04:08:46.262
 WEB -- FLOW ON THE WEB.  WE ARE
 ALREADY WORKING WITH SAMSUNG 

04:08:46.263 --> 04:08:49.067
PAY
 AND ALIPAY AND MANY OTHER 

04:08:49.068 --> 04:08:50.197
NATIVE
 PAYMENT APPS WILL BE INTEGRATED

04:08:50.198 --> 04:08:51.895
 VERY SOON.  IT'S NOT JUST 
NATIVE

04:08:51.896 --> 04:08:55.223
 PAYMENT APPS, WE WANT WEB APPS
 TO BE INTEGRATED AS WELL.  WE

04:08:55.224 --> 04:08:58.869
 ARE ACTIVELY PARTNERING WITH
 PAYPAL TO BRING THEIR WEB APP

04:08:58.870 --> 04:09:04.301
 RIGHT INTO PAYMENT REQUEST.
 SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

04:09:04.302 --> 04:09:05.816
THE
 ENTIRE THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT

04:09:05.817 --> 04:09:09.628
 ECOSYSTEM IS AVAILABLE FOR YOU
 IN YOUR CHECKOUT FLOW ON THE

04:09:11.639 --> 04:09:14.662
 WEB.
 SO FROM INSTALLING WEB APPS TO

04:09:14.663 --> 04:09:19.379
 YOUR DEVICE AND PAYMENTS, LET'S
 LOOK AT OUR THIRD USE CASE: 

04:09:19.380 --> 04:09:25.215
 MEDIA EXPERIENCES.
 MEDIA IS IMPORTANT.  OVER 70% 

04:09:25.216 --> 04:09:27.128
OF
 INTERNET TRAFFIC IS VIDEO, AND

04:09:27.129 --> 04:09:30.550
 SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE
 DELIVER A COMPLETE SOLUTION FOR

04:09:30.551 --> 04:09:33.972
 MEDIA ON THE MOBILE WEB.
 NOW, WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

04:09:33.973 --> 04:09:38.110
 ADDING MANY NEW APIs, THINGS
 LIKE THE MEDIA SESSIONS API,

04:09:38.111 --> 04:09:42.426
 BACKGROUND FETCH, FULL SCREEN
 ORIENTATION AND MANY OTHERS.

04:09:42.427 --> 04:09:44.842
 AND WE PUT TOGETHER A SAMPLE 
APP

04:09:44.843 --> 04:09:49.074
 TO SHOW YOU THE KIND OF MEDIA
 EXPERIENCES THAT ARE POSSIBLE

04:09:49.075 --> 04:09:53.187
 USING THESE APIs.  AND SO LET
 ME WALK YOU THROUGH SOME OF THE

04:09:53.188 --> 04:09:56.009
 HIGHLIGHTS.
 FIRST, AS YOU CAN SEE, I HAVE

04:09:56.010 --> 04:09:57.934
 INSTALLED THE APP TO MY DEVICE.

04:09:57.935 --> 04:10:01.164
 AND WHEN I TAP ON IT, IT
 LAUNCHES IN FULL-SCREEN MODE

04:10:01.165 --> 04:10:07.593
 WITH A SPLASH SCREEN.  AND APP
 BRANDING IS FRONT AND CENTER. 

04:10:07.594 --> 04:10:13.732
 THERE'S NO CHROME UI ANYWHERE
 HERE.  AND WHEN I TAP ON A 

04:10:13.733 --> 04:10:15.439
VIDEO
 TO PLAY IT -- OH, ACTUALLY, 

04:10:15.440 --> 04:10:18.356
WHEN
 I SCROLL UP AND DOWN, YOU CAN

04:10:18.357 --> 04:10:23.202
 SEE THAT THE APP FEELS SMOOTH
 AND FLUID AND JUST WORKS

04:10:23.203 --> 04:10:26.919
 REALLY -- JUST WORKS IN A VERY
 POLISHED WAY.

04:10:26.920 --> 04:10:31.262
 AND WHEN I TAP ON A VIDEO TO
 PLAY IT, IT PLAYS BACK

04:10:31.263 --> 04:10:33.785
 INSTANTLY.  AND THIS IS NOT
 BECAUSE THE WiFi IS REALLY

04:10:33.786 --> 04:10:37.499
 GOOD.  IT'S BECAUSE WE PREFETCH
 THE FIRST FEW SECONDS OF VIDEO

04:10:37.500 --> 04:10:42.445
 SO THAT WE CAN ENABLE INSTANT
 PLAYBACK.

04:10:42.446 --> 04:10:45.879
 AND IF I JUST FLIP MY PHONE
 OVER, IT WILL INSTANTLY ENTER

04:10:45.880 --> 04:10:49.108
 FULL-SCREEN MODE, AND YOU CAN
 SEE THIS VIDEO HAS CUSTOM

04:10:49.109 --> 04:10:54.244
 CONTROLS, SO I CAN GO BACKWARDS
 AND FORWARDS 30 SECONDS.  AND 

04:10:54.245 --> 04:10:56.363
AS
 I USE THE SCROLL BAR, YOU SEE

04:10:56.364 --> 04:10:58.364
 THUMBNAILS START TO

04:11:00.085 --> 04:11:02.613
 APPEAR.
 AND IF I LOCK THE DEVICE, YOU

04:11:02.614 --> 04:11:07.049
 CAN SEE THE BACKGROUND POSTER
 IMAGE AND YOU CAN SEE MEDIA

04:11:07.050 --> 04:11:10.572
 CONTROLS APPEAR RIGHT ON THE
 LOCK SCREEN.  AND THIS COULD BE

04:11:10.573 --> 04:11:14.136
 REALLY USEFUL, FOR EXAMPLE, IF
 I'M LISTENING TO AUDIO ON MY

04:11:14.137 --> 04:11:16.137
 MORNING COMMUTE.

04:11:17.521 --> 04:11:20.448
 AND, FINALLY, THIS ALL WORKS
 REALLY WELL OFFLINE AS WELL.  

04:11:20.449 --> 04:11:23.373
SO
 IF I GO INTO AIRPLANE MODE, I

04:11:23.374 --> 04:11:26.693
 CAN VIEW VIDEOS THAT I HAVE
 PREVIOUSLY SAVED FOR OFF-LINE

04:11:26.694 --> 04:11:31.338
 VIEWING AND I CAN TAP ON IT AND
 I CAN PLAY THE VIDEO WHILE I'M

04:11:31.339 --> 04:11:33.851
 OFF LINE.
 ALL OF THIS GOODNESS IS

04:11:33.852 --> 04:11:39.306
 AVAILABLE ON THE MOBILE WEB
 TODAY.  SO FROM INSTALLING WEB

04:11:39.307 --> 04:11:42.637
 APPS TO YOUR DEVICE, TO PAYING
 FOR THINGS ON THE WEB, TO

04:11:42.638 --> 04:11:46.573
 POLISHED MEDIA EXPERIENCES,
 WE'RE WORKING HARD TO MAKE 

04:11:46.574 --> 04:11:50.091
USING
 WEB APPS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.

04:11:50.092 --> 04:11:54.947
 WE'RE ALSO WORKING HARD TO MAKE
 BUILDING WEB APPS A GREAT

04:11:54.948 --> 04:11:59.752
 EXPERIENCE.  SO HERE'S A
 QUESTION.  HOW GOOD IS YOUR

04:11:59.753 --> 04:12:02.496
 CURRENT WEB APP?  AND HOW DO 
YOU

04:12:02.497 --> 04:12:07.730
 EVEN FIND OUT?  TO HELP YOU
 ANSWER THAT QUESTION, WE

04:12:07.731 --> 04:12:12.261
 LAUNCHED A TOOL CALLED
 LIGHTHOUSE.  LIGHTHOUSE GUIDES

04:12:12.262 --> 04:12:17.906
 YOU ALONG YOUR PWA JOURNEY AND
 RUNS OVER A HUNDRED AUDITS

04:12:17.907 --> 04:12:21.437
 AGAINST YOUR WEB APP CHECKING
 EVERYTHING FROM PAGE 

04:12:21.438 --> 04:12:23.358
PERFORMANCE
 TO BYTE EFFICIENCY TO

04:12:23.359 --> 04:12:25.875
 ACCESSIBILITY.  AND IT EVEN
 GIVES YOU A SCORE FROM ZERO TO 

04:12:25.876 --> 04:12:26.483
A
 HUNDRED.

04:12:26.484 --> 04:12:30.005
 SO IF YOU WANT TO BRAG ABOUT
 YOUR GREAT LIGHTHOUSE CORE ON

04:12:30.006 --> 04:12:34.756
 TWITTER, YOU CAN.  IT REALLY
 DOES SEEM TO GET THE 

04:12:34.757 --> 04:12:36.062
COMPETITIVE
 JUICES FLOWING.  AND YOU WANT 

04:12:36.063 --> 04:12:38.111
TO
 TAKE ALL OF THE GOODNESS OF

04:12:38.112 --> 04:12:41.618
 LIGHTHOUSE AND MAKE IT AS EASY
 FOR EVERYONE TO USE AS POSSIBLE

04:12:41.619 --> 04:12:44.231
 AND SO WE'RE INTEGRATING
 LIGHTHOUSE RIGHT INTO CHROME

04:12:44.232 --> 04:12:48.380
 DEVELOPER TOOLS.
 SO YOU CAN JUST OPEN IT UP, AND

04:12:48.381 --> 04:12:50.490
 YOU SEE A LIGHTHOUSE AUDIT 
RIGHT

04:12:50.491 --> 04:12:53.613
 THERE.
 WHETHER YOU WANT TO TWEET YOUR

04:12:53.614 --> 04:12:57.947
 SCORE OR NOT, I'LL LEAVE UP TO
 YOU.

04:12:57.948 --> 04:13:00.368
 SO HOW DO YOU GET A GREAT
 LIGHTHOUSE SCORE?

04:13:00.369 --> 04:13:04.194
 WELL, FOR ONE THING, YOUR APP
 WILL NEED TO WORK WELL WHEN

04:13:04.195 --> 04:13:07.439
 YOU'RE OFF LINE OR ON A FLAKY
 NETWORK.  AND THERE'S A 

04:13:07.440 --> 04:13:08.964
POWERFUL
 TECHNOLOGY BAKED INTO BROWSERS

04:13:08.965 --> 04:13:11.661
 CALLED SERVICEWORKER THAT
 ENABLES THIS.

04:13:11.662 --> 04:13:14.994
 BUT SERVICEWORKER IS QUITE A
 LOW-LEVEL API AND CAN BE HARD 

04:13:14.995 --> 04:13:17.215
TO
 WORK WITH DIRECTLY.  SO TO HELP

04:13:17.216 --> 04:13:21.350
 YOU TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE
 POWER OF SERVICEWORKER, I'D 

04:13:21.351 --> 04:13:24.669
LIKE
 TO INTRODUCE WORKBOX.

04:13:24.670 --> 04:13:29.304
 WORKBOX IS A TOOL THAT WE HAVE
 BUILT THAT ENABLES YOU TO

04:13:29.305 --> 04:13:33.243
 TAKE -- TO GET THE MOST OUT OF
 SERVICEWORKER.  IT BUILDS UPON

04:13:33.244 --> 04:13:35.162
 EXISTING TOOLS AND IT 
SIMPLIFIES

04:13:35.163 --> 04:13:38.105
 A NUMBER OF COMMON PATTERNS AND
 BEST PRACTICES, THINGS LIKE

04:13:38.106 --> 04:13:42.109
 FLEXIBLE CACHING, OR MANAGING
 BACKGROUND SYNC OR EVEN

04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:44.842
 COLLECTING USER STATS WHEN THE
 USER IS OFF LINE.

04:13:44.843 --> 04:13:47.470
 AND WORKBOX IS COMPLETELY
 MODULAR AND FLEXIBLE SO THAT 

04:13:47.471 --> 04:13:49.483
YOU
 CAN JUST TAKE WORKBOX, 

04:13:49.484 --> 04:13:50.986
INTEGRATE
 IT INTO YOUR EXISTING TOOLS AND

04:13:50.987 --> 04:13:52.987
 START USING IT RIGHT

04:13:55.825 --> 04:13:58.161
 AWAY.
 BUT DO REALLY MAX OUT THAT

04:13:58.162 --> 04:14:00.861
 LIGHTHOUSE SCORE, YOUR APP WILL
 NEED TO DO MORE THAN JUST WORK

04:14:00.862 --> 04:14:03.392
 OFF LINE.  IT WILL NEED TO BE
 FAST.  AND THIS MEANS THAT YOU

04:14:03.393 --> 04:14:07.215
 NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD AND
 LOAD YOUR RICH, COMPLEX

04:14:07.216 --> 04:14:08.532
 APPLICATION WITH AS LITTLE 
EXTRA

04:14:08.533 --> 04:14:14.975
 OVERHEAD AS POSSIBLE.
 WEB COMPONENTS ARE A WAY TO

04:14:14.976 --> 04:14:18.816
 BUILD LIGHTWEIGHT USABLE PIECES
 OF YOUR APP WITH VERY LITTLE

04:14:18.817 --> 04:14:21.426
 OVERHEAD.  YOU CAN CREATE YOUR
 OWN COMPONENTS OR YOU CAN REUSE

04:14:21.427 --> 04:14:26.462
 ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF
 COMPONENTS THAT ALREADY EXIST.

04:14:26.463 --> 04:14:29.485
 REMEMBER THOSE AMAZING AMP
 PERFORMANCE NUMBERS?  AMP IS

04:14:29.486 --> 04:14:33.522
 BASED ON WEB COMPONENTS.  AND
 JUST LIKE WE BUILT WORKBOX TO

04:14:33.523 --> 04:14:37.550
 HELP YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF
 SERVICEWORKER, WE BUILT POLYMER

04:14:37.551 --> 04:14:41.690
 TO HELP YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF
 WEB COMPONENTS.

04:14:41.691 --> 04:14:47.237
 AND I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE TODAY
 THE LAUNCH OF POLYMER 2.0, THE

04:14:47.238 --> 04:14:50.870
 NEXT MAJOR EVOLUTION OF THE
 POLYMER LIBRARY.

04:14:50.871 --> 04:14:52.871
 [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

04:14:55.881 --> 04:14:59.809
IT IS A GROUND-UP RETHINK THAT
 IS BUILT TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE

04:14:59.810 --> 04:15:05.163
 OF THE BEST NEW FEATURES OF THE
 MODERN WEB PLATFORM.  IT USES

04:15:05.164 --> 04:15:07.870
 THE NEW WEB COMPONENT APIs
 THAT HAVE SHIPPED IN CHROME AND

04:15:07.871 --> 04:15:13.311
 SAFARI.
 IT EMBRACES ES6 CLASSES.  IT IS

04:15:13.312 --> 04:15:15.739
 COMPLETELY MODULAR.  AND BEST 
OF

04:15:15.740 --> 04:15:23.086
 ALL, IT'S 10% FASTER AND 80%
 SMALLER.  SO TO TAKE A LOOK AT

04:15:23.087 --> 04:15:28.251
 SOMEONE WHO HAS USED POLYMER TO
 BUILD A GREAT PROGRESSIVE WEB

04:15:28.252 --> 04:15:33.262
 APP WITH A GREAT LIGHTHOUSE
 SCORE, LET ME INVITE UP ON 

04:15:33.263 --> 04:15:33.487
STAGE
 DIPIKA KAPADIA AND RATUL ROY

04:15:33.488 --> 04:15:35.778
 FROM OLA CABS.
  [ APPLAUSE ]

04:15:43.216 --> 04:15:45.937
 Dipika Kapadia:  HI, EVERYONE. 
 I'M DIPIKA KAPADIA, HEAD OF

04:15:45.938 --> 04:15:49.178
 CONSUMER WEB PRODUCTS.
 Ratul Roy:  I'M RATUL ROY,

04:15:49.179 --> 04:15:51.382
 PRINCIPAL ENGINEER.
 Dipika Kapadia:  WE ARE HERE 

04:15:51.383 --> 04:15:53.542
ALL
 THE WAY FROM BANGALORE AND

04:15:53.543 --> 04:15:54.512
 REALLY EXCITED TO TELL YOU 
ABOUT

04:15:54.513 --> 04:15:59.252
 OLA AND OUR PWA.
 OLA IS INDIA'S LARGEST

04:15:59.253 --> 04:16:02.571
 RIDE-HAILING SERVICE WITH A
 MISSION TO PROVIDE MOBILITY FOR

04:16:02.572 --> 04:16:07.008
 A BILLION INDIANS.  WE STARTED
 SIX YEARS AGO OUT OF A LITTLE

04:16:07.009 --> 04:16:11.358
 APARTMENT IN MUMBAI.  AND IN
 THOSE DAYS, OUR CO-FOUNDER 

04:16:11.359 --> 04:16:12.867
WOULD
 ACTUALLY DRIVE CUSTOMERS AROUND

04:16:12.868 --> 04:16:16.894
 WHEN THEIR RIDE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

04:16:16.895 --> 04:16:19.719
 TODAY WE DO OVER A MILLION 
DAILY

04:16:19.720 --> 04:16:22.036
 RIDES.  BUT EVEN THAT'S NOT
 ENOUGH WHEN YOUR MISSION IS TO

04:16:22.037 --> 04:16:26.870
 MOVE A BILLION INDIANS AROUND.
 IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE NEEDED

04:16:26.871 --> 04:16:31.714
 TO REACH TIER 2, TIER 3 CITIES,
 SMALLER CITIES WITH FLAKY

04:16:31.715 --> 04:16:36.990
 NETWORKS WHERE USERS HAVE
 LOW-END SMARTPHONES WITH SLOW

04:16:36.991 --> 04:16:41.368
 FRAMEWORK
 PROCESSORS AND LOW MEMORY. 

04:16:41.369 --> 04:16:44.905
 THAT'S THE REASON WE BUILT THIS
 PWA.  WE WOULD LOVE TO SHOW YOU

04:16:44.906 --> 04:16:48.840
 WHAT WE BUILT, SO LET'S GO TO
 DEMO WITH RATUL DRIVING.

04:16:54.466 --> 04:16:58.321
RATUL, LET'S ASSUME WE'RE BACK
 IN BANGALORE AFTER AN AWESOME

04:16:58.322 --> 04:16:58.922
 I/O EXPERIENCE AND NEED TO GET 
A

04:16:58.923 --> 04:17:04.046
 RIDE FROM THE AIRPORT BACK TO
 THE OFFICE.  WILL YOU CALL A

04:17:05.156 --> 04:17:07.578
 SUV?
 Ratul Roy:  SURE, DIPIKA.  I'M

04:17:07.579 --> 04:17:10.893
 LAUNCHING THE PWA FROM THE HOME
 SCREEN.

04:17:10.894 --> 04:17:13.811
 IT'S FAST, ISN'T IT?  IT'S
 ASKING FOR THE BROWSER LOCATION

04:17:13.812 --> 04:17:15.221
 PERMISSION.  BUT I'M GOING TO 
GO

04:17:15.222 --> 04:17:19.556
 AHEAD AND CHOOSE OTHER LOCATION
 FROM MY SAVED FAVORITES.

04:17:19.557 --> 04:17:27.144
 SO I'LL BE TAKING CAB FROM
 AIRPORT TO WORK.

04:17:29.934 --> 04:17:32.764
  THE REASON I
 COULD DO IT SO FAST IS BECAUSE 

04:17:32.765 --> 04:17:33.870
I
 SAVED ALL THE LOCATION AS MY

04:17:33.871 --> 04:17:37.703
 FAVORITES.  IF YOU HAVEN'T,
 STILL YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND 

04:17:37.704 --> 04:17:38.816
WHILE
 SEARCHING THE ADDRESS BAR FOR

04:17:38.817 --> 04:17:42.883
 THE LOCATION OR YOU CAN LOAD IT
 IN THE MAP AND NAVIGATE 

04:17:42.884 --> 04:17:44.745
THROUGH. 
 IF YOU HAVE NOTICED, IN ORDER 

04:17:44.746 --> 04:17:46.669
TO
 SAVE DATA, WE LOAD THE MAP ONLY

04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:48.670
 WHEN YOU NEED

04:17:51.295 --> 04:17:53.015
 TO.
 HERE ARE THE RIDES, DIPIKA.  WE

04:17:53.016 --> 04:17:55.136
 HAVE A SUV AVAILABLE IN FIVE
 MINUTES.

04:17:55.137 --> 04:17:56.562
 Dipika Kapadia:  COOL.  BUT 
WHAT

04:17:56.563 --> 04:18:00.193
 KIND OF RIDE ARE WE GOING TO
 GET?

04:18:00.194 --> 04:18:04.418
 Ratul Roy:  SURE, HAVE A LOOK
 HERE.

04:18:04.419 --> 04:18:05.630
 Dipika Kapadia:  SWEET.  I 
THINK

04:18:05.631 --> 04:18:09.967
 EXTRA LEG ROOM AFTER THIS LONG
 FLIGHT BACK FITS THE BILL.

04:18:09.968 --> 04:18:12.795
 Ratul Roy:  SURE.
  Dipika Kapadia:  SO, GUYS, SO

04:18:12.796 --> 04:18:18.325
 FAR YOU'VE SEEN OUR PWA IS AN
 IMMERSIVE, FULL-PAGE EXPERIENCE

04:18:18.326 --> 04:18:22.565
 THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCH,
 LOADS REALLY FAST, AND SUPPORTS

04:18:22.566 --> 04:18:24.468
 BACK-BUTTON NAVIGATION MUCH 
LIKE

04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:27.709
 A NATIVE APP.
 SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, GUYS?  

04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:30.731
SHALL
 WE BOOK A REAL-LIVE CAB IN

04:18:30.732 --> 04:18:31.736
 BANGALORE?  IT'S ABOUT 5:00 
A.M.

04:18:31.737 --> 04:18:32.549
 THERE.
 [ LAUGHTER ]

04:18:37.377 --> 04:18:38.939
AWESOME.
RATUL, DO THE HONORS, PLEASE.

04:18:38.940 --> 04:18:42.850
Ratul Roy:  SURE.  LET ME  TRY.
I'M CONFIRMING THE BOOKING TO 

04:18:43.002 --> 04:18:45.002
PICK UP.
Dipika Kapadia:  GO FOR IT.

04:18:46.580 --> 04:18:50.081
OOPS, THERE YOU HAVE IT,  GUYS,
THIS IS A REAL-LIVE  BOOKING IN

04:18:50.236 --> 04:18:53.475
BANGALORE THAT WE  JUST MADE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, RATUL.

04:18:53.476 --> 04:18:54.694
Ratul Roy:  SURE.
[ APPLAUSE ]

04:18:54.695 --> 04:18:56.695
Dipika Kapadia:  NOTHING  RIGGED
HERE.

04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:59.955
YOU BETTER CANCEL THAT  BOOKING
BEFORE HE GETS MAD  AND SHOWS

04:19:00.364 --> 04:19:01.163
UP.
[ LAUGHTER ]

04:19:01.164 --> 04:19:06.862
Ratul Roy:  LET'S 
(INDISCERNIBLE).

04:19:06.863 --> 04:19:10.252
Dipika Kapadia:  AWESOME.
OKAY.

04:19:12.721 --> 04:19:18.070
SO THE OLA PWA IS ONLY A HALF 
MEG, OF WHICH THE APPLICATION 

04:19:18.472 --> 04:19:23.241
CODE IS JUST 200KB.
SO HOW DID WE BUILD THIS  REALLY

04:19:23.585 --> 04:19:26.306
PERFORMANT APP WITH  SUCH A 
SMALL

04:19:26.307 --> 04:19:28.307
SIZE?
LET'S LOOK AT THAT.

04:19:29.958 --> 04:19:35.007
FIRST, WE USED THE POLYMER 
FRAMEWORK, WHICH LEVERAGES 

04:19:35.008 --> 04:19:39.131
CHROME OR OTHER BROWSER 
RESOURCES, AND GIVES US 

04:19:39.132 --> 04:19:42.110
BLAZING-FAST WEB COMPONENTS,  
DOM

04:19:42.111 --> 04:19:46.658
AND CSS CAPSULATION,  SUFING
SHADOW.COM, AND HTML  SHADOW

04:19:46.659 --> 04:19:49.004
PORT, FOR A VERY  EFFICIENT
40KB.

04:19:49.505 --> 04:19:51.739
NEXT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE 
FAST LOAD TIMES.

04:19:51.781 --> 04:19:55.584
WHAT YOU SAW RIGHT NOW IN THE 
DEMO WAS THE REPEAT CACHED 

04:19:55.585 --> 04:19:59.819
EXPERIENCE OF THE HOME  SCREEN. 
BUT WE HAVE A REALLY  ENVIABLE

04:20:00.066 --> 04:20:04.365
FIRST LOAD TIME OF  ONE TO THREE
SECONDS,  DEPENDING ON THE

04:20:04.366 --> 04:20:06.178
NETWORK,  INCLUDING LOW 3G, 
WHICH

04:20:06.179 --> 04:20:08.410
IS  WHERE OUR TARGET AUDIENCE 
LIVES.

04:20:08.441 --> 04:20:11.193
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW.
AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT  SIDE

04:20:11.617 --> 04:20:13.416
HERE, WE LOAD OUR WEB  
COMPONENTS

04:20:13.417 --> 04:20:16.961
VERY  STRATEGICALLY, USING A 
WATERFALL MODEL, SO THAT  WE'RE

04:20:17.222 --> 04:20:20.551
ONLY FETCHING THOSE  COMPONENTS
THAT THE USER  NEEDS TO SEE FOR

04:20:21.112 --> 04:20:24.441
HIS FIRST  INTERACTION WITH OUR
PWA.

04:20:24.645 --> 04:20:25.614
WE'RE FETCHING IN THE  
BACKGROUND

04:20:25.615 --> 04:20:28.845
THE OTHER  RESOURCES HE NEEDS TO
ENSURE  THAT THE EXPERIENCE 

04:20:28.846 --> 04:20:30.977
STAYS 
SNAPPY GOING FORWARD.

04:20:32.082 --> 04:20:35.865
ONCE WE'VE LOADED ALL THE 
COMPONENTS, USING WORKBOX, WE 

04:20:36.381 --> 04:20:39.564
PRE-CACHE ALL OF THESE, SO  THAT
THE REPEAT LOAD TIME  STAYS 

04:20:39.565 --> 04:20:40.877
UNDER
A SECOND.

04:20:40.878 --> 04:20:44.628
FROM THIS POINT ON, THE ONLY 
SERVER CALL THAT WE ARE  MAKING

04:20:45.128 --> 04:20:49.693
IS TO FETCH DATA, SUCH  AS
REAL-TIME CAB  AVAILABILITY,

04:20:49.694 --> 04:20:53.176
MAKING A  BOOKING, ET CETERA.
ALL OF THIS STAYS UNDER ABOUT 

04:20:54.133 --> 04:20:56.133
5KB.

04:20:57.817 --> 04:21:00.851
WE ALSO LEVERAGE LIGHTHOUSE.
[ APPLAUSE ]

04:21:01.098 --> 04:21:04.586
AND WEB PAGE TEST.  AND WE  ARE
PLANNING TO INTEGRATE  

04:21:04.587 --> 04:21:06.160
LIGHTHOUSE
IN OUR BUILD,  BECAUSE,

04:21:06.161 --> 04:21:08.546
OBVIOUSLY, WE'LL ADD  MORE
FEATURES TO THE APP.  SO  HERE

04:21:08.547 --> 04:21:12.129
YOU CAN SEE OUR  LIGHTHOUSE 
CORE.

04:21:12.131 --> 04:21:14.148
WE ARE  VERY, VERY PROUD OF THIS

04:21:14.149 --> 04:21:17.892
CORE.  AND WE OPTIMIZE FOR A 
PERFECT SCORE.  AND WE CAN 

04:21:17.893 --> 04:21:21.067
TOTALLY RELATE TO DEVELOPERS 
WANTING TO TWEET AND BRAG  ABOUT

04:21:21.725 --> 04:21:26.919
THEIRS.
SO HOW'S OUR PWA DOING FOR  US?

04:21:26.920 --> 04:21:29.456
WELL, WE'VE BEEN OUT FOR  ABOUT 
A

04:21:29.457 --> 04:21:33.599
MONTH NOW, AND WE ARE  SEEING
THAT OUR CONVERSION,  OUR RIDES

04:21:34.098 --> 04:21:37.445
BOOKED IN TIER 2  CITIES, IS
COMPARABLE TO OUR  NATIVE APP.

04:21:38.212 --> 04:21:42.193
BUT WHAT'S GREAT TO SEE IS  THAT
IN TIER 3 CITIES,  SMALLER

04:21:42.194 --> 04:21:45.275
CITIES, OUR  CONVERSION IS
ACTUALLY 30%  HIGHER THAN OUR

04:21:45.537 --> 04:21:49.425
NATIVE APP,  WHICH SHOWS THAT,
CLEARLY, WE  ARE SOLVING FOR

04:21:49.426 --> 04:21:52.305
NETWORK  ISSUES AND THE NEED FOR
LOW  DATA USAGE, WHICH IS

04:21:52.306 --> 04:21:56.849
INHERENT  IN THESE GEOGRAPHIES.
WE'VE ALSO SEEN MOBILE  TRAFFIC

04:21:57.416 --> 04:22:00.536
INCREASE BY 68% IN  THESE CITIES
SINCE WE  LAUNCHED, WHICH SHOWS

04:22:00.742 --> 04:22:02.742
THAT WE  ARE EXPANDING OUR

04:22:05.286 --> 04:22:07.515
REACH.
BUT WHAT SURPRISED EVEN US IS 

04:22:07.660 --> 04:22:13.612
THAT 20% OF OUR PWA BOOKINGS 
COME FROM USERS WHO HAVE 

04:22:13.613 --> 04:22:16.607
PREVIOUSLY UNINSTALLED OUR 
NATIVE APP.  SO THIS SHOWS  THAT

04:22:16.773 --> 04:22:19.708
OUR PWA CAN EVEN BE A  GREAT
RE-ENGAGEMENT TOOL.

04:22:20.007 --> 04:22:22.585
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT, GUYS.   
OUR

04:22:22.586 --> 04:22:26.786
PWA HAS BEEN A WIN-WIN  FOR OUR
CUSTOMERS AND FOR  OLA.

04:22:26.987 --> 04:22:30.021
SO I HOPE SHARING OUR JOURNEY 
INSPIRES MANY OF YOU TO BUILD 

04:22:30.275 --> 04:22:34.582
YOUR OWN PROGRESSIVE WEB APP, 
AND THE NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN

04:22:58.118 --> 04:23:02.974
AMAZING MOMENTUM ON THE CORE 
PILLARS OF THE MODERN MOBILE 

04:23:03.620 --> 04:23:09.582
WEB, AMP, AND PWAS.
NEW APIs, UNLOCKING NEW 

04:23:09.583 --> 04:23:12.772
EXPERIENCES AND NEW USE  CASES,
EVERYTHING FROM  INSTALLING WEB

04:23:12.974 --> 04:23:16.930
APPS TO YOUR  DEVICE, TO PAYING
FOR THINGS  ON THE WEB, TO

04:23:16.931 --> 04:23:21.865
POLISHED MEDIA  EXPERIENCES.
AND LOOKING AHEAD, COMPUTING 

04:23:22.084 --> 04:23:26.271
CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AT A FAST 
CLIP.  AND WE AT GOOGLE WANT  TO

04:23:26.294 --> 04:23:28.745
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HELP 
DEVELOPERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 

04:23:29.760 --> 04:23:32.995
THESE CHANGES, WHETHER  THEY'RE
BUILDING NATIVE APPS  OR 

04:23:32.996 --> 04:23:34.185
BUILDING
FOR THE WEB.

04:23:34.186 --> 04:23:37.099
AND JUST LIKE WE DO WITH  NATIVE
APPS, WE WANT THE WEB  TO BE A

04:23:37.350 --> 04:23:41.550
GREAT PLATFORM FOR  FUTURE
TECHNOLOGIES AS THEY  EVOLVE.

04:23:42.552 --> 04:23:47.806
ONE SUCH FUTURE TECHNOLOGY IS 
VR.  VIRTUAL REALITY ENABLES  

04:23:47.807 --> 04:23:50.477
THE
CREATION OF  RICHLY-IMAGINED

04:23:50.478 --> 04:23:55.928
WORLDS THAT  YOU CAN FULLY
IMMERSE  YOURSELF IN.  AND

04:23:55.929 --> 04:23:58.976
THROUGH THE  WEBVR API, ALL OF
THIS  EXPRESSIVE POWER IS

04:23:58.977 --> 04:24:04.775
AVAILABLE  ON THE WEB.  WEBVR
ENABLES  COMPANIES LIKE WITHIN 

04:24:04.776 --> 04:24:08.460

NOW, THESE WOULD BE TRULY 

04:24:25.637 --> 04:24:29.130
MIND-BLOWING IF YOU ALL HAD  VR
HEADSETS ON.  BUT YOU GET  A

04:24:29.131 --> 04:24:32.571
SENSE OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE.
WEBVR IS NOW FULLY SUPPORTED  IN

04:24:33.115 --> 04:24:35.803

EVOLVES AND CHANGES IN THE 

04:24:49.263 --> 04:24:53.695
FUTURE, THE WEB WILL ALWAYS  BE
HERE AS A WAY FOR YOU TO  REACH

 AND GET ME.
 WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU GUYS

04:48:01.096 --> 04:48:02.407
 ABOUT IS BACKGROUND LIMITS AND 
A

04:48:02.408 --> 04:48:05.343
 LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT
 WE'VE PUT IN PLACE IN O, AND IT

04:48:05.344 --> 04:48:08.576
 IS A STARTING POINT.  AND I
 WANTED TO TRY AND HAVE THIS 

04:48:08.577 --> 04:48:10.203
TALK
 TO GIVE YOU A GLIMPSE OF HOW

04:48:10.204 --> 04:48:13.433
 WE'RE APPROACHING THE PROBLEM
 AND SO YOU DON'T JUST THINK

04:48:13.434 --> 04:48:16.670
 WE'RE TRYING TO RUIN ALL THE
 APPS AND EVERYTHING YOU'RE 

04:48:16.671 --> 04:48:17.784
DOING
 IN THE BACKGROUND.  WE'RE

04:48:17.785 --> 04:48:23.624
 ACTUALLY TRYING TO FIND A
 BALANCE OF ENABLING USERS TO

04:48:23.625 --> 04:48:27.172
 HAVE BETTER LIFE THEY CAN RELY
 ON AND HAVE DEVELOPERS DO THE

04:48:27.173 --> 04:48:31.814
 USE CASES THAT THEY TRI-ARE
 GREAT AND RESPOND.WILL TO.  AT

04:48:31.815 --> 04:48:35.061
 THAT DO THAT, WE'RE GOING TO
 TALK A BIT ABOUT THE PAST, A 

04:48:35.062 --> 04:48:36.161
LOT
 ABOUT THE PRESENT, AND A LITTLE

04:48:36.162 --> 04:48:39.497
 BIT ABOUT THE FUTURE AND WE'LL
 GIVE A GLIMPSE OF THE SPACE

04:48:39.498 --> 04:48:45.004
 WE'RE TRYING TO GO LONGER TERM.
 SO IN THE PAST, WE HAVE DOZE 

04:48:45.005 --> 04:48:47.070
AND
 STANDBY.  DOZE AND DOZE LITE

04:48:47.071 --> 04:48:50.817
 WERE INTRODUCED TO TRY AND SAVE
 BATTERY IN TWO MAIN CONDITIONS,

04:48:53.345 --> 04:48:55.354
OFF
 FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.  A

04:48:55.355 --> 04:48:58.915
 GOOD EXAMPLE IS I TAKE MY
 TABLET, I TOSS IT IN MY DESK 

04:48:58.916 --> 04:49:01.030
AND
 IT SITS THERE FOR A FEW DAYS. 

04:49:01.031 --> 04:49:04.154
 YOU REALLY WANT THE DEVICE TO
 LAST A LONG TIME AND DOZE WAS

04:49:04.155 --> 04:49:07.790
 INTRODUCED TO MAKE THAT DEVICE
 LAST FOR UP TO A WEEK.  IT WAS

04:49:07.791 --> 04:49:11.124
 LARGELY SUCCESSFUL WHEN IT WAS
 INTRO INTRODUCED.  DOZE LITE 

04:49:11.125 --> 04:49:12.844
WAS
 TRYING TO TAKE THAT SAME 

04:49:12.845 --> 04:49:15.200
CONCEPT
 AND APPLY IT TO MY PHONE IS IN

04:49:15.201 --> 04:49:17.000
 MY POCKET, IT'S NOT ON BUT IT 
IS

04:49:17.001 --> 04:49:20.229
 ON ME.  AND DOZE WASN'T
 IDENTIFYING THAT SITUATION.  

04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:21.243
AND
 DOZE LITE WAS TRYING TO TARGET

04:49:21.244 --> 04:49:24.259
 THAT.  AND TO START SLOWING 
DOWN

04:49:24.260 --> 04:49:27.995
 APPLICATIONS AND LIMITING WHAT
 WAS HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE

04:49:28.000 --> 04:49:30.324
 DAY.  APP STANDBY WAS SIMILAR 
IN

04:49:30.325 --> 04:49:33.915
 CONCEPT IS THE USER INTERACTING
 VERY OFTEN AND IF NOT, BEGIN

04:49:33.916 --> 04:49:36.590
 THROTTLING THAT BACK.
 WE ALSO LOOKED AT BROADCAST

04:49:36.591 --> 04:49:40.840
 REMOVAL, AND THIS IS WHEN WE
 TARGETED AN INITIAL SET OF 

04:49:40.841 --> 04:49:42.251
THREE
 PARTICULAR BROADCASTS.  AND THE

04:49:42.252 --> 04:49:44.774
 BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS WE 
WERE

04:49:44.775 --> 04:49:48.810
 FINDING YOU TAKE A PHOTO AND
 SUDDENLY ALL THE APPLICATIONS

04:49:48.811 --> 04:49:51.529
 ARE GETTING REALLY EXCITED 
ABOUT

04:49:51.530 --> 04:49:54.366
 THAT PHOTO BECAUSE IT'S
 LISTENING TO THAT BROADCAST. 

04:49:54.367 --> 04:49:57.198
 THEY WOULD ALL BE WAKING UP A
 WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE PHOTO?

04:49:58.610 --> 04:50:02.047
 SHOULD I BACK IT UP?  WHAT
 SHOULD HAPPEN?  THE USER IS

04:50:02.048 --> 04:50:03.868
 LIKE, I AM REALLY TRYING TO 
TAKE

04:50:03.869 --> 04:50:07.400
 A PHOTO.  GOD FORBID SHOULD YOU
 TAKE TWO PHOTOS.  THE SECOND

04:50:07.401 --> 04:50:09.929
 PHOTO IS NOW THIS RESOURCE
 CONTENTION.  AND SO WE FOUND

04:50:09.930 --> 04:50:13.078
 THIS WAS REALLY SUCCESSFUL TO
 PULL THESE GUYS BACK FROM BEING

04:50:13.079 --> 04:50:17.914
 THESE GENERAL BROADCASTS ANNEX
 STEAD BEING A BIT MORE --

04:50:17.915 --> 04:50:20.635
 INSTEAD BEING MORE TARGETED. 
 THAT'S THE LEAD-IN TO THE

04:50:20.636 --> 04:50:23.164
 PRESENT WHEN WE STARTED LOOKING
 AT A GENERAL STRATEGY FOR

04:50:23.165 --> 04:50:27.623
 BACKGROUND LIMITS.  I WILL ALSO
 TALK ABOUT ALERT WINDOW WHICH 

04:50:27.624 --> 04:50:28.827
IS
 A SIMILAR PROBLEM SPACE.  AND A

04:50:28.828 --> 04:50:30.559
 BIT HOW WE ARE TRYING TO BRING 
A

04:50:30.560 --> 04:50:33.271
 DATABASE APPROACH TO IMPROVING
 SYSTEM HEALTH ON ANDROID.  I

04:50:33.272 --> 04:50:35.898
 DON'T MEAN HEALTH LIKE MY
 PERSONAL HEALTH, BUT MORE LIKE

04:50:35.899 --> 04:50:40.043
 THE DEVICE HEALTH.
 AND THEN I'LL PEPPER IN A FEW

04:50:40.044 --> 04:50:43.275
 BEST PRACTICES AS WE GO 
THROUGH.

04:50:43.276 --> 04:50:47.711
 SO BACKGROUND LIMITS.  WHY?  SO
 WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TWO

04:50:47.712 --> 04:50:50.537
 PARTS.  ONE IS TO SAVE BATTERY.

04:50:50.538 --> 04:50:53.691
 THIS ONE WAS LARGELY AROUND THE
 LIMITS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE FOR

04:50:53.692 --> 04:50:54.786
 LOCATION AND THE GOAL THAT 
WE'RE

04:50:54.787 --> 04:50:58.728
 TRYING TO GET AT IS WE WANT
 MULTIDAY BATTERY LIFE.  THAT'S

04:50:58.729 --> 04:51:01.169
 WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE US A WHILE
 TO GET THERE.  BUT THAT'S WHAT

04:51:01.170 --> 04:51:05.622
 WE'RE TRYING TO GO.  AND TO DO
 THAT, WE KNOW WE HAVE A PRETTY

04:51:05.623 --> 04:51:08.433
 LARGE TASK IN TERMS OF WHAT'S
 HAPPENING IN THE BACKGROUND.

04:51:08.434 --> 04:51:12.071
 IT'S A NEARLY 6 TO 8% 
EFFICIENCY

04:51:12.072 --> 04:51:14.297
 IMPROVEMENT FROM WHERE WE ARE
 TODAY.  THAT'S LIKE THE

04:51:14.298 --> 04:51:17.021
 BACKDROP, IF YOU WILL OF HOW
 WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IT.  AND

04:51:17.022 --> 04:51:19.764
 THESE ARE THE KIND OF INITIAL
 STEPS IN SETTING THE FRAMEWORK

04:51:19.765 --> 04:51:21.368
 FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET
 THERE.

04:51:21.369 --> 04:51:25.917
 THE OTHER PART IS ABOUT RAM
 MANAGEMENT AND WORKING ON HOW

04:51:25.918 --> 04:51:29.044
 BROADCASTS ARE BEING FIRED TO
 APPLICATIONS AND ALSO DEALING

04:51:29.045 --> 04:51:32.477
 WITH HOW APPLICATIONS ARE
 RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUNDS WITH

04:51:32.478 --> 04:51:35.326
 LONG-RUNNING SERVICES.
 SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A CONCRETE

04:51:35.327 --> 04:51:38.751
 EXAMPLE OF THIS IS YOU HAVE 
THIS

04:51:38.752 --> 04:51:41.161
 CHART OF SCREEN-OFF PERFORMANCE
 OVER TIME.  AND THE ONE THING

04:51:41.162 --> 04:51:44.199
 YOU CAN SEE UP HERE -- I CAN'T
 SEE MY MONITORS ANYMORE.  THE

04:51:44.200 --> 04:51:46.232
 SUN HAS TOTALLY KILLED ME UP
 THERE.

04:51:46.233 --> 04:51:48.257
 THE ONE THING YOU CAN SEE UP
 THERE IS OVER TIME YOU'RE GOING

04:51:48.258 --> 04:51:51.271
 TO HAVE A SLIDE OF YOUR
 SCREEN-OFF BATTERY PERFORMANCE,

04:51:51.272 --> 04:51:56.051
 THE LONGER THE PHONE IS IN THE
 FIELD.  YOU'LL ALSO SEE THAT 

04:51:56.052 --> 04:51:57.450
THE
 JANK RATES, THE SLOW UI FRAMES,

04:51:57.451 --> 04:51:59.573
 GET HIGHER THE LONGER THE 
DEVICE

04:51:59.574 --> 04:52:02.102
 IS IN THE FIELD.  AND SO THESE
 ARE THINGS THAT WE REALLY WANT

04:52:02.103 --> 04:52:04.618
 TO HELP REMEDY AND ADD
 ROBUSTNESS INTO THE PLATFORM SO

04:52:04.619 --> 04:52:06.746
 WE CAN REALLY SMOOTH THESE OUT.

04:52:06.747 --> 04:52:10.273
 LIKE, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING
 DEVICE'S AGE AND PHYSICS COMES

04:52:10.274 --> 04:52:14.208
 INTO PLAY AND THE MARCH TIME
 HAPPENS BUT WE DON'T WANT THEM

04:52:14.209 --> 04:52:16.744
 TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR THAT STEEP.
 ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS AS A DEVICE

04:52:16.745 --> 04:52:20.989
 IS ON IN THE COURSE OF EVEN
 DAYS, THIS ONE IS MEASURED

04:52:20.990 --> 04:52:24.326
 ALL -- INITIALLY HOURS AND THEN
 IN DAYS, YOU CAN SEE JUST 

04:52:24.327 --> 04:52:25.536
UPTIME
 STARTS TO TAKE A TOLL ON THE

04:52:25.537 --> 04:52:27.967
 DEVICE.
 AND SO THESE ARE THE THINGS

04:52:27.968 --> 04:52:29.879
 WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO TARGET
 AND IMPROVE.

04:52:29.880 --> 04:52:32.303
 SO LET'S DIG IN A LITTLE BIT TO
 SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE'RE

04:52:32.304 --> 04:52:35.451
 INTRODUCING.
 BACKGROUND LIMITS ON THE SAVE

04:52:35.452 --> 04:52:38.772
 RAM PART IS WE WANT TO RESTRICT
 SERVICES AND BROADCASTS AND WE

04:52:38.773 --> 04:52:41.512
 WANT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF
 CHURN THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

04:52:41.513 --> 04:52:45.242
 DEVICE.  AND TO SAVE BATTERY,
 WE'RE LOOKING TO IMPROVE

04:52:45.243 --> 04:52:47.964
 BACKGROUND LOCATION SCAN RATES
 AND WiFi SCAN RATES AND TO

04:52:47.965 --> 04:52:51.697
 REDUCE THEM AND MAKE THEM BE
 MORE OF A TRICKLE THAN THESE

04:52:51.698 --> 04:52:55.556
 BURSTY EVENTS THAT WE'RE SEEING
 HAPPENING IN THE ECOSYSTEM.

04:52:55.557 --> 04:52:58.378
 SO FOR BACKGROUND LIMITS, THE
 BIG ONE HERE IS WE WANT TO

04:52:58.379 --> 04:53:03.114
 REDUCE THAT RAM USAGE.  TO DO
 THAT IS -- WELL, THIS SLIDE IS

04:53:03.115 --> 04:53:06.469
 THE SAME.  I SHOULD SKIP.
 SO HOW WE'RE DOING THAT IS WITH

04:53:06.470 --> 04:53:08.179
 BROADCAST RECEIVERS.  BY 
PULLING

04:53:08.180 --> 04:53:13.523
 THESE GUYS BACK YOU ARE ABLE TO
 THEN SAY, OKAY, ALL THESE

04:53:13.524 --> 04:53:17.252
 BROADCASTS THAT ARE IMPLICIT 
ARE

04:53:17.253 --> 04:53:20.285
 GOING TO BE SILENCED.  IF YOU
 ARE NOT CURRENTLY RUNNING, 

04:53:20.286 --> 04:53:22.412
WE'RE
 NOT GOING TO WAKE YOU UP FOR

04:53:22.413 --> 04:53:25.766
 THEM EXCEPT IN THE CASE WHERE
 THEY ARE EXPLICIT.  WE SAY

04:53:25.767 --> 04:53:26.350
 SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAS 
HAPPENED

04:53:26.351 --> 04:53:29.285
 OR YOU HAVE BEEN TARGETED OR
 REGISTERED FOR SOME WAKEUP AND

04:53:29.286 --> 04:53:32.333
 THOSE THINGS WILL STILL WORK
 COMPLETELY AS NORMAL AS THEY 

04:53:32.334 --> 04:53:34.763
DID
 BEFORE.  SO THAT FOLLOWS ALARMS

04:53:34.764 --> 04:53:37.070
 AND NOTIFICATIONS.
 OTHER ONES THAT WE'RE STILL

04:53:37.071 --> 04:53:41.211
 KEEPING AROUND, BOOT COMPLETE,
 LOCALE CHANGING AND THESE ARE

04:53:41.212 --> 04:53:44.950
 REALLY EVENTS THAT ARE NOT
 HAPPENING AS THE USER'S TRYING

04:53:44.951 --> 04:53:47.180
 TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.  THAT'S
 REALLY BEEN THE TARGET OF HOW 

04:53:47.181 --> 04:53:48.491
WE
 APPROACH WHICH THINGS SHOULD

04:53:48.492 --> 04:53:50.925
 CONTINUE TO WORK AND WHICH
 THINGS SHOULD WE START

04:53:50.926 --> 04:53:53.147
 DEFERRING.
 THE OTHER ONE HERE IS FREE

04:53:53.148 --> 04:53:56.771
 RUNNING BACKGROUND SERVICES
 SHOULD NO LONGER BE A THING. 

04:53:56.772 --> 04:54:01.218
 AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT IS WE
 WANT USERS TO HAVE VISIBILITY 

04:54:01.219 --> 04:54:02.426
TO
 WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THEIR 

04:54:02.427 --> 04:54:03.548
PHONE. 
 AND SO IF AN APPLICATION IS

04:54:03.549 --> 04:54:04.872
 DOING SOMETHING REALLY 
EXPENSIVE

04:54:04.873 --> 04:54:06.174
 IN THE BACKGROUND, WE WANT 
THERE

04:54:06.175 --> 04:54:09.199
 TO BE SOME AWARENESS FOR THE
 USER.  WE DON'T WANT THE DEVICE

04:54:09.200 --> 04:54:12.549
 TO BE TOILING AWAY IN THE
 BACKGROUND WITHOUT ANY

04:54:12.550 --> 04:54:14.977
 AWARENESS.  THIS MEANS WE WANT
 TO START STOPPING THOSE 

04:54:14.978 --> 04:54:15.682
SERVICES
 AFTER THEY'RE RUNNING FOR A

04:54:15.683 --> 04:54:18.211
 LITTLE BIT.  WE WANT TO START
 THROWING -- WE WILL START

04:54:18.212 --> 04:54:19.630
 THROWING AN EXCEPTION IF YOU 
TRY

04:54:19.631 --> 04:54:21.862
 TO START A BACKGROUND SERVICE
 WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN THE

04:54:21.863 --> 04:54:23.816
 FOREGROUND OR WHEN YOU DON'T
 HAVE A FOREBROWNED SERVICE

04:54:23.817 --> 04:54:27.112
 RUNNING.  AND THIS IS ALSO THE
 VERY LAST ONE, IS WE START

04:54:27.113 --> 04:54:30.447
 RELEASING WAKELOCKS.  YOU STILL
 WANT TO MANAGE WAKELOCKS.  

04:54:30.448 --> 04:54:31.758
DON'T
 THINK THE OS IS GOING TO HANDLE

04:54:31.759 --> 04:54:33.879
 THEM FOR YOU.  WE ARE ADDING
 MORE PROTECTIONS IN DIFFERENT

04:54:33.880 --> 04:54:37.954
 SCENARIOS WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE
 BEEN LEAKED OR THE DEVELOPER 

04:54:37.955 --> 04:54:40.447
WAS
 A LITTLE LAX IN THEIR CLEANUP.

04:54:40.448 --> 04:54:45.101
 WE STILL HAVE THE WHITE LISTING
 WE HAD BEFORE SO THERE WILL BE 

04:54:45.102 --> 04:54:46.815
A
 WHITE LISTING STRATEGY THAT'S

04:54:46.816 --> 04:54:50.440
 AROUND WHEN GCM FIRES OFF A
 BROADCAST TO YOUR APPLICATION. 

04:54:50.441 --> 04:54:53.987
 YOU WILL STILL GET WOKEN UP. 
 YOU WILL GET A SHORT EXEMPTION

04:54:53.988 --> 04:54:56.314
 TO HANDLE THAT MESSAGE.  FROM
 THERE YOU CAN KICK OFF A

04:54:56.315 --> 04:54:58.537
 SERVICE, BRING YOUR APPLICATION
 TO THE FOREGROUND IF IT'S

04:54:58.538 --> 04:55:01.564
 APPROPRIATE.
 OR YOU CAN JUST TAKE THE NOTE,

04:55:01.565 --> 04:55:04.947
 RUN A SCHEDULE A JOB AND ALARM
 AND HAVE IT BE SCHEDULED BY THE

04:55:04.948 --> 04:55:09.665
 OS AND HAPPEN WHEN IT HAPPENS.
 THERE IS FLEXIBILITY FOR OEMS 

04:55:09.666 --> 04:55:11.449
IF
 YOU ARE RELYING ON OEMs

04:55:11.450 --> 04:55:12.792
 SPECIFIC INTENT OR SOME 
SPECIFIC

04:55:12.793 --> 04:55:16.713
 BEHAVIOR THAT'S NOT BUILD IN 
THE

04:55:16.714 --> 04:55:22.142
 EPS.  THE OEM WILL DEFINE WHICH
 MYS ARE EXPLICITS AND IMPLIES

04:55:22.143 --> 04:55:26.731
 SYS IT AND WHICH THINGS CAN BE
 FIRED AND WHICH THINGS GET THE

04:55:26.732 --> 04:55:29.451
 BRAKES TAPPED ON THEM.  YOU
 MIGHT BE THINKING AT THIS 

04:55:29.452 --> 04:55:31.378
POINT,
 THE USER PART OF MY BRAIN IS

04:55:31.379 --> 04:55:34.300
 REALLY HAPPY PROBABLY.  THE
 DEVELOPER SIDE IS GOING, WAIT, 

04:55:34.301 --> 04:55:35.619
I
 NEED -- I HAVE THINGS TO DO.  I

04:55:35.620 --> 04:55:39.360
 HAVE THINGS TO SAY.  HOW CAN I
 COMMUNICATE TO THE DEVELOPER? 

04:55:39.361 --> 04:55:43.198
 LIKE, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT,
 BEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 

04:55:43.199 --> 04:55:45.831
 THERE'S A NUMBER OF STRATEGIES
 AND I WILL TALK ABOUT THEM 

04:55:45.832 --> 04:55:46.938
RIGHT
 NOW ABOUT HOW TO DO THESE

04:55:46.939 --> 04:55:49.680
 OPERATIONS STILL WITH THE USER
 ON A TIMELY BASIS AND STILL BE

04:55:49.681 --> 04:55:52.205
 RESPECTFUL OF THE BATTERY BUT
 THEN ALSO BE ABLE TO TELL THE

04:55:52.206 --> 04:55:55.337
 USER, NO, I'M DOING SOMETHING
 INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.  SO THE

04:55:55.338 --> 04:56:00.380
 FIRST ONE TO LOOK AT IS USING
 FIREBASE AND GOOGLE CLOUD

04:56:00.381 --> 04:56:02.815
 MESSAGING AND USING THE HIGH
 PRIORITY AND NORMAL PRIORITY

04:56:02.816 --> 04:56:05.088
 MESSAGES.
 I HOPE YOU'RE TAKE-AWAY FROM

04:56:05.089 --> 04:56:09.665
 THIS SLIDE IS NOT LIKE FIRE ALL
 TORPEDOES AT HIGH PRIORITY. 

04:56:09.666 --> 04:56:11.891
 REALLY WANT YOU TO BE BALANCED
 IN SAYING IF SOMETHING IS

04:56:11.892 --> 04:56:15.841
 IMPORTANT, LIKE, SAY, MY FIRE
 ALARM IS GOING OFF AT HOME AND 

04:56:15.842 --> 04:56:17.053
I
 WANT TO SEND A NOTIFICATION TO

04:56:17.054 --> 04:56:21.599
 THE USER, USE A HIGH-PRIORITY
 NOTIFICATION.  IT'S KIND OF A

04:56:21.600 --> 04:56:25.531
 BIG DEAL.  IF YOU ARE, SAY,
 USING A USER IS SCHEDULED FOR A

04:56:25.532 --> 04:56:28.055
 TV SHOW THEY LIKE AND THAT TV
 SHOW IS NOW AVAILABLE AND THEY

04:56:28.056 --> 04:56:31.701
 CAN STREAM IT AT THEIR LEISURE,
 USE A NORMAL-PRIORITY

04:56:31.702 --> 04:56:34.631
 NOTIFICATION.  IT WILL MAKE A
 BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE BATTERY

04:56:34.632 --> 04:56:35.940
 LIFE OF THE DEVICE AND IT 
REALLY

04:56:35.941 --> 04:56:39.376
 ADDS UP WHEN THE ECOSYSTEM
 STARTS TAKING THESE APPROACHES.

04:56:39.377 --> 04:56:42.914
 THE OTHER ONE HERE IS SOMETHING
 NEW CALLED THE JOB INTENT

04:56:42.915 --> 04:56:46.130
 SERVICE.  THIS IS COMING OUT --
 WE JUST MISSED THE WINDOW BUT I

04:56:46.131 --> 04:56:49.771
 STILL WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT
 FOR WHAT CAME OUT WITH THE NEW

04:56:49.772 --> 04:56:52.616
 26 BETA.  BUT IT WILL BE COMING
 OUT SHORTLY BEFORE O LAUNCH. 

04:56:52.617 --> 04:56:56.144
 IT'S A STRATEGY OF YOU CAN USE
 JOB INTENT SERVICE ON O TO GIVE

04:56:56.145 --> 04:57:00.175
 YOU BACKWARDS COMPAT SUPPORT SO
 YOU WILL USE THEN JOBS WHEN

04:57:00.176 --> 04:57:02.314
 YOU'RE ON O AND YOU WILL HAVE 
AN

04:57:02.315 --> 04:57:06.030
 AUTOMATIC FALL-BACK TO USING
 SERVICES PRE-O.  THE REALLY 

04:57:06.031 --> 04:57:07.449
NICE
 PART ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU HAVE

04:57:07.450 --> 04:57:10.296
 THAT FALL-BACK, WE WILL HANDLE
 THE WAKELOCKS FOR YOU.  SO YOU

04:57:10.297 --> 04:57:11.911
 DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF 
YOU

04:57:11.912 --> 04:57:15.144
 WILL MAKE A LEAK OR MAKE A
 MISTAKE THERE.  DEFINITELY LOOK

04:57:15.145 --> 04:57:17.362
 AT THIS WHEN IT COMES OUT.  IT
 WILL MAKE YOUR LIVES A LOT

04:57:17.363 --> 04:57:20.195
 EASIER TO ADOPT.
 THE OTHER LAST ONE IS ABOUT

04:57:20.196 --> 04:57:23.334
 ALARMS, SYNCS AND JOB
 SCHEDULING.  THESE ARE ALL GOOD

04:57:23.335 --> 04:57:28.792
 STRATEGIES TO RUN JOBS ON A
 CADENCE IN THE BACKGROUND THAT

04:57:28.793 --> 04:57:32.220
 GIVES THE OS FLEXIBILITY ABOUT
 WHEN IT RUNS.  SO I WILL GIVE

04:57:32.221 --> 04:57:34.347
 YOU AN EXAMPLE.
 IF ALL THESE APPLICATIONS

04:57:34.348 --> 04:57:37.687
 BEFORE, WHEN WE HAD A WORLD OF
 THESE BROADCASTS BEING FIRED 

04:57:37.688 --> 04:57:38.593
AND
 THAT APPLICATION CAN START

04:57:38.594 --> 04:57:42.873
 SERVICES, THEY'LL ALL START AT
 THE SAME TIME.  AND THE OS

04:57:42.874 --> 04:57:45.868
 REALLY HAS ONLY NUKES TO DEAL
 WITH THIS PROBLEM.  WE CAN ONLY

04:57:45.869 --> 04:57:48.892
 KILL YOUR PROCESS.  THERE'S NO
 ABILITY TO THROTTLE.  WE CAN'T

04:57:48.893 --> 04:57:52.646
 TRY TO SQUISH RAM.  IT'S JUST
 YOU LIVE OR YOU DIE.  AND WHEN

04:57:52.647 --> 04:57:56.065
 THE RAM BECOMES CONTENTIOUS, WE
 START THRASHING PRETTY RAPIDLY.

04:57:56.066 --> 04:57:58.488
 WHEN WHEN YOU ARE USING YOU'RE 
USING JOBS AND 

04:57:58.489 --> 04:58:01.649
ALARMS, THE OS HAS NOW 
FLEXIBILITY TO DEFER, TO RUN  

04:58:01.650 --> 04:58:03.650
ONE
JOB AT A TIME, A FEW JOBS  AT A

04:58:03.825 --> 04:58:06.821
TIME, AND SPREAD IT OUT  ACROSS
THE LIFETIME OF A  DEVICE.  AND

04:58:07.745 --> 04:58:14.180
THAT AVOIDS,  THEN, RESOURCE
CONTENTION, IT  AVOID JANKINESS

04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:17.514
IN THE  BACKGROUND.
I'VE MADE THIS REALLY  EXCITING

04:58:17.930 --> 04:58:20.159
FLOWCHART FOR YOU  THAT YOU CAN
LOOK AT IT  LATER.  THE IDEA

04:58:20.160 --> 04:58:22.538
BEHIND IT IS  ROUGHLY LOOKING AT
WHAT ARE  THE DIFFERENT STAGES

04:58:22.539 --> 04:58:25.085
THAT ARE  HAPPENING AND WHAT IS
THE  RIGHT CHOICE FOR YOU AS A 

04:58:25.261 --> 04:58:28.631
DEVELOPER AND FOR THE USER TO 
HAVE, LIKE, THE -- THE BEST, 

04:58:29.240 --> 04:58:31.493
MOST EFFICIENT EXPERIENCE FOR 
THE USE CASE THAT YOU'RE  TRYING

04:58:31.791 --> 04:58:35.176
TO ACHIEVE.
YES, THE END OF THIS IS MAYBE 

04:58:35.379 --> 04:58:37.722
YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT IN THE 
BACKGROUND.  AND THAT'S THE  ONE

04:58:37.978 --> 04:58:40.661
I REALLY WANT YOU TO  FOCUS ON,
IS THINK ABOUT DO I  REALLY HAVE

04:58:40.662 --> 04:58:44.167
TO BE DOING THIS?   IS THE USER
GOING TO  UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M

04:58:44.186 --> 04:58:46.957
TRYING TO  DO?
IF THE USER IS GOING TO 

04:58:46.958 --> 04:58:48.269
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING  
TO

04:58:48.270 --> 04:58:53.286
DO, AND A GREAT EXAMPLE OF  THIS
ARE, LIKE, NAVIGATION  APPS,

04:58:53.287 --> 04:58:56.683
MUSIC-PLAYING APPS,  VARIOUS
EXERCISE  APPLICATIONS, ALL OF

04:58:56.848 --> 04:58:58.816
THOSE  SCENARIOS, IF YOU'RE
RUNNING  A FOREGROUND SERVICE 

04:58:58.817 --> 04:59:00.817
AND
THE  USER SEES A NOTIFICATION, 

04:59:00.994 --> 04:59:03.177
IT'S GOING TO MAKE SENSE TO 
THEM.  YOU'RE GOING TO BE  

04:59:03.178 --> 04:59:04.192
REALLY
WELL ALIGNED.

04:59:04.193 --> 04:59:05.869
SO IN THOSE SCENARIOS, PLEASE  
GO

04:59:05.870 --> 04:59:07.870
DO THAT.
IN OTHER ONES, WHERE YOU'RE, 

04:59:08.162 --> 04:59:10.743
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO 
EXPLAIN THIS TO A USER, THEN  

04:59:10.744 --> 04:59:12.066
YOU
SHOULD DEFINITELY BE  

04:59:12.067 --> 04:59:14.401
CONSIDERING
JOBS OR BE NOT  CONSIDERING

04:59:14.402 --> 04:59:17.145
RUNNING IT IN THE  BACKGROUND AT
ALL.

04:59:17.696 --> 04:59:19.677
TRANSITIONING, THAT WAS THE 
BATTERY SAVING AND EXECUTION 

04:59:19.678 --> 04:59:21.678
PORTION.  NOW I'M GOING TO 
TRANSITION A LITTLE BIT TO  TALK

04:59:21.761 --> 04:59:23.761
ABOUT LOCATION LIMITS.
AND THE IDEA HERE WAS TO PUT 

04:59:24.149 --> 04:59:27.245
SOME UPPER BOUNDS ON WHAT  WE'RE
SEEING IN THE  BACKGROUND AROUND

04:59:27.713 --> 04:59:28.817
GEOFENCING,  POLLING, AND 
OTHERS.

04:59:28.818 --> 04:59:31.365
AND IT  WAS CAUSING, REALLY, A 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DRAIN.  

04:59:31.366 --> 04:59:34.817
AND THE REASON IS, LOCATION  IS
POWER-HUNGRY.  AND THERE  WERE

04:59:35.777 --> 04:59:38.681
REALLY NO FUNCTIONAL  LIMITS ON
WHAT AN APPLICATION  COULD DO

04:59:38.824 --> 04:59:40.649
WHEN IT'S IN THE  BACKGROUND 
WITH

04:59:40.650 --> 04:59:43.960
RESPECT TO  LOCATION.
AND SO IT WOULD END UP WITH  TWO

04:59:44.214 --> 04:59:46.346
DIFFERENT TYPES OF  SCENARIOS. 
WE'D HAVE -- MOST  OF THEM, TO 

04:59:46.347 --> 04:59:48.347
BE
HONEST, ARE  ACCIDENTAL.  ONE

04:59:48.431 --> 04:59:50.961
BEING IS  THAT APPLICATIONS ARE 
AGGRESSIVELY REQUESTING 

04:59:50.962 --> 04:59:54.209
LOCATION.  AND THIS COULD BE 
BECAUSE THEY -- THEY'RE 

04:59:54.210 --> 04:59:56.755
INTERESTED IN WHERE YOU ARE,  OR
THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR USE  

04:59:56.756 --> 04:59:58.646
CASE.
BUT THE ONE THAT WAS  REALLY SAD

04:59:58.647 --> 05:00:02.456
WAS THIS IDEA OF  LEAKS, IS THAT
IF YOU'RE  RUNNING IN THE

05:00:02.457 --> 05:00:04.379
FOREGROUND,  YOU'RE -- SAY 
YOU'RE 

05:00:04.380 --> 05:00:05.309
NAVIGATING, YOU'RE GOING TO  
HAVE

05:00:05.310 --> 05:00:07.990
A REALLY HIGH RATE OF  QUERY. 
AND WHEN YOU GO TO  THE

05:00:07.991 --> 05:00:10.583
BACKGROUND, THAT HIGH  RATE 
MAYBE

05:00:10.584 --> 05:00:13.263
ISN'T NECESSARY  ANYMORE.  AND
THE INTENTIONAL  OF THE 

05:00:13.264 --> 05:00:15.234
DEVELOPER
WAS TO  REDUCE IT.  BUT FOR ONE 

05:00:15.235 --> 05:00:19.182
REASON OR ANOTHER, MEMORY  LEAKS
OR WAKELOCK LEAKS, IT'S  STILL

05:00:19.790 --> 05:00:24.216
RUNNING FULL BLAST.   AND WE SAW
THAT A LOT, A LOT  OF

05:00:24.217 --> 05:00:26.217
APPLICATIONS EVERY SECOND 
GETTING A LOCATION REQUEST.  

05:00:26.804 --> 05:00:28.804
THAT'S GOING TO COMPLETELY 
DESTROY BATTERY.  THOSE ARE  THE

05:00:28.932 --> 05:00:30.198
TWO AREAS WE'RE TRYING TO  
TARGET

05:00:30.199 --> 05:00:32.036
HERE.
THE IDEA NOW IS NOT TO SAY  THAT

05:00:32.037 --> 05:00:33.459
YOU CAN'T RUN IN THE  
BACKGROUND.

05:00:33.460 --> 05:00:36.977
WE'RE TILL  ENABLING THAT .  BUT
THE IDEA  IS TO SPACE IT OUT,

05:00:37.389 --> 05:00:40.887
ONCE  EVERY 30 MINUTES WITH A
CYCLE  OF ACCURACY WITHIN TWO 

05:00:41.086 --> 05:00:43.664
MINUTES WITHIN THOSE  30-MINUTE
UPDATES.  YOU CAN  THINK OF IT 

05:00:43.665 --> 05:00:47.184
AS
A 30-PLNT  DELAY WITH AN UPDATE

05:00:47.380 --> 05:00:49.662
ACCURACY  OF TWO MINUTES WITHIN
THAT  30-MINUTE CYCLE.

05:00:49.824 --> 05:00:51.492
THE SAME WITH WI-FI.  THE API  
IS

05:00:51.493 --> 05:00:53.585
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT .   WE
DON'T HAVE THE CONVENIENCE  FOR

05:00:54.199 --> 05:00:57.599
SCHEDULING.  BUT IF  YOU'RE
BANGING ON THE WI-FI  QUERY,

05:00:57.600 --> 05:01:00.443
YOU'LL KEEP GETTING  THE SAME
RESULTS IF YOU GO  TOO FAST.  WE

05:01:00.695 --> 05:01:02.729
WON'T ACTUALLY  DO THE QUERY. 
THOSE ARE THE  TWO STRATEGIES

05:01:02.992 --> 05:01:05.118
THAT WE TAKE  IN FOR LOCATION 
AND

05:01:05.119 --> 05:01:07.156
FOR  WI-FI.
JUST TO HIGHLIGHT, THERE'S A 

05:01:07.175 --> 05:01:11.335
NUMBER OF OPTIONS HERE HIS OR 
HER LOWER BATTERY IMPACTING  

05:01:11.336 --> 05:01:12.996
THAT
YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING  AT.  ONE

05:01:12.997 --> 05:01:16.195
IS BATCHING,  GEOFENCING, AND IN
THE  COMPLETE LAST CASE AGAIN IS

05:01:17.521 --> 05:01:21.995
SERVICE.  IF YOU ARE USING  THE
FOREGROUND SERVICE AND  THE USER

05:01:22.558 --> 05:01:24.693
UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS  KIND OF
HAPPENING, THAT'S  REALLY

05:01:24.694 --> 05:01:26.776
CRITICAL.  IF THEY  UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING,  THAT WILL

05:01:26.777 --> 05:01:28.959
ENABLE THEM TO SAY,  YOU'RE
RUNNING IN THE  BACKGROUND. 

05:01:28.960 --> 05:01:31.668
YOU'RE  EXPENSIVE.  I GET IT,
MOVING  ON.

05:01:31.695 --> 05:01:34.410
AND YOU'LL HAVE RELAXED 
REQUIREMENTS WHEN YOU'RE IN  

05:01:34.411 --> 05:01:35.823
THAT
MODE.

05:01:35.824 --> 05:01:40.343
SO THE OTHER THING I WANTED  TO
TALK ABOUT -- I KNOW IT  FEELS

05:01:40.537 --> 05:01:43.443
LIKE I'M TALKING ABOUT  BATTERY,
AND THEN SUDDENLY  I'M TALKING

05:01:43.585 --> 05:01:46.443
ABOUT ALERT  WINDOW.  I WANT TO
TAKE A  MOMENT TO THINK TALK

05:01:46.444 --> 05:01:49.137
ABOUT  IT.
TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST WITH  YOU,

05:01:49.138 --> 05:01:50.869
THIS WAS ONLY INTENDED  FOR  
WHAT

05:01:50.870 --> 05:01:55.326
THE NAME IS, SYSTEM  ALERT
WINDOWS.  IT WAS NEVER  REALLY

05:01:55.727 --> 05:01:58.521
CONSCIOUSLY INTENDED  TO BE USED
THE WAY THAT IT  HAS BEEN.  BUT

05:01:58.522 --> 05:02:02.537
WE WERE IN A  SIMPLER WORLD IN
API ONE, AND  IT WAS LEFT 

05:02:02.538 --> 05:02:05.233
PUBLIC.
AND  PEOPLE HAVE FOUND REALLY 

05:02:05.444 --> 05:02:08.427
AMAZING IDEAS AND SOLUTIONS 
USING THIS API.  SO WE DON'T 

05:02:08.637 --> 05:02:11.119
WANT TO GET RID OF IT.
HOWEVER, WE DO WANT TO TRY  AND

05:02:11.272 --> 05:02:15.647
PUT IT ON RAILS.  WHAT  WE'RE
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT  IS, MANY

05:02:15.854 --> 05:02:16.762
APPLICATIONS  RENDERING ON TOP 
OF

05:02:16.763 --> 05:02:19.663
EACH  OTHER, CONFLICTING WITH
EACH  OTHER.  THERE'S NO 

05:02:19.664 --> 05:02:20.834
ATTRIBUTION OF WHAT  
APPLICATIONS

05:02:20.835 --> 05:02:22.958
HAPPEN TO BE  RENDERING AT ANY
POINT IN  TIME.

05:02:23.124 --> 05:02:26.123
AND SO THE IDEA WAS THAT CAN  WE
ADD SOME LAYERING?  CAN WE  ADD

05:02:26.778 --> 05:02:29.167
SOME ATTRIBUTION WITHIN  THE
MODEL?  AND THAT'S WHAT  WE DID

05:02:29.523 --> 05:02:32.430
WITH THE APPLICATION  OVERLAY.
SO THE IDEA HERE IS, WITH AN  

05:02:32.431 --> 05:02:34.431
APP
OVERLAY, IS THE USER CAN  NOW

05:02:34.462 --> 05:02:39.130
MANAGE WHAT IS FLOATING  ABOVE
THE -- THEIR  APPLICATION

05:02:39.131 --> 05:02:42.630
ACTIVITY.  IT'S  Z-ORDERED
PROPERLY UNTO  THEMSELVES, AND 

05:02:42.631 --> 05:02:44.166
TO
SYSTEM UI  AND TO THE 

05:02:44.167 --> 05:02:46.193
APPLICATION
BELOW.   AND IT WILL

05:02:46.194 --> 05:02:48.012
AUTOMATICALLY  SHOW A FOREGROUND

05:02:48.013 --> 05:02:49.490
NOTIFICATION IN THE  
NOTIFICATION

05:02:49.491 --> 05:02:53.100
MENU, SO THE  USER IS AWARE IF
THEY'RE IN  MULTIPLE 

05:02:53.101 --> 05:02:54.527
APPLICATIONS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY USING THIS 

05:02:54.528 --> 05:02:56.609
FEATURE.
THIS WAY, IF THEY SEE IT, 

05:02:56.610 --> 05:02:58.885
THEY'RE UNHAPPY WITH IT, THEY 
CAN GO TO THE APPLICATION, 

05:02:58.886 --> 05:03:01.695
CONTROL THE SETTINGS IF THEY 
WANT.  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS MAKE 

05:03:01.944 --> 05:03:04.230
SURE YOUR USERS ARE AWARE OF 
USING THIS, BECAUSE IT CAN BE 

05:03:04.231 --> 05:03:05.756
KIND OF SURPRISING IF IT  
DOESN'T

05:03:05.757 --> 05:03:07.137
HAPPEN.
AND THE OTHER THING THAT WE 

05:03:07.138 --> 05:03:09.975
CHANGED WAS FOR TARGETING ON  O
IS, IF YOU ARE NOW USING  THIS

05:03:09.994 --> 05:03:14.240
NEW OVERLAY TYPE, YOU  WILL THEN
SEE -- SIT ABOVE  THE LEGACY

05:03:14.241 --> 05:03:17.403
VIEWS.  SO THIS IS  MAYBE YOUR
INCENTIVE TO ADOPT  A NEW MODEL,

05:03:17.601 --> 05:03:20.401
IS ONCE YOU'RE  USING THAT,
EVERYBODY WILL BE  PROPERLY

05:03:20.402 --> 05:03:24.669
Z-ORDERED IN A KIND  OF LRU
FASHION.   AND THEN  YOU'LL --

05:03:24.959 --> 05:03:27.303
BELOW SYSTEM UI,  BUT ABOVE
THINGS LIKE THE  KEYBOARD AND

05:03:27.756 --> 05:03:31.832
OTHER SYSTEM UI  COMPONENTS.
SO NOW I WANT TO TRANSITION A 

05:03:31.833 --> 05:03:34.101
LITTLE BIT ABOUT TALKING  ABOUT
HOW WE'RE GOING TO  IMPROVE THE

05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:38.072
SYSTEM WITH DATA.   AND, YOU
KNOW, I DON'T MEAN  TO BLAME

05:03:38.073 --> 05:03:39.850
ANYONE, 'CAUSE IT'S  NOT.  
THAT'S

05:03:39.851 --> 05:03:43.898
NOT MY INTENT.   BUT IT'S REALLY
A STORY ABOUT  APPLICATIONS.  

05:03:43.899 --> 05:03:45.225
AND
THAT  PHONES ARE AMAZING, AND 

05:03:45.226 --> 05:03:47.662
YOU 
CAN DO SO MANY THINGS WITH  THIS

05:03:47.919 --> 05:03:51.317
PORTABLE COMPUTING  DEVICE. 
HOWEVER, WE HAVE  RESOURCE

05:03:51.318 --> 05:03:53.351
SCARCITY, MOSTLY IN  THE FRAME 
OF

05:03:53.352 --> 05:03:54.870
BATTERY.
AND THE QUESTION THAT COMES  UP,

05:03:54.871 --> 05:03:57.104
WELL, THEN HOW DO WE  BALANCE
THIS?

05:03:57.134 --> 05:03:59.243
AND THE BIG THING THAT WE 
REALIZED -- AND YOU MIGHT BE 

05:03:59.394 --> 05:04:02.849
THINKING AT YOUR SEAT, YEAH,  
NO,

05:04:02.850 --> 05:04:05.852
DUH, NO.
THERE ISN'T VERY GREAT  TOOLING

05:04:06.200 --> 05:04:09.059
UP UNTIL RECENTLY TO  HELP
DEVELOPERS UNDERSTAND  THEIR

05:04:09.060 --> 05:04:11.700
IMPACT.  WHEN WE  REACHED OUT
INTERNALLY EVEN  AT GOOGLE, WE

05:04:11.992 --> 05:04:14.076
WOULD FINE THEY  DIDN'T REALIZE
THEY WERE  DOING IT.  SO THAT

05:04:14.096 --> 05:04:16.631
KIND OF  BROUGHT AROUND A NUMBER
OF  THOUGHTS THAT I'LL GET  INTO

05:04:17.590 --> 05:04:21.305
THE OTHER ONE IS THIS KIND OF 
TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS IN  THAT

05:04:21.306 --> 05:04:22.835
YOU HAVE SO MANY  APPLICATIONS 
ON

05:04:22.836 --> 05:04:25.464
YOUR PHONE.   AND IF ANY OF 
THOSE 

05:04:25.465 --> 05:04:28.164
APPLICATIONS SAY STICK A 
WAKELOCK, YOU ONLY NEED ONE  TO

05:04:28.372 --> 05:04:31.569
DO IT AND THE COST IS NOW  YOUR
CPU IS UNABLE TO GO TO  SLEEP. 

05:04:31.725 --> 05:04:34.525
AND YOU'LL HAVE A  VERY
PRECIPITOUS DRAIN ON  YOUR

05:04:34.526 --> 05:04:36.349
BATTERY OVER TIME.
AND WHEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF 

05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:38.885
APPS AND ONLY ONE NEEDS TO  MAKE
A MISTAKE, YOU'RE PRETTY  MUCH

05:04:39.292 --> 05:04:42.242
GUARANTEED TO HAVE A BAD  TIME. 
AND SO WHAT WE STARTED  LOOKING

05:04:42.397 --> 05:04:46.962
AT IS HOW CAN WE GET  TO A POINT
OF SUSTAINING  PERFORMANCE,

05:04:46.963 --> 05:04:49.398
INTRODUCING  ACCURATE
MEASUREMENTS FOR  DEVELOPERS AND

05:04:49.663 --> 05:04:51.529
BRINGING ON  LINE NEW
DASHBOARDS.

05:04:51.530 --> 05:04:53.975
SO LET'S DIG IN A LITTLE BIT 
INTO WHAT THESE ARE.  AND 

05:04:53.976 --> 05:04:55.418
THERE'S A TALK ON BAD  
BEHAVIORS,

05:04:55.419 --> 05:04:57.904
IT WAS EARLIER IN  THE DAY.  IF
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN  IT, PLEASE GO

05:04:58.211 --> 05:05:02.586
HOP ON YOUTUBE  AND GO TRACH AT
TAKE A LOOK A LOOK AT  IT.  THE

05:05:02.732 --> 05:05:05.169
GUYS WHO PRESENTED  IT ARE HERE
IN FRONT, STARING  AT ME.  THANK

05:05:05.544 --> 05:05:07.006
YOU.
THE BIG ONE HERE IS, WE'RE 

05:05:07.007 --> 05:05:09.961
LOOKING FOR EGREGIOUS  BEHAVIOR
THAT WE CAN ALL  AGREE ON.  SO A

05:05:10.324 --> 05:05:15.341
GOOD EXAMPLE  OF THIS IS
WAKELOCKS.  IS IF  YOU ASK A

05:05:15.342 --> 05:05:18.178
DEVELOPER, YOU WERE  HOLDING A
WAKELOCK FOR SIX  HOURS 

05:05:18.179 --> 05:05:20.179
STRAIGHT.
YOU WERE IN  FOUR ROUNDS AND THE

05:05:20.569 --> 05:05:21.854
USER  WASN'T -- IN THE 
FOREGROUND 

05:05:21.855 --> 05:05:25.445
AND THE USER WASN'T  INTERACTING
WITH YOUR  APPLICATION.  AND

05:05:25.446 --> 05:05:28.352
PRETTY MUCH  EVERYBODY SAYS I
HAVEN'T HAVE  BEEN DOING THAT. 

05:05:28.559 --> 05:05:31.605
THE TRICK  WAS, THERE WASN'T
REALLY GOT  TO INSTRUMENTATION 

05:05:31.606 --> 05:05:33.070
TO
HELP  YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WAS 

05:05:33.071 --> 05:05:34.207
HAPPENING.  AND THAT'S WHERE  
THE

05:05:34.208 --> 05:05:36.480
PLAY CONSOLE IS COMING  INTO ITS
OWN AND BRINGING OUT  THESE

05:05:36.481 --> 05:05:38.711
FEATURES SO YOU CAN SEE  THESE
TYPE OF SITUATIONS THAT  ARE

05:05:38.712 --> 05:05:41.214
HAPPENING.
OTHER BIG ONE HAS BEEN REALLY  

05:05:41.215 --> 05:05:43.446
HE
IS VEERING JANKING FRAMES,  SO

05:05:43.606 --> 05:05:46.653
FROZEN FRAMES, FRAMES THAT  DAK
OVER 700 MILLISECONDS TO  RUN. 

05:05:46.856 --> 05:05:49.444
ALSO REALLY HARD TO  FIGURE OUT
WHERE IN YOUR  APPLICATION

05:05:49.445 --> 05:05:52.697
THEY'RE OCCURRING  AND EVEN IF
THEY'RE OCCURRING  AND IF THEY

05:05:53.404 --> 05:05:55.587
ARE, WHAT DRISES  THEY'RE
OCCURRING ON.

05:05:55.794 --> 05:05:58.139
THE LAST WAS CRASH LOOPING  AND
CRASH DATES.

05:05:58.430 --> 05:06:02.312
THE OTHER IS LOOKING AT THE  OS
SIDE.  NO THE TO SAY THAT 

05:06:02.313 --> 05:06:05.309
EVERYTHING IS ABOUT APPS.   IT'S
NOT.   WE HAVE TO BRING  A LEVEL

05:06:05.546 --> 05:06:07.992
OF SANITY ONTO THE  OPERATING
SYSTEM.  ONE GOOD  EXAMPLE WAS

05:06:08.148 --> 05:06:09.272
THE IMPROVEMENTS  WE MADE ON 
BOOT

05:06:09.273 --> 05:06:10.584
TIME AND  LOOKING HARD AT HOW 
THE

05:06:10.585 --> 05:06:13.277
OS IS  STRUCTURED .  AND THE
OTHER  ONE IS ALSO GOING TO BE 

05:06:13.450 --> 05:06:16.429
STARTING TO LOOK AT I/O 
THROUGHPUT, HOW MANY SCANS  ARE

05:06:16.700 --> 05:06:18.700
HAPPENING IN THE  BACKGROUND IN
DIFFERENT  PARAMETERS.  AND ALL

05:06:18.774 --> 05:06:20.214
THESE  WILL START COMING OUT AND

05:06:20.215 --> 05:06:22.295
BEING AVAILABLE FOR YOU GUYS 
OVER THE COMING YEARS.

05:06:22.466 --> 05:06:26.102
JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE  OF
THIS, I HAVE A SELECTION    OF

05:06:26.103 --> 05:06:30.228
GOOGLE APPS.  I HAVE  HIDDEN THE
NAMES TO PROTECT  THE INNOCENT,

05:06:30.622 --> 05:06:32.622
SLASH, GUILTY.
BUT WHAT I HAVE PUT UP THERE  IS

05:06:32.919 --> 05:06:35.758
A HASH LINE.  AND THE HASH  LINE
IS EFFECTIVELY THE  THRESHOLD

05:06:35.769 --> 05:06:36.975
THAT YOU'RE GOING  TO SEE OF 
WHEN

05:06:36.976 --> 05:06:39.216
WE SAY AN  APPLICATION HAS
CROSSED INTO  THE TERRITORY OF

05:06:39.415 --> 05:06:41.919
BAD  BEHAVIOR.
SO YOU CAN SEE THE MAJORITY  OF

05:06:42.062 --> 05:06:44.545
APPLICATIONS IN THIS CROSS 
SECTION.  THESE ARE ALL MAJOR 

05:06:44.546 --> 05:06:47.148
GOOGLE APPS.  MOST OF THEM  ARE
QUITE GOOD.  AND THERE'S  A FEW

05:06:48.260 --> 05:06:50.899
OUTLIERS THAT ARE  HAVING ISSUES
WHERE A  WAKELOCK IS GETTING

05:06:50.900 --> 05:06:52.934
STUCK IN  THEIR APPLICATIONS. 
AND YOU  CAN SEE THE PERCENTAGES

05:06:53.241 --> 05:06:54.664
HERE,  THAT THEY LOOK SMALL, BUT

05:06:54.665 --> 05:06:58.233
WHEN YOU SEE THESE NUMBERS  OF,
LIKE, HALF A PERCENT  HERE, ONE

05:06:58.984 --> 05:07:01.023
PERCENT THERE,  THOSE ARE JUST
ONE APP.  AND  AS I MENTIONED

05:07:01.680 --> 05:07:04.609
BEFORE, ONLY  ONE APP NEEDS TO
MAKE THIS  MISTAKE FOR YOUR

05:07:04.610 --> 05:07:07.100
ENTIRE  DEVICE TO SUFFER. 
MULTIPLE  THAT BY THE HUNDRED

05:07:07.429 --> 05:07:09.429
APPS.  IF  YOU WORK OUT THE
RATIO,  YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A

05:07:09.622 --> 05:07:12.970
BAD  TIME.
THE NEXT ONE HERE, LET'S TALK 

05:07:13.326 --> 05:07:16.890
ABOUT FOREGROUND CRASHES AND 
HELPING OUR DEVELOPERS 

05:07:16.891 --> 05:07:19.822
UNDERSTAND REPEAT OFFENDERS, 
RAPID CRASHING IN A CYCLE.

05:07:19.992 --> 05:07:22.461
WE GENERALLY HAD GOOD 
DOCUMENTATION TO UNDERSTAND  IF

05:07:22.668 --> 05:07:26.978
YOU CRASH, BUT NOT  REPEATED
CRASHES VERSUS  SPORADIC.  DO I

05:07:27.289 --> 05:07:29.264
HAVE A  POPULATION OF 5% 
CRASHING 

05:07:29.265 --> 05:07:32.367
REALLY EXTREMELY OR DOES IT 
SPREAD ACROSS THE POPULATION 

05:07:32.976 --> 05:07:35.076
95%.
THE VERY LAST ONE  HERE IS  

05:07:35.077 --> 05:07:36.132
ABOUT
FROZEN FRAME RATES.   YOU CAN 

05:07:36.133 --> 05:07:37.148
SEE
ANOTHER EXAMPLE  OF MOST

05:07:37.149 --> 05:07:39.203
APPLICATIONS ARE  ACTUALLY DOING
PRETTY GOOD.   AND IN THIS CASE,

05:07:39.204 --> 05:07:43.211
THERE WAS  ONE WHO WAS A LITTLE
NOT AS  GOOD.  AND WHEN WE 

05:07:43.212 --> 05:07:45.212
PASSED 
THIS DATA ALONG TO THE TEAM, 

05:07:45.294 --> 05:07:48.389
THEY'RE LIKE, CRAP.  NOT  THEIR
INTENT, OBVIOUSLY.

05:07:48.587 --> 05:07:50.873
BUT IT REALLY MAKES THE 
EXPERIENCE ON THE DEVICE NOT 

05:07:51.023 --> 05:07:53.873
REALLY THAT FANTASTIC.  
ESPECIALLY THE APPLICATION.   IT

05:07:54.073 --> 05:07:57.576
MAKES THE USER GO, IS MY  DEVICE
WRONG?  IS THE APP  BAD?  WHAT'S

05:07:58.253 --> 05:07:59.416
HAPPENING?
SO GIVING THIS INFORMATION  BACK

05:07:59.417 --> 05:08:02.170
TO DEVELOPERS, THEY'RE  ABLE TO
START REMEDYING THESE  PROBLEMS

05:08:02.405 --> 05:08:04.795
AND SOLVING THEM.
SO THE BIG THING HERE IS 

05:08:04.796 --> 05:08:06.642
VISIBILITY.  AND THIS IS 
VISIBILITY BOTH FOR YOU GUYS  AS

05:08:06.643 --> 05:08:09.437
WELL AS FOR THE USER ON  THEIR
DEVICE.

05:08:10.445 --> 05:08:12.979
SO NEW DEVELOPER TOOLS, WE'RE 
ALSO DOING A LOT OF OUTREACH 

05:08:13.135 --> 05:08:17.243
BOTH INTERNALLY AND  EXTERNALLY
WITH BIZDEV, TO  REACH OUT TO

05:08:17.759 --> 05:08:19.759
TEAMS AND INFORM  THEM, HEY, DO
YOU KNOW THIS  IS HAPPENING ON

05:08:19.902 --> 05:08:26.748
YOUR APPS?   IN MANY CASES WE
DON'T, AND  IT'S A QUICK FIX,

05:08:27.509 --> 05:08:30.715
ESPECIALLY  WITH WAKELOCKS.
 AND THE LAST ONE HERE IS 

05:08:30.716 --> 05:08:32.716
BATTERY SETTINGS IN THE PLAY 
STORE.  AND I'LL TALK A  LITTLE

05:08:32.837 --> 05:08:35.381
BIT ABOUT THAT, AND  OEM
DASHBOARDS.  WE ALSO WANT  TO 

05:08:35.382 --> 05:08:37.382
GET
THIS DATA OVER TO  OEMs SO THEY

05:08:37.561 --> 05:08:40.664
CAN SEE WHAT  IS GOING ON AND
THEY CAN SEE  WHAT DEVICES ARE 

05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:43.165
INTRINSICALLY GOOD AND YOU  HAVE
A STRONG BASE TO WORK  ON, THAT

05:08:43.666 --> 05:08:45.904
YOU'RE NOT SEEING  JANK BECAUSE
OF THE DEVICE  FREAKING OUT, BUT

05:08:46.055 --> 05:08:48.805
YOU'RE  HAVING A GOOD EXPERIENCE
AND  THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY 

05:08:48.806 --> 05:08:50.845
TO 
CONTROL YOUR OWN DESTINY.

05:08:51.202 --> 05:08:54.810
SO BATTERY MENU ON HERE IS 
ABOUT -- THIS IS THE NEW O 

05:08:54.811 --> 05:08:57.435
BATTERY MENU.  AND IT WAS 
REDESIGNED WITH THE IDEA OF 

05:08:57.436 --> 05:08:59.775
BEING ACTIONABLE FOR USERS.   WE
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT  IF YOU

05:08:59.870 --> 05:09:04.701
GO TO THIS MENU, YOU  DON'T GO,
OKAY, I SEE GOOGLE  PLAY

05:09:04.702 --> 05:09:08.920
SERVICES, THE  SETTINGS --
ANDROID OS, AND  SCREEN.  

05:09:08.921 --> 05:09:10.270
YOU'RE,
LIKE, WHAT  AM I SUPPOSED TO

05:09:10.271 --> 05:09:13.653
THINK IF I  SEE THIS?  THERE'S
REALLY  NOTHING ACTIONABLE HERE.

05:09:13.654 --> 05:09:17.307
AND WHILE IT WAS TECHNICALLY 
ACCURATE, IT WASN'T  NECESSARILY

05:09:17.464 --> 05:09:20.715
USEFUL TO WHAT  YOU'RE TRYING TO
DO, IS TO  UNDERSTAND WHAT

05:09:20.716 --> 05:09:22.806
APPLICATIONS  ARE IMPACTING YOUR
BATTERY  LIFE.

05:09:22.977 --> 05:09:26.149
SO THIS IS HOW WE  RESTRUCTURED
IT.  AND WE ALSO  INCLUDED,

05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:28.981
THOUGH, YOUR  FOREGROUND
INTERACTION WITH  THOSE

05:09:28.982 --> 05:09:30.982
APPLICATIONS.  AND THIS  IS
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS  REALLY

05:09:31.421 --> 05:09:34.280
QUITE COMMONLY.  AND  I'LL GIVE
YOU JUST A QUICK AN  ANY DOTE

05:09:34.466 --> 05:09:38.290
FROM INTERNALLY.
I HAD A BUCK FILED TO BUG FILED

05:09:38.451 --> 05:09:42.963
TO ME,  IT WAS ABOUT ANDROID
BATTERY  LIFE, IT'S HORRIBLE.  I

05:09:43.119 --> 05:09:44.637
DON'T  MAKE IT PAST 3:00, WHAT'S

05:09:44.638 --> 05:09:46.821
GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED ON THEIR DEVICE 

05:09:47.078 --> 05:09:48.451
WAS THEY WERE PLAYING POKEMON  
GO

05:09:48.452 --> 05:09:54.136
FOR TWO HOURS ON THURSDAY  AT
1:00 P.M.

05:09:54.501 --> 05:09:58.046
AND I WAS -- AND MY REPLY  WAS,
THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING  THAT YOU

05:09:58.805 --> 05:10:00.805
GOT THIS MUCH  BATTERY LIFE OUT
OF POKEMON  GO ON YOUR PHONE. 

05:10:01.154 --> 05:10:04.610
ALSO, IT  WAS THURSDAY AT 1:00
P.M.,  GOOGLER.

05:10:04.767 --> 05:10:08.215
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE THING WAS 
THAT I TOOK AWAY WAS, THEY 

05:10:08.216 --> 05:10:12.174
DIDN'T REALIZE THEY PLAYED IT 
THAT LONG.  AND SO THAT WAS 

05:10:12.175 --> 05:10:15.013
HAPPENING QUITE OFTEN.  YOU'D 
SEE AN APP WITH BATTERY  DRAIN,

05:10:15.730 --> 05:10:17.921
BUT YOU DON'T  NECESSARILY
RECOGNIZE IT WAS  BECAUSE, OH, I

05:10:18.417 --> 05:10:20.760
USED MY PHONE,  LIKE, AN EXTRA
HOUR TODAY.   AND IT'S HARD TO

05:10:21.172 --> 05:10:23.172
REMEMBER,  HOW LONG DID I REALLY
HAVE  THE SCREEN ON.  SO THAT'S

05:10:23.466 --> 05:10:25.747
HOW  WE STRUCTURE BATTERY, IS TO

05:10:25.748 --> 05:10:27.748
HELP INFORM YOU OF HOW LONG 
YOU'RE USING THE DEVICE, HOW 

05:10:27.978 --> 05:10:29.940
LONG YOU'RE USING DIFFERENT 
APPLICATIONS, AND SO THAT YOU 

05:10:29.941 --> 05:10:32.338
CAN MAKE THIS COMPARISON OF  
WHAT

05:10:32.339 --> 05:10:34.996
IS HAPPENING IN THE  APPS.
WE DON'T WANT TO PASS  JUDGMENT

05:10:35.359 --> 05:10:38.498
ON AN APPLICATION  BEING GOOD OR
BAD.  IT'S NOT  NECESSARILY A 

05:10:38.499 --> 05:10:40.539
BAD
THING IF AN  APP USES 20% OF 

05:10:40.540 --> 05:10:42.462
YOUR
BATTERY.   IF YOU WERE LIVE

05:10:42.463 --> 05:10:44.807
STREAMING AN  EVENT, THAT'S
PRETTY DECENT,  ESPECIALLY IF IT

05:10:45.108 --> 05:10:48.211
WAS FOR AN  HOUR OR TWO.  SO
WE'RE NOT  TRYING TO SAY

05:10:48.212 --> 05:10:50.699
INTRINSICALLY  THINGS ARE BAD IF
THEY'RE  HIGH.  BUT WE WANT TO

05:10:51.109 --> 05:10:54.415
ADD  SOME VISIBILITY SO A USER
CAN  SEE THIS IS AN APP I DIDN'T

05:10:56.799 --> 05:10:58.937
TAKING UP 5% OF MY  BATTERY?  
AND

05:10:58.938 --> 05:11:00.811
THOSE QUESTIONS  STARTED
HAPPENING ON THE  USERS' PART 

05:11:00.812 --> 05:11:02.291
AND
GIVING YOU  GUYS FEEDBACK  AND

05:11:02.292 --> 05:11:04.122
YOU CAN  SEE THE SAME DATA IN 
THE

05:11:04.123 --> 05:11:06.669
PLAY  PLAY  CONSOLE.
SO THIS IS WHERE I WILL 

05:11:06.670 --> 05:11:09.369
TRANSITION TO TALKING A  LITTLE
BIT ABOUT THE FUTURE,  SO YOU 

05:11:09.370 --> 05:11:11.046
CAN
KIND OF GET AN  IDEA OF WHERE

05:11:11.047 --> 05:11:13.535
WE'RE GOING.
THIS IS ALSO MY SUGGESTION TO 

05:11:13.727 --> 05:11:17.292
REALLY LOOK AT BACKGROUND 
LIMITS, TO LOOK AT TARGETING  O,

05:11:17.706 --> 05:11:19.934
TO TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM 
BACKGROUND SERVICES TO JOBS, 

05:11:20.995 --> 05:11:24.495
ALARMS, GCM, ET CETERA.
AND THE THING IS, WE WANT TO  

05:11:24.496 --> 05:11:25.951
GET
TO THIS AMAZING BATTERY  LIFE

05:11:25.952 --> 05:11:29.572
THAT I STARTED OUT WITH, 
MULTI-DAY BATTERY LIFE.  AND  TO

05:11:29.733 --> 05:11:32.216
DO THAT, THERE'S A FEW  THINGS
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO  CHANGE,

05:11:32.217 --> 05:11:34.997
IF YOU WILL.  BUT I  WANT TO 
TALK

05:11:34.998 --> 05:11:38.637
ABOUT SOME  PRINCIPLES.
ONE IS, WE FUNDAMENTALLY  

05:11:38.638 --> 05:11:40.213
BELIEVE
APPLICATIONS SHOULD  BE ABLE TO

05:11:40.214 --> 05:11:44.403
RUN IN THE  BACKGROUND.  WE WANT
MUCH  MORE WELL-DEFINED RULES

05:11:45.156 --> 05:11:46.869
ABOUT  WHEN APPLICATIONS ARE 
ABLE

05:11:46.870 --> 05:11:49.259
TO  RUN.
TODAY, YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER  OF

05:11:49.712 --> 05:11:52.294
OEMs TAKING STRATEGIES,  TRYING
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM 

05:11:52.295 --> 05:11:54.295
INDEPENDENTLY.  AND IT  BECOMES
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR  DEVELOPERS

05:11:54.345 --> 05:11:56.654
TO DEAL WITH THAT  WORLD WHEN 
YOU

05:11:56.655 --> 05:11:57.728
DON'T  NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THE

05:11:57.729 --> 05:12:01.140
RULES ARE.  SO WE WANT TO GET  A
LOT CHRIS PER THERE.

05:12:01.432 --> 05:12:04.480
WE ALSO WANT USERS TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND BATTERY IMPACT.   YOU

05:12:04.684 --> 05:12:06.728
CAN ARGUE MY PREVIOUS  
STATEMENTS

05:12:06.729 --> 05:12:10.279
ABOUT THE SETTINGS  MENU, WHAT,
THE USER HAS TO  DO MATH IN 

05:12:10.280 --> 05:12:12.260
THEIR
HEAD ABOUT  HOW MUCH BATTERY IT

05:12:12.261 --> 05:12:14.635
USED?   AND I AGREE WITH YOU 
COMPLETELY .  WE WANT TO GET  TO

05:12:14.802 --> 05:12:17.500
A BETTER PLACE WHERE IT'S  MUCH
EASIER FOR A USER TO  UNDERSTAND

05:12:17.697 --> 05:12:19.792
WHAT'S HAPPENING.
AND WE WANT TO THEN ENABLE A 

05:12:20.136 --> 05:12:22.167
USER WHO SAYS, I'M NOT OKAY  
WITH

05:12:22.168 --> 05:12:23.844
THIS.  AND IF THE APPLES  
DOESN'T

05:12:23.845 --> 05:12:28.058
OFFER THE CONTROL, TO  GIVE THEM
ANOTHER OPTION   AT  

05:12:28.059 --> 05:12:29.032
UNINSTALLING
THE APPLICATION,  SOMETHING 

05:12:29.033 --> 05:12:30.813
OTHER
THAN JUST THE  NUCLEAR OPTION.

05:12:30.814 --> 05:12:36.232
THEN THE LAST ONE IS, WE  REALLY
WANT THIS IDEA OF  CONSISTENT

05:12:36.440 --> 05:12:39.688
DEVICE  PERFORMANCE, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE  WORRYING, WILL MY

05:12:39.839 --> 05:12:42.196
DEVICE MAKE  IT THROUGH THE DAY,
WILL IT  BE ABLE TO MAKE IT HOME

05:12:42.393 --> 05:12:43.813
UNTIL  I GET ON THE CHARGER.  WE

05:12:43.814 --> 05:12:45.228
WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING 
RELIABLE.

05:12:45.229 --> 05:12:47.370
ALL THESE USE CASES THAT  WE'RE
DOING ON PHONES AND ALL  THE

05:12:47.371 --> 05:12:49.246
PROPERTIES FROM GOOGLE  AND ALL
THE PROPERTIES THAT  YOU'RE

05:12:49.247 --> 05:12:51.603
MAKING AS APP  DEVELOPERS, YOU
CAN'T REALLY  RELY ON THIS STUFF

05:12:51.746 --> 05:12:54.484
UNLESS YOU  KNOW YOUR PHONE'S
GOING TO BE  THERE.  AND SO

05:12:54.485 --> 05:12:57.028
THAT'S REALLY  THE UNDERPINNING
FOR THIS  GENERAL STRATEGY.

05:12:58.095 --> 05:13:01.865
AND SO HOW DO WE GET THERE?
SO THERE'S THREE KIND OF BIG 

05:13:02.621 --> 05:13:04.200
TIERS.  WE HAVE TO CONSIDER  
WHAT

05:13:04.201 --> 05:13:07.591
IS THE API CONTRACT?  WE  DON'T
WANT TO BREAK THE  PROMISES WE

05:13:07.861 --> 05:13:11.200
MAKE TO YOU.
HOWEVER, WE DO MAKE A LOT OF 

05:13:11.408 --> 05:13:15.535
PROMISES THAT WE LATER  REGRET. 
AND SO AN EXAMPLE OF  THIS IS A

05:13:16.236 --> 05:13:18.579
WAKELOCK.  IF YOU  WERE TO
GENERALLY DESCRIBE A  WAKELOCK,

05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:22.015
YOU'RE SAYING,  WE'VE GIVEN THE 
APPLICATION -- ANY  APPLICATION

05:13:22.231 --> 05:13:27.813
CAN TELL THE OS,  STAY AWAKE
UNTIL I SAY TO GO  TO SLEEP,

05:13:27.814 --> 05:13:28.684
INDEFINITELY.  AND  WHEN YOU 
GIVE

05:13:28.685 --> 05:13:31.012
THAT LEVEL OF  CONTROL AND
THERE'S NOT  REALLY A WAY TO

05:13:31.013 --> 05:13:35.690
CLOSE THE  LOOP, YOU END UP WITH
VARYING  BATTERY LIFE.

05:13:35.882 --> 05:13:38.434
SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT,  THEN,
WHAT IS THE RIGHT  PROMISE TO

05:13:38.644 --> 05:13:40.921
MAKE TO A  DEVELOPER AND WHAT IS
THE  RANGE OF THAT PROMISE THAT

05:13:41.279 --> 05:13:43.220
WE  SHOULD BE GIVING TO ENABLE 
THE USE CASES BUT MAKE SURE  

05:13:43.221 --> 05:13:45.221
THAT
THE OS CAN BE RESPONSIVE  IN THE

05:13:45.748 --> 05:13:47.748
FACE OF

05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:50.925
 ADVERSITY OR 
APPLICATIONS TAKING ADVANTAGE  

05:13:50.926 --> 05:13:52.392
OF
THE PROMISE THAT'S BEING  MADE.

05:13:52.393 --> 05:13:54.580
THE OTHER IS THE ATTRIBUTION  I
MENTIONED BEFORE AND THE 

05:13:54.581 --> 05:13:56.831
CONTROLS THAT THE USER CAN  TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THIS STUFF.  

05:13:56.832 --> 05:13:58.968
TOGETHER, THE THREE OF THESE 
THINGS SHOULD GIVE US A MUCH 

05:13:59.223 --> 05:14:01.223
BETTER STRUCTURE.
AND SO THIS IS -- ALL OF THIS 

05:14:01.295 --> 05:14:03.641
IS, AGAIN, LIKE YOU SEE THIS 
LITTLE EXCITING BADGE ABOUT 

05:14:03.642 --> 05:14:06.123
PENDING REVIEW ON THERE.   THESE
ARE REALLY JUST IDEAS  TO

05:14:06.124 --> 05:14:07.252
ARTICULATE HOW WE'RE  
APPROACHING

05:14:07.253 --> 05:14:10.049
THE PROBLEM.   BECAUSE WE KNOW
IT'S A BIG  CHANGE.  AND SO 

05:14:10.050 --> 05:14:11.763
WE'RE
TRYING  TO BROADCAST THIS CHANGE

05:14:13.143 --> 05:14:16.846
ADVANTAGE OF IT.  YOU CAN  START
MOVING OVER TO  BACKGROUND 

05:14:16.847 --> 05:14:18.939
LIMITS
AND  TARGETING NODE NOW SO THAT 

05:14:19.192 --> 05:14:21.631
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A  BAD
TIME LATER ON.

05:14:21.883 --> 05:14:24.376
AND SO SOME OF THESE THINGS  IS
WE NEED TO LOOK AT MORE  LIMITS

05:14:24.879 --> 05:14:28.143
ON BACKGROUND  SCANNING.  WE --
WE HAVE TO  ADJUST THE LIMITS

05:14:28.333 --> 05:14:30.824
THAT WE'RE  DOING.  WE HAVEN'T
REALLY  GOTTEN AROUND TO

05:14:30.825 --> 05:14:32.953
BLUETOOTH  YET.  WE'RE ALSO
LOOKING AT  APPLICATIONS

05:14:32.954 --> 05:14:34.844
LISTENING TO  OTHER EVENTS ON 
THE

05:14:34.845 --> 05:14:35.802
DEVICE  AND WHETHER THOSE THINGS

05:14:35.803 --> 05:14:39.039
SHOULD BE HAPPENING OR NOT.
A BIG ONE HERE IS DEFERRING 

05:14:39.040 --> 05:14:42.655
WORK.  WE WANT THE OS TO HAVE 
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE 

05:14:42.656 --> 05:14:44.484
DISCRETION ABOUT WHEN JOBS  RUN.

05:14:44.485 --> 05:14:48.048
WHEN IT'S ALL  SERVICES-BASED,
THE OS HAS  REALLY NO CONTROL. 

05:14:48.796 --> 05:14:52.053
IF THE  SINGLE LARGEST INSTALLED
BASE  APPLICATION MAKES A 

05:14:52.054 --> 05:14:54.398
UNILATERAL DECISION TO  INCREASE
WAKELOCK TIME, THE  OS TODAY AND

05:14:54.549 --> 05:14:57.040
THE USER IS  POWERLESS TO DO
ANYTHING  ABOUT IT.  SO THAT'S

05:14:57.282 --> 05:14:58.968
WHY  WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE THESE

05:14:58.969 --> 05:15:01.053
TRANSITIONS.  AND THE BALANCE 
SHOULD BE NOW USERS ARE MORE  IN

05:15:01.306 --> 05:15:05.518
THE DRIVER'S SEAT ABOUT  WHAT
FEATURES THE  APPLICATION'S

05:15:05.519 --> 05:15:07.869
GIVING AND  WHETHER THE USER
FINDS VALUE  IN THOSE FEATURES

05:15:08.469 --> 05:15:10.708
RUNNING IN  THE BACKGROUND.  AND
THEN  THEY CAN ARTICULATE THAT.

05:15:10.709 --> 05:15:13.803
THE DEFAULTS FOR ALL OF THESE 
THINGS IS ON, AND THE MODEL  YOU

05:15:14.064 --> 05:15:16.969
CAN THINK OF, AS LONG AS  YOU'RE
COOL, THE OS IS COOL  AND

05:15:16.970 --> 05:15:20.063
EVERYBODY WILL BE COOL  AND IT'S
GREAT .  AND IF IN  THIS

05:15:20.064 --> 05:15:23.001
SCENARIO, THOUGH,  APPLICATIONS
START GETTING  AGGRESSIVE,

05:15:23.002 --> 05:15:25.193
BATTERY STARTS  GETTING HIGH,
SCANNING RATES  START GETTING

05:15:25.548 --> 05:15:28.660
HIGHER, WE MAY  START INFORMING
THE USER,  HEY, THIS STUFF IS

05:15:28.661 --> 05:15:30.397
KIND OF  HEAVY ON THE BATTERY, 
DO

05:15:30.398 --> 05:15:33.089
YOU  WANT IT TO RUN IN THE 
BACKGROUND?  AND THEN THEY  CAN

05:15:33.283 --> 05:15:34.298
ARTICULATE THAT BACK TO  THE OS.

05:15:34.299 --> 05:15:35.674
AND THEN WE CAN, YOU  KNOW, 
BEGIN

05:15:35.675 --> 05:15:37.302
HAVING A CONTROL  SURFACE FOR 
HOW

05:15:37.303 --> 05:15:39.225
WE MANAGE  INDIVIDUAL
APPLICATIONS.  AND  SO THEN THE

05:15:39.226 --> 05:15:43.002
USER CAN SAY,  THESE TEN APPS I
CARE ABOUT A  LOT.  THESE OTHER

05:15:43.346 --> 05:15:45.642
APPS, NOT  SO MUCH.  WE'RE NOT
SUGGEST  THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A

05:15:45.846 --> 05:15:47.112
MICRO  MANAGING MENU.  THAT'S 
NOT 

05:15:47.113 --> 05:15:50.173
THE DESIRE.  BUT USING THINGS 
LIKE HOW USERS ARE  INTERACTING

05:15:50.321 --> 05:15:52.861
WITH THE  APPLICATION, HOW OFTEN
ARE  THEY INTERACTING WITH GCM 

05:15:53.173 --> 05:15:58.851
APPLICATIONS WHEN THE IS 101  UP
.  HOW OFTEN DO THEY  INTERACT

05:15:59.934 --> 05:16:03.377
WITH -- HOW THE OS  SHOULD DOLE
OUT ITS LIMITED  RESOURCES,

05:16:03.378 --> 05:16:07.100
NAMELY BATTERY.
THE LAST ONE IS WE HAVE TO  BEEF

05:16:07.287 --> 05:16:12.726
UP THE IDEA OF  FOREGROUND
SURFACE -- HOW  DOES THAT NOT

05:16:12.971 --> 05:16:15.611
TURN INTO ALL  THE APPLICATIONS
RUSHING TO  THE EXITS OF

05:16:15.612 --> 05:16:17.807
FOREGROUND  SERVICE AND THEN
WE'RE BACK  IN THE SAME MESS 

05:16:17.808 --> 05:16:19.336
THAT
WE ARE  NOW WITH NO CONTROL

05:16:19.337 --> 05:16:23.103
SURFACE  AGAIN.
  AND WE WANT TO FIND A

05:16:23.104 --> 05:16:25.332
 BALANCE SO THAT APPLICATIONS
 CAN GENERALLY DO EVERYTHING

05:16:25.333 --> 05:16:28.559
 THEY NEED AND IN THE
 EXTREMES, THE USER IS ABLE TO

05:16:28.560 --> 05:16:30.690
 ARTICULATE APPROVAL FOR THESE
 EXTREME SITUATIONS.  AND

05:16:30.691 --> 05:16:32.533
 WE'RE HOPING THAT'S GOING TO
 RESULT IN A MUCH MORE STABLE,

05:16:32.534 --> 05:16:34.835
 MUCH MORE RELIABLE DEVICE IN
 THE LONG RUN.  AND SO

05:16:34.836 --> 05:16:37.885
 HOPEFULLY THAT GIVES YOU A
 BIT OF INSIGHT ABOUT HOW

05:16:37.886 --> 05:16:41.398
 WE'RE APPROACHING ANDROID
 HEALTH AND MOSTLY BATTERY

05:16:41.399 --> 05:16:46.238
 LIFE AND RESOURCE CONTENTION.
 SO -- OH, I FORGOT A SLIDE. 

05:16:46.239 --> 05:16:49.683
 BUT THE IDEA OF THE LAST ONE
 WAS ATTRIBUTION AND VALUE. 

05:16:49.684 --> 05:16:51.901
 SO WE WANT TO REALLY MAKE
 THAT IDENTIFIED, AND I

05:16:51.902 --> 05:16:55.544
 ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE
 POINTS.  I WON'T BORE YOU

05:16:55.545 --> 05:16:57.149
 REPEATING IT.
 AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

05:16:57.150 --> 05:16:59.176
 THE -- FOR YOUR TIME.
