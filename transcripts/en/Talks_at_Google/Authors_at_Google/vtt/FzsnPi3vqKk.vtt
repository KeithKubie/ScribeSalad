00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.819
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hi everyone. Thank you
for coming to today's @Google talk. I'm very

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:14.610
excited to introduce David Brooks. You all
know him as an Op Ed columnist for the New

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.939
York Times and the author of "Bobos in Paradise."

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.810
And David has also served as a Senior Editor
for the Weekly Standard, a Contributing Editor

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.699
for Newsweek and Atlantic Monthly as well.
And is a frequent commentator on The News

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:37.250
Hour with Jim Lehrer. So, without further
ado, I wanna invite up here David Brooks.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.250
[applause]

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.660
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Thank you. It's a little odd
to be here. I grew up about a half mile from

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.970
here, maybe longer, on 14th Street in Stuyvesant
Town--what I call Singapore on 14th Street,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.411
'cause of all the rules. Not allowed to bring
baby carriages into the playground and other

00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:56.219
odd rules in Stuyvesant Town.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.929
But it was a few blocks from here and a generation
ago. I grew up in the 60s. I went to Grace

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.850
Church School on 10th and Broadway. When I
was in 4th Grade, the Weathermen blew themselves

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.409
up in the block next door, if you remember
the Weathermen, the 60s radical group.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.479
My parents were somewhat Left Wing. My father
was teaching at NYU. They took me to a be-in

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:25.049
1965, where hippies would go just to "be"
in Central Park. And they threw their--. They

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.560
set a garbage can on fire and they threw their
wallets into it to demonstrate their liberation

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.100
from money and material things.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.240
And I was five and I saw a five dollar bill
on fire, so I ran up and grabbed the money

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.240
and ran away with it.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.240
[laughter]

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.810
And that was my first step over to the Right
in my life. So, it was definitely a different

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.880
era to move from. I got paddled in third grade
for writing "Julie Nixon is a Nazi" on the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.860
board. I was so Left Wing at that point.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.760
And so now, to go from the Weathermen to Google
is in some ways a big change, and some ways

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.340
not a change at all, actually. My first book
was more or less about that. So anyway, this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.819
book starts with a political problem I had.
And I'll just talk about it briefly. A problem

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.319
I had in covering policy, really for the last
20 years, which was when I took my current

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.590
job, I was given a good piece of advice, which
was to interview three politicians every day.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.110
And I don't always meet that quota, but I
often do. I spend a lot of time around politicians.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.209
And I learned that they're all emotional freaks
of one sort or another. They have what I call

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.069
"logorrhea dementia," which is they talk so
much it drives themselves insane.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.860
And when you meet them, they invade your personal
space. They stand way too close. They rub

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.530
the back of your head. They give you the full
man hug. Thing, I had dinner with a Republican

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.530
Senator who kept his hand on my thigh the
whole meal, squeezing it for emphasis when

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.430
he wanted to make a point.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.430
[laughter]

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.180
And so what they have is just incredible social
skills. A story I tell about Bill Clinton,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.110
which you'll call name-dropping, but I call
reporting, I'm walking out of a hotel lobby

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.110
in Boston.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.890
Clinton comes out of the elevator. He sees
me. He starts praising me for a column I'd

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.880
written praising him, which he thought was
particularly brilliant.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.420
[laughter]

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.940
And then I, a crowd gathers. They see Bill
Clinton in the hotel lobby. And he starts

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.920
backing up, so he can welcome them all into
our conversation. And so within a few minutes,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.090
he's like 80 feet away from me, but just talking
to me, but just wanting to welcome the whole

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.340
crowd.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.120
Mitt Romney, I was following him around in
New Hampshire the last Presidential cycle.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.459
And he was up in New Hampshire campaigning
with his five perfect sons, Bip, Chip, Rip,

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.940
Sip, Dip, and Lip and Skip. And he goes into
a diner and he introduces himself to a family

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.120
at the diner and asks, "What village in New
Hampshire are you from?"

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.690
And they described the village and he describes
the home he owns in their village. And then

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.040
he goes around. And he's leaving the diner
and he waves good-bye to everybody. Forty,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.620
fifty people. He's remember all their names.
He first names them. And so that's a level

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.799
of social skills that is impressive.

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.890
I was at the National Institute of Health
not long ago. And a neuroscientist showed

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.290
me a video of a girl with William's Syndrome.
And William's Syndrome, from the outside,

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.740
looks like reverse autism. And so, the girl
has no interest in the physical objects in

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.740
the room.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.780
She just has interest in social encounters.
And so, she's in a room with a guy who had

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.790
a little boy, who's 12 years old. And she
stands way too close to him and just wants

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.380
to stare into his eyes to get those social
encounters. And he's juggling. He's trying

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.060
to knock things over to get her interested
in the physical objects.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.250
But she just stands way too close and just
is looking at him. And I was looking at this

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.821
video and I'm thinking this is every Senator
that I've ever covered.

00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:47.800
[laughter]

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.750
So, these are the people I cover every day,
these socially very attuned creatures. And

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.760
yet, when they do policy very often, all that
skill vanishes and they start thinking like

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.430
CBO reports.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.800
And so I've covered a series of failures over
the course of my life, most of which derived

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.070
from this really simple view of human nature.
So I spent four years covering Europe and

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.850
the decline of the Soviet Union, the rise
of Russia. And we sent in teams of economists

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.650
with our currency plans and privatization
plans, because we assumed that what Russia

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.600
really needed after the Soviet Union was good
economic policy.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.190
But what Russia really lacked was social trust--the
inability to form associations and trust people.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.100
And as a result, everybody stole everything.
And that was something we didn't anticipate.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.200
In Iraq, we sent in the military, but our
leaders were oblivious to the cultural and

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.060
psychological realities they would find in
Iraq.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.040
I once asked a senior official in the Bush
Administration, "Didn't you guys kind of get

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.130
the culture in Iraq wrong?" And this person
said, "Well, I don't really believe in culture.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.080
I think if you change institutions, you'll
change the society." But so, cultures factored

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.740
out because it can't be quantified.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.360
And then we had a financial system based on
the supposition that bankers were prudent,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.340
rational creatures who would respond in straight
forward ways to incentives and wouldn't do

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:09.480
anything stupid en masse. That turns out not
to be true. And then the issue I care most

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.290
about is school reform education.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.730
And I've covered a whole series of policy
reform since 1983. And most of them have had

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.330
disappointing results because they treat students--.
Well basically, because they've skirted the

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:29.650
core issue in education, which is the individual
relationship between a teacher and a student.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.440
People learn from people they love, but if
you talk about the word "love" at a Congressional

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.900
hearing, they look at you like you're Oprah.
And so, this is an essential problem I face,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.810
which is that we have the most socially attuned
people on earth behaving and governing in

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.590
ways which are socially illiterate.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.010
And so I thought about this problem and it
occurred to me that it was not only a problem

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.880
in Washington, but it was a broader cultural
problem. That for centuries, at least since

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.350
the French Enlightenment, we've inherited
a view that we're divided selves. We have

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.350
reason over here.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.990
We have the emotions over here. And that they're
sort of a teeter-totter. They're at war with

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.100
each other. When the reason, the emotions
are down and vice versa. And this has led

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:17.350
to ways of studying human nature, which basically
borrow the methodologies of physics, emphasizing

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.740
those things that can be quantified and modeled,
and ignoring and amputating all the rest.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.100
It's meant that culturally, we're really good
at talking about material things, but pretty

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.240
bad at talking about emotions. When we raise
our kids, we're really good at talking about

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.770
job skills and things like that, but really
bad at talking about the things that matter

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.320
most, which are character.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.210
And so, we end up that when we raise our kids
in sort of the "Tiger Momization." She's the

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:49.460
extreme form, but many of us practice this
form of child parenting that we ridicule but

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:55.150
don't renounce, where we spend enormous amounts
of time focusing on the GPA and the SATs,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.310
things that barely lead to success.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.961
And in my neighborhood of Bethesda, Maryland,
and I know in this neighborhood, you get the--.

00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:06.750
If you go watch the kids coming out of school
at the third grade, they've got these 80-pound

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.080
backpacks on their backs. If the wind blows
them over they're like beetles, stuck there

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080
on the ground.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080
[laughter]

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.330
And their moms, who I described in one of
my earlier books, who come pick them up. I

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.360
call them Uber Moms who are highly successful
career women and have taken time off to make

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.940
sure all their kids get into Harvard.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.600
And you can usually tell the Uber Moms 'cause
they actually weigh less than their own children.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.000
At the moment of conception, they're doing
little butt exercises, taking so many soy-based

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.650
nutritional formulas during pregnancy. The
babies come out these gigantic, 13-pound,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.229
defensive linemen, plopping out there.

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:43.270
And the Uber Moms are cutting the umbilical
cords themselves and flashing little Mandarin

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.740
flashcards at the things to get them ready.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.050
[laughter]

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:52.630
And then, of course, the kids go off to become
the junior workaholics of America. And then

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:59.430
when they start talking about shopping, often
it ends up as consumption. And so we shop

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:05.060
in places that make us feel better about ourselves
because that's the easiest way to feel moral.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.320
We shop at Ben and Jerry's ice cream--an ice
cream company with its own foreign policy.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.490
I joke in one of my books that Ben and Jerry's
should make a pacifist toothpaste. It doesn't

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.070
kill germs. It just asks them to leave. That
would be a big seller.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.070
[laughter]

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:23.750
Or else, in this neighborhood you have Whole
Foods across the street in the market, these

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.800
progressive, enlightened stores where all
the cashiers look like they're on loan from

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.370
Amnesty International.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.450
And they've got these morally upstanding snacks,
'cause it's not pretzel and potato chips.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:39.220
They're these seaweed-based snacks. What we
buy in my household, it's called Veggie Booty

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:44.140
with Kale, which is for kids who come and
say, "Mom, Mom. I want a snack that will help

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.370
prevent colon rectal cancer."

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.530
[laughter]

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:52.690
And so, this is the lifestyle we have, which
is where the policy world is not as deep as

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:58.170
it should be. The way we raise our kids ignore
some of the most elemental factors. And when

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.300
we talk about morality, we're stuck in a world
that philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre described

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.380
where he said that "we have words for virtue
and courage and honor, but we no longer have

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.490
a system to understand how these things all
fit together."

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.480
And he said image we use words like gravity,
neutron, electron, but no real theory of physics

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.310
to how all these things fit together. And
he said that's the moral world we live in.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.100
I think there's a lot of truth to that. So
I'm stuck here both trying to analyze the

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:30.200
culture and the policy with these problems,
with this vacuum or this amputation of things

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.260
what's most important.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.380
And while I'm thinking about these problems
in my normal world, I see a group of researchers

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.900
who are coming up with answers to some of
these problems about what deepest in our nature.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.800
And the interesting thing to me was not in
the places where you would expect to look

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.440
for it in the world of philosophy, theology,
the people who usually tell us most about

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440
ourselves.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.370
It's over the past 30 years, among people
who've studied the human mind among neuroscientists,

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.460
cognitive scientists, behavioral economics,
psychology, sociologists. And in all these

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.670
fields, there's tremendous excitement and
really a much more aggressive and assertive

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.190
interest in who we are and describing who
we are.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:14.580
And so it occurred to me, over the past 30
years, we've had this really stream of advance.

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.340
And though they speak in a language of science
and use fMRI machines and high technologies,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.840
really the vision they give us of ourselves
is a much more humanistic vision than one

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.840
would imagine.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.270
It's the world being described by neuroscientists
is not a cold, deterministic world. It's a

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.290
very humanistic world. And really, if you
take all these many different fields that

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:40.020
are looking into the human mind, they tend
to revolve around three key insights. The

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.120
first of which is that while the conscious
mind writes the autobiography of our species,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.850
most of our thinking is unconscious.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:51.180
One way to think about this what a guy named
Tim Wilson, in the University of Virginia,

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.090
says the human mind can take in about 40 million
pieces of information a minute, of which it

00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:01.770
can be consciously aware of about 40. And
so, advanced amounts of thinking are unconscious--the

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.710
processes that are happening below awareness.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:09.420
And some of these are odd. These processes,
one of my favorite experiments, somewhat controversial,

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:14.970
is that people named Dennis are disproportionately
likely to become dentists. People named Lawrence

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.300
are disproportionately likely to become lawyers.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.279
Because unconsciously, we have a slight bias
toward things that are familiar, which is

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.610
why my daughter is named President of the
United States Brooks.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.230
[laughter]

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:30.221
Another oddity--I think it was Dan Ariely
who's now at Duke, found that when you eat

00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:34.900
alone, you eat this much. When you eat with
one other person, you eat, on average, 35%

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.900
more.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.900
Six or more other people, you eat, on average,
78% more. And you're really not aware of this,

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:45.210
that these are some of the ways you're biased
by unconscious processes. And then the second

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:50.520
thing about the unconscious is in some ways
the unconscious processes--of which there

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.600
are many--are really dumb.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.990
They're really bad at math, for example. But
in some ways they're phenomenally smart. They're

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.900
really good at pattern recognition. And so,
if you have a difficult problem with choosing

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.860
a poster, choosing a piece of furniture, often
the best way to solve it, the researchers

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.610
have found, is not to make a conscious list,
but to absorb the pattern.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:15.360
Distract yourself and then go with your intuition.
And so, one other tip I got from one of the

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.450
scientists was if you have trouble making
up your mind between two things, tell yourself

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.270
you'll settle it by a coin flip. But don't
go by whether the coin came up heads or tails.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:29.640
Go by your emotional reaction to the coin
flip. Are you happy or sad it came up the

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.100
way it did? And that's your inner mind telling
you what it wanted all along. And so that's

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.300
the first insight--the power of unconscious
paroxysm. The second insight is the centrality

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.390
of emotion.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:45.190
Emotion is not separate from reason. Emotion
is the foundation from reason. A guy named

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.950
Antonio Damasio, USC, studies people who have
had lesions in the parts of the brain that

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:54.050
process emotion. And those people are not
super-smart, Mr. Spocks. They're super-dumb

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.790
and basically incompetent at life because
what emotions are, they are an evaluation

00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:59.790
system.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.900
They tell you what you admire, what you don't
like, what you want, what you don't want.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.240
And if you can't make those value judgments,
you can't decide and your decision-making

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:13.210
landscape is hopelessly flat. And so, emotion
has risen from the periphery of the study

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.850
of the mind to the absolute center, as people
understand that emotion is central to all

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:18.850
of our processes.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:23.541
Now, I'm a middle-aged guy. I'm not particularly--.
I wear a suit, even at Google. I'm not particularly

00:14:23.541 --> 00:14:27.970
comfortable talking about emotion. My wife
jokes that me writing a book about emotion

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.700
is like Gandhi writing a book about gluttony.
It's not my natural thing.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.250
[laughter]

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.270
I come from Washington, the most emotionally
avoidant city on the face of the earth. And

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.750
I consider myself the most emotionally avoidant
person in the most emotionally avoidant city

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.150
on the face of the earth.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.160
There's a brain scan story, which is apocryphal
but gets at the truth, where they took a bunch

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.210
of middle-aged guys. They put them in an fMRI
machine. They had them watch a horror movie.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.640
And then they had them describe their feeling
toward their wives. And the brain scans were

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.000
identical in both circumstances--just sheer
terror. And so, I sorta get that.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.630
[laughter]

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.589
And yet, it is true that emotions are central
to how we think, to how we value. Emotions

00:15:07.589 --> 00:15:12.640
are central to what we remember. There are
some kids who are very bad, very low affects,

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.060
low emotion in childhood. And as adults, they
barely remember their childhoods.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:23.200
And then emotion literally wires the fibers
of the brain together. There was a horrible

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.650
orphanage in the 1940s out West, in the US,
where they decided the way to handle kids,

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.711
the way to raise kids at a very early age,
infants, was to give them good health care,

00:15:33.711 --> 00:15:39.460
give them good food, but not handle them.
Keep them antiseptic, germ-free.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:44.290
And in this orphanage, the mortality rate
by age two was 38 percent. And so, they stopped

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.050
naming the kids 'cause they were dying at
such high frequency. So without that emotional

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.470
handling, the brain really does not wire itself
together. So that's the second insight.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:58.160
And the third insight is that we're not primarily
self-contained individuals. We're deeply interpenetrated,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.550
one to another. Some of you have probably
read about the theory of mirror neurons, which

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.040
is that when we see each other do something,
we don't observe what we're doing.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.050
We reenact in our own brains what we see each
other doing. So when you see me pick up a

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:16.140
cup of coffee, it looks in your brain as if
you yourself are picking up a cup of coffee.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.530
And if I pick it up to drink it, you encode
it one way. If I pick it up to throw it in

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.990
the garbage, you encode it in a different
way.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.530
So you're not only observing what I'm doing,
you're reenacting the intention behind my

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:32.120
action. And so, this is a way we're deeply
interpenetrated, one with another. And it's

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.230
why emotional contagions can sweep through
a financial market, or sweep through the Middle

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.910
East.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:42.430
And this deep interpenetration happens sometimes
visually. Very importantly, in ways we don't

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:47.540
appreciate, happens through smell. People
who lose the sense of smell suffered greater

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.520
emotional deterioration than people who lose
any of the other senses because so much of

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.370
our signals come through smell in ways we're
not aware of.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:59.330
There was an experiment done in Germany, where
they took a bunch of people, put gauze pads

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:06.050
under their arms, had some of them watch a
horror movie, some watch a comedy. And they

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:11.180
had other people who were well paid smell
the gauze pads. And they said, "Which movie

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.610
did this person watch?"

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:17.750
And people can tell it way above average chance
which they watched. And women were a lot better.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.620
And so, these are the three foundational principles--the
power of the unconscious, the centrality of

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.439
emotions, and the deep interpenetration of
minds. And when you add those three together,

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.700
you get a different view of who we are.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:35.580
The French Enlightenment, René Descartes,
had a view that we're primarily rational creatures.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.559
But there was a separate enlightenment that
said the reason is weak, the sentiments are

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:43.650
strong. And this was the British, or Scottish,
enlightenment David Hume, Adam Smith, Edmund

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:44.650
Burke.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:49.240
And they said the sentiments are strong, what
we would call the emotions. And that gives

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.179
us a different view of who we are. And I think
a different view, for example, of what it

00:17:54.179 --> 00:18:03.350
takes to really succeed in the world, a different
set of traits that really build human capital.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.100
And so, when we talk about human capital,
what it takes to succeed and achieve, we tend

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:12.280
to talk about things like SAT scores, degrees,
years in schooling, things measured in IQ

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.460
tests. And those things aren't important.
Twenty-five percent of the job variation at

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.010
any company is explained by IQ.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:28.040
And so that is a significant thing. But 75%
of the job variation at any company is explained

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.470
by other things, many, many other things.
And I actually saw a study a couple weeks

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:37.930
ago--I'm sure you all read it--about Google
executives and what made a superior Google

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:38.930
executive.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.120
And if I recall the study correctly, it was
not raw IQ. It was not the ability to write

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.640
code. It was the ability to coach one on one,
which turned out to be the most important

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.330
factor. And so, when we think about what makes
up human capital, what this research points

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.330
to is not only the conscious abilities that
you can measure and count, like IQ, but a

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.910
whole series of unconscious skills.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:05.640
And so, I'm just gonna list a couple of those
skills. One of them you might call "mind sight,"

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.830
which is the ability to enter other people's
minds and download the information they have

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:16.150
there. The ability to permeate with another
person. This is something babies come with.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:21.080
So Alan Meltzoff, in 1979, a University of
Washington scientist, leaned over a baby who

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.809
was 43 minutes old, wagged his tongue at the
baby and the baby wagged her tongue back.

00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:30.730
A baby that young has no sense of myself or
another person or what a face is or what a

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.350
tongue is, but we're wired to mimic.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:38.150
And it's through that mimicry that we tend
to absorb information, tend to recreate a

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:44.510
world. Now in this country, 55% of the babies
by 18 months have established a reliable mimicking

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.760
relationship with Mom. And those kids have
a huge advantage when they get to school,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.170
even by 18 months, because not only do they
have a relationship with Mom, they have a

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.350
model in their heads of how to build relationships.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:01.100
And so, scientists at the University of Minnesota
take a look at these, what they call attachment

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.170
patterns at 18 months. And they can predict
with 77% accuracy who is gonna graduate from

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:09.820
high school. Because if you can relate to
Teacher, you just have a big advantage in

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.820
school.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.929
About 20% of the kids in this country have
what they call avoidant attachment patterns,

00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:19.360
which is to say they send out signals, but
nothing has come back to them. And so they

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.080
have an imperfect model of how to build relationships.
In one of the books I read, one of the teachers

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:30.500
described an avoidantly attached kid going
to class like a sailboat tacking in the wind,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.700
back and forth. Not wanting to get close to
teacher, but not really knowing how to do

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.730
that.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.880
And these kids, avoidantly attached people,
by age 70, have much fewer friends because

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:46.049
they just get less of a kick out of social
attachment. And they tend to do less well

00:20:46.049 --> 00:20:50.230
in work. And so this is a trait that we all
think about as very hard to measure, but some

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.530
people have the ability, when you're sitting
with them, just to laser into you.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:58.740
And they're gonna take whatever you have.
The second trait is what you might call "equipoise,"

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:03.870
which is having the serenity and maturity
to monitor the biases and shortcomings in

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:10.130
your own mind. And so, this, for example,
we all tend to be overconfident.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.850
Ninety-five percent of the professors in America
believe they have above average teaching skills.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:20.390
Time Magazine once asked Americans "Are you
in the top 1% of earners?" And 19% of Americans

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:25.390
are in the top one percent of earners and
another 36% expect to be someday.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:33.460
Paul Schumacher and Edward Russo gave tests
to executives about their own industry. And

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.570
then they asked them to evaluate their answers.
How confident were they they got the answers

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:42.679
to the test correct? And so, people in the
advertising industry gave answers they felt

00:21:42.679 --> 00:21:43.810
were 90% correct.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:49.840
And they thought the answers were 90% correct.
In fact, they got 60% of the answers wrong.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:58.650
The most overconfident industry in the entire
country is the computer and software industry.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:03.231
People in the computer industry, in these
tests, thought they got 95% of the answers

00:22:03.231 --> 00:22:06.840
correct. In fact, they got 80% wrong.

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.500
And that's because this overconfidence trait
is incredibly gender linked.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.090
[laughter]

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.850
And so, men drown at twice the rate of women
because men have tremendous confidence in

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:23.950
their swimming ability after they've been
drinking. And so, men are way more overconfident.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:28.090
But some people have the ability, what they
call meta-cognition, to look inside their

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:33.650
own mind and correct for their own biases,
what I call "equipoise." And so, there's a

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.929
whole series of traits, which are mental traits,
but which correlate relatively weakly with

00:22:38.929 --> 00:22:43.679
IQ, but are tremendously important--the ability
to regulate the strength of your conclusions

00:22:43.679 --> 00:22:45.410
to the strength of the evidence.

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:50.160
The ability to be curious and open-minded.
The ability to be modest in the face of partial

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.450
knowledge. The ability to build what you might
call "modesty boot straps" for yourself to

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:59.950
remind you how little you know. Peter Drucker
had one when he said, "When you make a decision,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:03.000
write down your reasonings. Seal it in an
envelope for nine months.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.600
Open the envelope. And you'll find nine months
later that a third of your decisions are correct.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.790
A third were wrong. A third were in the middle.
But in almost all cases, your reasoning will

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.400
be completely irrelevant."

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.799
And so these sorts of modesty boot straps,
this meta-cognition, the ability to think

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:21.679
about your own thinking, correct for your
own flaws is just a tremendously important

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:27.410
skill, which correlates weakly to IQ and things
like that. The third trait is a Greek word

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:32.460
called metis, which is the ability to detect
patterns in the environment.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:37.910
And so for example, my newspaper did a story
about soldiers in Iraq, who could look down

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:43.780
a street and tell whether there was a land
mine, and IED, on the street. And when we

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:47.610
asked them, "How do you know?" They couldn't
tell you. They just said, "I feel a coldness

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.179
inside."

00:23:49.179 --> 00:23:53.600
And that's not something that comes instinctively.
It's something that comes from long practice

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:58.641
and close observation. So an example of this,
because people with experience in the field,

00:23:58.641 --> 00:24:03.980
who have worked hard in the field to study
and observe something closely, see the landscape

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.980
differently than other people.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:11.610
A good experiment that illustrated this was
they took chess Grand Masters and chess novices

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:16.919
and gave them a five-second glimpse of the
chessboard. And then they said, "Memorize

00:24:16.919 --> 00:24:22.361
as much as you can on this board in five seconds."
The novices couldn't remember about four or

00:24:22.361 --> 00:24:23.660
five pieces on the board.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.100
The chess Grand Masters could easily remember
every piece on the board. And that's because

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:34.440
they didn't see individual pieces. They saw
formations of pieces. And so, and then they

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.429
rearranged the chess pieces so they were in
such a way that could never actually exist

00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:40.020
at a chess game.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.860
And the Grand Masters were no better than
anybody else. And it's through the power of

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:49.010
close observation over time you learn to see
something differently and you get these pattern

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:54.030
recognition skills. The fourth, I'll just
mention quickly, is sympathy.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:58.380
And if metis is the ability to look across
the physical landscape and detect patterns,

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:03.700
sympathy is the ability to look across the
social landscape and detect patterns. And

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:09.490
this is really useful if you wanna work in
groups. Most of us in companies--not newspaper

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:12.559
columnists, unfortunately--but most people
work in groups.

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:17.090
And that's because groups are much more efficient
than individuals. They think much better.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.460
And they work a lot harder. I just saw a study.
Somebody had the bright idea of measuring

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:26.820
the swimming times at the last Summer Olympics.
They compared the swimmer's performance in

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:31.299
their individual events to their performance
when they were part of a relay team.

00:25:31.299 --> 00:25:35.910
And as part of a relay team, they swum much
faster than they did individually. And the

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:41.040
later they were in the relay team, the third
or fourth, the more they improved their times

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.000
because they felt more essential to the team.
And so, groups think much better than individuals.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.990
Groups that think face-to-face do much, much
better than groups that communicate by electronics.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:57.580
University of Michigan did a study where they
took individuals--. Took a series of groups

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:02.490
and gave them math tests. Some of them could
solve the tests in face-to-face meetings.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:08.410
Some of them had to communicate by email.
The groups that met face-to-face had 10 minutes

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:12.720
to solve the problems. They did it easily.
The groups that communicated by email had

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.000
30 minutes and they failed. And so, face-to-face
communication is just a lot more effective.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.530
And the IQ of the group, the effectiveness
of the group, was not determined by the IQ

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:27.410
of the individual members. It was determined
by how emotionally sensitive they were to

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:32.280
one another--how often they took turns in
conversation and things like that. So that

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.950
ability of sympathy is just tremendously important.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:42.770
And then the final thing I'll mention just
quickly is the ability to build character,

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:48.830
to build a scaffold of restraints so you can
resist temptation and control your impulses.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:54.690
My favorite of experiments in all these fields
was done by a guy named Walter Mischel up

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:55.690
here at Columbia.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.300
Probably all of you know this. It's called
the Marshmallow Experiment. But just quickly

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.130
for those who don't, Mischel took a bunch
of four-year olds, put them in a room, put

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.940
a marshmallow on the table in front of them
and said, "I'm gonna leave the room, come

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.940
back in ten minutes.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:10.169
If you haven't eaten the marshmallow, I'll
give you two marshmallows." And he shows me

00:27:10.169 --> 00:27:14.290
videos of one of the little girls banging
her head on the table trying not to eat the

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.290
marshmallow.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.290
[laughter]

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.679
One day, Michelle was using an Oreo cookie.
The little kid picks up the Oreo, carefully

00:27:20.679 --> 00:27:25.752
opens the middle, carefully puts it back on
the table. And that kid is now a US Senator.

00:27:25.752 --> 00:27:27.470
[laughter]

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:32.240
But the significance of the test is that 20
years later, the kids who could wait seven,

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.600
eight, ten minutes have much higher college
completion rates and 30 years later, much

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:37.809
higher incomes.

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:42.380
The kids who could wait one minute or less
have much higher drug and alcohol addiction

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:47.250
problems and much higher incarceration rates.
And that's because some kids grew up in homes

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.460
where actions lead to consequences and they
learned to control their impulses.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:55.289
Some kids don't grow up in those homes. And
the kids, who could wait, didn't do it by

00:27:55.289 --> 00:27:58.980
staring at the marshmallow and saying, "I
will exercise iron willpower. I will not eat

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:03.450
that marshmallow." They did it by distracting
themselves, by singing, by doing something

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.510
else, pretending the marshmallow was a cloud.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.420
They had strategies. And so, the lesson is
if you wanna change your mind, you change

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:16.670
your behavior first. As the folks at Alcoholics
Anonymous put it, "Fake it till you make it."

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:20.809
And some people have the ability to instill
habits in themselves, which encourage really

00:28:20.809 --> 00:28:21.809
good--.

00:28:21.809 --> 00:28:28.230
That groove the mind in the right direction
and they develop good character. And so, these

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:34.410
are some of the traits you could describe
which contribute actual to real-life fulfillment

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.470
and achievement, which are not the conscious
traits, but are some of the traits being illuminated

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.750
by this field of research.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:47.180
And so, over the course of the research, I
came across a paragraph which I think illustrates

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.690
a lot of trends that I've been talking about.
And that's the importance of emotion, the

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:56.120
interconnection between people, and the importance
of unconscious processes.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.130
And I'll just close by reading this paragraph,
which is something of a sad paragraph. It's

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:05.240
a paragraph from a book by the name of Douglas
Hofstadter, who I hope some of you have heard

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.410
of, who's a great mathematician. A cognitive
scientist, I guess he is who teaches at Indiana

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.360
University.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:20.169
And Hofstadter wrote many fine books and he
was on sabbatical, if I recall the story correctly,

00:29:20.169 --> 00:29:27.440
in Italy with his two kids who were at that
point aged five and two. And his wife, Carol.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.960
And while he was there, Carol very suddenly
and very shockingly--I think she had a stroke

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:36.570
or an aneurysm--and she died when her kids
were five and two.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:41.799
And Hofstadter kept a photograph of Carol
on the bureau of his bedroom. And he presumably

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:47.180
saw this photograph many times during the
course of a day. But one particular time a

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:53.470
couple months after his wife's death, he happened
to see the photograph with a special intensity,

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.299
or poignancy.

00:29:55.299 --> 00:30:01.900
And he wrote this passage in his book, "I'm
a Strange Loop." So here's Hofstadter’s

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:02.900
writing.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.220
[reads from book]
"I looked at her face. And I looked so deeply

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:11.860
that I felt I was behind her eyes. And all
at once, I found myself saying, as tears flowed,

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:17.841
'That's me. That's me.' And those simple words
brought back many thoughts that I had had

00:30:17.841 --> 00:30:23.780
before about the fusion of our souls into
one, higher level entity, about the fact that

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:29.481
the core of both our souls lay our identical
hopes and dreams for our children, about the

00:30:29.481 --> 00:30:34.770
notion that those hopes were not separate
or distinct hopes, but were just one hope.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:40.690
One clear thing that defined us both, that
welded us into a unit. The kind of unit that

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:45.240
I had but dimly imagined before being married
and having children. I realized that though

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:51.020
Carol had died, that core piece of her had
not died at all, but that it had lived on,

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.840
very determinately, in my brain."

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.720
[ends passage]

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.740
And so the Greeks used to say we suffer our
way to wisdom. And the wisdom Hofstadter suffered

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.860
his way through this horrible experience was
that the loops that go through our mind are

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:09.740
shared loops. And some of them come from the
people near and dear to us right away.

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:16.280
Some of the loops in our mind come from education.
Some of them come decades ago from culture.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.179
Some come from family. Some come from our
civilization. Some come from religion. Some

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:24.510
come from our distant ancestors in the form
of genes.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:31.200
But all these loops really permeate our minds
in ways that connect us to one another and

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:37.090
make us more bounded as individuals, more
part of a collective. And in a less tragic

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:43.960
way, I think the policy failures of the last
few years suffered toward the wisdom that

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.940
if we have policy, that really doesn’t take
into account the full depth of human nature--all

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.880
these unconscious processes.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:55.380
If we have moral discussions that ignore our
moral sentiments and our moral intuitions.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.730
And if we have child rearing techniques, which
don't emphasize the things that are down there,

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:04.900
that really are the foundation of character,
then we'll be insufficient in all these things.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.419
And finally, the good news is that the last
30 years have really seen tremendous advances

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:15.460
in understanding what's going on down there.
And when Freud came up with his conception

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:21.220
of the unconscious, it had very pervasive
effects on culture. I think now we're developing

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.750
a new view of consciousness of the unconscious,
of who we are, written about by many books

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.070
and in many articles.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:33.380
And I think it's gonna have a tremendously
positive influence on our culture and maybe

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:40.440
even eventually on the world of policy. That
might happen. So, thank you very much.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.440
[applause]

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:54.160
There's time for questions or anything, if
anybody has--.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.320
[pause]

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.320
You first.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:04.910
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: I have a question about something
you said in the beginning about the conversation

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:12.220
about education and how the avoidance of emotional
inputs is pervasive. How do we change that?

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:19.120
How do we get that to be part of the conversation
where Congress doesn't want to talk about

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.260
kids connecting to the teachers?

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.870
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Well, it's--. I think, I would
say this research has permeated the field

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:29.659
of education more than any other. Because
people in the field are more comfortable talking

00:33:29.659 --> 00:33:34.559
about this stuff. And so, I think what's happened
is you've had a whole series of models which

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:37.940
have explicitly exploited this research.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.950
So for example, the Marshmallow Experiment
was the foundation for a series of schools

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:48.890
called KIPP Schools, which are around and
which really work on exactly the skills that

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.960
are below awareness. So when you walk into
a KIPP school, the kids are taught to look

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.950
people in the eye, to nod in agreement, to
walk down the hallway.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:59.830
Their graduation year is not the year they're
gonna graduate from high school. It's four

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:05.590
years hence, when they're expected to graduate
from college. And so, their expectations are

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:11.960
expanded. And so those models really take--.
They emphasize tests and accountability and

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.960
that stuff.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.719
But they also work to create a counter culture.
The difficulty politically--and Harlem Children's

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:25.139
Zone is the perfect example of this--which
is not just a school, but an entire counter-environment

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:29.749
really creating a pervasive environment, because
the fundamental effect is we don't know what

00:34:29.749 --> 00:34:31.629
causes poverty and these things.

00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:35.700
But you just gotta try everything. If you
have an emergent system that is poverty, you

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:41.250
have to have a counter-emergent system. The
political problem is that these institutions

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:46.450
which take advantage of this research are
incredibly paternalistic and very no holds

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:47.919
barred about that.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:54.139
And so the question becomes, do we want government
getting involved in families and really replacing

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:59.849
the culture of families? And we all take a
step back from that. Nonetheless, I think

00:34:59.849 --> 00:35:05.579
given when you're faced with especially the
generational cycles of poverty, it's worth

00:35:05.579 --> 00:35:11.160
taking that risk to have a series of paternalistic
human capital policies starting with nurse-family

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:16.200
partnerships to coach moms to become better
moms, early childhood education, much better

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.749
Head Start, KIPP Academies, after school,
mentoring, even in college, mentoring programs,

00:35:21.749 --> 00:35:28.299
coaching programs, a whole stream of policies
that pay attention to this to complement the

00:35:28.299 --> 00:35:30.750
testing in math and reading.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:36.260
And so, I think it's happening. And I had
an email just finally from a friend of mine

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.880
who worked in the Clinton Administration.
He came up here to work in the school system.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:43.609
And he said, "I've never been as optimistic
as I am about education reform. I've never

00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:45.849
been as pessimistic about government."

00:35:45.849 --> 00:35:48.450
And that's about how I feel. But I think a
lot of good stuff is happening in education

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.450
on that.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:36:02.039
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: It's hard to know how many of our
social instincts are innate, and how many

00:36:02.039 --> 00:36:07.849
are learned. But I was wondering given a world
where people tend to relate through Facebook

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:12.690
rather than face-to-face contact, do you see
a new set of social instincts emerging?

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:19.279
Or, do you think that somehow the whole Facebook-style
of interaction will fail because of innate

00:36:19.279 --> 00:36:20.289
social instincts?

00:36:20.289 --> 00:36:25.469
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Yeah. Well, some things are
innate. Some of the famous examples are men-like

00:36:25.469 --> 00:36:31.999
women with a zero point seven waist-to-hip
ratio. Men, in all times--. Or, women in all

00:36:31.999 --> 00:36:38.440
times and all places like guys who are taller
than them, though I did see a study.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:43.809
Somebody did a study of, I think match.com,
where they found that a guy who's 5'6" can

00:36:43.809 --> 00:36:49.569
get as many online date offers as a guy who's
6', so long as he makes $172,000 t a year

00:36:49.569 --> 00:36:50.569
or more.

00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:51.569
[laughter]

00:36:51.569 --> 00:36:56.329
That's the price of--. So if you're short,
work hard.

00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:57.329
[laughter]

00:36:57.329 --> 00:37:04.099
As for Facebook, there's advanced body of
research on this now. And my honest appraisal

00:37:04.099 --> 00:37:09.339
of it is that it's indeterminate. The way
I look at it, the question is does Facebook

00:37:09.339 --> 00:37:13.789
replace normal, face-to-face friendship, or
does it supplement it?

00:37:13.789 --> 00:37:18.739
And I think the body of research so far is
that it supplements it. But I think the one

00:37:18.739 --> 00:37:23.279
of the studies I saw recently, I think probably
have the best answer, which is, it's not Facebook.

00:37:23.279 --> 00:37:27.880
It's what you bring to Facebook. And so, most
of the people who do it, use Facebook as a

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.890
way to organize and deepen their normal contacts.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:36.950
But there's a minority of people who use it
basically as solace for their own loneliness.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:40.739
And so, it's not so much the technology that
is determining how it's used, whether it's

00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:47.739
just drawing networks, it's what people bring
to the technology. And my own--.

00:37:47.739 --> 00:37:55.170
I have an optimistic take because if there
is an upsurge in social dislocation, or social

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:59.869
dysfunction among say, people under 30, I
don't see the evidence for it. If you look

00:37:59.869 --> 00:38:03.930
at social indicators for people under 30,
their all heading in the right direction.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.200
Teenage pregnancy rates are dropping.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.089
Teenage suicide is dropping. Teenage violence
is dropping. Marriage rates are increasing.

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:17.030
Divorce rates are dropping. All these positive
social indicators for people under 35. And

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.160
so, if the technology is destroying their
lives, there's no evidence for that.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.249
So I take the more optimistic view, but there
is some negative results about the Facebook,

00:38:26.249 --> 00:38:27.249
too.

00:38:27.249 --> 00:38:28.930
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: Thank you.

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:35.509
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: You gave two examples at the beginning
about the Mandarin cards and then the marshmallows,

00:38:35.509 --> 00:38:42.130
where you seem to imply that it came from
the environment at home.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:46.750
It's exactly the kind of things where, based
on twin studies Judith Rich Harris would say.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:47.750
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Right.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:51.410
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: You can't say that. Can you comment
on that?

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:56.910
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Yeah. This is a great debate
which I can't do justice to. She, Judith Rich

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:01.869
Harris and many other people, Steven Pinker,
my friend Larry Summers, believe, look at

00:39:01.869 --> 00:39:08.259
twin studies and they essentially say parenting
barely matters, that some of it is genes,

00:39:08.259 --> 00:39:12.489
that some of it is peer, but very little of
it is parenting.

00:39:12.489 --> 00:39:19.369
I have two problems with this. First, there
is a gigantic--. I cited attachment studies.

00:39:19.369 --> 00:39:23.289
And this is where they look at the attachment
patterns through life and see how the kids

00:39:23.289 --> 00:39:27.609
turned out. And there are now--. There is
just a mountain of attachment studies done

00:39:27.609 --> 00:39:28.930
all over the world.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:34.269
And these are very rigorous studies which
correlate parental and child relationships

00:39:34.269 --> 00:39:41.190
to outcomes. And it shows that parents actually
do matter. And so, I look at attachment research

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:46.010
which stands in direct contradiction to the
twin study research. And that says that the

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.650
parental attachment matters.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:52.460
The second thing is that one of the problems
I have with the Rich Harris work, is a lot

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:57.859
of it is based on categories that I don't
think exist in real life. And so for example,

00:39:57.859 --> 00:40:03.480
when she's--. She says that two kids who are
in the same family have a shared environment.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:08.099
Yet, if I'm driving--I have three kids-- if
I'm driving with my three kids, I have very

00:40:08.099 --> 00:40:13.200
different conversations with each of them,
depending on what they bring to the table.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.750
We have different relationships. And so I
don't know what she means when she says that

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.529
there's a shared environment in the home.

00:40:18.529 --> 00:40:21.769
I don't think there's any such thing as a
shared environment. And then the final thing

00:40:21.769 --> 00:40:27.230
to be said is a lot of people believe parents
don't matter. I have never seen anybody actually

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:32.739
act that way. And so if you show me a parent
that says, "Hey, I don't matter. I'll let

00:40:32.739 --> 00:40:33.999
my kid run wild.

00:40:33.999 --> 00:40:39.720
I won't make them eat their, wait to eat dessert.
They can go to bed whenever the hell they

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.720
want." When I see somebody actually acting
that way and it turns out for the best, then

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.660
I'll believe it. So I'm an arch skeptic of
this view that the parents don't matter. But

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:51.230
there are a lot of scientists and a lot of
people that look at the data who take the

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.549
other point of view. So, it's not a settled
thing.

00:40:52.549 --> 00:41:00.970
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: So, some of the things you brought
up are how we're not really as rational as

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:06.119
we like to think we are, and that we--. That
relationships are very important. I'm wondering

00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:09.349
what your thoughts on how that should inform
health care policy.

00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:14.289
So, something that various people, including
you, have talked about is the need to move

00:41:14.289 --> 00:41:19.309
towards a more incentive-based system, where
you're making economic decisions based on

00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:23.539
prizes. And actually Google gave us this option
where we could take a very high deductible

00:41:23.539 --> 00:41:29.549
health care policy and they could give us
a lump of money in a spending account.

00:41:29.549 --> 00:41:34.049
So, for the first thousand dollars, you'd
have to be making very economic decisions.

00:41:34.049 --> 00:41:41.099
But I think about myself. I didn't accept
that because for me, health care is a lot

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:46.270
of trust in relationship. It's my wife saying,
"Hey, you better go. There's something wrong

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.270
with you.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:49.579
You better go have that looked at." And me
trusting my doctor and me knowing that I really

00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:55.599
can't make the--. I don't know how to make
these cost-benefit trade-offs because as well-educated

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:59.269
as I am, I don't understand. I'm not a doctor
and I don't know these things.

00:41:59.269 --> 00:42:03.190
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Right. No, that's a very good
question. So I think this is essentially the

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:07.479
fundamental question around politics right
now. And the core of all my political belief

00:42:07.479 --> 00:42:13.729
is this phrase epistemological modesty, the
idea that the world is phenomenally complicated

00:42:13.729 --> 00:42:16.299
and it's very hard to know.

00:42:16.299 --> 00:42:20.719
And that's certainly true of health care.
One little study I saw, this is tangential,

00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:25.170
but they took a bunch of doctors. They presented
them with the symptoms from the same patient,

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:29.650
separately. They gave some of the doctors
a bag of candy, Halloween candy.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:35.289
And some, no bag. The doctors who had a bag
of candy diagnosed a kidney ailment much more

00:42:35.289 --> 00:42:40.369
accurately than the no candied people. And
so, we all don't know much, even doctors.

00:42:40.369 --> 00:42:44.209
But nonetheless, we have to make decisions
in the world.

00:42:44.209 --> 00:42:47.999
And the decisions we have to make right now
are decision that will reduce health care

00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:56.140
inflation. And so the question is who makes
those decisions? Now, people like me, and

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:01.380
this I'm not a Libertarian, but I follow Hayek,
who said, "I would rather have the decentralized,

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:06.140
dynamic decision-making process of the market
make those decisions as people choose their

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.499
insurance options from a regulated batch of
insurance options."

00:43:09.499 --> 00:43:14.809
Other people, like the President, say, "No,
I'd rather have a board of experts in the

00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:19.760
Department of Health and Human Services."
He calls the board IPAP. There would be a

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.049
board. And they would make the decisions about
how to ration care.

00:43:24.049 --> 00:43:30.319
And so, I am, from my perspective of epistemological
modesty, I would say the technical experts

00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:36.469
trying to make decisions about 17% of the
US economy are probably gonna be even worse

00:43:36.469 --> 00:43:41.759
than a dynamic market system. But believe
me, there are plenty of people who take the

00:43:41.759 --> 00:43:45.631
other side, who think that the market hasn't
worked in health care and you need a central

00:43:45.631 --> 00:43:46.799
body of experts.

00:43:46.799 --> 00:43:52.240
But one way or the other, somebody has to
make those decisions. And the correct answer

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.271
could be there would be a mixture. There are
some decisions, some sorts of health care

00:43:55.271 --> 00:44:00.069
decisions, that individuals are better making
and some sorts that a group of centralized

00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:01.170
experts are better at making.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:08.430
But my bias is still to lean toward a decentralized
system, just because I think it's more dynamic.

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:16.761
I think it corrects mistakes more dynamically
than a group of experts sitting at HHS. But

00:44:16.761 --> 00:44:20.700
Paul Krugman would disagree. And Barack Obama
would, too.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:26.420
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: Another question that sort of touches
on the politics, maybe on that. But if we

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:33.539
could stay off the politics and more on the
social animal aspect of it, I've been profoundly

00:44:33.539 --> 00:44:38.209
confused by the recent debate over things
like The Ryan Plan.

00:44:38.209 --> 00:44:45.170
What polls indicate that people over 65 support
it tremendously, even though it would appear

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:52.180
to increase their costs. We've got situations
where everybody talks about it being a deficit

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:57.459
reduction plan, yet it has tremendous tax
reductions as well. So, it's like if you really

00:44:57.459 --> 00:44:58.459
care about deficit--.

00:44:58.459 --> 00:45:01.940
It's great to have cuts, but why in God's
name are you cutting taxes, too? From a rational

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:10.739
point of view, it seems there are a lot of
arguments. And I'm sure, I don't want to argue

00:45:10.739 --> 00:45:14.249
the politics of it, but from the point of
view of a lot of people who seem to be supporting

00:45:14.249 --> 00:45:17.809
it, it seems actually to be going against
what they think is important, or it goes against

00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:18.809
their interests.

00:45:18.809 --> 00:45:28.479
It seems to me that it's unlikely that people,
that the large portions of the population--.

00:45:28.479 --> 00:45:29.799
And I can understand the debate between Keynes
and Hayek and all the rest, even if they do

00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:30.950
watch rap videos.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:31.950
[laughter]

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:35.670
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: If everybody hasn't seen that
video, I highly recommend it, though.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:43.119
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: Yeah, yeah. Can you talk about,
in your experience, this social aspect of

00:45:43.119 --> 00:45:48.280
the political process, independent from the
rational aspect of it because I think we often

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:55.339
are in situations where it clearly is not
a purely rational argument that is convincing

00:45:55.339 --> 00:45:58.910
people, either because they don't have the
data or because they don't have the background

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:00.339
to understand what the arguments are?

00:46:00.339 --> 00:46:07.200
So, how does what you've written apply to--?
Why the heck do people either support or unsupport

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.200
these things?

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:12.520
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Yeah. Well, that's--. Lemme
address it this way. I've covered Obama and

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.330
Ryan for a long time. I've spent a lot of
time with each of them. And I think they're

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:23.059
very similar personalities. And if they ever
got together, they would like each other enormously

00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:25.039
and understand each other.

00:46:25.039 --> 00:46:28.980
But they've never actually got together. They've
never had lunch. Obama's never called Ryan

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.779
up and said, "Let's have lunch." Even though
they're basically the two principal figures.

00:46:32.779 --> 00:46:36.810
And I hear them talk about each other. And
they're both completely misinformed about

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:39.329
who the other is and what they believe.

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:43.589
And yet, they're in a competitive business.
They're in a very tribal business. And there's

00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:49.089
just a cold wind that separates the two tribes.
And so I'm to the point in politics where

00:46:49.089 --> 00:46:52.820
if I hear a member of one party--even really
smart people like Ryan, Obama--talk about

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:56.539
a member of the other, I know that everything
I'm about to hear is false.

00:46:56.539 --> 00:47:00.269
And I actually do interview both parties and
I know sort of what they think. So they're

00:47:00.269 --> 00:47:04.219
caught up. They're both very competitive people,
especially Obama. So they're caught up in

00:47:04.219 --> 00:47:06.450
the competitive juices of the fight.

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:12.229
My view is that to get to some sort of fiscally
sustainable solution, we've got to have a

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:17.890
budget that is affordable, that reduces debt,
but which allows the country to be dynamic

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.730
to allow creative destruction, but also heal
some of the social inequalities. So we've

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:26.549
gotta have a budget that solves three goals
which are in contention with each other.

00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:29.902
And therefore, we have to balance a whole
series of different things. We have to have

00:47:29.902 --> 00:47:35.349
some tax increases, some spending cuts. We've
gotta tax the affluent in order to support

00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:40.430
the young families. And so these are tremendously
complicated things.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:45.459
And my view is it's only gonna be solved when
both parties migrate toward what I think is

00:47:45.459 --> 00:47:46.459
the Simpson-Bowles plan.

00:47:46.459 --> 00:47:48.559
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: Yeah, but that's the policy.

00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:49.559
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Right, but I'm getting to
that.

00:47:49.559 --> 00:47:50.559
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: OK.

00:47:50.559 --> 00:47:56.900
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: So when I look at each party,
I'm asking what social steps are they taking

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:02.740
to get us toward Simpson-Bowles? And so, what
I liked about The Ryan Plan was he took the

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:08.380
Republican Party a social step toward that
center, because he said A, it's not enough

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:14.009
to focus on NPR and foreign aid. You've gotta
focus on the entitlements.

00:48:14.009 --> 00:48:17.940
And then you've gotta have something pretty
serious to reform entitlements. And that was

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:24.589
a bold step. And Obama took a step in calling
for some general deficit reductions. The policy

00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:30.019
details of the plans don't matter. The question
is are they taking a series of steps that

00:48:30.019 --> 00:48:33.009
get you closer to where the solution is bound
to be?

00:48:33.009 --> 00:48:37.739
And so I think both of them are beginning
to gradually take those steps to get out of

00:48:37.739 --> 00:48:44.960
the World War I trenches. And so I think they're
moving socially in the right direction. It

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.569
would just help enormously if they ever had
a conversation with one another.

00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:53.250
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: But you're saying the perceptions
of the people is essentially politics by tribe.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:57.960
The rational content of the policies isn't
important. It's rather which tribe you're

00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.960
in?

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.829
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: Well, a tribe does determine
everything in Washington. I mean, that's--.

00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:07.769
And so the question is how do you manage the
two tribes to get them toward one overlapping

00:49:07.769 --> 00:49:08.769
solution?

00:49:08.769 --> 00:49:13.509
And some days I think it'll happen. Most days
I think it's completely impossible. We'll

00:49:13.509 --> 00:49:20.349
have a national bankruptcy. I'd say 90% of
the days I think that. But it is that--. The

00:49:20.349 --> 00:49:24.749
big shock to me coming to Washington is how
much everything is team-oriented. It's team.

00:49:24.749 --> 00:49:29.160
Politics is a team sport. And the teams don't
overlap anymore.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:37.880
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: I'd like you to talk more about
overconfidence. So, the thing that doesn't

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:43.489
quite agree in my head is that while I agree
that we live in a world that is overconfident

00:49:43.489 --> 00:49:51.749
and we're not calibrated to what the reality
is and that most things fall on a normal distribution

00:49:51.749 --> 00:49:59.799
curve, but if you act in a way that is rational
and understanding what the probability of

00:49:59.799 --> 00:50:04.849
your actions are gonna be, people don't respond
really well to that.

00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:13.579
Like, say you're an engineer and you say,
"Well, I'm 70% sure that this bridge will

00:50:13.579 --> 00:50:19.020
continue to stay up for 30 years."[David Brooks
chuckles] And then the other engineer, whether

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:25.119
or not he's right, says, "I'm 99%sure that
this bridge is going to last for 30 plus years,

00:50:25.119 --> 00:50:26.220
or forever or whatever."

00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:33.670
The one that says 70% , even if he's correct,
will not get that job because that's the world

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:39.749
we live in. And if I tell my kids, "Yeah,
you're not--. Don't worry about your tests.

00:50:39.749 --> 00:50:44.500
It will fall under a normal distribution curve.
Some people do well. Some people don't."

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:45.579
[David Brooks laughs]

00:50:45.579 --> 00:50:49.079
Like, Cs, which are supposed to be average,
are not considered average. Come home with

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:53.630
a C, I'm sure like most everybody in this
room, they're parents probably would've beat

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.759
them. Or maybe just mine. But--.

00:50:55.759 --> 00:50:56.759
[laughter]

00:50:56.759 --> 00:51:04.579
So, I have a problem with the overconfidence
thing. Like, I think that it's not really

00:51:04.579 --> 00:51:10.920
a socially attuned thing to be calibrated,
like have your confidence be calibrated. That

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.749
it's really something that society wants you
to be overconfident.

00:51:15.749 --> 00:51:21.259
And that's positively received, even in politics.
If Barack Obama ever said something that made

00:51:21.259 --> 00:51:25.719
him seem like "I'm not confident," they'd
be like, "OK, why are you doing it, then?"

00:51:25.719 --> 00:51:29.489
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: OK. Well, I'd ask you to go
work at Lehman Brothers if you were so in

00:51:29.489 --> 00:51:36.339
favor of overconfidence. Just teasing. I think
the right answer is you should be mildly overconfident.

00:51:36.339 --> 00:51:41.069
And so, the people who have the most accurate
self-appraisals are people who are clinically

00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:46.309
depressed. People who are depressed are very
accurate about who they are and their skills.

00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:51.130
So you wanna be slightly overconfident, like
by 5%.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:52.130
[laughter]

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.970
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: But how could our depressed people
end interacting with society?

00:51:54.970 --> 00:52:00.759
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: No, that's your point. But
you don't wanna be 50% overconfident. So,

00:52:00.759 --> 00:52:06.759
and this is, again, gender-linked. If you
ask guys what your IQ is, the male response

00:52:06.759 --> 00:52:10.809
will be--. They'll tell you a score that's
about 15 points higher than it really is.

00:52:10.809 --> 00:52:11.809
Women tend to be pretty accurate.

00:52:11.809 --> 00:52:12.809
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Yeah.

00:52:12.809 --> 00:52:17.390
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: And so, you wanna be slightly
overconfident. I never would've started the

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:21.880
book if I knew how hard it was gonna be. And
I certainly wouldn't have gone off on a book

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:22.880
tour.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.069
I would've shot myself. And so you wanna--.
You don't wanna appreciate how difficult it

00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:33.279
is. Nonetheless, if you're building a bridge
and you think--. And you build a bridge that

00:52:33.279 --> 00:52:39.119
will bear 70% of the load you're supposed
to, you don't wanna say, “That's a fantastic

00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:40.380
bridge."

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:45.240
And so, you do wanna build. I mean, you do
wanna build modesty boot straps for yourself.

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:49.269
And so, slight overconfidence--. Well the
other thing, dual consciousness, and this

00:52:49.269 --> 00:52:56.380
is what I cover in politics, dual consciousness
is tremendously important. The best politicians,

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:59.559
in public, they totally believe what they're
saying.

00:52:59.559 --> 00:53:06.549
But in private, they have an equally authentic
self which says, "That's 70% true." And so

00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:10.619
I think it's valuable to have those two selves.
And by the way, that's another theme of the

00:53:10.619 --> 00:53:16.039
research is that we don't have one self. We
have a whole variety of very authentic selves.

00:53:16.039 --> 00:53:21.559
And so that would be my fudged answer to you.

00:53:21.559 --> 00:53:29.990
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And I think we're out
of time. I know you have a couple more questions,

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.990
but--.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:31.990
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: I've gotta run to something
else.

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.990
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's been a slow news
week, obviously.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.990
[laughter]

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.990
&gt;&gt;David Brooks: I've got a little--. There's
a guy in Pakistan I've gotta bump off.

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.990
[laughter]

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:38.099
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, thank you for joining
us today, David. It's been great having you.

00:53:38.099 --> 00:53:38.309
[applause]
