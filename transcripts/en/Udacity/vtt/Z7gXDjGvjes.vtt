00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.000
jQuery is an extremely popular JavaScript library meant to make a number of

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.770
common JavaScript tasks simpler, via a consistent API across all browsers.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.279
In other words, jQuery makes your life easier.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:17.915
As of 2014, almost 62% of the top 100,000 websites all use jQuery,

00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:20.230
which is pretty incredible.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.250
Performing AJAX requests that work properly in every browser is,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.860
well it's a big pain in the butt.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.520
Luckily we can use jQuery's AJAX methods and

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.130
leave some of the drudgery of supporting old browsers to jQuery.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.940
It's important to know that it's extremely common for

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.390
developers to use libraries to write AJAX calls.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.070
There's no problem with using libraries to simplify the code you have to write,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.300
especially with something like AJAX.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.220
In order to use jQuery we need to use jQuery objects, and

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.470
to do that we'll be using syntax like you see here within script.js.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.550
We're creating a few variables over here each of

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.600
which has a dollar sign in front of em.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.480
Now this dollar sign doesn't mean anything, it's just a character that

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.130
we're going to to use to identify the fact that this object is a jQuery object.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.880
To select an object with jQuery, we'll start off with this dollar sign.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.280
Which is a pointer to a jQuery object.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.990
And then, within the parentheses, we'll pass in a string of the element that we

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.960
want, where this pound sign represents an ID.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.780
So in this case, if we want the Wikipedia element we simply use

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.620
the dollar sign to represent the jQuery object and

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.960
then pass in a string starting with this pound sign or hashtag or

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.558
whatever you want to call it, representing the ID of wikipedia-links.

00:01:34.558 --> 00:01:39.650
Now wiki element represents a jQuery object of the Wikipedia links element

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.550
on the page.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.000
We'll be using two different methods for

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.660
AJAX requests, the .ajax method and the .getJSON method.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.470
Both methods take in a URL and then some optional parameters.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.990

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.730
