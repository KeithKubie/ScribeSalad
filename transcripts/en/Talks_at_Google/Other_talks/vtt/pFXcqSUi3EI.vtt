KAREN MAY: It is my
absolute pleasure today

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.820
to introduce you
to Jeffrey Pfeffer.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.250
And Jeff is a
professor at Stanford

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.320
and an author/co-author
of 14 books, another one,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.180
I understand, in the
making-- so 14 and 1/2 books.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.560
And so he's got lots and
lots of areas of expertise,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.560
and we're here today to
talk about his latest

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.820
book, "Leadership BS," which
is nothing, if not catchy,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.360
as a title.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360
I am Karen May.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.832
I lead our People Development
Team here at Google,

00:00:34.832 --> 00:00:37.040
and I know we're joined not
only by folks in the room

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.900
here today, but also
by a number of folks

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.650
in other locations
via live stream.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.020
So welcome all of you.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.950
And I shared briefly with
Jeff a little bit of an

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.220
and embarrassing fact,
which is I don't read

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.700
very many leadership books.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.530
And I tend to read
the first chapter

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.920
and feel like I kind
of got the point

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.940
and maybe read like
the first paragraph

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.000
of the rest of the chapters.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.300
There tends to be
a certain sameness.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.630
And so I left about
that much time

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.060
to read this book,
which is no offense.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060
But what I found when
I started reading

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.340
is I kind of put my feet up
on the couch and leaned back

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.400
and slowed down, and I said,
oh, this is very interesting.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.250
This is really different,
and so I was so pleased

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.330
that I had the opportunity
to directly ask

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.200
you questions because it was
a very thought-provoking book.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.270
And I know we can't assume
today the you've all

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.990
had the chance to read it yet.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.210
I imagine many of you will
following our conversation

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.200
because you too will
be very intrigued.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.770
So I'd like to just start off
with the first question, which

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.400
as I shared with you, I'm
very curious because you've

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.750
written at least two
books in one, maybe

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.350
three with this book.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.080
And two of the themes
that you wove together--

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.280
one is essentially, excuse
my paraphrase here-- you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.410
can correct me you like-- is
that the things that we say

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.350
we want in our leaders are not
necessarily the things that we

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.160
get in our leaders, nor are
they necessarily the things that

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.820
are rewarded in our leaders.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.720
So we have a disconnect.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.670
Similarly, we have a
multi-billion dollar leadership

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.690
development industry,
which claims

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.020
to help people develop into
that former set of things

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.090
that we say we want
in our leaders,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.840
and yet it doesn't do
a good job of that.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.840
And so you have commentary on
both of those states of affairs

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.500
in this book.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.930
And I'm curious about
why you wrote the book

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.110
and why you chose
to address both

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.490
of those important
questions together.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.050
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Wow!

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.420
KAREN MAY: No softball
questions to get us started.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.770
JEFFREY PFEFFER:
So I wrote the book

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.480
because I was angry,
which turns out

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.510
to make writing the book much
quicker-- you know, emotion,

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.780
motivation-- whatever.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.910
I am increasingly frustrated
by a combination of things.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.750
Number one, that
people who would

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.470
take my Path to Power class
at Stanford and say to me,

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.430
wow, your class
is very different,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.136
which I always take
as a compliment

00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:31.550
because I take anything as
a compliment at this point.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.550
You know, they say your
class is very different.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.310
It contradicts what we've
learned from other leadership

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.020
books or what we've learned
in other courses at Stanford.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.040
And that was kind
of interesting.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.540
And then I am
frustrated by the fact

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.220
that it's the dirty
little secret.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.740
The Stanford Business
School is, of course,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.200
very highly selective.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.694
We have extremely, fabulously
fantastic students--

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:57.360
probably now the most
selective business

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.640
school in the country--
hardest to get into.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.250
And in spite of the fact
that we are highly selective

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.870
and have these brilliantly
stunningly wonderful human

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.110
beings who come to us,
within the first 24

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.700
months of their graduation
from Stanford, a reasonably

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.565
high-- though since
nobody has studied it,

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:17.120
I can't give you exact data,
but my anecdotal evidence

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.740
from talking to a
few former students

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.490
is that somewhere between
10% and 20% of our students

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.340
will be fired within
the first two years.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.470
So that's a high
percentage, I mean,

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.830
because these are highly
selective, highly selected,

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.630
fabulously fantastic people.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.130
The idea that one of them would
be fired let alone somewhere

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.719
between 10% and 20%
is I think shocking,

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:40.510
and of course, the
reason why they're fired

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.218
is because they believe
the stuff they've

00:04:42.218 --> 00:04:44.230
been told in the other classes.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.900
So I think we as an
institution are failing.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.977
I certainly in my past with
the Power class, I have as one

00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:54.810
of the objectives that
you should never have

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.240
to leave a job involuntarily.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.800
We are preparing
you so that you know

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.220
how to survive in the world.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.774
That's the second thing.

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:05.940
But the thing that makes
me the angriest, of course,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.620
is the enormous
amount of hypocrisy.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.580
I can tolerate people lying,
cheating, and stealing,

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.770
and doing everything else.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.020
It's part of the world, and
some of them are actually,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.478
I guess, now running
for president.

00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:20.530
But in any event, what I
don't take very well to

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.590
is the hypocrisy.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.650
The people who stand up at
Our View From the Top series

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.850
or go and write these
books and describe

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.540
them and their
characteristics as a leader,

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.710
which bear almost no
resemblance to their behavior

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.570
and to what they've done.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.750
But many people in the
world believe this.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.810
So you can read Rudy
Giuliani's book on leadership.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.180
Or you can read-- I'll get
myself into plenty of trouble

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.471
because this is broadcast,
but his name is in the book,

00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:50.640
so I mate as well
say it-- Bill George,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.780
who is CEO of Medtronic.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.594
And you know, he
wrote "True North."

00:05:53.594 --> 00:05:55.510
Just a lovely book written
with my dear friend

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.110
and former student Pete Sims.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.900
And I actually very
innocently served on--

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.550
not innocently--
served on the board.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.180
I was on board with somebody
who had worked with Bill George

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.440
at Medtronic, and when "True
North " came out, I said, wow!

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.410
It must have been great
to work with Bill.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:20.460
The response was, that's not the
Bill George who I experienced.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.420
But this is not to say
anything about Bill.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.900
I think is typical.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.469
I make a point in chapter 1 of
the book to talk about why it

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:30.010
is difficult for people to tell
the truth even if they wanted

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.840
to, which by the way, in
many instances, they don't.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.880
I think memory selective-- we
know from studies of recall

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.330
of auto accidents or crimes that
even if there's no incentive

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.290
for you to misremember,
memory is imperfect,

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.810
and so we're certainly going to
have motivated imperfect memory

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.370
around what I did as a leader
and wonderful I was and how

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.470
everybody loved me
even if they don't.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.510
By the way, if you want
a little test of this,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.480
ask your friends and colleagues
about failed relationships.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.050
You get distorted
memory there too,

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.010
often in a different direction.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.710
So that's why I wrote the book.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.150
The reason why I wove
the two themes together

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.820
is because I think
they're actually-- I

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.770
believe they may be
related-- that the reason why

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.700
we say we want a set
of characteristics,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.160
and we don't get
them is in part,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.140
I think, because we have
a leadership industry that

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.630
is living in some mythical
world of the shoulds

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.486
and the oughts kind of like
Sunday school, which is fine.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:34.860
I have nothing
against religion--

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.340
or Saturday school
or Friday school

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.107
depending upon your
particular belief.

00:07:39.107 --> 00:07:40.690
I have nothing against
religion, but I

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.830
think we should not confuse
aspirational preaching

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.760
or lay preaching
with social science.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.570
And to me, I think the
two pieces are connected.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.950
But the reason why we have
done such a lousy job,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.650
manifestly lousy
job, of building,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.470
with the exception of Google
and my friends at SAS Institute,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.730
who typically rank
about in the top five of

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.440
places to work list every year.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.680
But for the most part,
workplaces are horrible.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.430
All data suggests it's awful.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:12.710
Employees are disengaged.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.480
Job satisfaction is horrible.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.240
My favorite statistic,
which was picked up

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.440
in "The Economist"
review of this book

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.040
last week was "Parade
Magazine" in 2012

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.580
said, would you rather
have a substantial raise

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.390
or be able to fire your boss?

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.260
And 35% of the people
said, fire my boss.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.820
I think leaders are failing and
not having a good experience

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.409
either.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.470
So the leadership
industry has failed,

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.470
and I think the disconnect
is one, not the only one,

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.340
but it's one manifestation
of the failure,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.130
so that's why I rolled
the two together.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.980
KAREN MAY: So one of
the things that you

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.670
outline in a sense is we
say we want these things

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.720
modesty, honesty, transparency,
care for others-- those kinds

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.530
of things.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.180
And yet those things
aren't rewarded.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.010
But there's a glimmer
of hope, if you will,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:09.740
that when done well and
not with leaders who

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.100
to 100% in those directions.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.090
But leaders who lead well,
there's a possibility that it

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.270
actually can be both
good for the organization

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.890
and the leader's career
and self-interest,

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.080
but that the leaders
career, the employees,

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.860
and the organization has three
different stakeholder groups,

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:28.920
as you will, often create
this triangle of tension with

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.550
the leader in the middle,
and they will solve first

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.130
for their career and often
second for the organization

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.360
because those two tend
to be best aligned,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.100
and it's the employees
who suffer as a result.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.400
Is that an accurate--

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.300
JEFFREY PFEFFER: I
think that's quite fair.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.720
KAREN MAY: So if we've
got this stakeholder

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.170
triangle and the potential of
those actually being aligned

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.660
to elicit behavior that
works for the leader's

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.930
career, the organization,
and the employees,

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.430
how do we begin to
shift from a state

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.540
where those are unaligned,
which reinforces the disconnect,

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.401
to one where they
become better aligned?

00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:07.901
JEFFREY PFEFFER:
That was a question

00:10:07.901 --> 00:10:10.160
I was going to ask you.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.692
KAREN MAY: I got it out first.

00:10:11.692 --> 00:10:14.150
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Since you're
a professional in this field.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.940
Well, you know,
I'm not 100% sure

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.450
that you actually can align it.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.890
It depends upon again what the
literature you want to access

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.130
and what scholarship
you want to access.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.495
But one of the fundamental
principles of sociobiology

00:10:27.495 --> 00:10:29.870
is that the interests of the
individual and the interests

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.750
of the group are frequently
at odds with one another

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.780
because-- so to take
an extreme example,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.665
if someone were to
roll a live hand

00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:42.550
grenade into this
room, what's good

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.190
for the group is for somebody
to throw their body on it,

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.320
but that's not what's
good for that individual.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.840
And there are many
ways in which what

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.040
produces individual
fitness and what

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:58.100
produces the best outcomes
for the group are not aligned.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.630
You want parents
to forgo food so

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.900
that their children can live.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.450
Or you wan the individuals--
I guess the best example would

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.726
be the Donner Pass.

00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:08.350
Hopefully, we'll have
snow this winter,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.780
but the Donner
Party getting stuck

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.594
in the thing and
some people, I don't

00:11:11.594 --> 00:11:13.052
think they volunteered,
but anyway,

00:11:13.052 --> 00:11:16.874
being eaten by the rest
of the Donner Party

00:11:16.874 --> 00:11:18.290
so they could
survive the travail.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.060
That would be, again,
unaligned interest.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.870
I'm not sure that it is
possible to completely align

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.370
the interests.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.510
And I'm not sure that many
of the qualities that we

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.057
say we want or not only that,
but we don't apparently want--

00:11:35.057 --> 00:11:37.140
but I'm not even sure
they're even good for people

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:37.800
or whatever.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.500
So one of my favorites
is authenticity,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.093
which we can talk about later.

00:11:42.093 --> 00:11:43.400
KAREN MAY: Let's do it now.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.425
That was one of
my questions too.

00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:46.550
Can I interrupt you?

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.940
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Sure.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.310
KAREN MAY: The
authenticity-- because one

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.309
of things that you said
that caught my attention

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:52.050
was that authenticity
can actually

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.270
be bad for an organization.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.300
We all talk about authenticity.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.360
So say a little bit more
about when authenticity

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.175
becomes problematic or toxic.

00:12:03.175 --> 00:12:05.960
JEFFREY PFEFFER:
Well, first of all,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.470
like much of the
leadership stuff,

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.070
if you search for authenticity
on my favorite search

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.230
engine, which is
in fact Google, you

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.170
get a billion definitions
or a lot of definitions,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.930
many of which are basically like
a list of positive attributes

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.320
that don't comport to any kind
of definition of authenticity

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.990
that I would believe.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.600
But if you look at
the more fundamentally

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.780
scholarly literature
of authenticity,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.937
it talks about being
true to yourself.

00:12:37.937 --> 00:12:40.520
And I don't believe that leaders
need to be true to themselves

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.400
at all.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.900
They need to be true to what
the human beings around them

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.570
need and want.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.696
So one of the examples
I use in the book-- I

00:12:47.696 --> 00:12:51.270
have a dear friend
whose daughter

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.405
fell in with a bad crowd.

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:55.520
Her boyfriend gave her drugs.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.510
She had an overdose.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.412
Five months later she was dead.

00:12:58.412 --> 00:12:59.870
But, unfortunately,
she did not die

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.720
that night, which would have
been better for everybody.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.090
And as he and his
wife watched her die,

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.080
and I could describe
that if anybody wants,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.060
what that process is
like to be brain dead

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.820
and have your muscles
atrophy, and even though most

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.280
of the brain is not functioning,
the pain of the muscles

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.585
contracting-- so there
is this poor, basically

00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:22.070
unconscious human
being, screaming,

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.420
and he was this very senior
administrator at a university,

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:31.870
and for the first minute or two,
or week, or day, or whatever,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.070
people are sympathetic, and
they are always, of course,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.070
concerned for him and about him.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:41.192
But sooner or later, he
has to go back to work,

00:13:41.192 --> 00:13:43.680
and his team, as
much as they love him

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.440
and as wonderful as he is,
fundamentally, after a while,

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.600
they forget it is
about, you know,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.250
you need to serve-- you
need to serve the group.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.490
We need your energy.

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:54.980
We need your commitment.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.220
We need your
emotional involvement.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:05.720
We need your leadership in the
sense of strategic direction

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.060
and all these other things.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.000
And I can assure you that
there were many days,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.400
there probably still are
many days, when he wakes up,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.840
and the last thing
he wants to do

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.280
is go to work at some higher
education university position

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.010
because as he said,
you lose a child,

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.390
it will stay with
you all your life.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:26.860
It is a sadness which is an
ineffable part of his soul.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.935
But on the other hand, that's
not what you've been hired for.

00:14:30.935 --> 00:14:33.060
And you have to show up
and do something different.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.440
And the less extreme
example, Gary Loveman,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.140
who just stepped down as CEO
of Caesars Entertainment,

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.790
first time he came to my class
because I wrote a case on him,

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.210
he was running 101
degree temperature.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:44.320
He had the flu.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.210
No sentient human being
with 101 degree temperature

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.620
wants to do four hours
of class with me.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.860
So if he's being
true to himself,

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.410
I want to be home in bed.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.512
But part of the job of
a leader is to convey--

00:14:58.512 --> 00:15:00.970
and he would do this when he
would show up at his casinos--

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.460
more important than my class.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.310
As he said once to my class in
a video which I've seen so often

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.239
now it's memorized,
people need your energy.

00:15:14.239 --> 00:15:15.530
They need your physical energy.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.988
They need your
intellectual energy.

00:15:16.988 --> 00:15:19.820
They need your emotional energy,
and they need your energy

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.540
even if at that moment in time
you've got marital trouble

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.400
or your children are acting
up, or you don't feel well.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.700
People need your
energy, and so the idea

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.697
of being authentic to
yourself seems a little too

00:15:33.697 --> 00:15:34.280
self-centered.

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:40.610
You show up at the
leadership role,

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.520
you have a responsibility to
the people you're being led by.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.985
And so part of the skill of
being a leader is the ability,

00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:49.110
I think, to act in ways
that you're not necessarily

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.530
feeling at the time.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.450
I may be tired.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.280
I may be depressed.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.580
I may be distracted.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.740
But in terms of
getting the job done,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.370
I have to show up in a
fully present, engaged,

00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:59.360
energetic way.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.649
Does that make sense?

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:01.440
KAREN MAY: It does.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.330
It does.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:08.410
So it comes, in a sense, back to
the definition of authenticity

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.840
and also to one of the points
you make about the leadership

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.550
training industry is
we sort of glamorize

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.500
and perhaps exaggerate
these traits

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.380
so that authenticity
means being completely

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.567
and utterly vulnerable
and open at all times.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.900
JEFFREY PFEFFER: And being
true to your wants and needs.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.170
KAREN MAY: Right.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.160
Being true to your
own wants and needs

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.870
versus a more realistic
definition, which

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.490
might have to do with evaluating
what your team needs from you

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.410
or what your organization
needs from you,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.880
checking to make sure you're not
violating fundamental values,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.590
and defining authenticity
on a longer-term scale

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.140
than in the moment,
how am I doing?

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.350
But what's the
connection for me there

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:54.360
is when our industry
defines things

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.640
in an unrealistic way
or an idealistic way,

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.030
we set a standard that's
unrealistically high,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.240
and that then becomes something
that people can't achieve,

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.047
and that exaggerates perhaps
the gap that already exists.

00:17:07.047 --> 00:17:08.630
JEFFREY PFEFFER: I
think that's right,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.092
and also we presume--
authenticity

00:17:12.092 --> 00:17:13.883
is an interesting thing
because it presumes

00:17:13.883 --> 00:17:15.869
you need to be true to
your authentic self,

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.329
but which authentic self?

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:21.810
Your authentic self when
you were 18 months old?

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.894
One of the other stories
is my favorite example

00:17:23.894 --> 00:17:26.537
is my dear friend
Alison Davis-Blake.

00:17:26.537 --> 00:17:28.620
I like to say I knew Alison
Davis-Blake before she

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.520
was hyphenated.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.380
I knew where she Alison Davis
and was probably the world

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.410
shyest doctoral student that you
could ever possibly imagine--

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.180
could hardly speak up in class.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.190
If she spoke up, you would not
know because you couldn't hear.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.835
And she is today dean of the--
she is just stepping down

00:17:46.835 --> 00:17:49.210
as dean of the Ross School at
the University of Michigan.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.020
And she's probably
going to go on

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.210
to be a provost or a
university president,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:56.620
and if you talk to Alison,
she will tell you--

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.470
she's still-- I don't
think she did a personality

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.570
transplant or something.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.380
She's still basically
an introvert.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.270
But she said to be an introvert,
define it, I don't know,

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.570
whatever, to be true that.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.880
She said, I figured
out after a while

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.500
that the behaviors
associated with that label,

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.836
being introverted, was not
very useful for my career.

00:18:16.836 --> 00:18:18.460
I was not going to
be able to be a dean

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.950
or president or an associate
dean or probably even

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.100
a functioning teacher if I was
going to be that shy so nobody

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:25.820
could hear me.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.940
And so I believe, which is one
of the themes of the class I

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.666
teach, is that
human beings-- you

00:18:30.666 --> 00:18:32.040
don't have to
change who you are,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.650
but you need change
your behaviors,

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.440
and we can all learn and
adopt behaviors that make

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.590
us better able to function.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.570
So she's a fabulous
public speaker.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.278
She's obviously been
extremely successful,

00:18:46.278 --> 00:18:48.403
and she will be a provost
or a university president

00:18:48.403 --> 00:18:49.890
of a major university.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:55.220
And if you had known her
in 1986, if you there

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.092
had been a list of
1,000 people who

00:18:57.092 --> 00:18:59.050
was going to be a dean
or university president,

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.591
she would have been
last on the list.

00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:06.510
And this is partly in her
case, saying to herself,

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.360
I will re-invent myself.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.710
I will develop skills and
resilience and toughness

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.104
that I never thought I had.

00:19:16.104 --> 00:19:18.190
And that's just perfect.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.790
KAREN MAY: So the
self evolves, and we

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.670
need to allow space for that.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.560
Many of the examples
in your book

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.900
focus on CEOs kind of the
senior level executive who

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.070
might hypothesize are more
subject to the tension

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.750
in the stakeholder triangle,
if you will, than some others.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.190
But I'm curious because you
spoke mostly about them.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.070
Do you see the same
disconnect kind

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.740
of all levels of
leaders and managers?

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.879
Or does it get worse at top?

00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:51.420
JEFFREY PFEFFER:
Well, no, actually I

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.757
think it's easier at the top
because most people at the top

00:19:54.757 --> 00:19:56.590
are particularly not
at the top because they

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:57.430
are company founders.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.763
But they've worked their way up.

00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:01.150
They've overcome anything
that worries them

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.990
about except their
own careers in case

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.590
you haven't been reading the
newspaper about people who are

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.370
pretty much self interested.

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:15.350
Many of the studies
that I cite are

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.600
studies of people throughout
the career course.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.750
The effect of narcissism
on career success

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.020
has been studied at the
level of presidents,

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.480
but it's also been studied
at the levels of selection

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.960
and to the officer
ranks in the military.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.050
So I think this holds
throughout the career.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.200
And I see you have coming
or somebody told me

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.730
that you have coming my good
friend Adam Galinsky-- "Friend

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:39.610
and Foe."

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.680
And that is a
different kind of issue

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.720
but a another kind of tension
because people are both friends

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.150
and foes in the same time.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.670
In organizational
hierarchies, you

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.070
are both peers and competitors.

00:20:55.364 --> 00:20:57.780
So you have to collaborate and
cooperate at the same time.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.332
That's right.

00:21:00.332 --> 00:21:02.540
You have to look out for
the organization's interest.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.360
To some extent, you have to
look out for your own interests.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.930
My dear friend Joe
Podolny, who works

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.430
for a company you may have
heard of called Apple.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.520
You know, when I wrote
the book before this,

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.200
"Power," he and I met at Apple--
the food's not as good as here.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.190
But in any event, we had
this wonderful discussion

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.230
in which he said, you
basically are telling people

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.445
that they need to take
care of themselves.

00:21:25.445 --> 00:21:27.820
I said, well Joel, you haven't
been at Apple for all that

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.720
long.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.990
But 30 or 40 years ago
in the Silicon Valley

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.660
there became a
mantra, and I don't

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.980
know if this is true of
Google, but I suspect it is,

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.380
and the mantra that came
out of the Silicon Valley

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.710
and still exists
is that we are not

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.300
responsible for your career.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.090
You are responsible
for your career.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.270
We are responsible to
give you interesting jobs.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.140
We are responsible to give
you learning opportunities

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.800
and growth opportunities.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.880
But in most companies, and I
suspect Google's one of them,

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.450
the first things you do when
you either get recruited

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.560
or sign on, you sign
an at-will statement.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.820
We are employed at-will.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.231
We can be fired for good
cause, no cause, any cause.

00:22:04.231 --> 00:22:05.730
By the way, this
is the only country

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.800
in the world that has
at-will employment.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.640
But that's another story.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.340
So I said, for 40 years you and
your colleagues in the Silicon

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.970
Valley have said
to people they are

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.800
responsible for their career.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.390
What I tell people
is when people

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.830
tell you're responsible for your
career, take them seriously.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.170
Believe the message.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.090
Believe the message.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.340
You're responsible for your
career means that then you

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.520
need to take care of yourself.

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:37.155
And you cannot say-- not
that I'm a big Freudian,

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:39.780
but what Freud would say is that
ever since we're expelled from

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.360
our mother's womb, we're looking
for the protective loving

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.160
figure to take care of us.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.510
And it could be some
godlike figure in his book,

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:47.952
"Delusion and
Dream," or it could

00:22:47.952 --> 00:22:50.160
be the big company that is
going to take care of me--

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.659
the company.

00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:52.994
I could lose myself
in the company,

00:22:52.994 --> 00:22:56.360
and the company is going
to look out for me.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.910
Maybe Google does that pretty
well, and they probably do.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:03.610
But most companies don't.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.620
And so you need to
take care of yourself.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.550
You are a fully
functioning adult. Stop

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:15.480
looking for the maternal or
paternal warmth and love.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.280
This is just a
transactional world.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.170
It's kind of a depressing
way to look at it.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.060
But it's on the other
hand, as I tell people,

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.059
I'm depressed when I see
former students of mine

00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:28.150
lose their jobs.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.640
That to me is way
more depressing

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.430
than have them go into where
they are with their eyes open.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:36.050
KAREN MAY: So would your outcome
be that folks reading your book

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.660
would walk away saying, ah,
things are different than I

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:43.040
wish and different than maybe I
thought, and I need to operate

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.120
differently as a result
or that people would say,

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.320
things are different
than I would wish,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.560
and I want to figure out
how to start to change that?

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.820
So I think you've given
advice in your book on both.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:53.736
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Both.

00:23:53.736 --> 00:23:54.470
I would say both.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.187
I would say absolutely both.

00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:58.770
The subtitle of this
book is "Changing

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.050
Workplaces and Careers
One Truth at a Time."

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:05.710
I don't believe we're going
to change the situation that

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.780
exists in the world
without understanding

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.900
the psychological and
sociological dynamics that

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.987
produce this behavior.

00:24:13.987 --> 00:24:15.820
We need to understand
where this comes from.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.653
We have to understand
the rules of the game.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.275
If we want fewer
concussions in professional,

00:24:22.275 --> 00:24:23.845
or for that matter,
amateur football,

00:24:23.845 --> 00:24:25.386
the first thing we
need to understand

00:24:25.386 --> 00:24:27.320
is number one, how many
concussions there are.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.694
And so one of the interesting
things about the leadership

00:24:29.694 --> 00:24:32.160
industry is that there
all these recommendations.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.180
So my favorite
trick for people who

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.820
give these talks which
I hate is to say, OK,

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:41.860
you told me that leaders should
tell the truth or "Leaders Eat

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.160
Last," Simon Sinek's
book, or whatever.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.740
Can you give me an estimate
of what percentage of leaders

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.875
engage in this behavior?

00:24:49.875 --> 00:24:51.750
And, of course, it's
always met with silence.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.239
We have no measures
if base rates.

00:24:54.239 --> 00:24:56.030
So if I said to you,
this is the difference

00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:00.430
between management and medicine
we've known for 400 years

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:06.040
that if I want to
encourage-- if I

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.410
want to produce healthy
outcomes, hygiene is important.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.900
So we know doctors
all wash their hands

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.970
in antiseptic solutions.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.710
And we know that 60% of all SARS
cases during the Sudden Acute

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.470
Respiratory Distress
Syndrome were

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.560
spread through the hands
of health care workers.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.340
So we know.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.929
So here I would say you
measure a base rate.

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:31.720
What percentage of
people wash their hands?

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.180
OK, why do they not
wash their hands?

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.980
Now we could figure
out interventions.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.320
We could measure the effect
of those interventions.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.770
And leadership, I want you
to be authentic or take

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.980
care of others or whatever.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:43.604
What percentage of
people are doing it?

00:25:43.604 --> 00:25:44.392
I'm clueless.

00:25:44.392 --> 00:25:46.350
What are interventions
that will cause a higher

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.600
percentage of people to do it?

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.224
I'm clueless because
I haven't measured

00:25:49.224 --> 00:25:50.700
how many people are doing it.

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.840
How can we possibly get any--
there is no theory, science,

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.840
or logic that would suggest that
is a situation in which things

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.850
are going to improve.

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.639
In order to improve, I have
to know where they are.

00:26:01.639 --> 00:26:03.930
I have to try different
experiments, which is something

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.800
that Google does-- good--
which is wonderful.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.210
But do experiments just as
you would run experiments

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.940
on your website or on search
engines or search results,

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.630
you run experiments
with this as well,

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.632
and how are we doing, and
are things getting better,

00:26:16.632 --> 00:26:17.840
or are we not getting better?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.631
And if they're not
getting better, why not?

00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:21.320
And that's the only way.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.330
This idea that things
are going to get better

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:27.590
by telling ourselves our version
of your favorite fairytale,

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.090
I just don't see any evidence.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.520
There's not a scintilla of that.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.020
Nor is there any
logic that suggests

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.400
that would make it any better.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.610
So on the one hand,
I think we ought

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.160
to try to make
things better, and we

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.442
ought to create a
healthier, better world.

00:26:39.442 --> 00:26:41.400
The book that I'm currently
writing-- actually,

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.230
I'm writing two books, but I
can hardly write one anymore

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.310
because we just
bought a new house,

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:51.300
and my wife has assigned
me the job of fixing it up,

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.475
which is interesting in
any event, but it's fine.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.460
The book that I'm
writing-- the book

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.360
is mostly finished in which I
hope to finish reasonably soon.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.320
The working title is "Dying for
a Paycheck," and two colleagues

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:12.430
who are much smarter
mathematically than I.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:14.280
They are operations
research people.

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.390
They built this wonderful model
based upon epidemiological data

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:23.640
and a meta-analysis we did
based upon survey data,

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.760
which tries to estimate
incidence of this is.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.940
Our estimate is 120,000
excess deaths a year

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.020
in the United States
from workplace stress,

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.770
which by the way, would
make the workplace

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.860
the fifth leading cause of
death behind heart disease

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:38.220
and cancer, but ahead of
Alzheimer's and diabetes.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.510
It's horrible.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.360
We literally have
toxic workplaces,

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.094
and we ought to do
something about that.

00:27:44.094 --> 00:27:46.010
But if we're going to
do something about that,

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.650
we also need to understand.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.230
I see all these pieces as
being part of the same--

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.820
KAREN MAY: Fitting together.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.236
JEFFREY PFEFFER:
Fitting together.

00:27:53.236 --> 00:27:55.470
KAREN MAY: You make
a case, as you just

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.919
did here, that before--
so there is a ray of hope.

00:27:58.919 --> 00:28:00.460
We could potentially
fix the problem,

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.550
but before we can
fix the problem,

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.635
we have to understand
the problem.

00:28:02.635 --> 00:28:02.920
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Of course.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.830
KAREN MAY: To
understand the problem,

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.970
we have to apply what
we know about science

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:10.360
and measurement to leadership
and management, which luckily

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.230
is something many
of us value here.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.150
We have a bunch of
real scientists here.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.480
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Of course.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.520
Not every place is like Google.

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.240
KAREN MAY: I am
curious where you

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.670
see people doing
the science well

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.630
and what we might be
able to learn from,

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.630
and you mentioned a couple of
examples in the book of places

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.060
where people incorporate
what we know about behavior

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.340
change, the science
of behavior change,

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.220
into practice where we're asking
people to set specific goals

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.850
and give them feedback
on those goals,

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.550
and I think there
are a few examples.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.900
What kinds of things
would you leave us

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.250
with as either people or
institutions that are really

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:56.590
doing good science in our arena,
even if they are the minority?

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.350
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Well, I don't
know that many besides Google.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:03.520
I'm not sure-- Google and
SAS Institute and probably

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.160
a relatively small number
of other places because part

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.290
of what I think distinguishes
good leaders, good managers,

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.380
good people is an
intellectual curiosity.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:22.570
And one of the striking things
about life-- I have a colleague

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.300
named Dennis Tourish,
who some years ago did

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.910
a survey-- he's a
Scottish professor.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:34.040
And he did a survey in which
he asked Scottish executives

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.014
not what books were they
reading, but had they read any.

00:29:38.014 --> 00:29:39.430
And the answer
would astonish you.

00:29:43.254 --> 00:29:45.670
First of all, we live in a
country where 25% of the people

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.420
don't believe in evolution.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:48.970
And that's a true figure.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.810
So it should not astonish
you that we do not

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:53.960
have a lot of
people-- we don't have

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.800
a lot of companies
doing what you're doing,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.230
which is having book talks.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.030
We don't have a lot
of senior leaders

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.510
who have any intellectual
curiosity at all

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.629
like how things work.

00:30:03.629 --> 00:30:05.420
One of the things I
love about Gary Loveman

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.660
is he would say,
OK, you know, I want

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.600
to teach by people how to think.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.970
So if people are aren't
doing-- if we're not

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.770
getting a large share of
their gaming dollar, why not?

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:17.440
Why are they choosing
the competitors?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.610
So you ask a series of
analytical questions,

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:21.890
and if the questions
are asked, well, you

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.157
can figure out eventually
how to get the data

00:30:24.157 --> 00:30:24.990
and do the analysis.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.720
But if you don't start
with the questions,

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.094
you're not going
to get anywhere.

00:30:28.094 --> 00:30:31.820
And so I don't see
the typical CEO--

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.340
so I'll tell a story on one
of your semi-competitors.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.780
I have a dear friend named Roger
Martin who just stepped down

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:44.280
as the dean of the Rotman
University of Toronto Business

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.510
School.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.510
So Roger and I were
together at a conference,

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.320
and we were talking
about life and things,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.770
and we exchanged
emails, and he said

00:30:53.770 --> 00:31:00.190
it's amazing how there is this
idea that if you're a CEO,

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:04.230
any word that comes out
of your mouth is correct.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.110
So he said, there's been a big
controversy, as many of you

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.750
know, about whether
or not there's

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:14.840
a real shortage of engineers
and technical employees or not.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.840
And he's been very active in
Toronto doing a strategic plan

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.020
for the province of Ontario,
and he's been very involved

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.330
with Statistics Canada.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.600
And he engaged in
exchange with Microsoft

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.630
about the issue of how
many engineers there were

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:30.800
and the number of engineers.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.591
And he has a thing
which he forwarded to me

00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:34.810
for the Microsoft PR
department that basically

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:40.610
said, if Bill Gates said
it, it's true-- literally,

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:41.360
it's true.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.600
There's no evidence.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.062
The statistics from Canada,
at least for the providence

00:31:46.062 --> 00:31:48.020
of Ontario which is where
the debate was about,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.010
suggested it was completely
made it up says it must be true.

00:31:54.583 --> 00:31:59.240
So we live in a world in
which the CEOs make stuff up.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.810
And we have a presidential
candidate who makes stuff up.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:03.801
Immigrants cause crime.

00:32:03.801 --> 00:32:04.550
How do we know it?

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.180
Because it came out of
Donald Trump's mouth.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:07.680
There's not a
scintilla of evidence

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.720
for this-- any studies of this
or proportions of immigrants--

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.620
proportions of that.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.050
I wrote the bestselling
business book of all time.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.780
No, but it doesn't matter.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.070
If you say it and say it
with enough conviction,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.050
it becomes true.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:25.430
In this kind of world,
we need science,

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:27.400
but it's not very prevalent.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.730
I'm sure you saw that when you
were in Terra Nova Consulting

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.120
and had to do--

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.220
KAREN MAY: It's true.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.630
JEFFREY PFEFFER: So how did
you go about changing it?

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.825
KAREN MAY: Well,
first, Jeff said

00:32:38.825 --> 00:32:41.200
is it OK if I ask you a couple
of questions, which it is,

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.369
but start thinking of your
questions because in a minute,

00:32:44.369 --> 00:32:46.910
Cliff is ready with the mic,
and we'll hear from some of you.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:47.830
How did I go about changing it?

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.890
I can't take responsibility
for changing it,

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.680
but I did join a place
that really values science.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.870
And I think at
Google because we are

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.060
an engineering-led
organization, and we

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.520
value making decisions
objectively, if you

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.540
don't have the data,
it doesn't matter

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:10.020
how compelling the case is.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.612
What matters is that
you are informed.

00:33:11.612 --> 00:33:13.320
And one of the things
that I've seen here

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.140
that I saw much less often when
I was an external consultant

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.240
is that our leaders
will change their minds

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.860
in the face of data.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.262
And that is something that you
don't always see elsewhere.

00:33:26.262 --> 00:33:27.220
You don't see the data.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.386
You don't see it presenting.

00:33:28.386 --> 00:33:30.100
You don't see people
change their minds.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.645
And I think teaching
people here as we often do,

00:33:33.645 --> 00:33:36.100
and these folks in the room
will help teach people--

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.210
teaching people to use data
to help influence decision

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.650
making is a critical capacity
and capability to teach,

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:45.902
absolutely.

00:33:45.902 --> 00:33:46.610
Questions, folks?

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.854
Cliff is there with the
mic if you have one.

00:33:48.854 --> 00:33:50.770
AUDIENCE: There's a lot
of stuff at the moment

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.400
about self-management.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.370
So get rid of managers,
get rid of leaders--

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.920
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Holacracy?

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.670
AUDIENCE: So do you
believe in that, then?

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.230
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Do I
believe in holacracy?

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:08.310
The evidence suggests
over years and decades

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.820
that-- people have been talking
about the end of hierarchy

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.659
for probably 70 years.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.239
And there are a
little experiments.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.540
I actually don't believe
Zappos is such an experiment.

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.110
As I have pointed out to several
reporters, everything I say,

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:27.110
of course, gets me into
trouble, which is fine.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.779
The idea that holacracy
is imposed from on top

00:34:30.779 --> 00:34:32.820
and that anybody who
doesn't agree with holocracy

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.679
should leave is a contradiction
in the idea of self-management,

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.960
but whatever.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.909
But Ricardo Semler
in Brazil has this.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:48.130
I think there are cooperative
forms of organization that

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.510
work-- Mondragon in
Spain, which I actually

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:53.260
visited some years ago.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:59.340
The John Edwards Cooperative
in the United Kingdom.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.270
There are certainly
self-governing, semi-democratic

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.830
forms of organizations,
which include basically

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.200
every law partnership, most
of the public accounting

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.470
partnerships, many
management consulting firm

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:16.180
partnerships where
they elect the CEO,

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.960
but the CEOs are elected
at least by the partners.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.827
So that is a form
of self-governance

00:35:22.827 --> 00:35:23.660
and self-management.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:31.210
But if you read Herbert
Simon who was deceased,

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.340
his book or the
article that was based

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.440
on the book, "The
Architecture of Complexity."

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.780
Hierarchy is pervasive
in the natural world.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.940
You see hierarchy
in schools of fish.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.380
You see hierarchy even in
apparently even organisms

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.160
more simple than
schools of fish.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.960
Hierarchy is
relatively pervasive,

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.915
and I see, again,
many of my students,

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:53.720
who are now ex-students,
come into companies

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.640
and they say, well,
we're not political here.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.010
Everybody's equal.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.955
That's probably not true.

00:36:00.955 --> 00:36:02.510
There is one CEO.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.560
There is one school
superintendent,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:09.220
and in 2018 there is going to
be a new governor of California.

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:13.520
I don't see much evidence
that non-hierarchical systems

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.370
do very well because in almost
any size and complexity,

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.090
hierarchy emerges
almost naturally.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.530
And my colleague,
Larissa Tiedens,

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.330
did some studies that show
that when you give people

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.420
a choice of how they want to
organize-- when you tell them

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.220
they have to accomplish a
task, they organize voluntarily

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.700
into an hierarchical
arrangement.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.520
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about how leadership

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.930
is informed by
multicultural companies,

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.680
and you mentioned that
10% to 20% of students

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.647
may get laid off within
the first two years.

00:36:46.647 --> 00:36:48.355
JEFFREY PFEFFER: They
don't get laid off.

00:36:48.355 --> 00:36:48.610
They get fired.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.050
AUDIENCE: All right,
they get fired.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.050
JEFFREY PFEFFER: We need
to be clear about that.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:53.820
AUDIENCE: OK, so can you
comment whether you speculate

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.209
that's because they go into
a multicultural company--

00:36:56.209 --> 00:36:58.125
that they had to figure
out different cultures

00:36:58.125 --> 00:36:58.791
because of that?

00:37:00.604 --> 00:37:01.770
JEFFREY PFEFFER: It happens.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.510
I'll tell you a
story, which is going

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.010
to sound so weird that you're
going to believe it's made up,

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:06.980
but it's not.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.670
I have a woman,
a former student,

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.805
who is actually a
little even older,

00:37:10.805 --> 00:37:14.250
calls me on the phone one
day, and she's in tears

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.260
because she needs to work.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.660
And she needs a
job, and so she has

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.640
been at a company, a high-tech
company, and obviously,

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.355
not this company, and she
is-- so what's the problem?

00:37:27.355 --> 00:37:29.129
She's about to be fired, why?

00:37:29.129 --> 00:37:30.920
Because she has gone
into the organization,

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.670
and the organization said,
we are an organization

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.320
that believes in
openness and transparency

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.780
and continuous improvement,
and therefore you

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:43.389
should tell everybody
at all moments

00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:45.180
kind of what we do in
our class at Stanford

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.580
called touchy feely--
interpersonal dynamics.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.250
We got to share your feelings
and share your honest feedback

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:50.930
with them.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.694
And you in particular
ought to tell people

00:37:52.694 --> 00:37:54.110
what you think
they're doing right

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:55.850
and what they think
they're doing wrong,

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.560
and she shared her
honest feedback.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.246
She had a boss.

00:37:58.246 --> 00:38:00.662
She didn't think the boss was
very good, which is probably

00:38:00.662 --> 00:38:03.560
true, and she told the boss.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.520
Her career is over.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.249
And I said, now how--
this woman is smart enough

00:38:07.249 --> 00:38:08.790
to get into Stanford
Business School.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.240
She's actually
smart, very smart.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.020
Smart but not wise.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:18.140
I said what possessed you?

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.460
What momentary, whatever,
what is it demonic

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.550
possession or something?

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:25.790
She said, no, the
organization said number one,

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:27.300
we want to be
continuously getting

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.710
better-- sounds reasonable.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.220
And the best way to get
continuously getting better

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.550
is to provide people with open
and honest feedback on how

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:40.080
they're doing, which is by the
way, also factually correct.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.150
So I said, they told me
they want to get better.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.350
This makes sense that
I'm going to give people

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:48.510
constructive feedback in
a constructive fashion

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.120
so they can improve
their performance.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.360
So I believed them, and
I said to her, I said,

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.080
did you ask-- did you do any
diligence on these statements

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.980
like what happened
to the last person

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.330
who gave constructive feedback,
and where are they now?

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.280
So one of the jokes
that I sometimes make

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.060
is if I sat up here,
and I said, I've

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.610
discovered the cure for
cancer, and I will sell it

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.096
to you or to Google for $500
million, which by the way,

00:39:17.096 --> 00:39:18.595
had I discovered
the cure for cancer

00:39:18.595 --> 00:39:21.080
would be the biggest bargain
in the history of life.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.496
How many of you
are going to write

00:39:22.496 --> 00:39:24.179
me a check for $500 million?

00:39:24.179 --> 00:39:25.720
And the answer is
nobody, because you

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.370
will do due diligence.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.400
You will say, if I
have a technology that

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.719
is going to provide some medical
benefit or for that matter,

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:36.010
any contact with a benefit,
we will use medical benefit

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.630
for the moment, you will
do sufficient due diligence

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.490
to understand is
the technology real?

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:42.280
Are there patents?

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.820
Is there intellectual property?

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:45.560
Does it work?

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.370
But when we come-- when we see
these leaders write the books

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.220
or give the talks or whatever--
we believe it uncritically.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:59.150
We don't even spend a nanosecond
of doing due diligence.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.650
It's true.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:00.816
What happened to the people?

00:40:00.816 --> 00:40:02.460
Are they living their beliefs?

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.670
You know, I have friends--
one of friends stimulating

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:09.130
me to write this book who talks
about himself as a leader.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.720
My god, all you have to
do is go to the city where

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.220
he spends a good
portion of his time

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.940
when he's not lecturing at
Stanford and do a search--

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.570
public records-- public records.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:24.678
You can see the suits
by his partners.

00:40:24.678 --> 00:40:28.430
In 30 minutes, you can-- why.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:35.520
So one of my recommendations
is don't believe--

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:38.279
trust but verify or something.

00:40:38.279 --> 00:40:39.070
Get a hold of data.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.330
When people tell you a story,
find out whether it's true.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.784
Volkswagen had a story that
turned out not to be true.

00:40:46.784 --> 00:40:48.700
You have a diesel car
with great gas mileage--

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.330
I don't think so-- and meet the
emissions standards, maybe not.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.990
So we need to verify
what we are told,

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.660
and I think that is the first
and most important thing is

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:04.500
just ask what's
real and what isn't

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.640
KAREN MAY: So there's
some coping strategies

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.790
for dealing in today's
real world while

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:13.360
at the same time getting the
base rate measurement that it

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.190
will enable us to affect
change systematically using

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.315
good scientific principles.

00:41:17.315 --> 00:41:19.856
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Yeah, one of
things that also drives me nuts

00:41:19.856 --> 00:41:22.100
is how we evaluate leadership
development activities.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.230
So the leadership development
industry is this huge industry.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.146
People go to these
conferences, and at the end

00:41:26.146 --> 00:41:28.110
of the conference, you
fill out a happy sheet.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.510
You know, did you
have a good time?

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:31.510
Were the doughnuts good?

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:33.780
Or whatever-- it's interesting.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:37.874
And we know that for four
decades ago in the early 1970s

00:41:37.874 --> 00:41:39.540
was to the best of
my ability to discern

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.300
it the first study of the
relationship between instructor

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.935
ratings and objective
measures of learning.

00:41:45.935 --> 00:41:48.060
So it was a calculus class,
a big state university,

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.910
you know , a big calculus class
where in the olden days before

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.700
the invention of technology--
these enormous tiered

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:59.045
classrooms, and they heard
a professor lecture about

00:41:59.045 --> 00:42:01.170
calculus, and then they
put everybody in discussion

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:01.880
sections.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.090
At the end of the semester,
everybody took the same test.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.590
They were randomly assigned
essentially to sections.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.000
So here's the perfect thing.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.791
You're going to ask to
what extent is there

00:42:10.791 --> 00:42:14.760
a correlation between
teacher ratings,

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.690
the core section ratings, and
objective measures of learning.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:18.630
The answer is zero.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.881
And that's 40 years of
research has demonstrated that.

00:42:20.881 --> 00:42:22.921
It's no different than
the leadership development

00:42:22.921 --> 00:42:23.520
industry.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.880
We are rewarding entertainment.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.140
We're getting entertainment.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.860
And that's another reason why
there's absolutely no progress.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.450
So one of my favorite stories
of in this book-- somebody

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.010
who was considering
me for a talk.

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.910
They chose somebody else.

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:37.570
So I said, you know, it's fine.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:40.854
Actually, many times this
woman called me and told me

00:42:40.854 --> 00:42:42.020
that they haven't chosen me.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.690
I said, can you explain to
me the selection criteria.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:45.730
She said, yeah.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.610
She said, we picked somebody
else, and gave me the name,

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:52.420
because he's better looking,
and by they way on the web,

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.562
he is better looking.

00:42:53.562 --> 00:42:54.562
I'd have picked him too.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.060
But think about this.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.612
The next time you go
look at the conference

00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:03.320
and who is big on the
conference circuit?

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.400
People who have compelling,
interesting stories.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.420
Do they know anything?

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.950
Absolutely not.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:08.950
KAREN MAY: Or maybe not.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:09.999
We don't know.

00:43:09.999 --> 00:43:11.290
Because we're not measuring it.

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:11.700
We don't know.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:12.610
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Yes,
we don't even know.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:13.480
KAREN MAY: OK, Debbie.

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:14.330
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.160
Another lens that we try to look
at leadership through at Google

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:19.650
is the lens of diversity
and asking our leaders

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.150
to be inclusive leaders.

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.260
And we're really trying
to get that right.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.290
Are there any hard truths about
that we should understand?

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:29.221
Or what do you think?

00:43:29.221 --> 00:43:31.220
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Well,
not beyond the hard truth

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.720
that you probably
already know which

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:39.380
is that people love people
who remind them of themselves.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.234
It's short.

00:43:40.234 --> 00:43:41.400
I love the "New York Times."

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.130
Their science
fiction is fabulous.

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:46.790
So some years ago, a
guy named Benedict Carey

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.770
wrote a nice article
called, "You Remind Me

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.490
of Me," which of course,
reminds us of the fact

00:43:52.490 --> 00:44:00.350
that we love people who look
like us, sound like us--

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.210
this is about
behavioral imitation.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.180
So one of things I actually
talked about this morning

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.080
in executive education class
I was talking out at Stanford.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.860
And a woman raised her
hand, and she said,

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.710
what is your recommendation?

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.910
My recommendation is if
behavior limitation works,

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.760
and there's no evidence
that it doesn't, then

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.690
you ought to imitate.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.240
You don't have to get
a sex change operation,

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:27.490
but you can imitate gestures.

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:29.069
You can imitate intonation.

00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.610
I don't know.

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.300
I'm sure some
people in this room

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.970
have seen Amy JC Cuddy's
TED talk on power posing.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:36.960
Absolutely.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.310
So you can do things and use
dialect or inflection or words

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:42.380
or gestures.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.100
Whatever.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.410
That, by the way, cuts
across race or gender.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:47.690
You can use
behavioral limitation

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.860
so that even though I don't
look like you or you don't look

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.570
like me or we don't
like each other,

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:56.046
you can look in a sense
of the use of language,

00:44:56.046 --> 00:44:57.420
in the sense of
some other stuff.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.500
So you can take the fact that
we understand similarities,

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:04.350
the basis of interpersonal
attraction, and use that.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:08.800
And I've seen some women
in particular or people

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.710
of color do, which is to
remind the people that they're

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:14.430
interacting with what
they have in common.

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.622
So I may be different,
but there are many things

00:45:17.622 --> 00:45:18.580
that we have in common.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.000
We work in the
same organization.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.090
We went to the same university.

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:23.550
We're stuck on
the same airplane,

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:26.550
which is going
nowhere or whatever

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.740
this is that we have in common.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.340
So you can find those things.

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.630
KAREN MAY: That's an
interesting example

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:38.060
of how I see you over and over
and over take the research--

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.120
social psychology in this
case, and in many cases

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.780
take the social
psychology research

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.970
and say, if this is true,
then how do we create a better

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.794
world around that, and how
do we operate realistically

00:45:49.794 --> 00:45:50.960
in the world we're in today.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.200
And I think those are the two--
one of the many tensions you

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.740
create in your book
is how do we hold true

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.820
the operate effectively in
the world in which we are

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:01.730
functioning and
at the same time,

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:04.580
work to make it a world in which
we'd like to be functioning,

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:07.790
and that's the hope and
fear aspects of your book.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:10.780
I think Debbie-- and it's
interesting to think about

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:14.329
to your question how we can
help leaders be the ones

00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:15.870
to find the thing
they have in common

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:20.220
and take the onus off of people
who want to be seen for all

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.710
they have to contribute as
having to also then build

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:26.910
that connection but have
leaders really looking for that.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:31.050
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned about
people dying from workplace

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.240
stress, and I just read
about a company that

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.520
instituted a five-hour workday.

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.420
So I'm wondering
how do you balance

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.300
not enforcing a
five-hour workday,

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.970
but saying please take
one, and then not having

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:47.030
the social pressure of people
wanting to show leadership

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:51.410
by then not abiding by
a five-hour workday?

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:53.940
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Well, work
hours is one source of problem,

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:56.260
but the biggest
source of workplace--

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.619
there are two sources--
so work hours is obviously

00:46:59.619 --> 00:47:01.910
a source of workplace stress
particularly to the extent

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:05.174
that it entails and engages
work/family conflict.

00:47:05.174 --> 00:47:06.965
But the biggest sources
of workplace stress

00:47:06.965 --> 00:47:10.830
are number one,
economic insecurity.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:15.410
So people with
families and mortgages

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:19.140
have economic obligations
that don't come and go.

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:22.387
And there are many places--
our friend down the road at HP,

00:47:22.387 --> 00:47:23.970
which is as near as
I could determine,

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:24.980
could only do layoffs.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.400
I believe that's what
they manufacture today.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.480
Somebody said,
what does HP make?

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.380
I said, they make layoffs
on a regular basis.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:34.100
It's not really a joking matter.

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.290
There's a lot of
epidemiological literature

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:40.530
on the harmful health
effects of being laid off.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.900
Economic insecurity
is an enormous source

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.980
of stress in today's
economy where

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:48.490
you have people in the so-called
freelancer, gig economy.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.080
You have companies--
Caterpillar, HP,

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.705
which we made a joke about, and
the companies are laying people

00:47:53.705 --> 00:47:54.413
off all the time.

00:47:54.413 --> 00:47:57.940
That's an enormous source
of workplace stress.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.580
A second source of
workplace stress

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.680
is an absence of job control.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.820
So the question isn't
how hard you work.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.820
The question is-- do
you have any discretion?

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.931
So if I give you a task to do,
it could be a challenging task.

00:48:09.931 --> 00:48:11.930
But if you have some
discretion on the resources

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.470
that you muster and when
you do it and how you do it,

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:17.360
that's much less stressful
than saying to you, by the way,

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.000
I need the report by noon.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.450
It's now 10:00 in the morning.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:23.120
Oh, never mind, I need a
different report by noon.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.820
Oh, never mind,
I need you to go.

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.975
So I have a friend that
works for a company that

00:48:26.975 --> 00:48:28.030
shall remain nameless.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:32.040
But it's not going to remain
nameless in the "Dying

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:34.950
for a Paycheck" book.

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:39.419
We're supposed to go out
with Sootha and Sima.

00:48:39.419 --> 00:48:41.460
The joke is they are the
Indian children we never

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.250
had because we don't
have any children.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.250
But we love them like
children, and they love us

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:50.190
like parents or something
or like friends.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:54.280
And Sima, who works for some
very fancy Bay Area company.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.789
Sootha emails me
Saturday morning.

00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:57.830
This is Saturday morning.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:00.110
We're going to see them
Saturday night to go to the Mars

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:01.117
in San Francisco dinner.

00:49:01.117 --> 00:49:01.950
It rains beforehand.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.620
What should we do?

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.654
Sima has been caught told this
morning to get on a plane.

00:49:11.654 --> 00:49:13.570
By the way, she's also
seven months pregnant--

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:17.810
to get on a plane, be
in Europe on Sunday

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:22.600
to do a sales and marketing
meeting on Monday.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.546
No control.

00:49:23.546 --> 00:49:24.900
That's stressful.

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.880
Not we're going to give
you five-weeks notice.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.240
Not we're going to ask what
is your preference to get

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.370
the work done that we have.

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:35.290
You're a marketing
executive in this company,

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:36.937
but there is some
responsibilities.

00:49:36.937 --> 00:49:38.770
You don't want to go
on maternity leave yet.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.010
That's fine.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:44.230
Here are some stuff you need to
get accomplished and figure out

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.800
how to do it.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.716
That's very different.

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:48.135
By the way, she has an MBA
from Harvard-- smart woman,

00:49:48.135 --> 00:49:51.700
even though it's from
Harvard, it's fine.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.860
It's very different than
saying, I am your boss.

00:49:54.860 --> 00:50:00.760
Get your ass on an airplane
tonight-- very different.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.010
That's stressful.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.710
That is I have no
control over my life.

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.860
Someone at any moment
could have me doing stuff.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.520
Not, I got a set of jobs
and a task to accomplish.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.125
This is, go here,
go here, go there,

00:50:13.125 --> 00:50:15.420
do that-- not a good thing.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:19.100
The third source of stress--
this is also controllable

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.910
and prior to the passage
of the Affordable Care Act,

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:24.520
and actually, post the passage
of the Affordable Care Act,

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.486
which not very affordable,
the third source of stress

00:50:26.486 --> 00:50:27.980
is that many people
in this country

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.601
do not have access to decent
medical care because of health

00:50:31.601 --> 00:50:32.100
insurance.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.990
Even company-provided health
insurance, many people

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:39.400
aren't covered, and the co-pays
have gone up, blah de blah.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.950
So I know people
stressed out about how

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:46.180
do I care for
myself and my family

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:49.280
with health issues and
all that kind of stuff.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.260
So there are many dimensions of
stress besides the work hours.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.920
And the work hours, you
know, my friend Jim Goodnight

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.740
at SAS Institute would say,
my job as the leader of SAS

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:02.160
is to try to get all the
unnecessary stuff out

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.160
of your life so that if you
actually work 40 hours a week,

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.680
you work 30 hours more than
you're currently working

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.540
on productive stuff
as opposed to dealing

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:15.470
with the bureaucracy
and the useless meetings

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:18.560
and the stresses--
the wonderful thing

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.800
that we've done in
benefits administration,

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.930
hopefully not at
Google, but who knows,

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.970
where we've said everybody needs
to be an expert on everything.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:27.230
So we're going to have
self-directed retirement

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.729
accounts.

00:51:27.729 --> 00:51:31.460
We're going to have
self-directed medical stuff.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.430
Everybody's responsible
for everything.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:35.390
So everybody has to
become an expert.

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.807
I wrote a column about this when
"Business 2.0" was still alive,

00:51:38.807 --> 00:51:40.890
so this is more than a
decade ago in which I said,

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.370
what happened to Adam
Smith and the idea

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:45.380
of the division of labor?

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.830
That a sensible thing
to do would be to say,

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:50.870
I'm not going to make everybody,
particularly people not as

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:53.030
educated as the people
in this room, experts

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:56.000
on financial planning
and financial investments

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.490
and, you know, and
certainly what I'd

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:02.730
do in my own medical care.

00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:05.740
My expert advice is don't get
old, nothing good comes of it.

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.847
But what I do it with respect to
my medical care is I spend not

00:52:08.847 --> 00:52:13.060
a minute becoming an expert on
whatever my current malady is .

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:17.180
I spend a lot of time
figuring out who is.

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.600
So when I had spine
surgery two years ago,

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.780
I'm not going to tell him
how to do the surgery.

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.570
But I am going to make sure
that I found absolutely the best

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:25.970
person to do this.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:29.470
So if anybody needs spine
surgery, I can give you a clue.

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:33.810
KAREN MAY: So we've had a teaser
into your next book as well.

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.060
JEFFREY PFEFFER: There you go.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.100
KAREN MAY: I'm
conscious many of you

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:37.230
are going to rush to
two o'clock meetings,

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.630
and I'm going to stop us
now so that those of you who

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:42.390
didn't get a signed book
beforehand and want to

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:44.750
can get one now at
the back of the room.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:46.820
And thank you so
much, and primarily

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:48.820
Jeff, thank you so much
for being with us today.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:49.120
JEFFREY PFEFFER: Thank you.

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:49.420
It was a pleasure meeting you.

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:49.720
Thank you.

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.511
KAREN MAY: And you.

00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:53.370
