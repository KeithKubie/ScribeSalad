00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
Guys look at that. That is absolutely crazy. What's up my friends welcome back today. We are outside

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.960
There's a clear sky, not a cloud in sight

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.800
The sun is beating down so we got out the solar scorcher because they jump down to the comments

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.780
And I found this one from Christie land

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.049
Sue who says can you cast metals with the solar scorcher?

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.539
So we're putting this to the test because there's no better opportunity to do this than today now for our metal melting experiments today

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.949
I got three different types of metals

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.459
I thought we could work with the first one is pewter you might remember the pewter from the video

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.060
I do with Collins key where we melt it down with a blowtorch and tried making fidgets spinners

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.430
I've also got one of the aluminum muffins that we got from melting down Pop cans in the backyard Metal foundry as well as one

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.469
Of these little brass ingots I made from melting Bullet shells

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.790
now the melting point of these metals is very very different. The pewter for example Melts at

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.789
250 degrees Celsius, the aluminum melts around 660 degrees Celsius, and the brass melts somewhere between

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.349
900 to 950 Celsius and I did that in celcius for my international fans

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.690
So let me know if you appreciate that so to get started

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.599
I'm going to take this solid pewter fidgets spinner that I made with Collins

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
We're going to direct the sunlight at it and see just how long it takes to get this thing liquefying if at all

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.479
Now some of you guys remember the solar scorcher. This is a lens that came off from a giant TV

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.599
And it basically acts as a giant magnifying glass and directs the light into a super hot laser beam which converges somewhere around here

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.009
We try shooting a little mist of water that we can actually see the exact focal point now

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.029
It's really interesting about this is I can actually hold my finger within an inch of that beam and not feel anything

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.890
But if anything crosses into it

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.579
It instantly burns into flames because that focal point is over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit which should be enough to melt metal how crazy is that?

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.379
Alright guys, so now that we know exactly where that focal point is let's go ahead and take one of our metal

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.369
Let's start with pewter and just slowly dip it into that solar laser beam and observe what happens

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.369
Alright, so there's our laser beam right there

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.399
We light it up. You can see

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.180
Just stick down here

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.899
It's thin right there and right about there's where we want to put our middle

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.110
Now watch your eyes because this is going to get bright here. We go

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.850
Dang, I can't even look at that

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.759
Trying to find that laser beam again. I looks like we're still in it. I

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.809
can actually see part of the metal starting to go molt in there if you look at the bottom you can actually see it shimmering

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.769
Shining splendid just got to keep that focus. Oh

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.979
wow, so piece of metal just dripped off on the concrete there and spattered

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.519
 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.140
Guys look at that. That is absolutely crazy like just sticking this thing in the sunlight

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.120
And it started melting off, and it's on my sidewalk look at that your splatters and drips all over my sidewalk

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.430
Yeah, look at that. Just within seconds or in seconds

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.370
It totally starts liquefying at the top that's going to drip right down on my sidewalk

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.530
crazy

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.640
Alright, so apparently this thing will take down pewter without any problem at all

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.440
I think what we're going to do is take all of our pewter spinners and remelt them into a pewter ingot using a muffin tray

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.820
Okay, so here's what I've done guys. I've taken a board and set it across the solar scorcher here

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.839
I've got the pewter spinners inside of a muffin tray and when I set those on top

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.549
It should be in the exact focal point of our ray of sun this way I can keep them stationary I can keep them static

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.099
So the sunlight can do its full potential without me jiggling around in the focal point. See if it works

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.829
Alright, it looks like right about here

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.739
And there we go pewter away

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.130
power of the Sun do your stuff

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.170
Looks like that should be right about the perfect focal point look at that within seconds

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.170
You can actually see

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.500
The metal is boiling bubbling on top and I could stick my finger here and not get burned and yet its melting metal

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.670
less than an inch away

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.560
That is nuts

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.560
melting metal with sunlight guys

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.840
And not only that it's happening fast

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.709
Look at that. She's dripping away like nothing

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.089
This is a hundred percent solar energy. There's nothing else going on here

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.720
You can see the pool of liquid metal down at the bottom there

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.360
It's actually taking that down so fast I'm tempted to put another piece of pewter in there just to make a proper ingot

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.710
I'm going to add this little bit of pewter that we didn't finish up at Collins house

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.559
I'm going to put it into this mix so that we have one full ingot

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.360
I want you to see the power of this thing because if the sunlight melts this we're talking about the same power as my map

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.489
Gas torch so it was taken that down with that super hot flame which is absolutely incredible when you consider

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.559
There's no fuel source here except for the sun

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.209
There look at that. You can see exactly where the sun's hitting it and it just started melting

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.929
We are melting metal with the sun

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.120
So cool

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.570
He's got to keep it in that focal point for maximum heat

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.580
But it's keeping the whole thing liquid if you look down the bottom there. It's still whole Molten pool of pewter

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160
It's working

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.890
In fact I can just throw that whole thing in there now. Just like an ice cube melting into a pewter pool

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.709
Everywhere I put that solar beam you can just see if I move that around a little bit it can actually direct where it starts

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.130
melting

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.999
Right over here a little bit boom

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.240
Look at that

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.120
That is a beautiful thing that

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.910
Thing is almost completely melted

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.559
But that is ripping hot you can see that's totally molten

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.700
Yep, there's nothing solid in there whatsoever

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.180
It's completely liquefied

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.380
So just skim some of that slag off the top and let it cool down

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.770
boom Molten pewter from the Sun

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.399
So what I'm curious about now is the sunlight will take down pewter so quickly. How will it react to aluminum? That's coming next

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.759
So quick update' guys. I'm a little bit discouraged by these results

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.749
I was really really hoping that sunlight would melt aluminium, but we've sat here for the last 20 minutes

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.679
And we've concentrated the sunlight on it. You can see that nothing has really happened

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:08.509
I'm sure this ingot is extremely hot right now, but it hasn't in any way liquefied

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.379
And I'm not sure how long it would take to do that

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.219
Now on the other hand you can see the pewter has completely solidified

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.319
And we could turn that upside down knock it out and have ourselves well petering it, but as far as the aluminum

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:21.229
I'm almost ready to give up if we can't melt aluminium

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.969
I know we won't melt brass now to be fair this doesn't get hot enough to melt those metals

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.880
It's just the quantity of the metal. We're trying to melt in this case

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.289
We've got quite a bit of math and even though this one little point in the middle is actually hitting somewhere around

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.139
2,000 Fahrenheit the whole block itself

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:41.568
Doesn't rise in temperature enough for the metal to melt and if aluminium is not going to melt Copper has absolutely no chance

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.189
I'm sure this thing is ridiculously hot right now listen to how it sounds and I for a little water on it

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.760
Dang

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.350
that was

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.510
extreme in fact that was so hot it looks like it was nearly ready to melt and

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.739
perhaps if we let it fit out for another 10 or 15 minutes it would have but

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.260
It's obviously not very practical method for melting metal all right. Let's check out the pewter can we knock that out?

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.540
Boom there's our pewter ingot

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.329
what's interesting about the pewter is it's got all these little bubbles on the bottom very interesting and if you wonder where those came from

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.489
It popped all the way around this little bubble, so those are we smooth on the top not really

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.859
Looks like craters on the moon there you have a guy's the moon's made of pewter all right?

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.710
So what do we got?

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.530
We know the solar scorcher definitely gets hot enough to melt pewter it almost gets hot enough to melt aluminum

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.000
It will not get hot enough to melt brass in large quantities, but there is one thing that I want to try

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.389
Maybe we can't melt in aluminum and get maybe we can't melt a copper ingot

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:54.918
But will it be enough to melt a brass cartridge casing let's give that a try for one final experiment

00:07:55.169 --> 00:08:00.049
All right, make sure I don't get my head in that laser beam that could be terrible all right here. We go

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.419
Where's that focal point? Where's that focal point?

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.060
Somewhere around here, I imagine

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.619
This is my mind playing tricks on me, or is that bullet shell actually smoking? That's a good sign

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.929
It's changing color let me see it's turning a little bit yellow

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:21.199
Just going to play with the focal point here a little bit that looks like it's right about here

00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:30.619
It's got some kind of a white film forming on the outside obviously some kind of reaction taking place. It's obviously getting hot

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:33.829
But I don't see any smoke. I don't see it going incandescent

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:37.309
I would like to see that thing melt I'm hoping that it will melt

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:43.508
Look at that. It's so hot. It's actually burning the wood

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:53.169
Yep, that's obviously hot just leaving scorch marks in the wood, but it's not melting the actual grass itself I

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.149
Got to jump in to be honest here guys

00:08:55.149 --> 00:09:00.339
I was fully expecting this brass casing to melt and I think the reason it hasn't melted is because we've lost our sun

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:01.489
It passed the point of no return

00:09:01.489 --> 00:09:03.819
We should have caught this earlier in the day

00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:07.118
But in any case you can see this is so hot that when we set it down on a piece of wood

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.069
It actually scorches the wood instantly that's still excessively hot even though we didn't get it to melt

00:09:12.249 --> 00:09:16.779
I think it's good to know because you're not always going to have ideal situations trying to cast with sunlight

00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:19.449
Alright guys, so quick summary of what we tried here today

00:09:19.449 --> 00:09:23.979
We tried to see if sunlight would actually melt metal and we tried three different Metals pewter aluminum

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:30.189
And brass what we found today was very interesting the pewter was taken down in no time at all it melts very very quickly

00:09:30.189 --> 00:09:32.379
but also has the lowest melting point about

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:38.559
250 degrees Celsius now when we tried doing the aluminum ingot we put it in the sunlight for about 15 minutes with no noticeable results

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:42.519
The biskits was so hot it made the water boil to the point where we saw the latent crossed effect

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:48.339
but we never actually saw the biscuit melt now whether or not it would have melted over time who's to say and the reason we

00:09:48.339 --> 00:09:51.998
Didn't get that muffin to melt isn't because of the temperature we actually did get up to a high temperature

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:55.479
But there wasn't enough energy from the sun to melt that much aluminum

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.059
Now if aluminum didn't work we had no hope for brass whatsoever

00:09:58.059 --> 00:10:02.259
But we did try one of the cartridge casings and under some circumstances when the sun is directly overhead

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:06.399
I think this would have worked I have been successful melting steel screws in the past

00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:10.298
So I'm not sure why we didn't do a copper cartridge today, however. It's good to see that

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:11.839
it doesn't always work the

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:16.388
Location of the sun the time of year your position on the earth these are all factors that play into whether or not this to

00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:17.049
Be successful

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:24.279
So for practical use I would say melting metals like lead copper and obviously gallium yeah sunlights the way to go no problem whatsoever

00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:27.308
When you get into metals like aluminium, brass Copper gold

00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:29.499
I don't think it's really going to work on a practical basis

00:10:29.499 --> 00:10:34.749
but it was still a fun experiment and we learned something new today and a big thanks to Chris neil and sue for putting a

00:10:34.749 --> 00:10:40.058
