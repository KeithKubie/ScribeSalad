00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:11.526
&gt;&gt;Susan: Let's get started.

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:13.996
"Dear Super Duper Boys and Girls."

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:19.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's the start of a super
day in Susan Corey's kindergarten class

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.746
at Fabian Elementary
School in Portland, Oregon.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.436
&gt;&gt;Susan: Who is super
duper in this room?

00:00:24.436 --> 00:00:24.616
&gt;&gt;All: I am!

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:30.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Across the hall fellow
kindergarten teacher Felipe is having

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:31.656
a different kind of morning.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.736
&gt;&gt;Student: I want my mama!

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:35.336
&gt;&gt;Felipe: Oh you want your mama?

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:38.496
Why don't you get a Kleenex
so we can blow your nose?

00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:39.296
Come on, let's go.

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:40.726
It's kind of like a magician.

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:42.306
You redirect, you know.

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:46.106
They're focused on one thing
and then you just get a Kleenex,

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:50.026
that was a redirection and then
they just need that little focus

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:52.056
to get back and then it's over.

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:53.476
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's what
we're looking for.

00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:55.426
To see what sound you're hearing.

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:57.206
Good job, yeah, yay.

00:00:58.246 --> 00:00:58.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The subtle
magic of teaching

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:01.136
at Fabian has produced
remarkable results.

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:03.766
In a school where nearly
three-quarters

00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:07.766
of the students receive free or
reduced lunch, ninety-seven percent

00:01:08.046 --> 00:01:11.736
of the school's fifth graders
met or exceeded state standards

00:01:11.736 --> 00:01:14.596
for both reading and math in 2005.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.946
Most here would agree
that the key to achieving

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:19.616
such high standards is
to expect nothing less.

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:21.276
&gt;&gt;We all hold-

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:22.326
&gt;&gt;Very high expectations-

00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:23.626
&gt;&gt;That they all can learn-

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:25.156
&gt;&gt;And we believe in them-

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:27.386
&gt;&gt;We teach them to set
goals for themselves.

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:30.476
&gt;&gt;And it's just understood here that
of course you're going to learn.

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.246
&gt;&gt;And they really do
rise to the occasion.

00:01:32.736 --> 00:01:36.986
&gt;&gt;Kyleshia: Having expectation is a
good thing because you can actually-

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.596
is like setting your
goal and your benchmark.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.326
&gt;&gt;Felipe: Let's find out
the 15, which in those 15?

00:01:43.326 --> 00:01:47.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To help students achieve
their lofty goals teachers engage

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:50.986
parents as partners by visiting
their homes before the first day

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:51.696
of kindergarten.

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:55.576
&gt;&gt;Susan: We always make home
visits to meet the children

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:57.296
and kind of on their territory.

00:01:57.296 --> 00:01:59.856
It makes them a little more
comfortable and it kind

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:03.956
of shows us a little
bit about their life.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:07.056
&gt;&gt;Felipe: I think it makes them
not so scared of kindergarten

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:09.066
because they've already seen us.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:12.436
They've already talked to us and that
helps us as well, the home visit.

00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:13.396
&gt;&gt;Student: Thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen.

00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:15.336
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers also
work in grade-level teams.

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:16.416
&gt;&gt;TaKiyah: This is Monday right?

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:17.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Taquia Williams

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:21.436
and Meredith spend two hours each
week planning their first grade

00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:22.356
lessons together.

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:23.596
&gt;&gt;Meredith: This will be good.

00:02:23.796 --> 00:02:25.946
This is part of commun-
you know neighborhood.

00:02:25.996 --> 00:02:29.376
If they have a library in their
neighborhood we can tie that in.

00:02:29.376 --> 00:02:30.036
&gt;&gt;TaKiyah: Into it, yeah.

00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:30.686
&gt;&gt;Meredith: Into that as well.

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:32.086
&gt;&gt;TaKiyah: I just love
working with my peers.

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:36.086
We are a unit and I can go back to
Susan or I can go back to Felipe

00:02:36.086 --> 00:02:41.246
and I can go to Meredith anytime and
say "Hey, this is the situation here.

00:02:41.436 --> 00:02:42.986
What can we do to solve it?"

00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:47.166
And we all put a piece into it and
come up with some great examples

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.796
of what we need to do as a staff.

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:50.376
You know we reach out to each other.

00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:53.726
&gt;&gt;Mary: I was thinking we should
go over all the little pieces

00:02:54.456 --> 00:02:57.776
that we feel they kind
of have gaps with.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:58.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fourth
grade teachers Mary

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:02.176
and Gail Quigley take the
teamwork concept even further.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:06.466
With the help of student teacher
Anna [Inaudible] they team teach 36

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:07.966
students in two shared classrooms.

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:11.486
&gt;&gt;Mary: For shared reading slash
writing we have you teaching a

00:03:11.486 --> 00:03:12.366
grammar lesson.

00:03:12.446 --> 00:03:12.606
&gt;&gt;Anna: Okay.

00:03:12.676 --> 00:03:14.046
&gt;&gt;Mary: Do you want to
continue doing that?

00:03:14.046 --> 00:03:14.486
&gt;&gt;Anna: Yeah, that's fine.

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:15.576
We're working through that book.

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:19.406
&gt;&gt;Mary: There's more to being
an educator than just teaching.

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:20.426
You have parents calling.

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:22.156
You have students who have questions.

00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:26.796
Constant paperwork and so you always
have one teacher who can keep an eye

00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:28.146
out while the other one is teaching.

00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:30.886
And it really saves
time for us as well.

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:34.906
We can spend more time focusing on
the kids and focusing on the learning

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:37.856
than on did they turn
in their homework?

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:39.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Another key element

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:43.096
in Fabian's success is a
social-emotional learning curriculum

00:03:43.096 --> 00:03:45.956
called Life Skills which is
taught at every grade level.

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:48.826
&gt;&gt;Mary: Everyone in here has
really been using the Life Skill

00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:51.216
of initiative to try to
keep the floor picked up.

00:03:51.216 --> 00:03:52.076
And to keep-

00:03:52.076 --> 00:03:55.976
&gt;&gt;Moly: We are working really hard
on infusing in children the idea

00:03:55.976 --> 00:04:00.436
of being a citizen, you know, a good
citizen of this school and this city

00:04:00.786 --> 00:04:03.536
and state, and what it
means to be respectful.

00:04:03.536 --> 00:04:05.176
What it means to give back.

00:04:05.176 --> 00:04:06.716
What it means to be a good friend.

00:04:06.716 --> 00:04:09.356
&gt;&gt;Mary: Who can help
these three people out?

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Fourth graders spend
20 minutes each day using the life

00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:15.756
skills they've learned to
resolve everyday conflicts

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:17.326
like cutting into a game line.

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:21.126
&gt;&gt;Student: He could have said "Okay"
because the line goes by quick

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:23.956
when nobody argues and stuff.

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:25.396
&gt;&gt;Mary: We learned that, didn't we?

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:28.646
Using the life skill cooperation
we can play a lot faster, can't we?

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:28.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Yes.

00:04:29.216 --> 00:04:32.326
&gt;&gt;Mary: Does anyone have
another piece of advice for them?

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:33.826
&gt;&gt;This gives us something
to talk about.

00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:34.976
This gives us real moments.

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:39.686
There's programs out there that teach
the life skills in a different manner

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:43.766
but it's a canned program, meaning
you hold up a poster and you say

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:46.136
"This is Billy, this is Jenny.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.536
They're fighting over a ball.

00:04:47.536 --> 00:04:48.586
How can we help them?"

00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:51.446
Whereas today there
were actual examples

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:53.716
of conflict and it applied to them.

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:57.896
&gt;&gt;You could have went
to another Four Square

00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:02.706
and you could have walked
away from the situation.

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:03.686
&gt;&gt;That was a good one.

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:04.946
I like the walking away.

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:07.706
We have a lot of Four
Square games going don't we?

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school's high
scores in English are the result

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:12.676
of an intense focus on
reading and writing skills.

00:05:12.986 --> 00:05:16.066
&gt;&gt;Your story is going to be told
from the point of view of one

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:21.396
of these characters, and they're
going to explain what happened.

00:05:22.026 --> 00:05:24.626
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And lessons in
the basics are often enhanced

00:05:24.626 --> 00:05:25.826
by new technology tools.

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:28.926
&gt;&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, this
is where we're going to have

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:32.556
to use the life skill of
flexibility and patience,

00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:36.206
because we need to
get into the server.

00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:40.396
And here comes my inspiration
starter.

00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:43.106
&gt;&gt;Part of teaching has
to do with entertaining.

00:05:43.296 --> 00:05:44.496
You need to hook them.

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:45.816
You need to catch their attention.

00:05:45.816 --> 00:05:46.156
&gt;&gt;Student: See?

00:05:46.156 --> 00:05:46.346
"R".

00:05:47.536 --> 00:05:49.116
&gt;&gt;Mary: And that's
what technology does.

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:50.146
It sucks them in.

00:05:50.146 --> 00:05:51.796
It makes them interested
in their learning.

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:56.976
&gt;&gt;Okay, so I'm going
to look for a person.

00:05:57.226 --> 00:05:58.236
&gt;&gt;Mary: I like that idea.

00:05:58.236 --> 00:05:58.766
That's a good strategy.

00:05:59.016 --> 00:06:03.826
&gt;&gt;Kyleshia: In the class we're
always usually calm and quiet

00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:10.246
and we're not always chatter-bugs and
we usually listen to the teachers.

00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:13.346
And the teachers really are
excellent teachers at their jobs

00:06:13.516 --> 00:06:16.026
because they actually
they do learning

00:06:16.026 --> 00:06:21.626
and at the same time
they do fun things.

00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:23.706
&gt;&gt;Student: "Grandma
didn't have a change."

00:06:24.096 --> 00:06:25.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers aren't
the only ones who teach here.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.716
Second graders regularly
read to kindergarteners.

00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:35.246
&gt;&gt;According to my research
phytoplankton live in the part

00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:38.386
of the ocean near the
surface that gets sunlight.

00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:40.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Community volunteers
also come into the school

00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:42.786
to spend time reading
with the students.

00:06:43.226 --> 00:06:43.826
&gt;&gt;Two.

00:06:45.316 --> 00:06:45.816
&gt;&gt;Two what?

00:06:47.046 --> 00:06:50.596
&gt;&gt;Pears, but he was still hungry.

00:06:51.096 --> 00:06:53.406
&gt;&gt;Susan: We read books
every day, sometimes two

00:06:53.406 --> 00:06:57.496
and three times a day depending on
the children and they love stories.

00:06:57.776 --> 00:06:59.196
&gt;&gt;Felipe: Point to it
if you see the squirrel.

00:06:59.196 --> 00:07:01.076
&gt;&gt;Susan: I mean most
of the time a lot

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:05.686
of these kids have not heard stories
too often at home so they love this

00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:09.506
and all I ask them to do is
to sit quietly and listen.

00:07:09.506 --> 00:07:13.066
&gt;&gt;Felipe: A world far away inside my?

00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:14.916
&gt;&gt;Student: Body!

00:07:15.046 --> 00:07:17.146
&gt;&gt;Felipe: "Head" because
he's using her imagination.

00:07:17.146 --> 00:07:18.786
&gt;&gt;Student: Imagination!

00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:22.746
&gt;&gt;Felipe: Oh I like the way
Monte said "imagination".

00:07:22.746 --> 00:07:26.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the end, Fabian's
phenomenal success is the product

00:07:26.256 --> 00:07:28.156
of dedicated teachers
working together

00:07:28.356 --> 00:07:31.006
to realize the potential
they see in every child.

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:33.866
&gt;&gt;Meredith: And tell
me one thing about it.

00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:38.166
&gt;&gt;TaKiyah: We have kids' lives in our
hands that we are responsible for.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:42.176
And no matter what's happening the
ultimate goal that we set up is

00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:46.426
that we have to make sure that we
are giving each kid an opportunity

00:07:46.426 --> 00:07:47.366
to be successful.

00:07:47.786 --> 00:07:48.796
&gt;&gt;And what about these two?

00:07:49.376 --> 00:07:49.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Six.

00:07:50.616 --> 00:07:53.206
&gt;&gt;TaKiyah: What about these two?

00:07:53.206 --> 00:07:53.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Seven, eight.

00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:55.256
&gt;&gt;Susan: Maybe we haven't
done it right the first time,

00:07:55.256 --> 00:07:57.176
we think oh they'll learn
this way and they don't,

00:07:57.456 --> 00:07:59.406
but if we try another
method it clicks.

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:03.666
&gt;&gt;Oh you guys are so smart!

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:07.706
&gt;&gt;Molly: It's about having faith
for one thing in the potential

00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:11.596
of these children and then
not only having the faith

00:08:11.596 --> 00:08:13.096
but then doing something with it.

00:08:13.546 --> 00:08:15.126
We believe children can learn.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:16.816
We believe they walk through our door

00:08:16.816 --> 00:08:18.786
and we can take them,
you know, to the moon.

00:08:19.396 --> 00:08:23.886
But it's using good assessment,
good strategies to make sure

00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:25.146
that happens for all children.

00:08:27.816 --> 00:08:29.956
