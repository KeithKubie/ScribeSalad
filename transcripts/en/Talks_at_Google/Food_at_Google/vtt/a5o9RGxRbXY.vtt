00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
&gt;&gt; Great, so welcome to this special edition
of the "Authors at Google" series. Today we

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.450
are specifically focusing on the National
School Lunch Program Reform and we have Ann

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.410
Cooper in conversation with our very own Olivia
Wu here, and Ann Cooper is also known as the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.620
"Renegade Lunch Lady". She is a chef, nutrition
services director, consultant, author, public

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:35.100
speaker, and advocate for practical nutrition
reform. And, did you know that our very own

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.280
chef, Olivia Wu, before becoming the Executive
Chef at Oasis was actually a journalist? She

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.930
is a staff reporter for the San Francisco
Chronicle. She is a food consultant and public

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.150
relations specialist. She specializes in Asian
cuisine and culture and fusion cuisine, seafood

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.390
and sustainability and believe it or not,
they were actually both roommates. So you

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.780
may remember that Alice Waters came here last
year to share her vision for the delicious

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.110
food revolution and Ann Cooper's actually
the person that Alice Waters and the Chez

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.180
Panisse Foundation helped hire to make that
vision a reality so she helped eliminate nearly

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.999
all the processed foods that were served within
the Berkley Unified School District. She introduced

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:29.649
fresh and organic foods into the daily menu
and all while staying within the food district's

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:36.270
budget and then she has since moved to Boulder
to keep spreading the change so please welcome

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.610
Chef Ann Cooper and Olivia Wu.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.610
[applause]

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.009
Olivia Wu: Welcome. It's an honor to have
you here. You've been to Google many times

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.630
and we've sat around and talked so much about
how your day went, what the kids ate and what

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.799
they didn't eat, and what your staff did so
I hope to just replicate some of that and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.340
there is a small enough group here that maybe
everybody can come up to the fireside with

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.729
your questions. We have lots of questions
for you in the next three hours but I'm just

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.390
going to kind of turn you on and let you talk
[laughs] But you turned the food chain around

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:17.720
here at Berkeley and now you are at Boulder
doing all of Boulder County. What are some

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.220
of the similarities? What are new challenges?
What are the 'ah ha' moments that make you

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:33.320
go "This is what I've been able to do and
I'll do it all again or this is new" so talk

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.060
to us about that.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.020
Ann Cooper: Well, when I came to Berkeley,
I came because Alice Waters asked me to come

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.121
and I had been doing this in New York and
she said come to Berkeley. I had also had

00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:52.570
been asked to go to Harlem and work in Harlem
so I said yes to both and I was working half

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.920
time in Harlem and half time in Berkeley,
commuting back and forth and trying to redo

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.840
some schools in New York City as well. And
I didn't actually think I'd ever take over

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.840
the district. I thought I was just going to
be a consultant but after being a consultant

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.610
for a year, I eventually took over the district
and because Alice and her foundation had been

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.420
working here for ten years and also the Center
for Equal Literacy, there was a real strong

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.360
movement in Berkeley to make change. However,
the food was spectacularly bad. I mean, the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.410
kids had a five day rotating cycle of chicken
nuggets, extremo burritos, pizza pockets,

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.620
corn dogs, and grilled cheese sandwiches,
all preprocessed, all prepared, all in plastic

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.150
and that's what the kids ate and so you'd
think Alice, Berkeley, you know, there's a

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.122
real disconnect but that's the kind of food
we had. It took four years and it was a real

00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:43.200
hard process and even though we had a lot
of parent's support in some areas, we had

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.150
a lot of push back in others and we had a
tremendous amount of push back from the kids

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.160
but you know, it was a process and it took
four years but Berkeley was small. It was

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.900
sixteen schools, 9,600 kids, and I could actually
go to every school in one day. I had this

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.130
huge support system, both financial and resources.
The foundation raised a million and a half

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.710
dollars over the time I was there to help
the school district make the change, then

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.020
now the school's districts nutrition services
is totally budget neutral and financially

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.430
viable, sustainable, systemic and all now
but it took a long time. I also had a superintendent

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.530
in the school board who are very supportive
and superintendent who basically stood in

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.280
front of me and said, you know, and protected
me and said, "We are going to make these changes,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:36.199
it's going to be painful, it's going to work."
So when I get asked, I get recruited to go

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.539
to Boulder in a sort of very similar community
and they said, "Yeah! We've got all this parent

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.150
support and we've got a community that's going
to support us. We've done this great survey

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.289
and everyone really wants this." And the superintendent
in the school board was like, "Yeah, yeah.

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.410
Everybody's ready and we're going to do this."
And so I took the job there. It's much bigger.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.259
It's 48 schools spread over 550 square miles.
I have a 175 employees and none of which,

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:08.830
or very few of which, were really motivated
to make these kind of very difficult changes.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.870
Even though they have surveyed the parents,
most of the parents who answered the survey

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.100
I think were from Boulder proper but we, the
district, encompasses ten communities and

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.759
literally 65 miles from one end of our district
to the other. So even though the Boulder parents

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.599
thought this was really great and they raised
half a million dollars and they were doing

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.590
all this great stuff, there was all these
other parents and so I'm getting pushed, I've

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.150
been there since July and I'm getting pushed
back like that, "I feed my kids chicken nuggets

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.940
at home. Who the hell are you to tell me not
to? Why do you get to decide our kids can't

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.091
have chicken nuggets or tater tots or high
fructose corn syrup or popsicles or Pop Tarts

00:05:47.091 --> 00:05:53.259
or you know, candy, we use it." And then other
challenges, the same Boulder parents who would

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.300
write checks of ten and twenty thousand dollars
at the drop off a hat won't make their kids

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.020
eat the food, you know? Because their kids
would rather have sushi or you know the kids

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:09.870
say, "I don't really want that, I want this.
I want you to get me this." You know, so I'm

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.150
struggling with the same parents who want
me there are the same parents who raised a

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.999
half million dollars to get this program off
and running aren't actually having their kids

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:22.309
eat so we run in there believing that we could
raise participation which is how you make

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:27.629
these programs sustainable and we've only
been able to raise it five percent which is

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.569
just not enough. So, in some ways, you've
either got the similar demographic but in

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:38.349
other ways, it's very different and it's so
spread out it's really hard. I mean, I now

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.559
have five managers and they can't even get
to every school every day so we try and get

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.150
to every school every other day now but it's
a lot of transition work.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.020
Olivia Wu: How many schools are we talking?

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.099
Ann Cooper: 48.

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:51.539
Olivia Wu: 48 schools?

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:52.620
Ann Cooper: Yeah.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.729
Olivia Wu: Yeah, that's a lot. You're the
most wired digital lady that I know. You have

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:05.499
so many toys so the obvious question for me
is you know Google. We want to be involved

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:11.830
and we want to make a difference. What do
we do? Do we find five hundred other anchor

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:18.490
boosts? Do we go in on the policy level? Do
we help raise money? Do we help market? What

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.599
can we do?

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:23.930
Ann Cooper: There is so many things and I
love that question because I need so much

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.800
help. You know, Berkeley or Boulder or any
of the local communities you might have kids

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.680
in or know where kids are, we cannot fix this
one school at a time. There is a 125,000 schools

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.960
in this country. We cannot fix it one school
at a time. There is almost fifteen thousand

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.050
school districts. We can't even fix it one
district at a time. It's impossible, we have

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:50.200
to change it at the USDA level. For the very
first time in my whole career on school food,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.479
I'm very optimistic and then we have a President
who actually talked about kids and food and

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:59.169
health in the same sentence. The last President
who talked about kids and food was Reagan

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:06.050
who made ketchup a vegetable so I'm very optimistic
with Obama. We now have a First Lady who not

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.229
only planted a garden at the White House that
I have been fortunate enough to go to but

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:15.409
has a great personal chef whose invested in
this and now they have food policies, and

00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:20.180
she has just announced to Council of Mayors
that she is taking on, and even in President

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.939
Obama's State of the Union, they are taking
on childhood obesity and she specifically

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:30.229
said in her speech to the mayors that what
had to happen in schools. I've met with the

00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:34.870
Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, Kathleen
Merrigan, who used to be on the National Organic

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.829
Standards Board and I was on the National
Organic Standards Board but I went on right

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:44.050
after her, and she is very interested in this
stuff and I met with the Undersecretary that's

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:49.470
over School Lunch, Janey
Thornton, and she's interested in making change.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.180
I think the most optimistic thing or the thing
that makes me most optimistic is Arne Duncan.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:59.449
I haven't met with him but I've met with his
staff and his staff said to me, "We can not

00:08:59.449 --> 00:09:04.620
close the achievement gap in America unless
we fix school lunch." So for the first time,

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.720
the Secretary of Ag and the Secretary of Education
are actually talking about these two things

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.300
because the Secretary of Education is over
education and the Secretary of Ag is over

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.829
school lunch so there's two very divergent
things. From Google's point of view, there

00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:22.199
is so much you can do to help. I mean, one
of the things, any of you who are at lunch

00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:27.360
or we could show later, one of the things
that's happening right now is we are building

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.610
a web portal and these little bands that say
"I Matter, Feed Me Well" also have the URL

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:38.100
for the web portal that we're building and
we're trying to build a web portal that will

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.050
have all the tools that every school district
in the country can use to make these changes.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:49.279
It has menus and recipes and technical tools
and videos and educational materials and a

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:56.410
big community piece sort of AKA Facebook where
people can gather, so we are trying to build

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:01.720
this. We partnered this past summer with Whole
Foods and we raised a million dollars to start

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.980
the process of building a portal, but one
of the things I've come to understand which

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:13.170
is very interesting is I thought much of this
up in my head and we've been struggling to

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.649
have the technology catch up to what we kind
of thought of, and so we're struggling with

00:10:18.649 --> 00:10:23.181
the technology to be able to build something
that's actually can do all the things that

00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:28.100
I think it needs to do and can be seen by
people in schools who can't get onto Facebook,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.160
who can't get onto Twitter, and who can't
use YouTube or anything like that, so all

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.990
schools ban all of that material, so how do
you have someplace where people can go that's

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:44.720
sort of outside of the social networking arena
that we all play in because schools can't

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:52.380
play in it. The other thing around that I
think, from a Google standpoint, we need,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:59.940
you know, whether it's the Google phone or
the iPhone, we need some apps that can build

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:07.230
in that smartphone universe that school people
could like pull up recipes, that they could

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.750
get answers to questions right from their
phone because many of them are out in the

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.279
field and they may not be able to get to their
computers so that's another thing we're looking

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:20.470
at, like how do we develop that and what is
it that we really want to develop around that.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:29.009
The other thing is on February 8th, that the
Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, is

00:11:29.009 --> 00:11:33.690
going to make a speech and the speech is going
to be taking about school lunch. Right after

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.370
the speech, my foundation is starting a national
write-in campaign to get a million moms and

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:46.079
dads or parents or caregivers to write to
Tom Vilsack and Kathleen Merrigan at the USDA

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:51.589
and the Senate and Representatives from Congress.
We are actually putting up the website with

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:55.569
a map and you'll be able to click on the map
and we've got a letter that you'll be able

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:59.649
to send in or customize the letter and send
it in. Getting information like that out would

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:03.829
be really, really helpful so we are trying
to have the stuff go viral. We've made an

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:08.980
animated video that we hope will help us.
A 90 second video can be like a PSA, it can

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.360
be watched on smartphones or on computers
and we are trying to get a bunch of stuff

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.329
going viral so this is the year of the child
nutrition reauthorization that only happens

00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:23.430
every four or five years. This is where the
federal government decides how much money

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.879
they are going to give school and what the
guidelines are. The money thing is really

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:33.930
important. Schools are now given $2,000.68
to feed a child for a day if it's a free child.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.509
Of that, traditionally two thirds goes to
payroll and overhead. That leaves us less

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:41.561
then a dollar a day to feed a kid and if any
of you have been to Starbucks of late and

00:12:41.561 --> 00:12:48.139
gotten a venti latte or any of the other exotic,
you know, coffee shops, you'll know that you

00:12:48.139 --> 00:12:52.800
are paying four or five dollars so you know
we now have a world where we spend four or

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.279
five dollars more on our daily coffee then
we are spending on our kid's lunch so the

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:03.030
dollar doesn't really get you enough but the
USDA does decide that. Also the USDA guidelines

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:07.779
around chicken nuggets, tater tots, chocolate
milk, high fructose corn syrup, transfat,

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:12.941
popsicles, Pop Tarts, and corn dogs, that
is all allowed on the National School Lunch

00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:23.720
Program so it's not enough just to get money.
We absolutely have to get the guidelines changed.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:30.949
Olivia Wu: Guidelines changed. Besides the
grassroots letter writing and getting to Vilsack,

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:34.589
how can Google further--, with this?

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:41.470
Ann Cooper: Well, I think it'll be an interesting
thing. I mean Google is sort of the center

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:46.920
of the, I mean from a Google outsider, someone
who Googles on like a million times a day

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:52.129
regular basis, you know, if Google is the
holder of information in the world, if any

00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:58.800
bit of information you want or think you want
can be gotten through Googling then that's

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.449
a way to collect information so I guess the
question would be does Google want to push

00:14:03.449 --> 00:14:09.740
information and if Google did want to push
information, then it'd be really cool to be

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:16.810
able to, when people are Googling school lunch
or people that are interested in some of these

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:24.399
things to be able to have a message or have
specific sites that will support it. You know,

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:29.310
when you go on Google and you'll see those
top ones and that's the ones that are sponsored

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:34.910
sites so maybe there is a way to sponser sites
that are done by non-profits or sponsor sites

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.500
that are really pushing forward this mission.
Something like that.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.730
Olivia Wu: Yes, Sir?

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.959
&gt;&gt; We don't, put up the natural search results,
we won't alter those because that has to be,

00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:44.959
you know, fair and the better content of your
site has, whatever site it is, then the higher

00:14:44.959 --> 00:15:09.690
it'll interact in the rankings, but in terms
of like the ads, we do offer Google Grants

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:19.320
Program to do that so I don't know if you
guys have been taking part in that yet.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320
Ann Cooper: Uh uh. We haven't.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.420
&gt;&gt; Great, so those advertisements are free
and that Grants program is significant so

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.420
you should talk about that.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.420
Ann Cooper: Cool. Great.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.420
Olivia Wu: Excellent. Yeah. So once, tell
me the sequence, the ideal sequence you see

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:29.700
things happening in, from policy down. How
do you think it should happen? And then maybe

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.889
from out here, we'll have ideas on how Google
fits in.

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:41.399
Ann Cooper: In a perfect world, and we know
we're in such an imperfect world, the problem

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:45.910
with the USDA guidelines and the money is
the USDA was founded to be the marketing arm

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:52.749
for agribusiness and their mission in the
world, and it may be changing now, but their

00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:57.780
mission historically has been to promote big
agriculture and for the most part that big

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.889
agriculture exports to other countries so
literally they are the marketing arm for Monsanto

00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:05.190
and DuPont and ADM and all these big huge
companies.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.779
Olivia Wu: Chemical companies.

00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:12.160
Ann Cooper: Chemical companies that have now
decided that food companies and as well, you

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.420
know, Monsanto and DuPont produce Agent Orange
and stain resistant carpet. They control 90%

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:22.509
of the commercially produced seeds in America,
so this is a crazy paradigm, but as well they

00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:27.870
also support a lot of companies through the
commodity food program and our tax dollars

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:35.420
spend about 45 billion dollars a year subsidizing
corn, soy, rice, wheat, and I think one other,

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:42.050
cotton, so the government buys all of the
stuff and the reason why sugar is so cheap

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:46.740
is because corn is so highly subsidized and
the reason we have high fructose corn syrup

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:52.100
in everything from hamburgers, to hamburgers
to hot dogs to gum to soda is because the

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.290
corn is so overproduced and so cheap that
now they make it into high fructose corn syrup

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:05.250
and so the USDA gets to decide what's allowed
in the food. They buy this food, although

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.880
it's not actually food because none of that
corn goes into high fructose syrup would ever

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.540
be eaten, so they buy the stuff and then subsidize
to make this processed stuff that we send

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:20.589
into schools and to give you a perfect example
of how awful the system is, a year ago January,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:28.120
a year ago this month, for some reason Tyson
decided they needed a bail out, so the USDA

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.150
bailed out Tyson for a 143 million dollars
so they bought a 143 million dollars worth

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:37.840
of chicken from Tyson while there may not
even have been chicken but there is the virtual

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.840
chicken. There is the idea that they needed
money so the government gave them the money

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.539
in exchange for chicken. So then Tyson comes
to schools all over the country, school districts

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:50.450
and says, "The government just gave us all
this money and we can give you free chicken."

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.221
It's like, "Great, we'll take the chicken."
"Oh no, no. You can get it in chicken nuggets,

00:17:54.221 --> 00:18:00.881
chicken patties, da, da, da, da, da, da, at
around forty dollars a case." So the government

00:18:00.881 --> 00:18:04.919
buys the chicken from Tyson who then sells
the chicken that they've already been given,

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:08.770
they've already been paid for the chicken
then they sell the chicken to schools for

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:13.770
the processing fee and oh by the way, then
they add all that junk in there so it's a

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:19.600
very corrupt system. It's very highly ingrained.
I don't know how we change the Farm Bill that

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:26.279
oversees that. I did talk with Kathleen Merrigan
and I said the commodity system has to change

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:31.220
and she said pick your battles so I think
that that's going to be a tough one but if

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:38.740
we could do, if there was a grassroots campaign
in this country that would get people all

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:43.440
over the country to say we want better food
for kids then that would make it a priority

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.610
to the Senate and the Congress people and
the Representatives who are actually the ones

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:54.610
that vote on and decide on like staying on
the Farm Bill because the USDA promotes it,

00:18:54.610 --> 00:19:00.780
the President promotes but when Congress meet
with Representatives and especially with any

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:06.480
kind of partisanship decide that their state
is going to be, is not going to do so well

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.510
because now we're not going to have high fructose
corn syrup in schools and what's Iowa going

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:15.650
to do if they can't produce high fructose
corn syrup, so that's why it's so important

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:21.580
to be able touch just regular people like
us because we are the ones that the officials

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:30.380
supposedly listen so if we could have this
mass belief and get people to actually do

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.190
it, I mean when the Organic Standards was
originally going to be passed it was going

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:41.390
to allow GMA's, irradiated food, and sewage
sludge as all part of the organic program,

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.429
and there were two hundred and sixty thousand
people who wrote in and said that's ridiculous

00:19:45.429 --> 00:19:49.340
and they changed and that was before email
pretty much. I mean, people actually picked

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:56.289
up a piece of paper and pencil and wrote and
mailed. You know, now if we could get a million

00:19:56.289 --> 00:20:00.630
or two million people to say we want something
different, I think it would start to force

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:06.430
the government to look at this in a different
way, so I think that's what has to happen

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.370
and it has to happen at the government because
we are not going to get more money and we're

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.571
not going to get higher guidelines unless
the government decides and the guidelines

00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:19.260
without the money or the money without the
guidelines, you have to have both.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:24.360
Olivia Wu: Umm, the Farm Bill is next up for
when? Next up for?

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360
Ann Cooper: 2012.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360
Olivia Wu: 2012.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.160
Ann Cooper: So at least three years or actually
two years away from the Farm Bill yet they're

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.580
sort of like on these alternating years.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:38.049
Olivia Wu: Okay. Umm, I want to zero in now
on maybe the kid level. So I visited Berkeley

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:45.590
once in the very early days when you first
took over and there were tostadas and stuff

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:50.560
that the lunch ladies took out from the freezer
and put in the microwave and pressed a button

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.680
and they heated the kid's food up and the
only fresh thing there was green grapes which

00:20:54.680 --> 00:21:02.960
the kids then took outside in the playground
and threw at each other so what can we do

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:10.400
in the way of interactive stuff for kids so
that they might eat those grapes rather than

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.970
throw them at each other?

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.580
Ann Cooper: Well, you might know that eating
grapes in the middle of one if they come from

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.000
Chile, are the wrong thing.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.520
Olivia Wu: It shouldn't be there but yes,
right.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.150
Ann Cooper: This is a tremendous educational
piece needed, you know? I say that there are

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:31.120
five big challenges to doing this work: food,
finance, facilities, human resources, and

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.890
marketing. Food, where is it going to come
from and how do we make sure it's good; finances,

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.929
how do we pay for it; facilities, how do we
cook it or store it because most school kitchens

00:21:38.929 --> 00:21:43.029
don't have stoves or walk ins; human resources,
how do we take all these men and women all

00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:46.380
across the country who have been using box
cutters and can crushers because everything

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.539
came canned or frozen and actually now give
them raw chicken and tell them how to cook

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:54.909
it and then after we've figured out all of
that stuff which is overwhelmingly hard, how

00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:58.200
do we get the kids to eat it? You know, we've
now grown a generation of children that think

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:04.059
chicken nuggets is a food group and hot Cheetos
and soda is breakfast. To get them to go from

00:22:04.059 --> 00:22:08.980
there to something else, you know granola
and yogurt for breakfast or roast chicken

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:14.309
and roast potatoes and salad bar at lunch
is hard. Hands on experience in learning cooking

00:22:14.309 --> 00:22:19.980
and gardening classes is really important
but it would be really great if there was,

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.970
you know I've always thought this should be
part of our website but we haven't even thought

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:30.210
about trying to develop this yet, but if there
was some interactive things, websites, really

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:36.179
cool, compelling, or games. How about a game
that kids would play that would be about food

00:22:36.179 --> 00:22:40.419
or farming or agriculture and how do we get
the kids invested. I mean, how do we get kids

00:22:40.419 --> 00:22:48.190
that spend all of their time in front of a
blue screen, how do we get them to understand

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.760
that where a carrot comes from makes a difference
or that it may taste different if it comes

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.730
from dirt or if it comes from the grocery
store where it's been for seven years, so

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:02.720
I think interactive games, which there are
none out there, or some sort of food farming.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.730
Something like that could be really cool.
Some good kid-oriented websites that would

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:15.110
connect them and there are none that I know
of out there and that doesn't replace the

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:18.620
hands on experiencial learning. I mean, I
think we need to get kid's hands dirty. We

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:23.649
need to get them touching food, but we also
need to start with from where they are and

00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:27.790
the youngest kids are not too hard but for
middle school and high school, it's really

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:33.440
hard to turn these kids around so we have
to give them something that's cool for them,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.300
you know. We need to make this stuff cool.
Good food has got to be cool food and there's

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:44.600
not a school, well there's a couple, you know?
There are very, very, very, very, very, very

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.490
few schools in America that has food even
a tenth as good as what you guys here have

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.490
here every day.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:24:00.549
Olivia Wu: Talk to me a little bit about,
let me get the full "F's" here: food, family,

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:02.309
farming, foundation, your foundation.

00:24:02.309 --> 00:24:10.399
Ann Cooper: So, we started a foundation only
to be able to bring in money, to raise money

00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:16.700
so we could build this web portal and about
two years ago, I had had this idea for this

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.260
web portal for a number of years and I sort
of tried to shop it around and get people

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:24.760
interested but a couple of years ago, the
Carole Foundation gave us a planning grant,

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:29.840
a two year planning grant, to start building
it and start thinking about it and start planning

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.679
it and almost at the same time, I started
working with Whole Foods and over the two

00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:41.210
years between then and now, we were able to
raise a significant amount of money and actually

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:47.140
start implementation on the website so the
foundation is really a vehicle to do projects.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:52.179
The main, and only project right now, is the
Lunch Box Project and of the Lunch Box Project,

00:24:52.179 --> 00:24:57.510
really what we're working on is the web portal
and also some videos and this letter writing

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:03.250
campaign so all of these campaigns are on
the Child Nutrition Act and also around just

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:08.850
working with schools all across the country
and this is all running through the foundation.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:15.110
Olivia Wu: Are you doing anything with curricula
at school and does everybody who have, every

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:20.190
school that has the food, gardening, and curricula
component know about each other? What's going

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:21.190
on there?

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:26.190
Ann Cooper: You know, it's really difficult,
you know. Everybody kind of gathers around

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:32.880
the garden piece because it feels sexy and
it's fun and it's really, really, really important,

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.740
but by in large the gardens don't change what's
on the plate in schools and unless you can

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:42.610
change what's on the plate in schools, the
gardens are just kind of a cool fun or an

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.590
add on and because they've been sort of sexy,
a lot of foundations have thrown money at

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.679
it. So we're reinventing the wheel a lot and
one of the ideas around the web portal, the

00:25:52.679 --> 00:25:57.350
Lunch Box, is that we will have a whole area
on curriculum and we are trying to gather

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:02.549
the ear of the actual curriculum or links
to curriculum in one place, so that every

00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:06.529
school and district that decides they want
to have some of these things doesn't either

00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:11.090
A) Get a foundation to pay for it again or
B) Not be able to get it because they just

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:16.179
can't find it so there is plenty of curriculum
out there. You know, there's dozens and dozens

00:26:16.179 --> 00:26:19.640
and dozens of curriculum, but mostly people
don't know what each other is doing. There

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:23.160
is not one repository for all of this and
that's what we hope the Lunch Box will be.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:28.611
Olivia Wu: Excellent. Thank you. Are there
any questions from out there?

00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:29.611
Ann Cooper: Or comments or thoughts?

00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:30.611
Olivia Wu: Or comments or thoughts?

00:26:30.611 --> 00:26:31.611
&gt;&gt; They need to use the microphone.

00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:35.350
Ann Cooper: We need a step ladder for the
microphone.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:46.779
&gt;&gt; That's true I guess. So, how do you naviagate
between tackling everything and also staying

00:26:46.779 --> 00:26:49.880
focused enough to actually have an impact?

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.640
Ann Cooper: I don't sleep. [laughs]

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.110
Olivia Wu: She does not.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:27:00.870
Ann Cooper: So says my former roommate. I
don't know. I mean, I guess because it's all

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:06.910
the same work whether I'm in Boulder, you
know going into schools yesterday to see.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:12.480
I mean, yesterday I was sitting in one of
the schools at lunch talking to kids who had

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.660
gone to the salad bar and didn't have any
protein and we're giving them out these things

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:21.480
because you know you got to them so that is
just as instructive for the bigger work as

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:28.590
the bigger work instructs how we deal in Boulder,
so because it's all so entwined, I guess I

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:36.429
can like do it all or try as well as I can
do it all and it all inner relates. So there's

00:27:36.429 --> 00:27:41.620
nothing too different so I'm able to kind
of tackle as much as I can and I work with

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.909
some real, real great people you know, I have
a ton of support.

00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:52.399
Olivia Wu: Is there a piece of this movement
that is about mobilizing chefs or people in

00:27:52.399 --> 00:27:57.659
the organic movement to do a piece of this?

00:27:57.659 --> 00:28:06.600
Ann Cooper: Sort of but there's a challenge
among mobilizing chefs for this, because most

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.639
chefs have no concept of what it means to
cook a meal for a dollar. They have no idea

00:28:11.639 --> 00:28:16.630
how to deal with the commodity food system,
many of them don't use recipes, never mind

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:25.600
having the USDA guidelines to deal with and
trying to, and then having kids as the ones

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.090
who you know, are your customers. So I think
it's really important to be able to have the

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:36.441
chefs involved but we have to find the right
place. You know, now that we have like "Top

00:28:36.441 --> 00:28:41.370
Chef" and I just saw an advertisement for
like "The Warrior Kitchen". I mean, I don't

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.990
know. It's all crazy but now that chefs are
celebrities. I think that there is a way to

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:49.091
touch kids, especially high school kids and
middle schools kids. We chefs coming in and

00:28:49.091 --> 00:28:54.919
saying you need to eat better and here's some
ways, but I don't think the answer is getting

00:28:54.919 --> 00:29:01.350
chefs in those kitchens cooking with the lunch
ladies. I think you get a lot and lot of this

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:06.510
because it's just, you know, you got to deal
with these commodities and you got to figure

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:11.520
all that part out but if we could get chefs
and rock stars and football stars and musicians,

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:19.630
I mean if we could get people the kids look
up to to help with this food piece and help

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:24.379
say it's really important to eat well, I think
that would be great.

00:29:24.379 --> 00:29:31.490
&gt;&gt; Hi, I was wondering how your group is sort
of addressing what I see is two sort of root

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:37.230
causes of why food is so bad in schools. One
would be the amount of money they're getting,

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.309
like a dollar. I think it's pretty much impossible.
I mean, we have good food here at Google but

00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:48.550
I've heard numbers about how much it costs;
it's expensive but it's very good food. And

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:55.409
then two, the actual convincing of people
that the food is harmful because what I think

00:29:55.409 --> 00:30:02.000
the biggest problem is that kids can be told
something and they will sort of believe it

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.930
but you know if parents aren't telling them
that it's harmful or they don't believe it's

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:12.110
harmful, like you have to convince somebody
that chicken nuggets isn't healthy. How are

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.429
you addressing that part? I guess that's my
main question.

00:30:14.429 --> 00:30:19.409
Ann Cooper: Okay, so first thing on the dial
or with our animated video that we hope to

00:30:19.409 --> 00:30:24.720
show sometime, maybe at lunch, we just did
this animated video and we're actually at

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:30.000
the end of the video, it says and it's all
animated with a young child's voice, "Please

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.780
give us an extra dollar for lunch" so my campaign,
or our campaign, is going to start on February

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:41.309
9th and it is directed toward the USDA and
Congressmen and Representatives is we need

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:45.480
an extra dollar for lunch dedicated to fresh
foods, fresh vegetables, whole grains with

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.000
a priority on regional procurement so that
is what we're pushing for. I can tell you

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:57.700
I don't believe we'll get it. There's not
a lot of people only asking for 35 cents but

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:04.600
what the President has proposed is a billion
dollars for all child nutrition services which

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:10.789
would end up with about fifteen to twenty
cents added to the National School Lunch Program

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:17.130
which is just such a, I mean I can't buy a
piece of fruit, you know? For us to get good

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.679
food to put on a kid's plate is 25 cents so
the idea that we're only going to raise the

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:25.340
National School Lunch Program by half of that
is just overwhelming so that's our campaign.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:31.399
It's going to start in a few weeks and you
know, that's what we're really pushing for.

00:31:31.399 --> 00:31:36.850
In the campaign, in the little video that
we're going to try to get up and 'virally',

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:41.059
it actually in a really cute way says you
know thirty percent of kids are overweight,

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:45.130
one in three kids are going to have diabetes
in their lifetime, so we're trying to get

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:50.899
this out without really scaring people and
getting them to understand. I think our website

00:31:50.899 --> 00:31:57.710
will also have more information but there's
a way to touch people in a school and in a

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:02.350
district but from nationwide, it's really
going to take, I mean I wish the government

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:06.600
would do a national marketing campaign around
good food. I mean, the government took on

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.470
drinking and driving, they took on seatbelts,
they took on smoking, they really should take

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:15.250
on the food issue. I'm not sure they would
because there is so much big business that

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:21.419
you know stands to lose money if we eat healthier.
I mean, if kids ate healthier, who wins? Well,

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:25.559
not agribusiness, not the medical industrial
complex, and not the pharmaceutical industrial

00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:30.900
complex so who wins? The kids? They don't
vote so we really do have to try and educate

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:37.759
their kids and their parents through soft
marketing and PR that does just this educational

00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:42.029
component and you know it's hard but you show
its strength when it said that there's one

00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:46.440
point one million who wake up hungry every
day in America and when you're hungry, you

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:51.090
know you don't necessarily care about the
quality of the food, you just don't want your

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:56.110
kids to be hungry so we have an access issue,
we have a demographic issue between rich and

00:32:56.110 --> 00:33:03.169
poor, you know. This is totally a social equity
issue. You know, the CDC has said that of

00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:07.029
the children born in the year 2001, one out
of every three Caucasians and one out of every

00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:11.650
two African Americans and Hispanics are going
to have diabetes in their lifetime, many before

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:15.620
they graduate high school so we're looking
at within ten years, 30 or 35 percent of kids

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:22.110
insulin dependant. I mean, it's crazy and
it really runs along social lines, social

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:27.380
equity lines and we've also seen that the
achievement and the life expectancy gap between

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:32.789
rich and poor has grown twenty percent over
the last two decades so if you're poor in

00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:37.159
America, you're going, you're not going to
do as well in school and you're going to die

00:33:37.159 --> 00:33:42.539
younger. I mean, it's a crazy thing for our
country, so we really have to get the education

00:33:42.539 --> 00:33:43.539
out there.

00:33:43.539 --> 00:33:48.690
Olivia Wu: Has anybody done the matrix on
the cost of healthcare for all of these young

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:49.690
diabetics?

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.179
Ann Cooper: As a matter of fact, Michael Pollan
reported about three months ago in the New

00:33:54.179 --> 00:33:59.549
York Times that just two illnesses, diabetes
and obesity, is now costing the country 260

00:33:59.549 --> 00:34:04.100
billion dollars, that's a quarter trillion
and if the healthcare initiative, that may

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:09.080
probably not pass now which is awful, was
only going to cost 900 billion. I mean, in

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:13.980
one year spending 25 percent of the entire
cost of the healthcare bill on these two diseases

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.910
that are by in large preventable.

00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:21.320
&gt;&gt; You should put that on the campaign for
the extra dollar. I mean, that's one more

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.320
dollar, right?

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.849
Ann Cooper: Yeah, well it's just so crazy
and the National School Lunch Program right

00:34:26.849 --> 00:34:34.010
now spends $8.5 billion to feed 5.4 billion
lunches a year and so if we added a dollar,

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:39.419
it would go from 8.5 billion to 14 billion
and people, you know I say this in Washington

00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:43.359
and you know people like lose their mind and
I'm going, "Yeah, but okay so it's costing

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:50.179
three billion dollars a week for the war that
we try and pretend we're not in and it's going

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:53.849
to cost 260 billion a year for healthcare"
So what is it going to take for us as a nation

00:34:53.849 --> 00:34:58.960
to understand that we have to see what we
eat as part of our health and part of preventative

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:03.850
medicine. You know, health and human services
recently came out and said if we don't change

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:08.240
how we're eating, every single person in our
country is going to be overweight or obese

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:15.060
by 2040, you know? In 30 years. It's crazy,
it's crazy.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:20.060
Olivia Wu: What other matrix should we be
looking at?

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:25.520
Ann Cooper: Well, the thing, the unfortunate
thing that everybody wants to know is if we

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:30.800
feed kids better food, will it raise their
academic performance. This is a very, very,

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800
very hard -

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.589
Olivia Wu: Well, duh.

00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:39.400
Ann Cooper: Well, instead of like "Duh". Okay,
so when any of us like eat crap all day or

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.460
don't eat, how do we feel? We feel really
awful and when is it that we want sugar or

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.470
caffeine? 3 in the afternoon when we skip
lunch. I mean, we as adults know what happens

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.789
to our body, you know. We don't?

00:35:49.789 --> 00:35:56.829
&gt;&gt; We don't pay attention to our bodies as
adults. What are you talking about? [laughs]

00:35:56.829 --> 00:36:03.630
Ann Cooper: Okay. Maybe as adults we actually
have the knowledge to pay attention to our

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:10.510
bodies if we wanted to and with all that being
said, we do know that kids that eat a diet

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:14.710
high in sugar, refined sugar and refined flour,
are really often diagnosed with ADD, ADHD,

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.630
and dyslexia. We know that these same kids
are almost always in the office, that they

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:24.150
have real poor performance and real poor behavior
but everybody wants the study that's going

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:29.050
to link better food to academic performance
because of No Child Left Behind. Well, No

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:34.511
Child Left Behind pretty much leaves every
child behind. It is a crazy system, it's really

00:36:34.511 --> 00:36:41.890
bad from the food service point of view. There
was just a study done in England by Jamie

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:47.960
Oliver's group, a group run by Jamie Oliver
just did a study and did actually show over

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:53.440
there that the food reduction in refined sugars
and refined flours in more whole foods does

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.490
indeed increase academic performance. What
I actually think it does is not increase academic

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:02.010
performance, it increases our ability to focus
and think. You know, when you give kids a

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.720
lot of sugar they just get really high and
they crash and I was working with some kids

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.291
in Harlem one time and we were making a PBS
show and they're just hanging around and the

00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:12.620
kids are a little nervous and there're cameras
everywhere and I said, "What did you guys

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.550
have for breakfast?" And I came from a little
town in the middle of nowhere and they said,

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:19.190
"Snack Crack". I'm in Harlem now and I said,
"Oh. They said snack crack. It's an English

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:28.710
topping." And they said, "You know, our parents
go out in the street and get crack to get

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:36.160
high all we need is 20 ounce soda and candy
on the way to school and we get just as high,

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.380
you know." I mean, this is what the kids,
13 year olds were saying, so they know what

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:44.400
we are doing to them and I say 'we' because
you know, the adults have to make choices.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:49.280
I mean, schools are drug free zones, schools
are alcohol free zones, they should be junk

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.280
food free zones.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:57.170
&gt;&gt; Actually just quickly, would you talk about
open campuses versus closed campuses? I don't

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.710
know the status of Berkeley and I don't know
the status of Boulder and is that going to

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.369
be required for a big change like this.

00:38:01.369 --> 00:38:08.020
Ann Cooper: Yeah. Both Berkeley and Boulder
have open campuses. It's a really crazy system.

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.510
I do not know why we would want to send our
children -

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.760
&gt;&gt; Tell people what that means.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:20.030
Ann Cooper: Okay. So what open campus means
is that in many high schools across the country,

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:24.350
the students are allowed to leave campus for
up to an hour in the middle of the day to

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:30.680
go somewhere and do something. The idea is
that you are letting them go off campus for

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.440
lunch. These are, you know, sometimes as young
as 14, 15 year old, 16 year old kids who you

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:41.260
send to school because you think that they're
being educated and you know given some supervision

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:46.450
that you then allow them to go where they
want. One of the things that happens when

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:51.060
you let them go where they want is they don't
eat the food on campus and they go eat junk

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.660
food wherever they can because they don't
want to spend a lot of money and they can

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:58.050
get a lot of calories and a lot of sugar and
a lot of fat for 99 cents at some fast food

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:04.589
place. Schools are starting to turn that around,
it makes no sense to me. Why would you, why

00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:10.000
would we want to send our kids to school and
then assume that they're going to spend some

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.300
amount of time without any supervision doing
whatever they're going to be doing and eating

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.820
and drinking and smoking whatever they are
going to be doing and yeah, I mean that happens

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:26.320
to us all at some point when we are probably
a little older then teenagers, but I do think

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.010
we should close campuses. The big challenge
on closing campuses now is they didn't make

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:34.380
schools big enough, you know? Because they
started letting kids out so now, like in Berkeley,

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:40.310
there's one high school, 32 hundred students,
they built a beautiful new cafeteria and it

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:45.680
seats 400. Duh! There's no way I can feed
them and Boulder's done the same thing so

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.130
schools have saved money by building buildings
that don't have cafeteria seating for the

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:55.230
kids because they figure the kids are going
to go away so it's, "Oh good, we don't have

00:39:55.230 --> 00:40:00.380
to watch them for an hour." Well, you know
that's not -- if we are educating the whole

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:04.450
child for the whole day that we have them
with us, we have to understand that the lunch

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:08.340
period is part of the educational experience.
It's part of the whole child.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:20.910
Olivia Wu: Do we know the policy people and
the Congress people who are most friendly

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:25.420
to childhood nutrition and such issues?

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:31.500
Ann Cooper: Yes. There will be up on the new
website, there's some other websites that

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.599
do have them all listed. We don't have them
listed on our website but we will have all

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:40.400
the information up there.

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:46.730
&gt;&gt; I have a question that relates to that.
It seemed to me for a long time that the real

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:51.280
way to victory on this is to make this a bipartisan
issue which of course it inherently is. It's

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:58.730
about children and it's very hard to meet
any elected official who doesn't understand

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:05.609
that that's fundamentally really the constituency.
Of course, it very quickly can become a political

00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:09.320
and bipartisan issue when I think grownups
get involved.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.380
Ann Cooper: [laughs]

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:16.859
&gt;&gt; And so I actually really would love to
see, you know, a way to get children speaking

00:41:16.859 --> 00:41:22.670
more actively and I challenge the people of
Google to help make this happen. To let children

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:26.579
more speak to their experience directly to
share their experiences with people and to

00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:30.329
be the advocates for this change,
because what we're seeing more and more is

00:41:30.329 --> 00:41:35.220
that these polarizing issues including healthcare
has become very, very difficult for people

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:41.640
to understand, for the electorates to understand,
for Democrats who originally thought it was

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:46.710
a great idea to understand, for Republicans
who felt that they were going to have to support

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:52.809
it to support it. Most people now feel, as
you said a moment ago, it's kind of dead in

00:41:52.809 --> 00:41:56.430
the water. You know, the children are incredibly
powerful here. They can cut through a lot

00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:02.270
of this but we have to find a way to give
them a voice.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:06.830
Ann Cooper: There's a couple of interesting
things happening. There is a couple of different

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:12.950
groups. One is the Healthy Schools Campaign
that are actually having kids do a set of

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:18.100
"Iron Chef" competitions and the winners of
the one in Chicago actually got to meet Sam

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:22.270
Kass, who is the chef at the White House,
or Michelle's chef and working on these issues.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:27.050
They actually just two days ago served the
winning recipe from this year at all the Chicago

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:32.069
schools so there is this group that's doing
that. The other thing that's happening is

00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:33.749
a video competition which is, what's the name
of it?

00:42:33.749 --> 00:42:35.080
&gt;&gt; The National Farm to School Network.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:45.930
Ann Cooper: The National Farm to School Network
is hosting a video competition and we are

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:49.711
part of the sponsors of this and they are
getting kids all across the country to make

00:42:49.711 --> 00:42:55.790
little videos and upload them about what their
school food is and what it should be so there's

00:42:55.790 --> 00:43:00.391
two projects that are going on right now,
and we are working with both of them.

00:43:00.391 --> 00:43:03.480
&gt;&gt; And that's on Youtube by the way.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:07.650
Ann Cooper: That's on Youtube? Yeah, okay.
That again is FarmtoSchool.org.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:15.910
Olivia Wu: Okay. A lot of data has already
been gathered. What we don't want to do at

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:25.079
Google is repeat any of that and a lot of
studies have been done, short of the one you're

00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:32.960
talking that connects academic performance
for that, but is there any area in data collection

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.000
that has not been done out there?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:44.480
Ann Cooper: Well, there has not been a really
unbiased national study done about what's

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:51.079
really happening in schools. On our website,
we are going to have areas where there's feasibility

00:43:51.079 --> 00:43:56.242
studies that have been done so you can see
them and a lot of this information will be

00:43:56.242 --> 00:44:02.420
on the Lunch Box site but what I don't think
has happened is a real comprehensive look

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:07.400
at what we are feeding our kids all across
the country. The School Nutrition Association

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.790
has done it, but not all school districts
are involved and they really have it bent

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:16.580
to make it look good, so I don't know that
we've ever collected really what kids are

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:21.410
eating. Like New York City, I think on the
New York Times today, New York City just changed

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:27.500
the fat content of the milk and saved, I don't
know, how many billions of calories, but we

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:31.660
shouldn't serve chocolate milk in schools
and we haven't been able to get chocolate

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.619
milk out of schools. So really understand
what we are feeding our kids and the health

00:44:36.619 --> 00:44:42.249
ramifications. I just don't think we've done
a good enough job figuring that piece out.

00:44:42.249 --> 00:44:48.540
&gt;&gt; You mentioned a list of people in Congress
who are friendly toward healthy food in the

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:54.619
schools. Have you identified people who are
less then friendly who are more on the agribusiness

00:44:54.619 --> 00:45:00.940
side and more to understand their argument
and their problems to be solved as well so

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.450
that hopefully it could be a bipartisan issue?

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:10.480
Ann Cooper: Well, I don't have that list but
it'd be pretty easy to make.

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.809
&gt;&gt; About half, right?

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:13.589
Ann Cooper: Yes. Nicole?

00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:19.521
Nicole &gt;&gt; Children Tips and La Vida Locavore
has a list of the unfriendlies on her website.

00:45:19.521 --> 00:45:26.900
Ann Cooper: Okay, so there's a website. LaVidaLocavore.org
and she has both the- for and against people.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:34.090
The people are not against healthy food for
kids but they are by in large from these states

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:39.500
where all of their money comes from corn or
soy, and there is basically not much good

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:44.240
you can do with GMA corn or soy except make
it into this stuff that goes into school food

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.791
or healthcare or things like that.

00:45:45.791 --> 00:45:55.359
&gt;&gt; Related question. Have we learned much
from the fight against tobacco and how to

00:45:55.359 --> 00:46:01.240
work with those states that are dependant
upon tobacco because there's been, as a child

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.410
of the 70's, tremendous progress in the last
thirty years.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:08.830
Ann Cooper: You know, Michael Pollan talks
about this issue a lot and you know, there's

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:17.119
a lot of people who talk about this big ad
and how it points into the cigarette smoking

00:46:17.119 --> 00:46:23.690
issue. The thing that comes up, and you hear
is the pushback all the time, is there is

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:29.700
nothing positive about smoking and you didn't
need to smoke. Everyone needs to eat and there's

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:37.800
this social component of that. There's a historical
component of that. There is the familiar component

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:43.710
of that and big business just keeps pushing
it as choices, choices, exercise, yet they

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:48.829
spend twenty billion dollars a year marketing
non nutrient foods to kids so I think a lot

00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:53.880
of people have thought how to connect these
and I do think, we've seen some people like

00:46:53.880 --> 00:47:00.210
trying to sue McDonalds and then now we have
these anti veggie laws where you can't sue.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:05.230
I don't know if you guys remember when Oprah
said that she wouldn't eat a hamburger again

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:09.170
from the National Cattlemen's Association
sued her for billions of dollars. She won

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:14.730
but it cost her a billion to win, you know
so there's these anti defamation for vegetable

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:23.069
laws so you can't say a food isn't good, you
know. It's crazy so people have sort of put

00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:30.090
their toe in. I think the way to go after
this and it's really hard to say you have

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:36.970
to sue the government, but I'd love to see
us think about a way to do a class action

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.349
suit against some of these big companies and
against the government that's feeding our

00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:51.290
kids that allows this food into schools, but
it's really hard to sue a government [laughs]

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.270
I want to do it! We can do it.[laughs]

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:57.690
&gt;&gt; Well, you and I have been talking for a
long time about suing the government and I'm

00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:58.690
in. I'm ready [laughs]

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:06.510
I'm just going to say maybe you want to mention
Kelly Brownell who recently had that pretty

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:12.420
interesting report that he issued. This is
a guy at Yale who is very interested in the

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:19.452
parallels between anti smoking sentiment and
the movement that grew up to really kind of

00:48:19.452 --> 00:48:20.452
take that over.

00:48:20.452 --> 00:48:22.239
Ann Cooper: But which report exactly?

00:48:22.239 --> 00:48:30.020
&gt;&gt; It's about nine months old and actually
I can just send it but it's pretty interesting

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:34.180
because it actually doesn't deal so much with
the litigious aspects as the cultural aspects

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:40.120
of marketing and it's really about the mistakes
that people in the food movement have made

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:44.870
and the mistakes that people in the tobacco
movement are making and how we can kind of

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:50.910
try to capitalize on it but I appreciated
his study because it was more nuanced and

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:55.720
it did deal of course with this huge problem,
which is that we all have to eat, but it really

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.920
tried to talk a lot about the kind of marketing
shifts.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.210
Ann Cooper: Well, one of things at one of
the studies that has just really recently

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:08.540
come out too is really finally proving this
thing about marketing to kids and that these

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:15.619
big companies are so focused on marketing
this non nutrient foods to kids and you know,

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:20.390
kids are basically brainwashed over this stuff,
but Kelly Brownell from the Rudd Center at

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:26.020
Yale has been studying obesity in kids and
adults for a long time and looking at all

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.020
of these issues.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:39.750
Olivia Wu: I want to bring the conversation
back around to just what you do on the ground

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:47.040
every day and what the kids are like. So describe
for me what a kid's lunch was starting with

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:52.750
chicken nuggets and then describe to us for
the dollar and the commodities that you got,

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:57.569
what kind of meals they got by the end of
your four year tenure at Berkeley.

00:49:57.569 --> 00:50:03.710
Ann Cooper: In Berkeley, we started with the
food I told you. The real crappy commodity

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:04.710
food.

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:08.100
Olivia Wu: So it was chicken nuggets, chocolate
milk.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.619
Ann Cooper: It was chicken nuggets, corn dogs,
extremo burritos, grilled cheese sandwiches,

00:50:12.619 --> 00:50:18.950
and pizza pockets and they are all pre frozen
and pre made things and they had chocolate

00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:24.930
milk and they had all kinds of sugary 'desserty'
things and stuff like that.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:27.210
Olivia Wu: So how many calories was a meal
like?

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:31.049
Ann Cooper&gt;&gt; A typical meal like that tends
to be about a thousand calories and it tends

00:50:31.049 --> 00:50:39.270
to be 2,000 milligrams of sodium which is
really more than a daily dose so that's what

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:40.270
it tends to be.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.420
Olivia Wu: And calories from fat?

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:48.700
Ann Cooper: Almost all. Like 60 percent calories
for that and usually a meal like that has

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.869
15 or 20 percent 'sat' fat even though the
law says ten.

00:50:51.869 --> 00:50:54.340
Olivia Wu: And then what was the change?

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.869
&gt;&gt; That's within guidelines, right?

00:50:55.869 --> 00:51:02.240
Ann Cooper: Well, it's going outside the guidelines.
There's no guidelines on sugar or sodium.

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:08.140
You are supposed to stay under 35 percent
fat and under 10 percent 'sat' fat but because

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:15.170
the way a lot of it works, some people don't
but you can balance it over the course of

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:19.710
a week, so then you feed them something else
that doesn't have so much fat one day and

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:23.819
you can balance out, so there's no law on
how much you can feed kids. There is also

00:51:23.819 --> 00:51:30.589
no maximum calorie count which is really,
really old and silly. They tell you that you

00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:38.270
can feed kids two to three thousand calories.
It's like, "Huh? Do you not know there's an

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:42.750
obesity crisis?" But again, their job is to
promote agriculture and the easiest way to

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:45.970
promote agriculture is corn and soy, because
that's what we grow in this country. So now

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:51.450
in Berkeley, although I haven't been there
this year but when I left last year, instead

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:55.730
of chicken nuggets there'd be roast chicken
and instead of tater tots, there'd be roast

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.880
potatoes. There'd be a fresh vegetable and
there were full salad bars in every school

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:06.880
every day, local organic milk. No desserts
and no high fructose corn syrup, no transfats,

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:13.550
all whole grains and that's the same way we
are walking towards in Boulder. We are certainly

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:18.890
not in Boulder where Berkeley ended up because
we are just beginning in it but there's a

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:22.069
lot of pushback from kids.
I mean, I just got an email today saying,

00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:28.200
"Why is it that we have to feed kids chicken
with bones?" and my comeback is, "Do you know

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:33.240
any chickens that are growing without bones?"
[laughs] and it's this crazy thing. Now that

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:36.990
we've convinced kids that chicken nuggets
are actually chicken, who decided that chicken

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:43.510
should be stars or giraffes or dinosaurs or
you know, fish? Chicken is chicken so why

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:48.890
shouldn't chicken come on the bone? But you
know, the idea that kids don't even know the

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:55.290
chicken has bones anymore and we are not supposed
to feed it to them. So in Boulder, our slowest

00:52:55.290 --> 00:53:00.500
day of the week now and we are working on
this in all kinds of ways, is chicken day

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:06.960
because kids don't know how to actually eat
chicken anymore and because they think chicken

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:13.430
nuggets is chicken, so it's a struggle to
make these changes and you know you would

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:19.210
think roast potatoes for tater tots but there's
lot of kids who haven't eaten a fresh roasted

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:25.970
potato, but they think that tater tots are
actually potatoes or that you know that instant

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:31.460
potato stuff is what mashed potatoes are supposed
to taste like so when we serve kids real mashed

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:35.781
potatoes, they go "Uggh!" and we make real
mac and cheese and the kids hate it, you know?

00:53:35.781 --> 00:53:39.780
One of our biggest complaints so far this
year is the mac and cheese and it's like,

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:45.990
"Okay, so we're cooking pasta and we've got
real cheddar cheese and we are making the

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:50.660
cheese." But you know, they are used to Kraft
and that yellow amato powder that you mix

00:53:50.660 --> 00:54:01.700
with water and put some little pasta stuff
in it, so it's a huge change for kids and

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:06.819
the other comment I got from kids is it's
not salty enough and this comes from the amount

00:54:06.819 --> 00:54:11.280
of salt they get in processed food versus
the amount of salt you'd actually salt something

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:17.589
with. So it's not salty enough, it's not spicy
enough because they are so used to this highly

00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:22.740
processed, really high sodium food. On the
other hand, what we are seeing now is kids

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:27.920
10 years old who have kidney stones, because
of all the sodium in food. I mean, this is

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:33.230
crazy. Ten year old kids now with kidney stones
and you know pre teen kids with high blood

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:38.440
pressure and heart disease and you know, it's
really awful.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:47.109
Olivia Wu: But on the other hand, the days
you would tell me about where a big bowl of

00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:51.760
Pink Lady organic apples disappeared. The
kids liked them?

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:57.240
Ann Cooper: Well, absolutely. I mean, in Berkeley
you had that model, you had cooking and gardening

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.150
classes in every single school. That hands
on experiencial learning is invaluable. You

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:06.740
got to have a way to touch the kids but by
the end of the Berkeley project, or by the

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:11.049
time I left, because it's ongoing and sustainable,
I mean kids were really eating the food and

00:55:11.049 --> 00:55:15.920
the participation went up over three times.
When I started, we were doing about 500 thousand

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.430
meals a year and I think they are going hit
almost two million this year so we really

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:25.460
grew participation. The kids are eating. They
eat food, they eat vegetables, they eat off

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:29.390
the salad bar. You know, not every kids eats
great every day but when you work with the

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:33.482
kids, it's a process. I often say it takes
ten years. You got to get the kids when they

00:55:33.482 --> 00:55:37.119
are young and get them through high school
because if you just start in the middle, it's

00:55:37.119 --> 00:55:38.119
really hard.

00:55:38.119 --> 00:55:42.660
&gt;&gt; Okay, actually that's a great opportunity
for me to stand up. Why start in school? What

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:48.420
about first fives? What about earlier? What
about preschool? You know, you are starting

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:53.030
with children who've already had years of
exposure to chicken nuggets shaped like dinosaurs

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:58.180
and apples that were pre cut in a bag. Why
didn't you start in preschools and get them

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.359
eating healthy there?

00:55:59.359 --> 00:56:03.930
Ann Cooper: We actually, in Berkeley and in
Boulder where preschools are involved with

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:10.150
the public school system, we do but as an
entry point the public school system is where

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:15.579
we feed the most kids and because that system
is where we're actually paid, there is money

00:56:15.579 --> 00:56:19.960
available to do that so I'm not at all saying
we shouldn't start with younger kids. It's

00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:26.180
just the entry point that I think is one we
can use but most schools are actually starting

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:31.299
with pre kindergarten and stuff like that
so you do have an option. The thing about

00:56:31.299 --> 00:56:35.849
a lot of the preschools is that they end before
lunch, a lot of preschools are half day so

00:56:35.849 --> 00:56:39.119
we are trying to get into the schools with
breakfast so I absolutely agree. I mean, not

00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:43.130
only you can touch the kids, the more you
can touch the parents. I mean, we go to every

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:48.329
PTA meeting, these calendars are an unbelievable
marketing tool. I mean the marketing, marketing,

00:56:48.329 --> 00:56:55.809
marketing talking to parents. I mean, it's
hard. I met with a bunch of the leaders of

00:56:55.809 --> 00:57:00.760
the Hispanic community in Boulder a couple
of days ago and getting them to understand

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:09.569
why it's so important and why we really have
to do this is a process. It takes time and

00:57:09.569 --> 00:57:10.569
it's not easy.

00:57:10.569 --> 00:57:17.550
Olivia Wu: So an interesting point for discussion
later on in a sense. If you want to fight

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:22.720
the fight, we need to maybe start with the
preschool and consider that this generation

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:29.980
of high school kids is lost and focus there.
So, thank you for coming and thank you so

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:36.920
much, Ann, and I know most of us will be continuing
with this discussion for the next two hours.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.039
Thank you so much.

00:57:38.039 --> 00:57:39.039
Ann Cooper: Thank you.

00:57:39.039 --> 00:57:39.150
