were to be able to view everything it
 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.769
were to be able to view everything it
would know who you call

really has a very good it has the
 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.120
really has a very good it has the
potential to have a really good

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130

understanding of who you are and what
you're up to when people think about

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260
you're up to when people think about
 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.950
you're up to when people think about
their feelings a lot of times people

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960
their feelings a lot of times people
 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.980
their feelings a lot of times people
feel like feelings are really ephemeral

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:38.990
feel like feelings are really ephemeral
 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.380
feel like feelings are really ephemeral
or that it's just a very sort of

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390
or that it's just a very sort of
 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.260
or that it's just a very sort of
personal thing well it turns out that

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270
personal thing well it turns out that
 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.330
personal thing well it turns out that
our feelings actually do have signals

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340
our feelings actually do have signals
 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.330
our feelings actually do have signals
that show up in things like our heart

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340
that show up in things like our heart
 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.090
that show up in things like our heart
rate variability or our galvanic skin

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100
rate variability or our galvanic skin
 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.630
rate variability or our galvanic skin
response and so there's actually signal

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640
response and so there's actually signal
 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.730
response and so there's actually signal
to our feelings and so what's starting

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:57.740
to our feelings and so what's starting
 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.860
to our feelings and so what's starting
to happen is we're starting to have the

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870
to happen is we're starting to have the
 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.000
to happen is we're starting to have the
ability to pick up the biological

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010
ability to pick up the biological
 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.910
ability to pick up the biological
signals from various mental states

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920
signals from various mental states
 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.130
signals from various mental states
stress is probably the easiest one and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140
stress is probably the easiest one and
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.139
stress is probably the easiest one and
then another thing is that people feel

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149
then another thing is that people feel
 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.959
then another thing is that people feel
like human psychology is very ephemeral

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969
like human psychology is very ephemeral
 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.080
like human psychology is very ephemeral
- like we all like to think that we're

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090
- like we all like to think that we're
 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.910
- like we all like to think that we're
completely unique and special snowflakes

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920
completely unique and special snowflakes
 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.270
completely unique and special snowflakes
and while you know each snowflake has

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280
and while you know each snowflake has
 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.149
and while you know each snowflake has
its own story like my my mother is a

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159
its own story like my my mother is a
 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.010
its own story like my my mother is a
different person than your mother I grew

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020
different person than your mother I grew
 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.330
different person than your mother I grew
up in a different neighborhood than you

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340
up in a different neighborhood than you
 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.459
up in a different neighborhood than you
did when you start to take the data from

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469
did when you start to take the data from
 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.969
did when you start to take the data from
our digital exhaust it actually is very

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979
our digital exhaust it actually is very
 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.469
our digital exhaust it actually is very
very good at predicting what we're

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479
very good at predicting what we're
 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.050
very good at predicting what we're
interested in which is also a good proxy

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060
interested in which is also a good proxy
 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.279
interested in which is also a good proxy
for human psychology and so you know a

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289
for human psychology and so you know a
 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.559
for human psychology and so you know a
good place to ask oneself is like is

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569
good place to ask oneself is like is
 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.690
good place to ask oneself is like is
this science fiction or is it real would

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
this science fiction or is it real would
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.419
this science fiction or is it real would

your eye even if you don't click on it
 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.710
your eye even if you don't click on it
and also there's a lot of research

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720
and also there's a lot of research
 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.140
and also there's a lot of research
that's going into micro facial

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150
that's going into micro facial
 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.280
that's going into micro facial
recognition

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290
recognition
 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.860

can use to really see the effectiveness

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209
can use to really see the effectiveness
 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.479

of their ads we have you know over a

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489
of their ads we have you know over a

hundred facial expressions only nine of
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.699
hundred facial expressions only nine of
which we control and so these things are

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709
which we control and so these things are
 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.880
which we control and so these things are
great at picking up our emotion what we

great at picking up our emotion what we
 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.119
great at picking up our emotion what we
like what we don't like and if you add

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129
like what we don't like and if you add
 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.940
like what we don't like and if you add
that into a lot of data about what sites

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950

hands of a consumer so that they can
 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.460
hands of a consumer so that they can
understand themselves better because we

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470
understand themselves better because we
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.160
understand themselves better because we
aren't actually really good

we're up to over time it's one of the

we're up to over time it's one of the
 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.520
we're up to over time it's one of the
reasons why behavior change is such a

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530
reasons why behavior change is such a
 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.740
reasons why behavior change is such a
hard task like it's actually hard to

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
hard task like it's actually hard to
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.379
hard task like it's actually hard to
change your behavior to take that and

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389
change your behavior to take that and
 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.530
change your behavior to take that and
use that to harness that for you so you

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540
use that to harness that for you so you
 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.530
use that to harness that for you so you
