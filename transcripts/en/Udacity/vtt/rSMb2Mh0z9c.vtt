00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.600
In this final lesson, we focused on six different

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.540
professions that use genetic information to a different extent

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.550
in their day to day jobs. And we've also

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.490
looked at the societal implications of having personal genetic

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.010
information. Let's see if we can summarize these major

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.920
concepts into four main points. Point one, institutional medical

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.730
and scientific research has not always been conducted in

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.860
ethical ways. Point two, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.560
signed into law in the United States in 2008 to allay fears about the misuse of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.030
personal genetic information. Point three, we've discussed six

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.020
different professions that use genetics in their day

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.410
to day jobs to a varying degree. For

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.400
example, a bioethicist, a computational biologist, a director

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.900
of clinical operations, a genetic counselor. A genetic

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.058
genealogist, and a human genetics researcher. And Point four,

00:00:51.058 --> 00:00:55.700
as the future of personal genetics fast approaches, it's important

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.150
that the public understanding of science with regards to this kind

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.490
of personal genetics technology advances. If we want to make

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.130
ensure that we make the best possible decisions as a society.
