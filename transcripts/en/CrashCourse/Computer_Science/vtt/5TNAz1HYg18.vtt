00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.040
Hi, I’m Carrie Anne, and welcome to Crash
Course Computer Science!

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.219
We’re here: the final episode!

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.080
If you’ve watched the whole series, hopefully you’ve developed a newfound appreciation

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.700
for the incredible breadth of computing applications and topics.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.410
It’s hard to believe we’ve worked up from
mere transistors and logic gates, all the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.460
way to computer vision, machine learning,
robotics and beyond.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.750
We’ve stood on the shoulders of giants like
Babbage and Lovelace, Hollerith and Turing,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.770
Eckert and Hopper, Sutherland and Engelbart, Bush and Berners Lee, Gates and the Woz, and

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.739
many other computing pioneers.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.079
My biggest hope is that these episodes have inspired you to learn more about how these

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.540
subjects affect your life.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.100
Maybe you’ll even pick up programming or
choose a career in computing.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.100
It’s awesome!

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.840
It’s also a skill of the future.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.140
I said in the very first episode that computer science isn’t magic, but it sort of is!

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.120
Knowing how to use and program computers is sorcery of the 21st century.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.400
Instead of incantations and spells, it’s
scripts and code.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.380
Those who know how to wield that tremendous power will be able to craft great things,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.620
not just to improve their own lives, but also
their communities and humanity at large.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.480
Computing is also going to be literally everywhere – not just the computers we see today, sitting

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.780
on desks and countertops, and carried in pockets and bags – but inside every object imaginable.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.980
Inside all your kitchen appliances, embedded in your walls, nanotagged in your food, woven

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.940
into your clothes, and floating around inside your body.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.440
This is the vision of the field of Ubiquitous
Computing.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.500
In some ways, it’s already here, and in
other ways, we’ve got many decades to go.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.160
Some might view this eventuality as dystopian, with computers everywhere surveilling us and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.960
competing for our attention.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.360
But the late Mark Weiser, who articulated
this idea in the 1990s, saw the potential

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360
very differently:

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.340
“For [fifty] years, most interface design,
and most computer design, has been headed

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.580
down the path of the "dramatic" machine.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.700
Its highest idea is to make a computer so
exciting, so wonderful, so interesting, that

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.300
we never want to be without it.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.420
A less-traveled path I call the "invisible";
its highest idea is to make a computer so

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.530
imbedded, so fitting, so natural, that we
use it without even thinking about it …

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.700
The most profound technologies are those that disappear.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.700
They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it."

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.360
That doesn’t describe computing of today
– where people sit for hours upon end in

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.540
front of computer monitors, and social media notifications interrupt us at dinner.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.460
But, it could describe computing of the future, our final topic.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:32.420
INTRO

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.060
When people think of computing in the future, they often jump right to Artificial Intelligence.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.290
No doubt there will be tremendous strides
made in AI in the coming years, but not everything

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.930
will be, or need to be, AI-powered.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.030
Your car might have an AI to self-drive, but
the door locks might continue to be powered

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.200
by what are essentially if-statements.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.880
AI technology is just as likely to enhance
existing devices, like cars, as it is to open

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.880
up entirely new product categories.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.440
The exact same thing happened with the advent of electrical power – lightbulbs replaced candles.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.300
But electrification also led to the
creation of hundreds of new electrically-powered gadgets.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.420
And of course, we still have candles today.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.340
It’s most likely that AI will be yet another
tool that computer scientists can draw upon

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.359
to tackle problems.

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.650
What really gets people thinking, and sometimes sweating, is whether Artificial Intelligence

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.709
will surpass human intelligence.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.960
This is a really tricky question for a multitude of reasons, including most immediately:

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.240
“what is intelligence?”

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.400
On one hand, we have computers that can drive cars, recognize songs with only a few seconds of audio,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.400
translate dozens of languages, and totally dominate at games like chess, Jeopardy, and Go.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.820
That sounds pretty smart!

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.280
But on the other hand, computers fail at some basic tasks, like walking up steps, folding

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.420
laundry, understanding speech at a cocktail
party, and feeding themselves.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.680
We’re a long way from Artificial Intelligence
that’s as general purpose and capable as a human.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.100
With intelligence being somewhat hard to quantify, people prefer to characterize computers and

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.280
creatures by their processing power instead, but that’s a pretty computing-centric view of intelligence.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.760
Nonetheless, if we do this exercise, plotting
computers and processors we’ve talked about

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.340
in this series, we find that computing today
has very roughly equivalence in calculating

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.939
power to that of a mouse...

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.590
which, to be fair, also can’t fold laundry,
although that would be super cute!

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.919
Human calculating power is up here, another 10 to the 5, or 100,000 times more powerful

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.210
than computers today.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.190
That sounds like a big gap, but with the rate of change in computing technologies, we might

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.680
meet that point in as early as a decade, even though processor speeds are no longer following

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.540
Moore’s Law, like we discussed in Episode
17.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.190
If this trend continues, computers would have more processing power, slash intelligence,

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.780
than the sum total of all human brains combined before the end of this century.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.800
And this could snowball as such systems need less human input, with an artificial superintelligence

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.229
designing and training new versions of itself.

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.280
This runaway technological growth, especially with respect to an intelligence explosion,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.250
is called the singularity.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.860
The term was first used by our old friend
from Episode 10, John von Neumann, who said:

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.460
"The accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, give the

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.379
appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.740
affairs, as we know them, could not continue."

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.260
And Von Neumann suggested this back in the 1950s, when computers were trillions of times

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.710
slower than they are today.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.220
Sixty years later, though, the singularity
is still just a possibility on the horizon.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.160
Some experts believe this progress is going to level off, and be more of an S curve than

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.800
an exponential one, where as complexity increases, it becomes more difficult to make additional progress.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.220
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen calls it a
“complexity brake”.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.040
But, as a thought experiment, let’s just
say that superintelligent computers will emerge.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.960
What that would mean for humanity is a hotly debated topic.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.700
There are people who eagerly await it, and those who are already working to stop it from happening.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.820
Probably the most immediate effect would be technological unemployment, where workers

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.460
in many job sectors are rendered obsolete
by computers – like AIs and Robots – that

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.870
can do their work better and for less pay.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.520
Although computers are new, this effect is
not.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.840
Remember Jacquard's Loom from Episode 10?

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.020
That automated the task of skilled textile
workers back in the 1800s, which led to riots.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.800
Also, back then, most of the population of
the US and Europe were farmers.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.060
That’s dropped to under 5% today, due to
advances like synthetic fertilizers and tractors.

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.720
More modern examples include telephone switchboard operators being replaced with automatic switchboards

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.940
in 1960, and robotic arms replacing human
painters in car factories in the 1980s.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.471
And the list goes on and on.

00:06:31.471 --> 00:06:34.409
On one hand, these were jobs lost to automation.

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:39.331
And on the other hand, clothes, food, bicycles, toys, and a myriad of other products are all

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.480
plentiful today because they can be cheaply produced thanks to computing.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.960
But, experts argue that AI, robots and computing technologies in general, are going to be even

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.380
more disruptive than these historical examples.

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.010
Jobs, at a very high level, can be summarized along two dimensions.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:59.340
First, jobs can be either more manual – like
assembling toys – or more cognitive – like

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.580
picking stocks.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.840
These jobs can also be routine – the same
tasks over and over again – or non-routine

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.780
– where tasks vary and workers need to problem solve and be creative.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.969
We already know that routine-manual jobs can be automated by machines.

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:16.669
It has already happened for some jobs and
is happening right now for others.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.100
What’s getting people worried is that non-routine manual jobs, like cooks, waiters and security

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.189
guards, may get automated too.

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:27.699
And the same goes for routine cognitive work, like customer service agents, cashiers, bank

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:29.419
tellers, and office assistants.

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:33.199
That leaves us with just one quadrant that
might be safe, at least for a little while:

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.900
non-routine cognitive work, which includes
professions like teachers and artists, novelists

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.880
and lawyers, and doctors and scientists.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.820
These types of jobs encompass roughly 40% of the US workforce.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.100
That leaves 60% of jobs vulnerable to automation.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.500
People argue that technological unemployment at this scale would be unprecedented and catastrophic,

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.260
with most people losing their jobs.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.500
Others argue that this will be great, freeing
people from less interesting jobs to pursue

00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:03.479
better ones, all while enjoying a higher standard of living with the bounty of food and products

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:06.720
that will result from computers and robots
doing most of the hard work.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.419
No one really knows how this is going to shake out, but if history is any guide, it’ll

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.220
probably be ok in the long run.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.880
Afterall, no one is advocating that 90% of
people go back to farming and weaving textiles

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.560
by hand.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.080
The tough question, which politicians are
now discussing, is how to handle hopefully-short-term

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.040
economic disruption, for millions of people
that might be suddenly out of a job.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.920
Beyond the workplace, computers are also very likely to change our bodies.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.349
For example, futurist Ray Kurzweil believes
that “The Singularity will allow us to transcend

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:38.469
[the] limitations of our biological bodies
and brains.

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:40.219
We will gain power over our fates.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:42.709
... We will be able to live as long as we
want.

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:47.370
We will fully understand human thinking and will vastly extend and expand its reach.”

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.130
Transhumanists see this happening in the form of cyborgs, where humans and technology merge,

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.200
enhancing our intellect and physiology.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.470
There are already brain computer interfaces in use today.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:01.690
And wearable computers, like Google Glass
and Microsoft Hololens, are starting to blur

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:02.440
the line too.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.960
There are also people who foresee "Digital
Ascension", which, in the words of Jaron Lanier,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.600
“would involve people dying in the flesh
and being uploaded into a computer and remaining conscious".

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.080
This transition from biological to digital
beings might end up being our next evolutionary step...

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:26.800
and a new level of abstraction.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.520
Others predict humans staying largely human, but with superintelligent computers as a benevolent

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.740
force, emerging as a caretaker for humanity – running all the farms, curing diseases,

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.160
directing robots to pick-up trash, building
new homes and many other functions.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.060
This would allow us to simply enjoy our time on this lovely pale blue dot.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.940
Still others view AI with more suspicion – why would a superintelligent AI waste its time

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.300
taking care of us?

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.200
It’s not like we’ve taken on the role
of being the benevolent caretaker of ants.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.860
So maybe this play out like so many Sci-Fi
movies where we’re at war with computers,

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.829
our own creation having turned on us.

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:05.420
It’s impossible to know what the future
holds, but it’s great that this discussion

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.720
and debate is already happening, so as these technologies emerge, we can plan and react intelligently.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.100
What’s much more likely, regardless of whether you see computers as future friend or foe,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.240
is that they will outlive humanity.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.120
Many futurists and science fiction writers
have speculated that computers will head out

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.120
into space and colonize the galaxy, ambivalent to time scales, radiation, and all that other

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.440
stuff that makes long-distance space travel
difficult for us humans.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.120
And when the sun is burned up and the Earth is space dust, maybe our technological children

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.160
will be hard at work exploring every nook
and cranny of the universe, hopefully in honor

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.170
of their parents’ tradition to build knowledge,improve the state of the universe, and to boldly go

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:44.970
where no one has gone before!

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.720
In the meantime, computers have a long way to go, and computer scientists are hard at

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.980
work advancing all of the topics we talked
about over the past forty episodes.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.940
In the next decade or so, we’ll likely see
technologies like virtual and augmented reality,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.820
self-driving vehicles, drones, wearable computers, and service robots go mainstream.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:08.700
The internet will continue to evolve new services, stream new media, and connect people in different ways.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.000
New programming languages and paradigms will be developed to facilitate the creation of

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.780
new and amazing software.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:20.800
And new hardware will make complex operations blazingly fast, like neural networks and 3D graphics.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.500
Personal computers are also ripe for innovation, perhaps shedding their forty-year old desktop

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:30.160
metaphor and being reborn as omnipresent and lifelong virtual assistants.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:34.320
And there’s so much we didn’t get to talk
about in this series, like cryptocurrencies,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.140
wireless communication, 3D printing, bioinformatics, and quantum computing.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:44.220
We’re in a golden age of computing and there’s so much going on, it’s impossible to summarize.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.070
But most importantly, you can be a part of
this amazing transformation and challenge,

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.680
by learning about computing, and taking what’s arguably humanity’s greatest invention,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.760
to make the world a better place.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.240
Thanks for watching.
