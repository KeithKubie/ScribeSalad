00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.129
The moon is just sitting there, waiting for
us to go back.

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.780
It has resources, opportunities for science
and discovery, and Google's XPRIZE gives companies

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.390
cash to get up there.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.109
Hey guys it's Trace with your Weekly DNews
Space Update -- and holy wah, Google XPRIZE.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.269
If you're not familiar with the XPrize, it's
one of the ways Google is incentivizing other

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.410
companies to literally reach for the stars,
or in this case, the moon.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.310
The search giant hopes to inspire "engineers
and entrepreneurs from around the world to

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.800
develop low-cost methods of robotic space
exploration."

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.960
The winner will be awarded $40 million dollars,
but there are other prizes as well.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.800
The promise of the XPrize is what helped foster
SpaceShipOne; the first, manned private spacecraft

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.170
in 2004.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.680
This week, Google announced the five finalists
who will compete for some of the OTHER prizes

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.230
along the way to that $40 million dollar GRAND
prize.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.620
They're calling them "milestone prizes."

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.100
The finalists are from around the world, but
they're also from previously successful spacefaring

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.100
nations.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.760
Two US companies, and one each from Japan,
Germany, and India.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.340
From now until September, each company will
attempt to outdo the others in three areas...

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.690
ONE: land a robot on the moon successfully
-- that ALONE nets a cool million bucks.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.040
TWO: drive the robot 500 meters on the lunar
surface -- for that you get $500-Kay.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.550
and THREE: the robot must create two "'Mooncasts'
consisting of high-quality images and video

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.600
on the lunar surface."

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.130
This might seem like low-hanging fruit for
any lunar mission, but the point isn't to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.490
break boundaries of exploration, but for non-governments
to be on a level playing field to compete!

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.360
Lowering the cost of space travel for everyone
in the long run.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.060
It's important to note, the teams don't actually
have to PHYSICALLY COMPLETE the tasks to win

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.060
the prizes.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.910
Yes, the winner of the GRAND prize has to
ACTUALLY COMPLETE these tasks, but the Milestone

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.060
Awards are about testing and analysis.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.549
It's not a space race, it's a battle of ideas.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.810
Competitors will demonstrate their hardware
and software to test which of them can produce

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.610
the most creative, simplest and affordable
solution.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.340
From there, an international panel of expert
judges will determine the winners and award

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.610
the milestone prize.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.220
It's not even necessary to attempt the GRAND
prize to win the Milestone prizes, and so

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.910
the companies are already competing on the
battlefield of ideas.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.300
A company called 'Astrobotic' is hoping to
tap the wealthy public for additional support

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.440
-- promising the ability to ship a package
onboard their robot!

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.440
Just think, if scientists could afford it,
there could be new lunar experiments launched

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.440
in the next YEAR!

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.500
Or, maybe we could have a Coach bag dropped
onto the lunar surface...?

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500
Maybe?

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.530
Have any lunar launch ideas?

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.940
We'd love to hear 'em so head down and type
my little space monkies!

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.940
Type!

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.200
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next Friday
with another Weekly DNews Space Update.
