00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.360
 I can be in prison I think 

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.240
 it's time to stop these lawsuits 

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.770
 that these people be because they have 

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.480
 contributed to the fall of a jim dictatorship 

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:28.220
