HUCKABEE-PROCLAIMED SECOND
COMING OF M.L.K. KIM DAVIS WENT

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.009 line:91%
BACK TO WORK TODAY TO DO WHAT
AMERICANS DO BEST -- AVOID

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:11.911 align:start position:0% line:85%
ACTUAL WORK.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:15.148 line:91%
&gt;&gt; KIM DAVIS TOLD THE MEDIA SHE
WILL NOT AUTHORIZE LICENSES ON

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.316 align:start position:0% line:85%
HER FIRST DAY BACK.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.386 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ANY UNAUTHORIZED LICENSE THAT
THEY ISSUE WILL NOT HAVE MY

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.423 align:start position:0% line:91%
NAME, MY TITLE OR MY AUTHORITY
ON IT.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.626 line:91%
INSTEAD, THE LICENSE WILL STATE
THAT THEY ARE ISSUED PURSUANT TO

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.064 align:start position:0% line:85%
A FEDERAL COURT ORDER.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.766 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
KIM DAVIS IS COLLECTING A

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.701 line:91%
GOVERNMENT PAYCHECK IN ORDER TO
SIT AROUND AND LET EVERYONE ELSE

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.871 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO ALL THE WORK?

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:48.548 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THOUGHT WE CALLED PEOPLE LIKE
THAT WELFARE QUEENS...

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.850 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY!

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.885 line:91%
UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE A BIGOTRY
HYDRA, YOU CUT OFF ONE HEAD AND

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:55.354 align:start position:0% line:85%
MORE SPRING UP.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.957 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE ARE 12 OTHER CLERKS AND
JUDGES IN KENTUCKY,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.827 align:start position:0% line:91%
NORTH CAROLINA AND ALABAMA
COPY-CATTING KIM DAVIS'

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.696 align:start position:0% line:85%
STRATEGY.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.731 line:91%
ONE CLERK EVEN RODE HIS BIKE
ACROSS THE STATE IN SUPPORT OF

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:10.570 align:start position:0% line:85%
HER.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:15.341 size:78% position:39% line:85%
RODE HIS BIKE? GOOD LORD!

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:20.213 line:91%
I TELL YOU THIS -- THERE IS NO
WAY IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE THAN HOW

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:25.218 align:start position:0% line:91%
I CHOSE TO
SUPPORT FOR "THE STRAIN" BY

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.486 align:start position:0% line:91%
SPACE-BOARDING DOWN THE WEST
SIDE HIGHWAY.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.687 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WAS NOT EASY.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.655 line:91%
SO KIM DAVIS IS NOT ALONE, AND
THAT'S AWFUL BECAUSE, DESPITE

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:32.125 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT SHE SAYS, THIS ISN'T ABOUT
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.160 line:91%
IT'S ABOUT USING RELIGION AS AN
EXCUSE TO DENY SOMEONE ELSE'S

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:37.630 align:start position:0% line:85%
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:44.203 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: ALL RIGHT?

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:45.705 line:91%
AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO AWESOME
WHEN I FOUND OUT THESE GUYS WERE

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:46.939 align:start position:0% line:85%
GETTING INVOLVED.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.576 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT
THIS GROUP OF HEAVILY ARMED MEN.

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:57.683 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY CALL THEMSELVES
OATHKEEPERS.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:01:58.584 align:start position:0% line:85%
P.D.

00:01:58.617 --> 00:01:59.385 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST ABOUT KEEPING
PEOPLE SAFE.

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:00.252 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: UM...

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.587 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK JAMES BLAKE COULD USE
YOUR HELP.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.056 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THE BROTHER THAT LOOKS LIKE
JAMES BLAKE.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:07.960 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:09.595 line:91%
SO THESE OATHKEEPERS ARE A GROUP
OF PEOPLE WHO COME HEAVILY ARMED

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:11.230 line:91%
TO AWKWARD CIVIC CONFRONTATIONS
WITH THE INTENT OF PROTECTING

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE CONSTITUTION.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.570 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE THE WHITE
BLACK PANTHERS.

00:02:17.603 --> 00:02:21.641 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY, THEY'D BE
WHITE PANTHERS, WHICH WOULD

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.776 line:85%
TECHNICALLY BE SNOW LEOPARDS.

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:33.819 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, I COULD GO ON, BUT WE'D

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:42.895 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, I COULD GO ON, BUT WE'D

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:44.330 align:start position:0% line:91%
JUST GO INTO A LINGUISTIC SPIRAL
AND THIS BIT WOULD NEVER END.

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:45.464 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S JUST CALL THEM WHITE
LIONS.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:46.598 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:47.666 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SO THESE ALBINO TIGERS HAVE
TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:48.867 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROTECT KIM DAVIS BECAUSE "SHE"
IS THE VICTIM HERE.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.069 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT THE PEOPLE WHOSE ACTUAL
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ARE BEING

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:51.203 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRAMPLED ALL OVER.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.906 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SO WHAT DO THESE IVORY PUMAS
HAVE TO SAY FOR THEMSELVES?

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.111 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE ISSUE IS STILL THAT A
JUDGE TOOK AN ELECTED OFFICIAL,

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:03.482 line:91%
A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES
AND DETAINED THEM WITHOUT CAUSE.

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:05.885 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WITHOUT CAUSE?

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:07.853 line:91%
LOOK, KIM DAVIS WAS PUT IN JAIL
BECAUSE A JUDGE LEGALLY HELD HER

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:09.956 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN CONTEMPT OF COURT.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.390 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARM THEMSELVES TO
PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION, YOU

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:15.294 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOULD TRY READING IT.

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:17.330 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR
PRESENCE TO BE KNOWN BECAUSE

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.131 line:85%
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF MARRIAGE.

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:22.501 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, IT IS AN ISSUE
OF MARRIAGE.

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:25.905 line:85%
DON'T TRY TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.373 line:91%
THIS IS ALL ABOUT SOMEBODY USING
RELIGION BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:28.941 align:start position:0% line:85%
GAY MARRIAGE.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:32.245 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND BY THE WAY, GAY COUPLES ARE
LITERALLY EXERCISING THEIR

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:46.058 line:91%
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO TAKE AN
OATH OF MARRIAGE, YOU ALLABASTER

00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.827 align:start position:0% line:85%
MOUNTAIN CATS!

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.397 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.500 align:start position:0% line:91%
GROUP, JOINING ME NOW FROM

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:18.557 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELL, ISN'T THAT THE
PURPOSE OF THE POLICE?

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.893 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, APPARENTLY THE PURPOSE OF
THE POLICE IS TO ARREST KIM

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:23.029 line:85%
DAVIS FOR DOING NOTHING WRONG.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:25.331 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH, WE'LL FIGHT THE SHERIFF
IF WE HAVE TO!
