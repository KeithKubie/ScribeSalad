00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.680
Probably on the day that that you won,

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.469
Oliver, and you were on the front page of the Globe

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.660
there were a fair number of people

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.490
who if they had seen you that day would

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.740
recognize you but, it's not like

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.410
being a rock star, largely your

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.630
forgotten. In a way, there is something a

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.680
bit strange about the whole thing

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.900
because, you know, I'm the same person I

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.870
was the day before. Suddenly demand has

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.020
gone from zero to quite high. I've never

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.070
actually been able to bring myself to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.829
tell a fully booked restaurant [laughing]

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.070
that maybe they want to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.359
give me a seat.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:44.399
My work has been particularly about how

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.109
in a situation where you can't specify

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.649
everything, it's important,

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.839
who has the right to decide on the

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.079
things which are left out. When you make

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.269
a discovery or you do a piece of work,

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.370
you might be very excited, but you don't

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.750
know that anybody else is going to take

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.440
it up.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.810
Eric is an extraordinarily talented

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.000
person, he's a multi-talented person,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.110
which I'm not.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.330
He's a fantastic musician, because I've heard

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.120
him play, he's a great cook,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.030
he's a formidable arguer, which I've

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.810
discovered to my cost, sometimes. And I'm

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.070
not like that [laughing]. The argument

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.910
part you are.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.060
Yes, yes, I like to argue, but I knew

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.580
no economics and I was rather frustrated

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.110
when I had political arguments with

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.210
people. They sort of introduced some

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.130
economic idea and at that point, I lost the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.050
argument that I had no idea what balance

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.220
of payments or something,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.920
I just didn't know what it was. And so I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.350
thought well you know, you can kill two

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.840
birds with one stone. In my day,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.170
Perry Mason was a very popular TV show

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.260
and I thought being able to win all your

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.430
cases and get innocent people off was

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.000
a great line of work, so I was either

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.719
going to do that or play the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:14.899
clarinet.
