JOHN ZERATSKY: My name
is John Zeratsky.

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.950
I'm a User Experience Designer
at YouTube where I work

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.890
on tools for video
creators and curators.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.410
Before that I was working on
advertising tools at Google.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.040
And prior to that I was working
for a start-up in Chicago

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.669
called FeedBurner, which
is where I met my

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.069
friend Matt Shobe.

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:17.841
MATT SHOBE: Hi, I'm Matt Shobe.

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.759
I was one of the co-founders
with FeedBurner and I was our

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.340
Director of User Experience.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.640
All aspects of user experience
involved in from designing on

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.469
the front end to writing a lot
of the copy for the site.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.539
A lot of communication.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.779
Lot of explaining to do at
various parts of FeedBurner

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.519
and also providing
direct customer support.

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.850
So the end to end user
experience was a big part of my

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.570
and John's lives at that time.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.870
And I think the principles,
tips, techniques, bits, and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.670
pieces we've got to talk about
with you today-- although we

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.480
really derived those during
this kind of startupy

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.299
experience with FeedBurner we
feel that they apply to

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.979
whatever size organization
you might be from.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.920
From four guys in a van all the
way up to a major corporation.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.490
So I think they should
work fairly well for that

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.950
purpose and are we bit.ly?

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.339
There we go.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.509
The back-channel as I think
all these talks have.

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.570
There it is so hop in and
we'll look forward to

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.790
the questions later.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.690
Take it away.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.040
JOHN ZERATSKY: All right, so
as we said this is a talk

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.740
about user experience.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.090
It's not exactly a
talk about design.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.310
At least not in the
traditional sense.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.810
So what's the difference?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020
When most people think about
user experience they think

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.030
about usability, user interface
design, interaction design.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.820
And these are very
important things.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.950
I mean, this is what we do most
of the time in our day jobs and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.350
it also makes up the core of
the experience that people

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.820
have using your products.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.360
But it doesn't end there.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.150
There's so many other things
that affect the user experience

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.470
that don't fall into
that category of design.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.009
And that's what we want
to talk about today.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.570
So we've get seven principles
and a handful of concrete tips

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.899
scattered throughout that will
have you create experiences

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.030
that will delight and serve
and engage your users.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.009
And there are things that you
can do even if nobody in your

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.649
organization has designer
in their job title.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.694
We think that these are tips
that anyone could use.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.630
So the first one is simple, but
it's very, very important.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.529
Which is why we start out
with it, is to be fast.

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:13.250
And one of the reasons we like
to talk about this first is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.139
that it kind of emphasizes the
point we're trying to make

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.529
here, which is that you've got
these technical factors that

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:21.779
impact the user experience.

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.210
They don't fall under the
umbrella of design, but they

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.080
really, really matter to the
people who are using

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.169
your software.

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.719
So our first tip is
to focus on latency.

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:32.739
Basic stuff.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.099
Pages should load quickly.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.400
Users shoud get immediate
feedback when they

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.300
do something.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.389
Your app should feel
snappy, generally.

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.579
And it's not just about
user experience.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.369
This stuff can have a big
impact on your business.

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.689
We've got a case study
here from Mozilla.

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.249
Who recently optimized their
download page for Firefox.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.059
The only change that they made
is they shaved about two

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:55.609
seconds off the page load time.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.209
They didn't change
the way it looked.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.030
They didn't change the way
it worked, this is the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.199
only thing they did.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.869
And what was the result?

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:05.819
They saw download conversions
improve by 15%, over 15%.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.039
So this is an example of
the impact of latency.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:14.069
It's not only on user
experience, but on business.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.989
And you can check out they got
a blog post about this if you

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.184
follow that bit.ly link there.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.749
Of course speed is very
important to Google.

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.899
Part of why people like
Google is that it's fast.

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.809
Search results load quickly
and you get to where

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:29.364
you're going very quickly.

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.709
In this slide I've used Firebug
to measure how long it took to

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.060
download and render this
page. 470 milliseconds.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.449
That's pretty quick.

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.290
There are a lot of cool things
about Firebug, but one of the

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.239
really great things for
purposes of measuring latency

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.230
is the net tab there that
maybe you haven't seen.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.060
That allows you to see exactly
how long it took every single

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.799
component of the page, the
markup, the CSS, the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.329
JavaScript, the images to load.

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.965
And that's really interesting
when you're trying to

00:03:53.965 --> 00:03:54.439
speed up your web app.

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.539
Beyond that, you know, detailed
advice on improving latency is

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:04.790
a bit beyond the scope of this
talk and we promise to talk

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.909
about user experience.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.620
You can learn a lot about
making your application

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.790
fast throughout the
rest of the conference.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.770
But I do want to mention a
few of the resources that

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.479
are really valuable.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.890
Pagetest at webpagetest.org
allows you to analyze not only

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.650
a single webpage or a single
site and see what's

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.510
slowing it down.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.850
But do comparisons
between multiple sites.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.600
So you can actually watch how
pages are downloaded and

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.589
rendered in real time
or in slow motion.

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:31.699
You can create a video of
that too and I have a video

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.080
I'll show you in a second.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.699
Page speed and YSlow
are very similar.

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:41.604
They're both add-ons to Firebug
that will analyze your page and

00:04:41.604 --> 00:04:44.650
not only show you how long
things are taking to download,

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.400
but they'll compare your site
against the set of best

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.869
practices in the case of YSlow
developed at Yahoo and

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:52.510
the case of Page speed
developed at Google.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.540
And they'll give you
advice on how to improve.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.669
So as promised
I've got a video.

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.700
This is generated at
webpagetest.org and what I've

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.070
done is I put in the search
results page for Google, for

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.539
Bing and for Yahoo and what
we've going to do is we're

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.590
going to watch in slow motion
as each of these three pages

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.779
download and render.

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:20.989
So we're seeing time
at the bottom.

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:22.660
This is running slowly.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.110
And you'll see that all three
search engines they load the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.220
content in on the search
result page pretty quickly.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.389
When they're finished loading
as in the case of Google and

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.699
Yahoo the page turns gray.

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:36.509
Bing is actually just loading a
background image and then it

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.179
finally finishes, but the
content was there from

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:40.349
about one second.

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.289
So you know, not trying to make
any point about the choices

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.352
that these teams made, but you
can see how this would be

00:05:46.352 --> 00:05:47.560
useful for your own site.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.940
Looking at that and seeing in
detail, OK, you know it's OK

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.810
if this big background
image doesn't load it.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.900
It's OK if something that's
aesthetic mostly in nature

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.312
doesn't load as long as the
important content is there.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.770
And even investors, well,
some of them are savvy

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.050
about this stuff.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.460
Fred Wilson is a venture
capital investor whose been

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.879
involved with a lot of
successful companies and a lot

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.709
of unsuccessful ones too.

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:14.419
He says that speed is the
most important feature.

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.019
He's not an engineer, he's not
a designer, he's an investor

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:20.270
and he thinks that
this is true.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.680
He brings up a great point
here, which is that speed

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.960
actually matters more to casual
mainstream users because they

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.960
don't know how hard it is for
your application to

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.030
be fast, right?

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.119
They just want it work.

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:33.250
The people in this room, you
know, power users and

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.219
developers, as Fred puts it,
we're a bit more sympathetic

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.759
to how difficult it is
to make a web app fast.

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.609
So we tend to tolerate
a little bit more when

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:46.689
we see a slow app.

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.019
So moving onto our
second tip about speed.

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:51.790
It's not enough for your
application to be fast.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.430
You need to do things to
make your users fast, too.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.449
There are a lot of little
shortcuts that you can provide

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.569
and I'll run through a bunch of
tips and examples to help you

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.919
make your users faster at
using your application.

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.932
If you don't pay attention to
those things, not only are you

00:07:06.932 --> 00:07:09.299
going to slow people down, but
all those little things, day

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:12.219
after day, time after time are
going to add up and make the

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:13.650
experience just a little bit
more frustrating

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.689
for your users.

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.169
So as a very simple example to
start out, let's say we've got

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.280
a pages that's got a form on
it with four fields, right?

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.150
And you know that when people
get to that page-- let's say

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.623
it's like the compose screen
for sending an e-mail or

00:07:28.623 --> 00:07:29.669
writing a message, right?

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.669
You know that they're going to
want to start typing in that

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:33.080
first field right away.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.330
So a simple thing you can do,
very easy to implement is

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.289
automatically focus
that first field.

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:39.119
It's going to shave
half a second off.

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:41.344
People aren't going to have
to use the mouse to locate

00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:42.899
and click on that field.

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:44.559
It's not going to change the
world, but it's going to make

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:49.639
your users lives just
a little bit better.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.310
Here's an example from an
airline website where they're

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.880
remembering recent input.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.270
So especially with airlines
this is actually a really smart

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.990
thing because you generally fly
between just a handful

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.029
of airports, right?

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:04.350
You're not flying all over
the world from and to many

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.180
different airports, so it's
useful to remember

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.319
the inputs here.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:11.160
So rather than having again to
you know, locate that field and

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.159
type into it you can just
you know, pick one of the

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:17.009
selections that's already
there and be on your way.

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:20.189
And Matt pointed out another
sort of bonus example from

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:24.400
this case, which is that the
developers took the care to

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.300
actually use the HTML label
element around round trip and

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.946
one way so that you don't have
to find that tiny little radio

00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:32.089
button and can click on that.

00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:35.050
You can click anywhere on
that label and trigger

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.519
the selection you want.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:38.659
Again, not going to change the
world, but it's a nice little

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.930
thing that's going to speed up
your users and make their

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:42.410
lives a little better.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.180
MATT SHOBE: Yeah, big targets
are always better than small

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.029
targets when it comes to
using the mouse for sure.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.680
JOHN ZERATSKY: Totally.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.410
And exacerbated by
mobile devices.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.010
MATT SHOBE: Yeah, definitely.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.260
JOHN ZERATSKY: So here's
another small thing that's

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.260
easy to implement.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.580
It's not necessarily going to
be important for all of your

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.840
users, but certainly
for some of them.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.550
It's tab order, right.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.259
You're going to have a series
of fields in a form that people

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:08.420
are going to go through in a
predictable way most likely.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.590
So the tab order
should mirror that.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.660
In this case you know,
physically on the page at least

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.800
in left to right language, the
fields are username and then

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.939
password and then the
sign-in button and then the

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:20.129
remember me checkbox.

00:09:20.129 --> 00:09:20.719
This is from Twitter.

00:09:21.219 --> 00:09:23.779
Presumably they put them in
this particular arrangement

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:27.580
because they thought it looked
good for aesthetic reasons.

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.570
But if you're using this,
you're not going to click

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.810
the sign-in button before
you check the remember

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.020
me checkbox, right.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.450
So if you are typing, using the
keyboard and tabbing, you

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.260
actually want to go in a
slightly different order.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.649
So the developers at
Twitter took the time

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:41.790
to say, you know what?

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.340
You're going to type in your
username and then your password

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.590
and then if you want the
remember me option you actually

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.050
have to check that before you
hit the blue button, right?

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.040
So they got the tab order right
so that it mirrors the way that

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.350
people are actually using it.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.660
Two other quick ideas that we
don't have examples of, Matt

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.530
mentioned earlier generally
big click targets on mobile

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:04.090
and on desktop, really,
really useful thing.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.560
If you've got a form make sure
that people can submit the form

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.340
by pressing enter, right?

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.150
They don't have to use the
mouse and find a button.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.559
If you have keyboard shortcuts
in your application, if there's

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:17.819
some consistent standard for
how those shortcuts should

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:19.250
work, you know, use those.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.090
Don't make people
relearn things.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.200
And just for fun, let's talk
about a few offline examples.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.390
The thing on the left is an oil
filter, but it's got this

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.730
really annoying plastic
packaging on it, right?

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.839
That you're going to have
to get out the biggest

00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:35.320
scissors in your house
or some kind of knife.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.850
You're going to have to wrestle
with it and open it up.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.110
It's really, really
frustrating.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.030
It's just the packaging.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.290
I mean, I'm sure it's cheap and
easy for them to make, but it's

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.160
really hard for you as
the customer to open.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.270
While I was browsing around
Flickr I also learned that

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.369
you can open these things
with a can opener.

00:10:49.569 --> 00:10:51.950
I didn't know that, but
it's a tip for you guys

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.770
to use when you get home.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.360
Life hack.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.709
Amazon knows that packaging can
be a source of frustration, so

00:11:01.709 --> 00:11:04.270
they invented frustration
free packaging.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.510
So you buy this toy and instead
of having to deal with this

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.660
plastic wrapping that's all
around every single piece of

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.369
the pirate ship you get a
nice cardboard box, right?

00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:16.200
You can open it up, take
your toy out, you or

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.660
your kid is happy.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.490
And finally, some things are
supposed to be slow like

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.870
food and drink, right?

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.340
You're at a restaurant, you
don't want to be rushed along.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.100
I haven't thought of any web
app examples that are supposed

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.490
to be slow, but you know,
maybe you guys will.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.998
MATT SHOBE: Perhaps web chess
or something to that effect.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.470
Principle two, be yourself.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.920
Sounds simple, I realize.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.720
What I think this is all of us
giving ourselves permission to

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.440
let a little bit of the spirit
of the team that creates

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.800
the thing appear in
the thing itself.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.829
And that can take many
different forms.

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:57.919
It depends on the kind of an
application you're writing,

00:11:57.919 --> 00:11:58.469
whether it's mobile.

00:11:58.469 --> 00:11:59.389
Whether it's for the desktop.

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:02.360
Whether it needs to
communicate certain traits.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.690
Security and trustworthiness
pretty useful for a financial

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.620
website or a banking
application.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.540
Playfulness and engagement for
something that's more social

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.110
or more game oriented.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.990
And empathy for an application
that may be used frequently in

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.869
a high-turnover, high-stress
work environment.

00:12:19.869 --> 00:12:23.129
That's where the tips like set
the friggin' focus on the first

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:27.090
form in the field really come
in to save people minutes and

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.970
untold aggravation every day.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.290
And I think essentially this
comes down to giving yourself

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.869
permission to do this.

00:12:33.869 --> 00:12:38.230
And it's also I think a big
part of this is, if you have an

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.960
application that has a fair
amount of text and a fair

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.510
amount of either real time or
asynchronous communication.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.800
In this case, there's a lot of
explaining going on or there's

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.550
a fair amount of text to
describe features that's an

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.980
opportunity for the personality
of the team, the personality of

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.600
the company and really it's
almost like a branding issue.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.860
How do you want your product
to feel and be perceived?

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.300
That can come through
in the text.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.949
And I think all too frequently
teams large and small don't

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:04.409
give themselves permission to
say it how they really feel and

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:05.999
they think, well we've got
to be corporate with this.

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:08.229
No, you don't necessarily have
to be corporate with this

00:13:08.229 --> 00:13:10.480
because the people doing the
job may not be thinking

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.810
about the product that way.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:12.760
But enough about that.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.010
Let's take a look
at a few examples.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.750
Brizzly is a service I'm
sure some of you use.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.460
Allows you to see Twitter and
Facebook and multiple accounts

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.310
from each in one
web application.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.840
It's a great sort of a social
aggregater I guess I'd call it.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.960
And they've got a 404
page like many other 404

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.850
pages in all the land.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.860
It lets you know that what you
tried to visit isn't there

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.070
for whatever reason.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.060
What they do that I think is
smart here is I think they

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.089
realized they have a generally
text savvy or early adopter

00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:39.539
oriented audience
at this point.

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:41.760
They don't need to
over-explain what happened.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.570
They've got their branding
element with the Brizzly bear

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:44.700
there, which is kind of fun.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.420
It's like OK, well there's
not a page here, but

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.829
hey, he's smiling at me.

00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:50.919
And example number three, this
web server's bonkers right now.

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:54.180
I think that's an explanation
that pretty much you don't need

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.240
to say much more than that.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.340
That that might be
exactly what's going on.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.920
At FeedBurner we had a 404 page
that said trouble at the mill.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.850
And that infuriated a number of
people just because it didn't

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.610
provide a proper explanation
for what might be going on.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:10.339
We did provide more detail
further down the page, but

00:14:10.339 --> 00:14:15.070
there are cases where too much
detail and no way to act on

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.470
it is not going to
be a good thing.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.340
And in this particular case
it's like OK, I'm going to

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.740
try this again later or
try some other website.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.510
JOHN ZERATSKY: And Brizzly can
pull it off because it's

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.030
fundamentally not a super
serious application.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.320
MATT SHOBE: That's true, but
if you're trying to pull your

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.330
bank account together than
maybe that's not so hot.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.200
So a few other examples that
we found here and there.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.399
In Gmail, I think awhile ago
maybe now, I'm not even sure,

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:39.110
you could select to have
somebody show in your chat list

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:41.110
depending on how often that you
e-mail them and just

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.470
finishing with the status
message, it's magic.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.190
That's great just don't
over-explain these things if

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.720
it's kind of a cool feature and
you don't need to go into much

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.253
detail and it's kind of cool to
just say, hey it's

00:14:51.253 --> 00:14:52.300
this thing we did.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.800
That kind of language I think
is totally appropriate.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.240
Again, the tone of your
application needs to reflect

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.150
what it needs to reflect.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.840
Now AdSense, somewhat more
serious application.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:02.970
People are using
it to make money.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.569
To manage what they publish and
in some cases they're living

00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:12.820
online and in this particular
example it's an alerts box that

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.530
had important account level
messages and error messages

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:16.900
that you needed to act on.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.480
There weren't any found.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.709
You can just say,
no alerts found.

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:19.930
You can go play outside.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.870
Maybe come up with two or three
different messages you might

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:25.950
show there if everything's done
and there are no

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.610
alerts in here.

00:15:27.209 --> 00:15:30.060
Even though this is a serious
application, this is exactly

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.170
the sort of playfulness that I
think you can tweak into it

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.670
without doing yourselves harm.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.220
And in fact creating a little
better engagement, a little

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.089
better emotional connection
with your users.

00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:41.559
And finally the last one,
somebody must have punched

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:43.839
the history racer button,
so are you sure you

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:44.499
want to forget history?

00:15:44.499 --> 00:15:46.600
If you do you'll be
doomed to repeat it.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:52.060
You can get away with a joke or
a pun here or there if it's an

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.490
application that's not doing
something too serious, but in

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.740
this particular case-- I don't
know where we found this one,

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.290
but it doesn't really matter.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.570
I don't know what was going to
get deleted there, but it's

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:06.770
another one of those examples
of stuff that you can make

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.505
happen that should
have a fun effect.

00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:14.980
JOHN ZERATSKY: All right, so
one way to improve the user

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.160
experience of your product is
to actually engage in

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.573
conversations with your
users or potential users.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.070
When you do this
people like you more.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.459
They're more willing to forgive
you and they see you as kind

00:16:24.459 --> 00:16:25.579
of being on their side.

00:16:25.579 --> 00:16:29.209
It sort of takes away that wall
between developer and user.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:31.650
And you're all sort
of in this together.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.800
Of course companies haven't
always engaged directly in

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.099
conversation with
their customers.

00:16:36.099 --> 00:16:38.669
But starting in early 2000s a
lot of companies started to

00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:41.414
have blogs so that they could
respond to other blog posts,

00:16:41.414 --> 00:16:43.960
so that they could host
comments on their own site.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.020
And obviously as you're all
aware since then there's been

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.760
an explosion of ways for people
to talk about us as developers

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.520
and for us to talk back to
them when it's appropriate.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.980
So the first important tip
here is simply to listen

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.310
to what people are saying
about your product.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.080
And perhaps more generally.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.170
This is all about monitoring
those various conversations

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.509
that are happening about your
company or your product.

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:10.999
Whether it be on blogs,
Twitter, Facebook, the

00:17:10.999 --> 00:17:12.755
list goes on and on.

00:17:14.251 --> 00:17:16.699
You know, just to run through
some simple tools here,

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:18.189
many things I'm sure
you've heard of.

00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:20.740
Google Blog Search gives you
near real-time results about

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.689
what people are saying.

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:24.860
Technorati, same basic idea.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.060
Has been around for years
and for good reason.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.420
It's a really useful way to
track what people are saying

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.320
about your product
or your company.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.380
And Twitter of course.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.090
Twitter lets you do a search,
save that search so it's

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.400
easy to get back to.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.530
I particularly enjoy tracking
these sorts of things on

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.960
Twitter because I think it
gives you access to a different

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.320
type of information then
you would see on a blog.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.600
It allows you to see things
that are too new for people

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.240
to have made much of a stink
about it or too small.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.470
You know, they figure this
is a minor annoyance.

00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:57.940
It's not worth writing an
e-mail to the developer, but

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.290
I'm just going to post about it
on Twitter and if that's

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.470
something that you can see and
say hey, actually I've got an

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:03.770
idea for how to fix that.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.690
You know, that can have a
really great impact on the user

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.290
experience of your product.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.870
So provided you've been
using these tools.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.760
You've been listening.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.180
You know what people are doing.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.950
You know, sometimes it's
appropriate to respond.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.230
And when you do it's very
important to respond with

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.830
honesty and humility.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.770
And Matt's got a great
anecdote to back this one up.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.380
MATT SHOBE: So this was
early 2006 with FeedBurner.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.830
Feedburner was growing
as a service.

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:35.159
We were identifying publishers
large and small to work with

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:39.019
and we were also adding new
staff and bringing them onboard

00:18:39.019 --> 00:18:39.940
with how we do things.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.750
And again, I mentioned some of
the things we do you earlier

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.380
was a lot of folks in the
company were involved in

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.620
providing direct
product support.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.660
Everyone was generally pretty
engaged with what's going on

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.920
with the business if not
helping our users directly

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.640
in some form or another.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.220
And one of the new employees
that came on, one of his jobs

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.500
or one of his responsibilities
was to build some of that

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.160
publisher engagement and get
some of the bigger publishers

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.720
to start using some new
services we had for publishers

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.140
and eventually get them
involved in our ad network.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.340
At the same time, FeedBurner
had a very straightforward,

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.560
very simple privacy policy,
which was at registration time

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.110
we said, gives us your e-mail
address, we won't spam you.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.840
Honest.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.320
Ever.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.440
And that was just that it.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.350
We would never mean to contact
a publisher unless they

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.370
contacted us first, for
example, for support with an

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.390
issue with their account
or their feeds.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.200
So this employee put
together an e-mail.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.090
Sent it to I think 90
of our top publishers.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:38.450
It was a very well written
e-mail explaining that we have

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.720
some new features and some new
capabilities that are coming

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.360
together and we'd like to
get them involved in it.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.429
And I don't know, 5, 10 minutes
after that e-mail went out late

00:19:47.429 --> 00:19:51.240
on an evening of some kind,
there were blog posts straight

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.039
away saying hey, I just got
some spam from eedBurner, WTF--

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:57.160
and I think that stands
for where's the fire.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:02.050
And immediately those of us
with the keyword searches with

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.460
Technorati and if we had powers
to see the future we would

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:07.210
have seen the Tweets.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.150
Saw those posts, got out there,
made some comments, but

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:12.410
our CEO [? DeKaslo ?]

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.489
figured out, well we need to
post about this right away.

00:20:15.489 --> 00:20:18.420
We need to say something
because we aren't going to be

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.570
able to respond here, here,
here, here, and here.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.970
So he put a blog post out there
that was an extension of

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.750
a comment that he put
on one of the posts.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.900
And I'll just point out, we're
very quick to promote our own

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.909
success around here and we sign
deals and work with great

00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:31.160
customers, so we have to look
ourselves in the eye and

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.630
challenge ourselves
when we screw up.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.440
So we basically said, this
is not how we do business.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.100
It's a mistake, it's
a cultural issue.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.090
We need to help people
understand how we do things,

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:43.160
we're not going to do
it again, we're sorry.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.780
This happens to be one
particular scenario

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.039
where this happened.

00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:50.190
I think what you do when you
have a general openness and

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.300
transparency about responding
like this, you buy yourself a

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.970
second chance when you screw
up and you're going to

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.290
screw up at some point.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.590
This I think just gives you a
better chance of an out and in

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.570
this particular case the
bloggers in question, again, 90

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.370
of our higher profile
publishers said, OK, yeah, we

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.740
know that's not how
you guys do this.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:09.009
We've seen what your
personality is in your site

00:21:09.009 --> 00:21:10.470
from the way you've
communicated before and the way

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.970
you've generally run things.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.340
This does feel like it was a
one-time thing and thanks

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.750
for clearing that up.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.350
Also I think Dick's in a
session at 3 o'clock today

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.750
and hopefully he'll be
signing Blackberries or

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.480
something like that.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:24.580
We'll see.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:24.790
Surprise.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.600
So I'm currently a User
Experience Designer with Google

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.039
working still on our publisher
tools and I guess the example

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:36.149
here is the mobile one.

00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:38.870
Yeah OK, for some reason I
was thinking I was going to

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:39.520
go to the other example.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.580
No, this is good.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:43.826
There was a set of our
publisher tools that we

00:21:43.826 --> 00:21:45.790
created a mobile version for.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.380
Somebody had an idea, there
was kind of a hackathon.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:51.390
We took one week aside from our
regular responsibilities and

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.890
said, let's build a mobile
version of this part

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.640
of this application.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.290
And it would be perfect for
this situation where we need

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.270
to stop these things from
happening or go investigate

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.080
them or put a star on them
later so you can go look at

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.670
them when you get to the office
in front of a proper desktop.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:07.099
And this is one of these
higher stress, more

00:22:07.099 --> 00:22:08.149
repetitive type jobs.

00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:10.099
So it's one of these cases
where the more control you

00:22:10.099 --> 00:22:11.989
feel you have over the
situation the better.

00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:14.119
So we designed and built
this thing in about a week.

00:22:14.119 --> 00:22:16.019
We're starting to test
it with a few people.

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:18.320
And then three days later,
somebody saw a Tweet.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.520
So here we are in
the present day.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.230
Got a Tweet saying, I sure wish
Google would launch a mobile

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.239
version of that thing.

00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:26.709
And so somebody from the team,
like two hours later said,

00:22:26.709 --> 00:22:27.909
hey, you want to come to
the New York office on

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:29.290
Wednesday and test it?

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.270
And the guys like, huh, sure.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.604
Sure, I'll come in
and so he came in.

00:22:32.604 --> 00:22:34.109
He give us some great feedback.

00:22:34.109 --> 00:22:35.750
Changed a few things
about the design.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.250
We were going to test it at
some point eventually, but we

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:43.190
saw this Tweet out in the
wild and basically got

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.130
some good feedback.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.700
He walked away happy.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.110
We were happy to have an
opportunity to have something

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.870
lucky like that happen and by
surprise your users I guess

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.309
I'm not saying wait for
serendipitous opportunity.

00:22:53.309 --> 00:22:55.039
Like, we had a hackathon and
then somebody Tweeted that

00:22:55.039 --> 00:22:57.050
they wanted the exact
same feature to happen.

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.180
But the more attention you pay
to the conversations that are

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.440
going on out there, the
likelier you are to make your

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.370
own luck and end up in
a situation like that.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.940
And I forget what comes next.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.840
Yes, well as far as surprise
and delight is concerned, swag

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.420
is a powerful motivator.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.440
It's kind of a
branding issue too.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.740
If you have a logo or you have
elements of your application

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.000
that you can distribute
as stickers.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.530
Stickers are great to get out
there If you have spontaneous

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.440
meetups or community developer
events that you're involved

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:31.030
with and your product can have
a few things along with it to

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.270
move your brand and your
message and move your sort of

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.000
look and feel out in the world
it's a great way to do it.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.180
And delighted users are
a good thing to have.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.170
And this is one of the
easiest ways to do it.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.170
I know almost all of us will
do anything for a t-shirt.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.790
I know I still will.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.550
It seems to be
eternally effective.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.165
So sort of continuing on this
general theme of providing your

00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:55.590
own support, sometimes you
don't have a choice because

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.580
again, it's that two guys
and a van scenario.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.070
No one's going to provide
support except you.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.890
It's a great way to stay
connected to what's going

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:02.620
on with your product.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.630
What ideas people
might have for it.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:05.690
What's going wrong right now.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.690
The pain that's something you
built and deployed to

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.640
production is causing somebody
else is a pretty solid direct

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.600
line motivator for you
to go fix that thing.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.210
And make the fix happen, so
that's a good thing to do.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.659
And as far as platforms
who are doing that.

00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:24.070
There are a variety of
ways of doing that.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.720
There's of course, paying
attention to those

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.390
conversations and Twitter and
Technorati and so forth.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:31.110
But for having a conversation,
you could install your own

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.620
forum or bulletin board
software. phpBB is what we used

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.650
way back when with FeedBurner.

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.200
We use groups now with
the Google version.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.240
There are lots of
platforms with this.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:45.280
Get Satisfaction we point out
is one that has it support

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.309
forums that end users as well
as employees visit and manage

00:24:49.309 --> 00:24:51.040
and interactive in and work
for multiple products.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.919
So I believe one log-in at Get
Satisfaction will work for you

00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:56.020
for multiple products
that you might use.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.180
That's convenient.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.040
And in general, if you have a
platform like this or something

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.370
well-defined these people that
keep coming back again and

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.070
again, these early testers that
you meet that you end up with

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.440
direct e-mail conversations
with and folks that seem like

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.200
they really get it, they're
really interested in the space

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.340
you're working in or the mobile
application you've got or

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.580
whatever your technology is,
they'll go out and help other

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.250
people and ask you for help in
giving help to those other

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.849
people and they sort of become
super friends or super users

00:25:21.849 --> 00:25:24.669
that you can then use the
t-shirts and the swag and so

00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:26.200
forth to reward for
their service.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.320
And if you give them a platform
for this it's a way to kind of

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.070
handle the scaling issue
of customer support.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.529
Let's say things go well and
things go well beyond your

00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:39.780
ability for the two, four,
eight, twelve, or even however

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.990
many of you there are to handle
that can't be focused on

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.540
support because I realize
that's not realistic for

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.960
every organization.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.240
So platform is good.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.500
And I'm going to continue
the streak here.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.830
Principle four, be willing
to give up control.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:26:00.230
So what this really is, is not
invented here is kind of a

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.550
thing that I think is a problem
for many of the people in the

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.840
room because we all use
third-party-- almost all

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.980
of us probably use some
third-party libraries.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:09.100
We freely share code.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.410
We use various other
third-party services to

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.520
make things happen.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.460
I mean, that's fairly
common with us.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.450
But this also applies to things
like, I'm not very good at

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.810
accounting or invoicing, I'd
like somebody to handle that.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.580
You might hire somebody of
course to do that in your

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.139
office, but if that's not an
option there may be some

00:26:27.139 --> 00:26:29.850
application you find that can
help make that work for you.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.700
For our specific example, at
FeedBurner we had a fairly

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:39.279
strong sense of brand and
design and color palette that

00:26:39.279 --> 00:26:40.339
we established early on.

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:42.220
That was the
relatively easy part.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.789
The harder part was if we
needed illustrations for

00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:49.339
particular seasonal events or
launches, certain blog posts,

00:26:49.339 --> 00:26:55.220
and creative material, none
of us had illustrator or

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.610
photographer level talent.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.340
None of us had anything beyond
the ability to put together

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.820
decent interaction design and
make the web graphics, but a

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.179
resource like iStockphoto is a
great place to go for you

00:27:07.179 --> 00:27:08.159
to find those elements.

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:09.799
There are lots of illustration
[? permittives. ?]

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:11.299
Lots and lots of photographs.

00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:13.049
Lots of bits and pieces that
can help support whatever

00:27:13.049 --> 00:27:15.239
the goal is that you
want to accomplish.

00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:17.814
This is the case where if you
decided to try to do all that

00:27:17.814 --> 00:27:20.360
inhouse you'd be spending
probably an awful lot of time

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.210
coming up with not so great
stuff when something

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:23.270
excellent is out there.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.230
There's one risk that we've
talked about with this before,

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.470
which is, well what if somebody
else uses the same infographic

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.490
to communicate their
big product launch?

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.070
That's pretty low risk.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:36.520
And you're going to find a set
of artists or creators that

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.309
really match up with what you
think your personality is and

00:27:40.309 --> 00:27:41.690
you're going to kind of go
to them again and again.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:45.230
And you're going to kind
of own that look and feel

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.999
after some period of time.

00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:49.350
And I just don't think
that's a big enough risk

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.940
to really worry about.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.289
All right, and now politeness.

00:27:55.289 --> 00:27:56.730
JOHN ZERATSKY: So the fifth
principle that we want to

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.410
talk about is to be polite.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.460
This is kind of an odd
one, so let me give

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.800
a little background.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.820
First of all I need to give
credit to Erica Hall,

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.820
who is a designer and
founder at [? Mill ?]

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.420
Design, a design agency
in San Francisco.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.410
Because she gives a really
great presentation called

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:11.860
copy as interface.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.330
The point of this presentation
is that the majority of the

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.600
interfaces that we use day to
day in high-profile,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.640
popular applications are
mostly text, right?

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.670
So most of what we're seeing
and interacting with as

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.010
users is actually text.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:28.140
So we really need to pay
attention to the text that's

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:28.530
in those interfaces.

00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:33.090
She has a variety of different
pieces of advice for doing

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:36.140
this well, but the one that I
really like is to be polite.

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.030
And to a certain extent this
is common courtesy, right?

00:28:39.809 --> 00:28:44.350
You want to design things that
are considerate of your users,

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.830
that are friendly, right?

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.679
You want to put yourself in the
mind of your users and walk

00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:50.210
through your application or
walk through a given experience

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.190
and say, where would
this be annoying?

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.929
Where would this
piss me off, right?

00:28:53.929 --> 00:28:58.190
And think of it in that way.

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.890
So here's an error message
I saw the other day.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.880
Not really, but I mean, there
are many error messages out

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.970
there in the wild that
really aren't a whole lot

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:09.680
better than this one.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.109
They tell you something is
wrong, but they don't really

00:29:12.109 --> 00:29:14.039
give you a way to find
out more information or

00:29:14.039 --> 00:29:16.240
figure out how to fix it.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.549
And apart from the message
itself this OK/cancel

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:21.220
combination is rarely useful.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.910
Especially in an error message.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.180
It can leave you sort of
feeling like you don't

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.150
have any control.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.370
There's nothing you
can really do.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.960
It doesn't matter which button
you're going to press.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.029
So of course, you don't need
me to tell you not to write

00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:35.130
unhelpful error messages.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.130
So let's talk about
some hopefully more

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.120
interesting examples.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.430
For the first tip here about
being polite is to make it easy

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.000
for people to get started.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.139
You know, again, this is
sort of common courtesy.

00:29:46.139 --> 00:29:48.760
If we were going to start
having a conversation, we

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.090
wouldn't kick it off by asking
each other for date of birth

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.190
and mother's maiden and maybe a
credit card number, right?

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.000
We'd start talking, if we need
to collect more information

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.080
like a phone number we
would certainly do that.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.899
So why would you do something
like that with your

00:30:01.899 --> 00:30:03.080
web application?

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.499
Not that any of you do,
of course, but I've

00:30:05.499 --> 00:30:06.834
seen it out there.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.500
This is a really great example
of a smart way to do this.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.620
Tripit is a website that
allows you to save and share

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.520
your travel itineraries.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.050
And one way you can get started
using that site is to actually

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.020
forward your e-mail
confirmation that you get from

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.900
a site like Expedia or directly
from an airline, just forward

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.050
that to plans@tripit.com and
what they'll do is they'll get

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.280
your e-mail and they'll parse
out all the information about

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.290
your flight or your hotel or
whatever it is and they'll send

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:39.140
you back an e-mail.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.230
And they'll say hey,
we got your e-mail.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.419
We've created you a shell
account, we've put your

00:30:43.419 --> 00:30:46.020
information in it, if you'd
like to use Tripit going

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:49.730
forward just click on
this link and sign up.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:52.470
So that's a really nice, simple
and clever way of making it

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:57.230
very easy to get started
with an application.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.920
Things like OpenID can make it
really easy to get started

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.250
provided that your users have
an OpenID and know what it is.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.760
But there are other
options as well.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.549
There's Google and Facebook
and Twitter all have these

00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:10.840
federated sign-in options.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.310
And the reason this is good is
that people don't have to

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.740
create yet another account.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.180
When they get to your site
they can use something

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:16.850
they already know.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.830
It's easy for them to remember,
get started right away.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:22.580
Generally people don't
like creating new

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.760
accounts for things.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.350
And they're not very good at
remembering arbitrary strings

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.960
of text, you know,
passwords, right?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.630
So they tend to use the same
password over and over.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:34.120
So not only is it a frustrating
experience, it's also kind

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.601
of a security problem.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:40.980
On the flip side, it's not
enough to just make it

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.139
easy to get started.

00:31:42.139 --> 00:31:45.029
You need to make it easy for
your users to leave or stop

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:47.640
doing whatever they're
doing in your application.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:52.950
So make it easy for them to
sort of cancel their account

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.919
and leave, give them a way
out or a way to cancel

00:31:54.919 --> 00:31:56.170
whatever they're doing.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.440
People don't like to feel
trapped, so if you can avoid

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.580
building dead ends and dark
alleys into your product,

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.659
they're going to be
much, much happier.

00:32:02.659 --> 00:32:06.210
Matt brought up an example
recently that is kind of like

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.325
the original example of this
principle, which is you

00:32:09.325 --> 00:32:12.020
remember those top of page
links you use to see on a lot

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.470
of long webpages back in the
90s when people didn't want to

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.480
have a link to a new page
so they'd use anchor

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.770
links a lot, right?

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.120
I guess this was before they
invented scroll wheels or

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.889
something so it was not that
easy to get back up to the top.

00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:27.809
But just when you're feeling
like, I'm sort of a long

00:32:27.809 --> 00:32:28.860
way down this page, right?

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.340
Oh, there's a very convenient
top of page link.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.025
So that's the basic idea.

00:32:33.025 --> 00:32:35.762
It certainly has
evolved since then.

00:32:35.762 --> 00:32:37.930
Here's something that's
actually really, really

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.830
common on the web
today, which is great.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:43.149
Which is providing a very
simple, clear way to cancel

00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:44.870
whatever action you
are about to take.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.049
So whenever you have something
like save changes, have

00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:49.510
cancel and don't save.

00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:53.309
It's important to not only
have cancel, but explain

00:32:53.309 --> 00:32:54.250
what that means.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.490
If you cancel, what is
not going to happen?

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.950
You're not going to
save in this case.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.920
Let's talk a little bit about
making it easy for people

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.980
to leave a service.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.230
This is Brizzly yet again
and their sort of account

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.360
cancellation experience
is very straightforward.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.840
It's right there on
your settings page.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.090
It's easy to find.

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.670
And the thing I like about
it is that these use

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.050
really clear language.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.650
The button says, delete this
Brizzly account forever.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.110
It's very clear about
what's going to happen.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.950
You don't have to worry.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.669
It sounds immediate, right?

00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:32.910
It's a very polite way to
handle account cancellation.

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.640
Netflix has really taken
this to a new level.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.050
They have a very sophisticated
design for allowing people

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.580
to leave their service.

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.070
So the ability to cancel your
Netflix account is also

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.090
on their settings page.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.650
It's also very easy to find.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.090
Even more prominent
than Brizzly.

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:49.470
It's right at the top here.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.540
And not only do they have a
clear cancel link right here,

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.020
but they have the option to
put your membership on hold.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.260
And this is really nice.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.480
Because you know,
sometimes you're moving.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.130
You're on vacation.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.440
You just don't feel like having
DVDs sent to your house for

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.630
awhile and so why pay
for that, right?

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.389
Why not put your
membership on hold?

00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:09.239
That's a very considerate, very
polite thing for them to offer.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:11.589
But let's say you do
click cancel membership.

00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:14.769
You go to this next screen,
which sort of explains what

00:34:14.769 --> 00:34:16.209
this means, what's
going to happen.

00:34:16.919 --> 00:34:18.839
You've got to send
your DVDs back.

00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.399
Don't worry, we're not going
to charge you anymore.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:25.029
But the thing that I really
like here is that at the very

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:27.859
bottom it says, you'll still
have the option to restart

00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:29.449
your membership at any time.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:30.549
And this is really nice.

00:34:30.549 --> 00:34:32.889
You know, they're not
sort of guilting you.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:34.950
They're not sort of saying,
well you can cancel your

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:37.334
account, but we're going to
delete all your data and you

00:34:37.334 --> 00:34:39.229
know, you're going to have
to recreate it next time.

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.669
They make it really easy for
you to come back, which is

00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:46.064
again a very considerate
design on their part I think.

00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:49.419
MATT SHOBE: Prepare
for failure.

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:52.829
Well, it's not as simple is it
sounds in this case, but we

00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:55.759
might have heard this one
before thinking about fast

00:34:55.759 --> 00:34:58.459
failure or concept of well,
we're going to move quickly.

00:34:58.459 --> 00:34:59.809
We're going to see
if this is right.

00:34:59.809 --> 00:35:02.239
If it's not right, we'll
do another iteration.

00:35:02.579 --> 00:35:04.509
We'll make a change to this.

00:35:04.509 --> 00:35:06.869
We'll make this gray instead
of blue and eventually

00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:08.139
it'll work out.

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:09.139
That's fast failure.

00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:10.179
That makes a lot of sense.

00:35:10.179 --> 00:35:12.479
What we're talking about in
this case really has a lot more

00:35:12.479 --> 00:35:16.979
to do with weird scenarios, I
think blind alleys or dark

00:35:16.979 --> 00:35:21.569
alleys, blind exits, forks in
the road, sticks in the mud.

00:35:21.569 --> 00:35:22.409
That sort of thing.

00:35:22.409 --> 00:35:25.099
Odd interactions as well as
things that are totally out of

00:35:25.099 --> 00:35:29.319
your control that you can
prepare for in order to

00:35:29.319 --> 00:35:31.619
essentially keep your service
up and running or make sure

00:35:31.619 --> 00:35:34.689
things are still available
and working as close to

00:35:34.689 --> 00:35:36.189
correctly as possible.

00:35:36.189 --> 00:35:39.369
As well as weird little
interaction situations such as

00:35:39.369 --> 00:35:42.049
the first example that you may
not see unless you start doing

00:35:42.049 --> 00:35:44.670
some usability testing or start
using the thing in the wild.

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:49.970
So this is a security dialog
from Mac OS and there are

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:51.800
situations where if you're
really quick with the

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.570
keyboard you can get
this dialog to appear.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:56.490
This actually happens on
log-in, general log-in more so

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.939
than this particular dialog,
but this is for effect.

00:35:59.939 --> 00:36:01.329
You start, type in your
username, you tab to the

00:36:01.329 --> 00:36:03.599
password field, you start
typing, the system says, oh,

00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:05.659
I'm going to set the focus on
the name field, but you were

00:36:05.659 --> 00:36:07.929
already ahead of it before it
called that event and then set

00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:09.990
the focus back on the name
field so your password just

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:12.329
starts to show up out there in
clear text because it

00:36:12.329 --> 00:36:15.469
switched the focus back
without asking you.

00:36:15.469 --> 00:36:16.269
JOHN ZERATSKY: Is
that your password?

00:36:16.269 --> 00:36:16.499
MATT SHOBE: Totally.

00:36:16.499 --> 00:36:19.529
So there's a fair amount of my
personal information in the

00:36:19.529 --> 00:36:21.974
next few slides so please
try to pay attention.

00:36:21.974 --> 00:36:22.609
JOHN ZERATSKY: Get
your notebooks ready.

00:36:22.959 --> 00:36:23.699
MATT SHOBE: Yep.

00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:29.169
So 23 Skidoo Street-- so in
this case you could make sure

00:36:29.169 --> 00:36:32.139
that if somebody has the
password field and is typing

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:34.829
in it, don't take the focus
from the password field.

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:36.479
Something you wouldn't think
about because you're like, oh

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:37.119
we're going to set
the name field.

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.650
Nobody's ever going to get
ahead of it, but in practice if

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:40.609
the system works with the
timing in such a way that this

00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:42.619
can happen you need to make
sure that you handle

00:36:42.619 --> 00:36:44.789
that sort of thing.

00:36:44.789 --> 00:36:46.810
So messy data entry.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.110
Why force me to enter the
parens and the em-dash

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:50.820
or the dash-em-dash.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.700
Or the dash or the http prefix
if you need to give me a

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.490
website address or I need to
give you a website address.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.344
Or in I think a number of
cases, I don't even need to

00:36:59.344 --> 00:37:01.099
indicate it's a Visa, I
can just start typing the

00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:03.130
credit card number, you're
going to figure it out.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.919
If you can do this sort of
stuff for data entry,

00:37:05.919 --> 00:37:09.419
especially repetitive stuff--
people are in here doing this

00:37:09.419 --> 00:37:12.219
every day and it's not like a
one-time account setup feature,

00:37:12.219 --> 00:37:14.129
even then you still want to do
it because I just want to make

00:37:14.129 --> 00:37:17.559
it as quick as possible for you
to fill out this form and not

00:37:17.559 --> 00:37:20.619
throw an error message, cause a
failure to happen that we

00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:22.489
didn't need to validate for.

00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:25.910
Make messy data entry as
possible as it can be for

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.229
the user and it'll
make them happier.

00:37:28.229 --> 00:37:30.710
Again, this is kind of
empathy sneaking in here.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.259
Is that you've tried to
absolutely make sure that bare

00:37:33.259 --> 00:37:36.150
minimum error cases are the
ones that you're going to

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:39.729
report on and stop somebody
from making progress.

00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:44.290
I like this particular example
just because it shows kind

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.219
of readiness for anything.

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:49.710
BBC always has a high and low
graphics version of I think

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.810
all their major new sections.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.499
I'm not sure how
deep this goes.

00:37:52.499 --> 00:37:54.929
The low graphics version will
render on just about any

00:37:54.929 --> 00:37:56.829
device, which is nice to
have generally speaking.

00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:59.939
You almost always know you
can go to slash low there

00:37:59.939 --> 00:38:02.259
and get to that content.

00:38:02.259 --> 00:38:04.519
The high graphics version of
course is whatever bells and

00:38:04.519 --> 00:38:06.660
whistles they care to deploy.

00:38:06.959 --> 00:38:08.769
But let's say there's a
bandwidth spike, there's a

00:38:08.769 --> 00:38:12.229
major news story, something big
is coming, let's say you're

00:38:12.229 --> 00:38:14.400
about to do a major product
announcement and you know your

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.549
homepage is going
to get slammed.

00:38:15.549 --> 00:38:18.750
You might just want to have
a plan B homepage that

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.690
makes sure that the news
still gets through.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:23.060
It seems obvious, but plenty
of times people don't

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:23.450
think about it.

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.339
They don't prepare for this
particular kind of failure,

00:38:25.339 --> 00:38:27.960
which in this case is something
that could've been very good,

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.239
goes horribly wrong because
you weren't ready for it.

00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:33.069
And having that alternative
case ready to go could save

00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:35.999
you a lot of heartache.

00:38:35.999 --> 00:38:39.439
And well there's the fail
whale from a year or two ago.

00:38:39.439 --> 00:38:41.109
This is actually an
image from iStockphoto.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.830
And this became sort of famous
for well something has happened

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.489
with Twitter at this point and
we're not going to be able to

00:38:49.489 --> 00:38:51.799
get the Tweets to you for a
little while, but we'll be

00:38:51.799 --> 00:38:53.290
back as soon as we can.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.760
And it became something of
a cultural phenomenon.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:59.170
It became certainly something
that folks at Twitter-- well, I

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.979
guess if they could've Tweeted
about it, they would've Tweeted

00:39:00.979 --> 00:39:02.419
fail whale as a trending topic.

00:39:02.989 --> 00:39:10.099
It was one of those things that
simply became a recognized icon

00:39:10.099 --> 00:39:12.509
from when things weren't quite
going wrong or weren't

00:39:12.509 --> 00:39:13.519
quite going right.

00:39:13.519 --> 00:39:20.539
And it essentially gave them,
certainly not over explaining

00:39:20.539 --> 00:39:23.009
what was going wrong, but it
gave them at this point in

00:39:23.009 --> 00:39:25.769
time a fairly familiar way
of saying, OK, here's the

00:39:25.769 --> 00:39:26.399
thing that's happening.

00:39:26.399 --> 00:39:27.530
You know what's happening.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:28.960
We're going to get it
back up and running

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.190
as soon as possible.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:34.710
Meanwhile, iconic image for
you, which led them of course

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:38.509
to eventually start working
on what supports our

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.429
seventh principle.

00:39:40.429 --> 00:39:43.969
JOHN ZERATSKY: Which
is to be reliable.

00:39:43.969 --> 00:39:46.839
In a sense we've kind of
brought this presentation

00:39:46.839 --> 00:39:47.599
full circle.

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:50.730
I started out by talking about
latency, which is a technical

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.430
factor that has a big effect
on the user experience.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:56.249
Reliability is the same way.

00:39:56.249 --> 00:39:58.640
Nothing's more aggravating
than software that crashes

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:01.079
or a website that goes
down unexpectedly.

00:40:01.079 --> 00:40:03.040
Especially when it's something
that you really rely on.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.000
Of course, the stakes
are higher for certain

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:05.980
types of applications.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.859
You know, we've talked a
lot about banking and

00:40:08.859 --> 00:40:09.999
those sorts of things.

00:40:09.999 --> 00:40:14.879
If your banks website is
unavailable or acting sort of

00:40:14.879 --> 00:40:17.069
erratically, not only are you
not going to trust that

00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:19.830
website, you might actually
not trust the bank, right?

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:23.130
So this sort of thing could
have a really huge impact on

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.139
that company's reputation.

00:40:26.139 --> 00:40:29.799
And as Matt mentioned, to sort
of flip this Twitter example on

00:40:29.799 --> 00:40:33.579
its head, you know, the fail
whale and their error page that

00:40:33.579 --> 00:40:37.870
was very nice to look at, it
was very friendly, it was cute.

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.080
Definitely had a positive
impact on the user

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:40.700
experience, right?

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.319
Making a bad situation
slightly less bad.

00:40:44.319 --> 00:40:47.109
But the real improvement
came from when they focused

00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:48.760
on reliability, right?

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.240
They committed as a team to
making the service much more

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.549
reliable, to making it
something that you can

00:40:54.549 --> 00:40:57.390
depend on and it paid
off big for them.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.339
Partially as a result I
think of the reliability

00:41:00.339 --> 00:41:01.839
improvements.

00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:04.009
Twitter is now not
seen as a toy.

00:41:04.009 --> 00:41:05.869
It's seen as an essential
tool for a lot of people.

00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:09.039
It's seen as this incredible
platform for communication.

00:41:09.039 --> 00:41:12.039
And now it's at the point where
I can't remember the last time

00:41:12.039 --> 00:41:15.059
that I saw the fail whale
except for when I was making

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:18.299
this presentation of course.

00:41:18.299 --> 00:41:19.469
So that wraps it up.

00:41:19.469 --> 00:41:20.889
We talked about
seven principles.

00:41:20.889 --> 00:41:23.739
We scattered some tips and
some examples in there.

00:41:23.739 --> 00:41:25.299
The first one to be fast.

00:41:25.299 --> 00:41:27.299
Not only should your
application be fast, but you

00:41:27.299 --> 00:41:30.479
should allow your users to
be fast at using it.

00:41:30.479 --> 00:41:31.389
You should be yourself.

00:41:31.389 --> 00:41:33.529
You should let the spirit
and the personality of

00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:35.189
the developers come
out in the product.

00:41:35.189 --> 00:41:36.529
That wil give you
a point of view.

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:38.889
It will give your users
something to relate to.

00:41:38.889 --> 00:41:40.759
Engage in conversations
with your users.

00:41:40.759 --> 00:41:42.839
Figure out what they're
experiencing, what they're

00:41:42.839 --> 00:41:44.869
going through, and
talk with them.

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:47.819
Be willing to give up control
in those cases where it can

00:41:47.819 --> 00:41:49.460
actually result in a
better experience.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.259
Like where you get your artwork
from somewhere else because

00:41:52.259 --> 00:41:54.519
you can't do it yourself.

00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:54.719
Be polite.

00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:55.669
Be considerate.

00:41:56.559 --> 00:41:58.959
Think about things from the
perspective of your users.

00:41:58.959 --> 00:42:00.389
Make it easy for them
to get started.

00:42:00.389 --> 00:42:02.179
Make it easy for them
to leave or get out of

00:42:02.179 --> 00:42:03.619
whatever they're doing.

00:42:03.619 --> 00:42:06.869
Prepare for the likely event
that your users will fail, will

00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:09.719
run into a problem while
they're using your application

00:42:09.719 --> 00:42:11.299
and try to work around that.

00:42:11.299 --> 00:42:13.259
And finally, be reliable.

00:42:13.259 --> 00:42:16.170
So that your users can
actually use the product

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:19.399
that you created.

00:42:19.399 --> 00:42:20.040
Thank you.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:21.044
That's it.

00:42:30.075 --> 00:42:30.577
Hi.

00:42:31.594 --> 00:42:32.624
AUDIENCE: Great talk.

00:42:32.624 --> 00:42:38.049
And there's just two things
that I keep running into and

00:42:38.049 --> 00:42:45.380
wondering, how hard is it to
tab to the state drop down and

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:51.489
let people use the keyboard to
actually enter their state

00:42:51.489 --> 00:42:54.954
instead of having it
automatically to go to the zip

00:42:54.954 --> 00:42:57.430
code and then you have to use
the mouse to go back?

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:59.979
JOHN ZERATSKY: That's a great
example of one of those tiny

00:42:59.979 --> 00:43:03.170
little things that like very,
very little effort would be

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:04.794
required to make
that work right.

00:43:04.794 --> 00:43:10.319
AUDIENCE: And as far as failing
I keep running into websites

00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:15.989
where you have to have Flash in
order to even see the site.

00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:21.660
There's no way past the Flash
page to get into the site.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.420
JOHN ZERATSKY: That's
another great example.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.749
AUDIENCE: Don't they want
us to look at the site?

00:43:26.749 --> 00:43:30.089
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah, thank you.

00:43:30.089 --> 00:43:31.929
I'm going to open up the
Wave here in case anybody

00:43:31.929 --> 00:43:33.476
put questions there.

00:43:55.869 --> 00:43:59.999
AUDIENCE: For the save and
cancel slide that you guys

00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:01.849
had up there, on the form
development you actually

00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:03.419
had a button in text.

00:44:03.419 --> 00:44:07.339
Can you guys tell me about a
little bit on the decision tree

00:44:07.339 --> 00:44:09.389
on why you guys prefer buttons
in certain situations

00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:10.099
versus text?

00:44:10.099 --> 00:44:14.377
Is it via success rate
in trying to guide the

00:44:14.377 --> 00:44:15.849
user through a process?

00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:17.569
Or I don't know I've seen a ton
of things and reasons why,

00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:19.560
I was just wondering what
you guys have behind it.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.490
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah, that's a
very specific sort of design

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:26.739
issue, but generally my
thinking on that is that

00:44:26.739 --> 00:44:29.219
buttons are good for an action.

00:44:29.219 --> 00:44:31.329
Something that's really
going to do something.

00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:33.419
In that case the link is
the opposite, right?

00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:35.460
The link is not doing anything.

00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:37.809
It also just comes
down to visual focus.

00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:40.190
You know, generally a button's
going to be heavier visually

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.969
than a link, so people are
going to see it and recognize

00:44:42.969 --> 00:44:44.709
that as the primary action.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.849
And finally, just the simple
matter of click target

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:49.680
and size, right?

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.539
A big button is going to be
easier to click than a small

00:44:53.539 --> 00:44:55.449
cancel link and so you don't
want people accidentally

00:44:55.449 --> 00:44:57.469
hitting that cancel link.

00:44:57.469 --> 00:44:59.519
If you had two buttons that
were the same size right next

00:44:59.519 --> 00:45:02.819
to each other it'd be pretty
easy to either mess up and hit

00:45:02.819 --> 00:45:05.020
the wrong one or you know,
you'd have to sit there and

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.910
sort of squint and say,
OK which one's the one I

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:08.049
really want in this case?

00:45:08.049 --> 00:45:12.539
AUDIENCE: OK, a Google specific
question, do you guys actually

00:45:12.539 --> 00:45:15.189
use like usability test labs
and actually run your users

00:45:15.189 --> 00:45:17.789
through visual experience like
iTracking and things like that?

00:45:17.789 --> 00:45:19.659
MATT SHOBE: Yeah, definitely.

00:45:19.659 --> 00:45:20.749
JOHN ZERATSKY: At Google
we do the full gamut

00:45:20.749 --> 00:45:21.719
of user research.

00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:26.490
From very tactical, specific
usability testing and iTracking

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:31.400
all the way to ethnographic
studies where we just go to

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.133
somebody's office or go to
somebody's home and talk and

00:45:33.133 --> 00:45:34.369
talk to them about how
their using products.

00:45:35.239 --> 00:45:37.529
MATT SHOBE: And paper
prototypes and show a series of

00:45:37.529 --> 00:45:40.099
my mocks and have people just
look around a conference

00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:41.169
room in an afternoon.

00:45:41.169 --> 00:45:43.489
Very scrappy stuff, too.

00:45:43.489 --> 00:45:46.999
AUDIENCE: I noticed like my
users in my labs are actually

00:45:46.999 --> 00:45:49.079
kind of put off on the fact
that they're in a lab, but

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:52.179
whenever I get way better
results from anything

00:45:52.179 --> 00:45:52.645
I resolved.

00:45:53.579 --> 00:45:56.312
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah, we didn't
really talk about research here

00:45:56.312 --> 00:46:00.499
and I kind of wish we had a
little bit, but it's

00:46:00.499 --> 00:46:02.269
important to sort of have a
good cross-section.

00:46:02.269 --> 00:46:04.660
You don't want to be overly
reliant on one research

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.910
technique or it's going to
affect the results

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:07.490
that you get.

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:09.629
AUDIENCE: I'm guessing you
guys are huge on remote

00:46:09.629 --> 00:46:09.869
usability testing.

00:46:09.869 --> 00:46:13.085
What do you guys actually use
for getting users across

00:46:13.085 --> 00:46:14.039
the globe to test?

00:46:14.039 --> 00:46:15.219
JOHN ZERATSKY: I
don't actually know.

00:46:15.219 --> 00:46:15.999
I know that we do it.

00:46:15.999 --> 00:46:18.759
I don't know the specific tools
that we use for that though.

00:46:18.759 --> 00:46:20.149
MATT SHOBE: You mean
the WebEx equivalent?

00:46:20.149 --> 00:46:20.779
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yeah.

00:46:20.779 --> 00:46:20.839
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:24.679
MATT SHOBE: I can't
even remember.

00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:25.259
Where's [? Tomar ?]

00:46:25.259 --> 00:46:27.179
when you need him.

00:46:27.179 --> 00:46:30.646
What is the name of that thing?

00:46:32.628 --> 00:46:35.179
If I can dig that up in
the next 15 minutes

00:46:35.179 --> 00:46:36.839
I'll get back to you.

00:46:38.259 --> 00:46:42.469
I know it's a Windows
based client that we

00:46:42.469 --> 00:46:43.689
were typically using.

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.380
No the controls on our end
were Windows based, but

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:47.919
anybody could use it.

00:46:47.919 --> 00:46:49.679
There's was a Java applet of
course on the other end, so

00:46:49.679 --> 00:46:52.599
any platform could
use it to sign-in.

00:46:52.599 --> 00:46:54.025
AUDIENCE: OK, we use
something called [?

00:46:54.025 --> 00:46:55.484
Userview ?], but it was
limited to Windows.

00:46:55.484 --> 00:46:57.429
Our Mac based users
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.140
MATT SHOBE: Yeah, I
don't remember what

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.589
the heck it's called.

00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:08.939
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:47:08.939 --> 00:47:10.109
That's right.

00:47:11.209 --> 00:47:13.299
Yeah, Skype-- I've definitely
heard that before.

00:47:13.299 --> 00:47:16.289
That it works really
well for that.

00:47:16.289 --> 00:47:16.649
Yes sir?

00:47:16.649 --> 00:47:18.569
AUDIENCE: Yeah, when you were
talking about making text

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:21.819
friendly, how do you
handle localizing text?

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:25.409
You know, where it says
something that's more cultural?

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:27.159
MATT SHOBE: Well that
is a challenge.

00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:34.089
I think the reality of having
a personality of course it

00:47:34.089 --> 00:47:36.550
has a lot of cultural
connotations to it.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.359
Like I was thinking we had
a section on FeedBurner

00:47:39.359 --> 00:47:40.919
that was my feeds blank.

00:47:40.919 --> 00:47:43.409
And we'd always put some phrase
in there and it was typically

00:47:43.409 --> 00:47:49.409
something vaguely seasonal or
it might have a slight baseball

00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:53.659
reference or I stuck in a
TK-421-Y enter at your

00:47:53.659 --> 00:47:54.989
post at one point.

00:47:54.989 --> 00:47:58.270
And you know, that was for the
five people that got that.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.010
And so that part of it is just
kind of saying we're not going

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:02.830
to be predictable here.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:07.469
And I think if you have an
organization that is building a

00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:09.960
product that's going to be
localized, you may simply not

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.249
get the same benefits in effect
unless your localizers

00:48:13.249 --> 00:48:14.309
are in on it.

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:18.339
Whatever that sense
is can translate.

00:48:18.339 --> 00:48:20.660
If there's a humorous aspect
to it that's always tricky.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:23.709
I mean, I don't know that I'd
ever promise success there.

00:48:25.229 --> 00:48:27.799
We want it to be whimsical
and playful and empathetic.

00:48:27.799 --> 00:48:30.889
We want to feel like if you
could somehow communicate

00:48:30.889 --> 00:48:32.520
to the folks that are
doing the translation.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.359
Part of the apps need to read
like it's really on your side.

00:48:36.359 --> 00:48:38.539
However that can be nuanced,
I'd take a chance at trying

00:48:38.539 --> 00:48:40.389
to do that because that's
ultimately what you're trying

00:48:40.389 --> 00:48:42.430
to communicate in any language.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:44.499
JOHN ZERATSKY: It's
definitely harder though.

00:48:44.499 --> 00:48:45.369
MATT SHOBE: Yeah, I
certainly don't have a

00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:47.890
pat solution for that.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:51.929
Although I hear our Russian
translator was hilarious.

00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:54.239
AUDIENCE: Hello, I wanted to
ask if you had any experience

00:48:54.239 --> 00:48:58.500
or tips when you're designing
for children, like

00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.329
10 year olds.

00:48:59.359 --> 00:49:03.574
I know they don't pay attention
to instructions or something

00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:06.679
like that, so how would you
compare that when you're

00:49:06.679 --> 00:49:09.689
designing for kids compared to
when you're designing

00:49:09.689 --> 00:49:11.219
for adults?

00:49:11.219 --> 00:49:14.369
JOHN ZERATSKY: Well, nobody
pays attention to instructions.

00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:16.009
MATT SHOBE: I was going to say,
kids might actually do a better

00:49:16.009 --> 00:49:19.039
job of reading the instructions
than any of us do.

00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:20.419
JOHN ZERATSKY: That's not
something I have any experience

00:49:20.419 --> 00:49:22.129
with unfortunately.

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:25.127
AUDIENCE: Any references
or ideas you think

00:49:25.127 --> 00:49:27.001
is helpful for that?

00:49:27.939 --> 00:49:29.459
JOHN ZERATSKY: You're probably
already aware of this, but I

00:49:29.459 --> 00:49:33.019
know there has been an
explosion of applications

00:49:33.019 --> 00:49:35.150
targeted at children,
especially for the iPhone and

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:39.249
iPad just because it's such
an immediate interface.

00:49:39.989 --> 00:49:41.879
I'm sure you're familiar
with many of those.

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:44.149
I would look there just to
see some examples of what

00:49:44.149 --> 00:49:45.730
other people are doing.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.247
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:49:55.849 --> 00:50:01.179
AUDIENCE: Hi, some Google
website uses unexpected results

00:50:01.179 --> 00:50:04.819
such as if you search something
on Google Maps for instance,

00:50:04.819 --> 00:50:09.979
get you directions from New
York to Paris it says like swim

00:50:09.979 --> 00:50:18.499
10,000 miles or I think it used
to be at Google Search when you

00:50:18.499 --> 00:50:20.376
search for Chuck Norris it says
you don't find Chuck Norris

00:50:20.376 --> 00:50:20.859
he finds you or something.

00:50:20.859 --> 00:50:21.339
JOHN ZERATSKY: Right.

00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:24.257
AUDIENCE: So what do you
think about that kind

00:50:24.257 --> 00:50:25.325
of user experience?

00:50:25.859 --> 00:50:28.539
MATT SHOBE: I'm for it.

00:50:30.579 --> 00:50:34.789
As long as it doesn't get in
the way of something that's

00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:36.450
life-threatening or mission
critical or high,

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:37.390
high frequency.

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:38.940
Nobody likes to hear
the same joke.

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.880
And you're not probably going
to run that same query 59 time.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.539
Although you might be
interested to see if you get

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:43.240
different instructions.

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.880
This time try it butterfly
instead of back stroke.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:46.779
That sort of thing.

00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:53.349
That's actually one thing from
the be surprising principle

00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:57.049
that we mentioned-- I forgot to
touch on, which is easter eggs.

00:50:57.049 --> 00:51:01.900
Little in jokes when the right
things combined can be fun as

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.299
long as there sort of whimsical
and off to the side and don't

00:51:04.299 --> 00:51:06.320
get in the way of whatever
the critical thing is

00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:07.519
that you're doing.

00:51:07.519 --> 00:51:10.939
And in this case you know I
think those searches are not

00:51:10.939 --> 00:51:15.085
super critical although I guess
you could decide-- I'm not

00:51:15.085 --> 00:51:16.450
sure how you actually
opt out of those.

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:19.010
JOHN ZERATSKY: Yes, so I think
in the case of the Maps one is

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:22.510
a really, really good one
because you're realistically

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:24.240
not going to use Google Maps
to figure out how to get

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.300
from New York to Paris.

00:51:26.489 --> 00:51:30.109
It's not a realistic of use of
that tool, so that's a perfect

00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:31.759
opportunity to inject a
little bit of humor.

00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:35.520
The Chuck Norris thing, like as
long as the real search results

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.400
are also on the page, you know,
let's say you're actually doing

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.659
research about Chuck Norris
for some legitimate purpose.

00:51:40.659 --> 00:51:42.119
You know, you don't want
to be blocked from

00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:43.050
finding the results.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.640
It's just fun.

00:51:46.279 --> 00:51:47.769
MATT SHOBE: We'll make sure
the scholarly reports

00:51:47.769 --> 00:51:49.329
still get through.

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:54.527
The awesomeness side is fun
to future up top if you can.

00:51:57.329 --> 00:52:00.160
JOHN ZERATSKY: OK, I think
we've warned you down.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:00.609
Thank you very much for coming.

00:52:00.609 --> 00:52:05.609
MATT SHOBE: Thanks.
