00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.050
And the correct answer is, obviously, ide.udacity.com. You

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.060
know, if we had a cookie in our

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.910
browser for ide.udacity.com, when, if you visited ide.udacity.com,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.610
we'd send that cookie. And we'd also send that

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.756
cookie to other.ide.udacity.com. Basically, any sub domain of

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:20.500
this domain would receive that cookie. And that kind of

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.710
makes sense, right? If you, you set this

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.230
cookie anything below that domain is kind of part

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.020
of that domain so you would receive that cookie

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.690
as well. Okay good job, let's try another one.
