about what South By is about.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.975

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:09.809

 playing the guitar,

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:17.717

 are you talking about weed?

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.156

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.857

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:31.364

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.865
- Racist.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:34.367
- They're beans of color,
 they're not like fava beans.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.868
- Do people tell you all
 the time that you look like

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.703

dream was realized.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.972

people and white people

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.908
and Mexican people can
come together in Austin

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.176
and be weird.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.444
- [Akilah] Do you
 remember the Alamo?

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.745

 the first gay bars.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.515

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.485
