00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.590
There's no stopping Marvel's box office dominance,
with each new hero, star, character, or superteam

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.790
adding to the universe's legacy - and behind
the scenes, adding even more unbelievable

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:17.790
stories and coincidences.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.040
But for all its success and seemingly - perfect
planning, the MCU has just as many weird,

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.920
or hard to believe secrets that the studio
would rather fans not spend time thinking

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.920
about.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.500
Here are 20 Secrets the MCU Doesn't Want You
To Know.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.210
Wolverine’s Cameo
Before the MCU became a blockbuster monster,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.190
the studio was a lot more open to sharing
their universe with the rest of Marvel's heroes

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.550
at rival studios.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.580
It's long been rumored that Marvel had considered
having Hugh Jackman appear as his immortal

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.500
clawed soldier alongside Cap during World
War 2.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.440
Even if rights meant he couldn't be CALLED
Wolverine, it still would have been an incredible

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.700
cameo.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.170
Casting Iron Man
He may have become the face of the Marvel

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.010
Universe, but when the role of Iron Man was
being cast, the studio couldn't have been

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.780
less convinced Robert Downey Jr. was their
man.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.399
While they would still have preferred Tom
Cruise, director Jon Favreau knew Downey could

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.460
pull off a brilliant man who realizes he'd
been wasting his life - since he already had

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.580
himself.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.380
JARVIS
After years playing the voice of Tony Stark's

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.189
AI JARVIS, fans finally got to see actor Paul
Bettany on screen, as the new Avenger, Vision.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.240
But it was a first for his costars, too.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.590
The actor admitted that he had never worked
with Robert Downey Jr before then, having

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.499
spent close to a decade just recording his
lines in a studio after filming had wrapped.

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.320
Sam Rockwell’s Role
Iron Man 2 takes a beating from fans, but

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.320
not it's villain.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.719
But in a parallel universe, Robert Downey
Jr and Sam Rockwell could have had their roles

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.719
reversed.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.340
Rockwell was invited to read for the hero,
and was apparently in the running before Downey

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.340
was cast.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.750
His audition clearly impressed, since he was
asked to return for the sequel.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.630
Daredevil’s Powers
Since Daredevil is as serious a Hero as they

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.960
come, Marvel doesn't advertise the fact that
the chemicals which gave him his powers also

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.880
turned a group of turtles into teenage mutant
ninjas.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.349
That's according to the turtles creators,
who mirrored most of Daredevil's story in

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.239
their own, with Splinter a play on Stick (Matt's
mentor) and fighting the veil ninjas of the

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:08.360
Foot, instead of Marvel's Hand.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.720
Hulk’s Origin Story
With the Avengers' success, fans everywhere

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.510
are demanding more Hulk - but they almost
had it.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.080
When Edward Norton signed on to play the hero,
he rewrote the script, adding a longer origin

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.780
and even more character scenes.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.530
He and the director tried to convince Marvel
that it was the right move, but the studio

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.720
thought tighter action was a better move.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.970
Either way, The Avengers gave some credit,
revealing Bruce Banner had attempted suicide

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.840
- the very first scene in Norton's screenplay.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.950
Iron Man’s Price Tag
Cap was a hit, but when The Avengers came

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.370
along, Iron Man was Marvel's biggest star
- and Robert Downey Jr, and his agent, knew

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.370
it.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.360
With just two movies under his belt, the actor
negotiated a $50 Million paycheck for the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.780
team up, and Marvel had no choice but to pay.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.320
Since the movie made over a billion dollars,
it was more than worth it.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.320
Robert Banner?

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.360
He goes by Bruce, but officially, the Hulk's
alter ego is named Dr. Robert Bruce Banner.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.260
Why does he go by his middle name?

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.340
Easy: writer Stan Lee forgot which one to
use.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.500
The three part name was his cover story, but
the Marvel legend later admitted he went months

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.380
referring to Banner as Bob, before realizing
his mistake.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.020
Casting The God Of Thunder
When Marvel was looking to cast it's riskiest

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.520
Avenger, the god of Thunder, it came down
to three actors: Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520
and his brother, Liam.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.600
Hiddleston got Loki and Chris got the lead,
but weirdly enough, he found out he got the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.060
role while on the set of Cabin in the Woods,
with his future Avengers director, Joss Whedon.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.110
Just days before, Whedon had actually claimed
he'd make a perfect Captain America.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.240
Odin’s Secret
The Dark World offered one of the first lessons

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.300
in the Infinity Stones of the MCU, courtesy
of Odin, Thor's dad.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.290
But the Allfather was apparently keeping some
secrets.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.490
According to Thor director Kenneth Brannagh,
it was Odin who put the MCU in motion, hiding

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.120
the Tesseract in Captain America, the Infinity
Gauntlet, and so on.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.600
Whether the current writers agree...

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.390
We'll have to wait and see.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.210
Human Torch Costume
The mannequin wearing the original Human Torch

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.319
costume in Captain America's opening scenes
is usually taken as a playful jab at star

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.570
Chris Evans' former role - but the truth is
even crazier.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.870
The red suited Torch was actually the first
Marvel superhero, whose name and powers were

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.680
later recycled for the Fantastic Four - exactly
like Evans, whose likeness and star quality

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.070
got him recycled into the Avengers.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.000
What are the odds?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.220
The Hulk Re-casting
When the role of Bruce Banner had to be recast

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.539
for The Avengers, director Joss Whedon thought
Marvel would have doubts about his top pick,

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.920
Mark Ruffalo, since he wasn't exactly an A-Lister
at the time.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.689
To his surprise, he was Marvel's top pick
too, after he'd been on the shortlist before

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.300
Ed Norton landed the part.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.949
Considering how that story played out, they
probably wished they'd made that choice years

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.289
earlier.

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.800
Post-Credit Secrets
Marvel is famous for its post credits scenes,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.719
but they're not always easy to film, especially
if they haven't been written until after shooting

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:47.719
is finished.

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:52.699
For Thor 2, Natalie Portman wasn't even available
to film her post credits kiss as Dr. Jane

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:53.699
Foster.

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.849
Since she was the same size, Chris Hemsworth's
wife, actress Elsa Pataky ("PAD-eck-EE") threw

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.349
on a wig and stepped in to take her place.

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.039
Department H
The Marvel writers couldn't help but make

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.500
reference to the secret Canadian organization
called Department H, mentioned in both The

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.629
Winter Soldier and Agents of SHIELD.

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.319
There's one problem: thats the experimental
agency that launched the Weapon X program

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.419
which created Wolverine and Deadpool in the
comics.

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.370
Both characters to which Marvel no longer
holds the rights.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.460
Let's hope Fox didn't notice.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.199
Re-using Locations
The Marvel Universe crosses time and space,

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.229
but the actual filming locations can't.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.080
So the studio hopes fans won't look too closely,
or else they'll notice that the centuries-old

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.240
village in Thor's prologue is the same one
Red Skull attacks in Captain America.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.300
Or that the secret bunker where Bucky is brainwashed
in the Winter Soldier is the same bank Cap

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.439
is blown out of in The Avengers.

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.779
Sebastian The Sidekick
Since Captain America has passed his shield

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.939
to a few successors in the comics, it's no
surprise that the Marvel films have established

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:53.419
a few candidates in his friends Sam Wilson
and Bucky Barnes.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.479
What fans don't know is that actor Sebastian
Stan was in the running for the role to begin

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.819
with, until Chris Evans agreed to sign on,
and Stan got his sidekick instead.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.539
Iron Man’s Suit
It seems like a dream come true to wear the

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.319
Iron Man armor, but the reality of a suit
of armor isn't as glamorous.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.979
Thanks to advances in CG, Robert Downey Jr.
only has to wear a headpiece or shoulder pads

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:13.979
on set.

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.689
Whenever the iron Avenger's face isn't visible,
fans are actually watching a digital creation,

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:19.039
or a stunt man.

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:20.550
Sorry to burst the bubble.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.580
Laura Haddock
It's an ironclad rule that no actor can play

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.779
two different characters in the MCU, with
Paul Bettany's shift from JARVIS to Vision

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:28.850
the only exception.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.990
Well, unless you count actress Laura Haddock,
who appears in Captain America looking for

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.830
an autograph... and again, as Peter Quill's
dying mother.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.130
The studio has denied any connection between
the roles, making her casting... impossible

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.130
to explain.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.120
Guardians On A Budget
Guardians of the Galaxy turned out to be one

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.300
of Marvel's biggest hits - but they didn't
expect it to be.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.159
In fact, the studio only agreed to pay for
the movie's massive prison set to be built

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:55.580
once a plan was set to melt down the steel
after filming wrapped, so it could be sold

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.690
for scrap to gain back the money spent.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.219
We doubt that will be a problem for the sequel.

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:02.990
Casting Cap
These days, almost every young actor is fighting

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.419
to play a superhero and hit blockbuster level.

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:09.719
But when Marvel sought out actor Chris Evans
to play Captain America, he wasn't sold.

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:14.219
With terrible memories of his Fantastic Four
contract, Evans actually turned Marvel down

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:15.499
- THREE times.

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:20.259
He finally agreed when Marvel dropped his
initial contract from 9 movies to 6, and the

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.259
rest is history.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:25.449
Those are just some of the crazy coincidences
that hide below the surface of the MCU, and

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:28.839
with the movie universe growing by the day,
the list is only going to get longer.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.419
