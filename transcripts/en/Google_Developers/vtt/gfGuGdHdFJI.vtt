00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.510
Hi.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.530
I'm Ricardo.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.350
I work on the Google Play team.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.630
I'm going to tell you
about all the tools

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.340
available in the
Developer Console

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.480
to help you build high
quality apps for Google Play,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.620
from tips in the
publishing process,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.940
to how to make the best
of the data reporting

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.210
available to you.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's start from the basics--
targeting the right audience.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.190
First, it's a good idea to
do a bit of market research

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.070
and assess your target audience.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.950
Understand and what and what
versions and screen sizes

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.040
you want to target.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.000
If you go to
developer.android.com

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.850
and search for dashboards,
you can get relevant graphs

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.970
to show you which versions
you would want to support.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.000
You're likely to get the best
result, if you design your app

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.100
to work on tablets
from the start.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.780
The increased screen
area on tablets

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.920
gives you more
possibilities and allows

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.290
for more engagement
with the user, which

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.120
can mean increased usage as
well as more monetization

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.130
opportunities.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.880
If you're building a
game, make sure you

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.730
choose the right category
among the 18 new game

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.349
categories recently
added in Google Play.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.540
After sorting out the
general outline and placement

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.010
of your app, it's time
to start building it.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.150
But don't wait until
your app is 100%

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.900
finished before
showing it to people.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.000
We have designed
beta testing to help

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.020
you get user feedback
as early as possible.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.470
Before your app is ready
to be seen by the world,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.390
you can distribute it to a
group of users you select.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.689
We call this alpha
and beta test groups.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.980
If you don't yet have a
production version of your app,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.540
your app will be
invisible in Google Play,

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.990
except to the
testers you choose.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.750
If you're using Google
Play Games Services,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.090
you can use the alpha
and beta testing

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.590
to test your game
services as well.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.540
You can use Google groups or
Google+ communities to indicate

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.300
which users you want to be able
to access the test versions

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.630
of your apps.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.790
You can set a what's new field
for each version of your app,

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.620
including the ones for testers.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.450
And this is really useful
to tell your testers what's

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.420
new in the alpha and
beta versions they

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.350
are about to receive.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.470
Each user will need to opt in
to be a tester for each app

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.730
and unload the app of course.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.490
To aid users in doing so, many
developers create a little web

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.890
page with a set of
instructions that they send out

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.910
to their testers, or mention
it in their group or Google+

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.290
community.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.080
Now that your alpha and
beta test is in progress.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.310
It's good to know that users
who are alpha or beta testers

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.370
cannot leave reviews
for your app.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.020
In this way, you can
protect against leaks

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.680
about your secret app
or harm to your ratings

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.660
if you're beta version
still has some bugs.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.670
However, you can still see crash
reports, optimization tapes,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.220
and statistics in the
Developer Console.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.330
And we explicitly
mark out results

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.160
that pertain to your
alpha or beta test.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.530
So for example, you can quickly
isolate all application crashes

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.660
that your beta testers
are experiencing.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.900
Your beta testers are
great for identifying

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.210
bugs and the usability problems.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.850
But keep in mind, they are
not a representative sample

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.390
of your target user population.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.880
Once your app is looking
good to your beta testers,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.560
and it has been through a full
round of testing on your side,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.404
it's time to publish.

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:10.070
Once your app is
published to all users,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.430
you will have some options when
you roll out your next updates.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.564
Here at Google.

00:03:14.564 --> 00:03:16.730
We want to be sure that
everything goes well when we

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.385
roll out new
version of our apps.

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:20.540
And we know that you do as well.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.440
For this, we design
staged rollouts.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.180
You can rollout
updates of your app

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.120
to just a percentage
of your users, like 5%,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.430
and then crank it
up to 100% when

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.310
you can see that the
reviews are still good,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.830
and there are no
problems on the horizon.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.070
Don't panic, if you realize that
you rolled out a bad version

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.340
while a staged rollout
is still in progress.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.860
Spin up a bug fix and
publish a new version.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.219
Your fix will go out to the
users who have the bad one,

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:46.510
and you can resume the rollout.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.710
Now that I covered the
publishing process, let's focus

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.140
on monitoring how
your app is doing.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.740
Here at Google we think
that the developers do best

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.650
when they have lots of insights
into their users and app

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.940
performance.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.640
Most successful
developers tell us

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.570
that they log into
the Developer Console

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.740
every day to check on
their statistics, reviews,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.880
and optimization tips.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.560
Here's an overview of
some of the types of data

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.440
that is offered in
the Developer Console

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.560
that we think more developers
should be looking at.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.610
Starting from the
basics, most of you

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.950
know that you can see
installs and the uninstalls

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.930
over time in the
Developer Console.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.460
In addition to that, if you
just go to the statistics page,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.440
you can see how your app ratings
have changed over time, crash

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.010
trends and if you link
your Developer Console

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.230
account with Google Analytics,
data about your active users,

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.320
and their engagement
with your app.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.120
Be sure to click on
app version to make

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.430
sure you compare your new
versions against the older

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.290
ones.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.390
Also use the CSV exports to
download the full data set

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.485
beyond the first top 10 values.

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:53.610
If you're a game developer
and you use Google Play Games

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.590
Services in your app, you can
monitor your game performance

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.610
and key player metrics using
the new game stats module

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.560
that we just launched
a few weeks ago.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.390
Crashes can be a major problem.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.980
They make users unhappy
and dissatisfied.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.990
They can result in
bad reviews and users

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.210
uninstalling your
app in frustration.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.915
So we have spent time making
the crash reporting feature

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:17.520
in the Developer
Console even better.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.310
You can check on your beta
test and your stage rollout

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.390
by filtering your
crashes by version.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.590
You can also see how
these crashes break

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.880
down across different
devices and Android versions

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.610
to make it easier to track
down what's going wrong

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.130
or why users on a certain
device are complaining.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.220
If you develop a native code,
we have improved the reporting

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.280
and presentation, specifically
for native crashes,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.380
with better clustering
of similar crashes

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.190
and summarizing of
relevant information.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.500
Also, remember that we
collect crashes in real time,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.660
so you can monitor your
staged rollout or beta version

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.860
minutes after publishing it.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.810
Finally, optimization
tapes show you new ways

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.810
that you can improve, tailored
to your own apps and users.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.080
From adding translations,
making sure your app works well

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.980
on tablets and ensuring
your app is using the latest

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.480
versions of the Google
services you integrate with.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.090
We also help you
out with alerts,

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.300
letting you know if there's been
a big change in your installs,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.510
uninstalls, ratings, or crashes.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.130
With alerts, you can
trust Google to alert you

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.210
whenever a relevant
event occurs.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.190
So you can focus on
building your app.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.670
We just added the ability to
get these alerts over e-mail.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.150
So make sure you subscribe
to this new service

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.210
from the setting section
of the Developer Console.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.430
To summarize, let me remind you
the core aspects in building

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.370
a quality app-- research and
identify your target audience,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.690
collect early feedback
by your beta testers

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.980
while development is
still in progress,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.720
do risk-free releases
with stage rollouts,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.710
and keep optimizing
your app with the data

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.680
that Google Play makes
available to you.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.750
Now get cracking.
