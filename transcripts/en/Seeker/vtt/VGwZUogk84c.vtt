00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.210
The universe is a tantalizing realm of billowing
galaxies, terrorizing black holes, mysterious

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.150
planets, and then...we get to asteroids.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.210
These lone grey worlds seem to have all the
hype right now and, if we have so much going

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.800
on in the universe, why are we so focused
on sending spacecraft to these drifting rocks?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.000
I mean they’re not exactly easy to explore.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.080
Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency learned
that the literal “hard way” when their

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.280
spacecraft, Hayabusa2, had to launch a “bullet”
into the rocky surface of asteroid Ryugu.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.890
(Of course it was for data collecting purposes)
but it was never supposed to be that way.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.080
JAXA scientists anticipated the asteroid to
have regolith, or a powdery surface of pulverized

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.200
material of ice, and dust This would be easy
for Hayabusa2 to collect a sample of and add

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.829
to the regolith material that was brought
back from asteroid Itokawa on the first Hayabusa

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:55.829
mission.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.449
But upon arrival, they were met with the opposite;
a graveled hard terrain.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.829
With some quick thinking, scientists made
adjustments to their collection tactics before

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.149
our buddy H2 made its landing–and in doing
so, here on earth, they entirely replicated

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.759
the surface of an asteroid and shot it with
a copy of their sampling instrument.

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.499
All their testing proved successful when,
on February 22nd, 2019 the spacecraft blasted

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:25.200
the surface of Ryugu, collecting a piece of
the asteroid, which is now is on its way back

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200
to us.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.170
We expect H2’s valiant return in 2020.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.170
5.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.819
But that’s not the only sample we’re expecting
to arrive to Earth in the coming years.

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.490
NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is on a mission
as well, to investigate another asteroid named

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.939
Bennu.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.700
Scientists recently discovered by chance that
this is a rare class of asteroid, which ejects

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.549
its own mass into space leaving a trail of
tinier rocks in its wake.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.549
6.

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.270
But Hayabusa2 and Osiris-rex didn’t travel
so far to check if asteroids are bullet-proof

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.829
and watch them throw up.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.020
I mean they did, but more importantly NASA
says that asteroids are time capsules of our

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.950
solar system, and these investigative missions
are a way to unravel a few mysteries we still

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.039
have about how it all formed and how we got
here.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.039
7.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.129
Like one of the biggest asteroids may have
delivered the elements of life to Earth.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.630
Scientists believe that asteroids like Bennu
which are carbon-rich, collided with our planet

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.099
during its formative years.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.430
And while the rocks didn’t have oceans on
them, they could have had water molecules

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.140
lurking within its mineral structure, and
helped begin the vast life we now know and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.140
love.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.400
There’s also the idea that while earth might
have been given life from an asteroid, they

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.920
may have also supplied the foundations for
the planets themselves.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.920
8.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.819
In the early beginnings of our solar system,
there were just tiny particles of dust, made

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.230
of rock, metal, and ice swirling around our
young sun.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.590
But as time passed some bits fell into the
sun and others stuck together; creating asteroids,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.700
but maybe also getting bigger into planetary
bodies.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.090
We have evidence that previous asteroids we’ve
visited with NASA’s Dawn spacecraft, Vesta

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.790
and Ceres, were internally layered with materials,
with the core being the densest part.Indicating

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.060
both asteroids were growing to be planets
but they never gathered enough material to

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.189
do so.

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.549
So an asteroid could be a leftover relic from
that early evolution period of our solar system

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.310
that we’re still trying to figure out.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.310
9.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.870
But now that I’ve explained some ways asteroids
are awesome, there’s always a little disclaimer

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.910
and this one is that asteroids can be hazardous
to earth.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.819
We actually have a program called the Planetary
Defense Coordination Office and they use a

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.280
collection of instruments in the Near-Earth
Object (NEO) Observations Program to keep

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.760
tabs on any and all asteroids that flyby,
or enter our atmosphere.NASA is even working

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.640
on a redirect mission called DART where Bruce
Willis takes a team of oil riggers – jk,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.719
There’s no Bruce, but this is a real mission.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.909
And emerging research like this simulation
from John Hopkins University shows that it’s

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.700
much more difficult to destroy an asteroid
than we previously thought.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.239
So this all may be new to you, but we’ve
actually been hunting asteroids for a while

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.239
now.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.049
Back in the early 2000’s, NASA’s NEAR
Shoemaker was the first spacecraft to orbit

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.900
and land on an asteroid.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.969
Now missions like this are standard when going
to small bodies with OSIRIS REx, Hayabusa1

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:17.979
and 2, Rosetta/Philae, and New Horizons.

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.579
And they’ve taught us so much already.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.139
Hayabusa2, although not back yet with its
sample, has already detected that the Ryugu

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.670
asteroid is drier than anticipated and that
it’s quite young, only around 100 million

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.890
years old.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.389
This suggests that wherever it stemmed from
was probably devoid of water, too.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.849
Which might change our current understanding
of what the universe looked like 100 million

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.020
years ago.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.600
And OSIRIS RE-x, remember lucked out with
Bennu being an “active asteroid.”

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.680
Out of the 8,000 asteroids discovered, there
have been just 12 observed releasing their

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.470
material into space.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.960
So all observations from Bennu are valuable
and it has plenty of time to prepare for its

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.479
sample mission in July 2020.

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.290
But what is in store for the future?

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.460
Let me introduce Mission Psyche.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.210
NASA wants to send a spacecraft, for the first
time, to a nearly entirely metal asteroid

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.280
named Psyche.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.320
Psyche is special because it might be a piece
of a metallic core that’s similar to Earth’s

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.379
that we can ACTUALLY study.

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.930
Earth’s core is way too hot to investigate
and now it’s our opportunity to do so and

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.380
understand how Earth and other rocky planets
formed.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.630
Plus, the center of our magnetic field is
our metallic core, sooo this might help us

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.180
understand that too.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.840
(hopefully) NASA’s estimated arrival to
Psyche will be in 2026.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.889
So floating space rocks such as asteroids,
are unique to our understanding of our universe.

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.039
They may hold the key answers to our burning
questions and all we have to do is capture

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.039
them.

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.639
One spacecraft at a time.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.700
Still wanna know more about the missions ahead?
