00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.110
FEMALE SPEAKER:
We're really excited.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.401
and wanted to welcome Dr.
Uhls, who's joining us today,

00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.874
author of "Media
Moms &amp; Digital Dads."

00:00:10.874 --> 00:00:12.540
And she's a friend
of the Google office.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.320
She has several friends here,
and has been here before.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.844
We're very glad
to host her again.

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:18.510
And with that, I'll
welcome her onstage.

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:24.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.540
DR. YALDA UHLS: OK.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.040
Thank you.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.020
Can you guys all hear me?

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.720
And for those of you in the
back, if you want a book,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.660
there's a book up front,
as well as some handouts.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.680
So I wanna thank Nadine Shelton,
Tom Williams, the Google

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.639
office, and Julie [? Worshkin ?]
for hosting me here today.

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:45.180
So first, I wanna
tell you why I'm so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.850
passionate about this subject.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.160
I have always been
interested in media

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.050
I started out my career
working as a movie executive.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.760
I was at Sony, and
MGM, and New Line.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.180
But when I had kids, I stepped
off my movie executive path,

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.750
and I decided to
go back to school

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.820
and study adolescent development
at UCLA, where I got a Ph.D.,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270
and I totally
transformed my life.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.640
And while I was
getting the Ph.D.,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.260
I also decided to study
media effects on children.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.860
And I found out that
I was really excited

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.180
about sharing this
information with parents,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.010
with anyone who was interested.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.280
And I would go out and
I'd talk to parents,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.700
and I'd find out they
were really scared,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.300
and they were very confused
about the Digital Age.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.050
Nobody knew what to do.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.140
And I myself was scared.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.210
My kids were growing
up at the same time

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.340
as I was going to school.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.130
The Digital Revolution
was taking off.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.980
I was studying this stuff.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.060
And as I would go
and talk to parents,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.070
I would be feeling
the same issues,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.160
but what fear didn't
jive with the research

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.040
that I was reading.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.070
And I was also watching
my own children

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.020
growing up, and seeing them
thriving in the Digital Age.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.050
So when I graduated from school,
I decided to write this book,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.690
"Media Moms &amp; Digital Dads."

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.260
It's about my research.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.200
It's about other
people's research.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.260
It takes a lot of
different topics,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.010
and I try to bottom
line it for parents,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.502
and I give takeaways and tips.

00:02:23.502 --> 00:02:25.210
So I'm trying to make
it useful, but also

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.100
give you the facts, both the
positive and the negative.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.550
So I'm very interactive.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.150
If you guys have questions,
feel free to ask me at any time.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.140
You can raise your
hand, or shout it out.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.600
I'll probably ask you some
questions along the way.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.529
So we're gonna
start with a quiz.

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.320
Or I want you guys,
actually, to shout out.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.450
It's not a quiz.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.260
So at the turn of
the 19th century,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.900
parents were worried about a
new media that teenagers loved.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.100
They were taking to it
like ducks to water.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.340
What do you guys think
that new media was?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.950
Please, shout it out.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.828
Oh, this is too
smart of an audience.

00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:06.120
Yes.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.450
I knew it was gonna
be a smart audience.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.580
The romantic novel.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.080
Usually people guess all
sorts of other things.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.510
Nobody ever guesses the novel.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.050
And my point is here is
that we've done this before.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.980
We freaked out
about media before.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.660
And guess what?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.266
The romantic novel,
one of the books

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.140
they were freaking out
about was Jane Austen,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.350
one of the authors.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.590
I would die for my daughter
to read Jane Austen now.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.720
I have a 16-year-old, by
the way, and a 13-year-old.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.200
So it happens over, and
over, and over again.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.260
The more things change, the
more they stay the same.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.810
So here's a picture
of kids, young girls,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.700
freaking out over the Beatles.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.960
Young girls freaking out-- this
was my generation-- and N'Sync.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.490
Here they are
freaking out again.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.680
Who's that?

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.370
Who are they freaking out about?

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.345
YouTube stars.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.870
So they're doing the same thing,
except now it's YouTube stars.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.040
So even though
kids seem to adapt,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.250
sometimes the older
generation adapts more slowly.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.340
So this video will
give you an idea.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.709
It's in German.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.910
I will translate
if you need me too,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.830
but I think you can kind of
figure out what's going on.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.480
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:30.410
DR. YALDA UHLS: She's asking
him how he likes the new iPad.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.790
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.160
DR. YALDA UHLS: So clearly
that's a digital immigrant.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.030
Have you guys hear the
term digital native

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.720
and digital immigrant?

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.230
Has this smart
audience heard that?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.290
If not, it's in the book.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.680
I explain where it comes from.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.330
So this digital immigrant
is having trouble adapting,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.670
even though he
thinks he's adapting.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.610
But young people
adapt more quickly.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.670
So here's a photo I found,
probably in Google Images,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.220
where some kids are
at a birthday party,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.120
looking at the camera.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.270
Here's some kids
in 2013 adapting

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.530
to this new age at a party,
looking at the camera,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.740
but a different camera
straight in front of them.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.890
So the question is,
and that's the question

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.410
I posit in the book, and
the research that I've done,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.280
and the research
of other people,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.330
"is childhood changing?"

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.480
So this video will give you
an idea that perhaps it is.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.970
This is the iPad baby.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.799
Has anyone seen this video?

00:05:52.799 --> 00:05:55.090
Oh, you've seen it, because
I've given the talk before.

00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:01.010
So you can see what she's doing.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.520
Has anyone's young
baby done this yet?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.770
A really cute part's coming up.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.860
And it's one of my favorites,
because little kids

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.100
are scientists.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.450
They really are.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.260
There's a great book called
"Scientist in the Crib."

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.030
She's testing her finger.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.840
And it's broken there,
but it works on her leg.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.050
So her finger's not broken.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.632
A dad just filmed
this, and put this up.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.510
A magazine is an iPad
that does not work.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.850
It's gonna be that
for her whole life.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.050
Probably not, but possibly.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.660
He's coded part of her OS.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.130
You guys know what that
is, operating system.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.750
In human terms,
what does OS mean?

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.600
Could it mean?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.100
Maybe it's too literal.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.280
Brain, her brain is changing.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.400
Our brain adapts to whatever
environment we're in.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.710
Your guys' brain is adapting,
and the kids' brains are

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.900
adapting, and they're changing.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.710
But humans and our
tools will still

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.950
be the same with some changes.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.350
So this, for example,
gives you an idea

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.030
of an older tool,
an older media.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.460
I hope you can read it.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.950
Books, which we started
with the romantic novel.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.920
And people complain all the
time that kids ignore them,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.895
because they're staring
at these phones, right?

00:07:49.895 --> 00:07:51.270
They're staring
at these screens.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.310
But if you think
about it, a book

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.620
is a much better way
to ignore people.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.660
So the good old days when we
ignored each other with books

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.990
instead of smartphones.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:07.250
And here is a comic that does
what you guys probably do,

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.000
and it shows that all of these
different applications, they're

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.910
just extensions of things
that are old school.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.220
So YouTube, we used to
just be able to look

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.240
in front of ourselves.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.350
Now we can access the world.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:24.390
Facebook, our kids
now are in contact,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:29.050
if they're on Facebook, with
everyone they've known forever.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.680
So in my book, I talk
about three approaches

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.820
to parenting in the Digital Age.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.809
And I'd love for you
to be honest with me,

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.549
and tell me which one
you think you are.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.580
So the first one is the
stick your head in the sand,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.917
and wish it would all go away.

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:45.250
There are some people like that?

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.040
Raise your hand.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.550
Say it loud.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.980
Say it proud.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.590
Do you think that's a
healthy way to do it?

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.280
The problem is, especially
as they get older,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.030
you won't be there
to parent them.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.850
OK, here's the next one.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.310
By the way, that's my partner,
Karen Glass, over there.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.900
And she came up with this.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.930
Since it is now
the 21st century,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.150
it used to be called
helicopter parenting.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.090
It is now called
drone parenting.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.580
And this is a drone parent.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.560
She filters.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.580
She monitors.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.910
She watches everything.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.810
Did anyone see the movie
"Men, Women, and Children?"

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.500
It's a really good
movie to get an idea

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.420
about what parents' reactions
are to the Digital Age,

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.220
and how kids care
about this stuff.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.980
I write about in a book too.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.060
She is an over-monitoring,
over-controlling parent,

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.030
and there are some
devastating consequences.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.700
And then lastly,
of course, there's

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.000
the media mom and digital dad,
which is what I advocate for.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.960
It's a reasoned, calm approach.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.430
Media is not going away.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.370
Get the facts.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.230
Don't stick your
head in the stand.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.720
Don't be a drone
and overprotective.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.080
Be involved, but also let
them embrace this stuff,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.570
because they're gonna need it.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.792
So here are my four
recommendations.

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:04.250
In the book, there's
tons of stuff.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.708
Every time I give
a talk, depending

00:10:05.708 --> 00:10:07.780
on the age of the
kids, the parents,

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.780
this one I'm assuming
you have younger kids.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.350
I talk about all sorts of stuff.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.030
There are all sorts of tips.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.740
But these are the four
basic ones that I think fit

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.090
with almost everybody.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.850
So be a responsible role model.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.110
That's number one, and
I'm gonna hit that hard.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:23.870
Think about your
content choices.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:28.210
So in your handouts over
here, the American Academy

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.460
of Pediatrics just came
out with some new--

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.410
they're not guidelines yet,
but some advice for families.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.570
And they say content--
you'll see it

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.360
in a second-- is more
important than time spent.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.180
So thinking about what
your kids are using,

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.710
and what you're using,
and watching, and playing

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.130
is important, more
important than anything.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.700
Build face-to-face time into
each day, co-view, co-play,

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.450
and try to stay positive.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:56.930
So start with role modeling.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:02.480
This is a survey that was done
with 6,000 people, parents

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.444
and kids, families
of kids 8 to 13.

00:11:06.444 --> 00:11:09.540
And 54% of the children felt
that their parents checked

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.520
their devices too
often, and 32% of them

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.620
felt unimportant when parents
get distracted by their phones.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.550
I know it's really easy
to look at your phone

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.040
and be distracted, and
not be there for your kid,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.140
but they notice.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.560
They notice, and they start
noticing at a very young age.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.190
And these are kids all
the way up to age 13.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.690
Yes?

00:11:33.754 --> 00:11:34.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.940
DR. YALDA UHLS: Yes.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.210
No, their own devices, staring
at their own devices, not

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:45.710
their kids, their own devices.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.810
So here is a funny video
that-- full disclosure,

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.220
I work part time with
Common Sense Media.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.440
They created this, and it's an
and it's a national nonprofit

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.290
that I love.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.950
It's a bad role model.

00:12:04.349 --> 00:12:05.890
MAN: I need you to
look more excited.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.327
Pan up, down.

00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:08.285
But you're blocking me.

00:12:08.285 --> 00:12:09.489
You're blocking me.

00:12:09.489 --> 00:12:10.280
You are impossible.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.326
Ready, three, two--
that's a good one.

00:12:12.326 --> 00:12:13.700
You don't look
great in that one,

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.560
but the filter makes
everybody look great.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.770
Caption.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.506
Now we wait.

00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:20.690
[RINGING]

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.640
Cutey pies, that' us.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.830
65 likes and 22 shares
in less than 45 minutes.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.010
NARRATOR: Are you
missing out on real time?

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.115
Learn how to find a healthy
balance with technology

00:12:32.115 --> 00:12:33.860
at commonsense.org.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.889
DR. YALDA UHLS: So you've gotta
think about what your modeling.

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:37.680
What are you doing?

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.320
A lot of people post pictures
of their kids on social media.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.880
Think about when they
grow up to be teenagers.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.560
They may be able to
find those photos.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.580
I want you to think
about it, and think

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.840
about what your own
behavior is first,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.830
because that's what
they're gonna learn from.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.130
I mean, it's obvious
parenting, but it's

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.630
really important
in the Digital Age,

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.430
because sometimes we
don't think about it.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.710
So to hit this
home, at what age do

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.390
kids first learn how to drive?

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.300
AUDIENCE: Drive what?

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:06.540
DR. YALDA UHLS: Nope.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.454
Huh?

00:13:07.454 --> 00:13:08.370
AUDIENCE: Drive what?

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:09.536
DR. YALDA UHLS: Drive a car.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:14.946
Five.

00:13:14.946 --> 00:13:18.300
AAA says 5-years-old.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.660
I found this out when I
was taking the parent AAA

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.790
class for my daughter.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.920
So if you don't want your
kid to grow up to be this,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.560
don't do this.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.390
That kid is actually
learning from her.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.440
Bottom line, responsible
role modeling

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.270
means you should prioritize
face-to-face conversation.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:37.910
Now, that doesn't
mean that you have

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.370
to never be on your device.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.620
That's unrealistic.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.040
A lot of times,
you're doing work.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.390
I'm on my device a lot.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:47.540
By the way, I'm guilty
of so many things.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.780
But when your child
wants your attention,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.010
try to give it to them.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.760
You don't have to do
it every single time.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.490
Often, it's awkward.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.725
But when I was growing up,
when my kids were growing up,

00:13:58.725 --> 00:14:00.110
I said 10 minutes on the floor.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.050
All the experts say spend
10 minutes on the floor

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.800
with them, playing with them.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.100
That's still great advice.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.310
It's also great
advice to put down

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.750
your device for 10 minutes.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.970
Make it clear that
they're your priority.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.100
Also, controlled
use of cell phones.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.690
So that's texting and driving.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.890
Don't do it while you're
walking across the street.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.570
Think about your
own cellphone use.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.280
Model technology as
a tool, not a treat.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.400
So that's my husband,
Jim Uhls over there.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.540
He is a screenwriter.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.090
He's probably very
embarrassed that I did that.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:35.900
He is a screenwriter, and
he's always on his computer.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.430
And he is working.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:42.016
That's what he has to do, but
my son, and my child children

00:14:42.016 --> 00:14:43.640
didn't know when he
was younger that he

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.910
was working on a computer.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.900
They just saw him
on the computer.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.060
So what he would do, and what's
very important for you to do,

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.180
is make it clear that you are
using these screens-- when

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.060
you're using them for work--
make it clear that it's

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.145
a tool, that you are using it
for whatever you need to do.

00:15:00.145 --> 00:15:01.520
And it could just
be hanging out.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.080
It could be talking to Grandma.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.240
It could be any other
thing like that,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.910
but it's not just something that
you're just spacing out with,

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.380
or spending tons of
time googling things,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.000
or things like that.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.194
And content choices,
like we said,

00:15:17.194 --> 00:15:18.860
show children how to
tell the difference

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.480
between the good stuff
and the bad stuff.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.770
So that's my second takeaway.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.440
Content matters.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.300
You'll see that
in the AAP thing.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.800
And I'm gonna tell
you about a study

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.490
that I did at UCLA while I
was getting my dissertation,

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.570
where I looked at values
in television content.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.790
So I looked at changing
values in television content.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.430
And I looked at
television shows from '67

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:47.000
all the way up to 2007,
and asked people what

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.220
they thought the values were.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.724
So we all know that you have
to pay attention to sex.

00:15:50.724 --> 00:15:52.640
We know you have to pay
attention to violence.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.810
We know you have
to pay attention

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:54.950
to all these other things.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.324
You may not always
think you even

00:15:56.324 --> 00:16:00.930
have to pay attention to
values, but values come across,

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:02.630
and they change.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.680
Does anyone wanna guess what
the value was in the top shows?

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.910
In the top shows, it with
family, community feeling.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.690
In the bottom, it was fame.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.400
And what ended up happening
was in the top shows,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.750
fame was at the bottom.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.430
It was the number 16th value
in the television shows.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.690
Out of 16 values, it
was at the bottom.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.910
And in 2007, when "Hannah
Montana" came out,

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.210
and other shows, like "The
Kardashians," reality TV,

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.550
it was the number one value.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.340
So it flipped.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.020
So it was really bizarre.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.210
And what we found as we
continued to look at it

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.840
is that this was just a
small study in Los Angeles.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.150
And we found that the kids were
picking up on the messages.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:49.030
So I asked them
about these TV shows.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.990
And then it turned out they
were using social media,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.520
and actually understood
that they could get

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.210
an audience with social media.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.024
So at fourth and fifth
grade-- I did focus groups

00:17:00.024 --> 00:17:01.190
of fourth and fifth graders.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.680
They were picking up
on these messages.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.109
So there are all sorts of
messages they're picking up on,

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:09.000
and it's really important for
you to pay attention to it.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.740
So as I said, here's the
American Academy of Pediatrics.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.050
This is just a small part of
what they put in this article.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.099
Content matters.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:18.910
The quality of the
content is more

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.819
important than the platform
or time spent with media.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.780
They took all the research.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.040
Some of it's in my book.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.136
A lot more isn't.

00:17:26.136 --> 00:17:27.510
They took it all,
and they talked

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.900
to a whole bunch of
researchers, and they came up

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.930
with these recommendations.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.830
And curation helps.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.190
There's another great book
called "Click, Tap, Read"

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:40.250
that came out about apps,
and it talks about this.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.690
80,000 apps are
labeled as educational,

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.910
but they're labeled
educational by the developer.

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.580
There's no real research,
usually, proving

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.890
that they're educational.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.630
So it's important to pay
attention to them if you can.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:58.090
And how many of you guys
know Common Sense Media?

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.790
OK, so you know it.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.020
You wanted a resource.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.510
This is an amazing resource.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.990
And they have an app
called Kids Media that you

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.510
can download on your phone.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:13.480
It's free, and it will give
you great unbiased ratings,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.120
and recommendations, and lists
apps to learn creativity with,

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.290
apps for all different ages.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.710
And I urge you to look at it.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:27.050
Who knows Common
Sense Media here?

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.259
Danielle, do you wanna
talk about it for a second?

00:18:29.259 --> 00:18:30.550
Can you tell the room about it?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.301
Do you mind?

00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:34.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:36.808
DR. YALDA UHLS: I can't--

00:18:36.808 --> 00:18:37.724
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.820
DR. YALDA UHLS:
OK, well actually,

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.240
Brad, will you go to the mic?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.350
Would you mind talking
about Common Sense Media?

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.960
Yeah, this is Brad Zacuto.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.599
He's head of school at
Westside Neighborhood School,

00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:06.515
and has known Common
Sense since they started.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.126
Would you just talk
about the ratings?

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:23.150
Yeah, what you think
about the ratings?

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.010
Sorry.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.000
BRAD: So we focus--
oh, there we go.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.790
So we bring Common Sense
Media to all of our parents.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.540
It's a tool we use throughout
our school community.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.550
And the ratings, what's
nice about the way

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.270
Common Sense Media works is they
don't have a dog in the fight.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.650
It's really about providing
parents with tools

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.550
to make informed decisions.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.130
And we actually just had a
workshop with parents, where

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.400
they were going through it.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.230
And parents were sharing how
what they have figured out

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.230
was even better
when a child wanted

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.100
to know about seeing
a movie, they're

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.610
having their children go
look up the information

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.600
on the Common Sense Media,
see what the feedback was,

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.140
then and sit down and
discuss it as a family.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.490
And that was a far more powerful
tool than the parent saying,

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:06.310
well, here's what
it says, so no.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.070
DR. YALDA UHLS: Yeah,
I find that too.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.750
does anyone else wanna
share about it, or no?

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.920
It's a great resource.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.390
It's free, as I said, and it'll
help you with figuring out

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:18.137
what great content is.

00:20:18.137 --> 00:20:20.220
They actually recommend
it in the American Academy

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.010
of Pediatrics.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.650
These are some other great apps.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.074
This is meant to show you that
there are all sorts of apps.

00:20:30.074 --> 00:20:31.490
You can learn all
sorts of things.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.550
So one of them is about reading.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.540
It actually, supposedly,
motivates kids to read.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.930
And the other one, "Daniel
Tiger's Grr-ffic Feelings,"

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.110
songs and activities,
recognize, express,

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.280
and understand emotions.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.410
So there's all this
great content out there.

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.060
And if you pay attention
to the content,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.740
your kids can have
fun with this stuff.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.864
You can feel good about it.

00:20:51.864 --> 00:20:54.260
I mean, obviously balance
and limits are important,

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.960
but they're gonna be using
this stuff in the 21st century.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.830
And here's a study
that just came out.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.520
It's about content
impact in Science,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.350
which is the premier journal for
scientists, about bedtime math.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.940
And the scientists, they
were actually funded

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.560
by the developers, but may
have no financial interest,

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.680
and if it was published in
Science, I trust the data.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.330
And then basically
what they did was

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.420
that they had these
kids at bedtime

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.719
do these little math problems.

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:25.010
And they compared them to a
reading group, a group that

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.920
just did not do any math apps.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.370
And it was as if they had
spent three extra months

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.020
in a classroom studying math.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.940
So it was very, very high effect
for a short amount of time.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.280
So brief, high quality
parent-child interactions

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.540
about math can break the
intergenerational cycle

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.832
of low math achievement.

00:21:46.832 --> 00:21:49.040
So as long as you're paying
attention to the content.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.790
And that's actually
Common Sense's rating.

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.310
They had rated it long
before this study came out,

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.190
and they had given
it a great reading.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.930
So bottom line, curate
and check the ratings

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.130
from an independent
source, if possible.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.440
And teach your child how
to do it for themselves,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.810
just like Brad said.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:09.320
When you teach your child
to do it for themselves,

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.220
they start to learn to think
critically about this stuff

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.960
themselves, and make
their own judgment,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.720
and learn what they like
and they don't like.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.410
Co-viewing the content even
a few minutes with them

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.570
will help.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.360
Converse, use the
messages in the content

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.770
to draw out your family
values and talk about it.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.100
Every family is different.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.200
I like to say, in
France, people in France

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.330
are not as worried
about sexual content,

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.930
but they may be worried,
more worried, about violence.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.270
It's different here.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.920
So it's really important for
you to know what you care about

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.480
and what your
family cares about,

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.660
and use what's in the
content to draw your

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.570
out your family values.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:57.710
So number three, prioritize
face-to-face time.

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.790
So no one wants
to be this family,

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.500
I hope, in "Modern Family,"
although some of us

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:06.020
are this family more
than we care to admit.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.570
And this really came
home to roost for me.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:13.140
I mean, I've always known
it, but I did a study.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.330
It was in the press quite a bit.

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.070
So some of you may know it.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.540
I was really
worried, because you

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.200
saw that picture of all those
girls staring at these screens?

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.950
I was scared they were
staring at this, instead

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.080
of staring face-to-face.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.660
So I wanted to design
a study to look at it.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:38.270
So this study, we
looked at kids,

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.840
and we compared, two sets
of kids, control group

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.960
and experimental.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.080
The ones on the left--
these aren't the real kids.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.540
I just found these pictures--
were going to school as usual.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.370
They had media out of school.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.740
They spent 4 and 1/2
hours a day out of school.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.080
That was their average.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.450
They reported it,
self-report, using media.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.540
That's lower than the
national average, by the way.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.540
And the other kids went to this
camp, outdoor education camp.

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.340
And they had no media,
no screens for five days.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.290
And what we did
is we tested them

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.710
on their ability to understand
non-verbal communications

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.040
skills.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.080
So we did a pre and a post.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.560
So we did a test
before and after,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.420
right when they got to the
camp, on the Monday first thing

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.180
at school, end of the day
Friday when they left the camp.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.280
And we asked them
to write down what

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.724
emotions photos of faces,
which were adults and children,

00:24:35.724 --> 00:24:37.390
and they had four
different expressions.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.690
And we asked them to tell us
what the expressions were.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.500
And we did it pre and post.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.440
And we also showed videos, and
these videos were very much

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.800
like Charlie Brown videos.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.630
The tone was taken out, so
they were like-- but I mean,

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.970
the tone was there, but the
verbal content was removed.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.660
So you could hear somebody
sounding like they

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.860
were happy or unhappy.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.095
This was a girl who got
a really ugly sweater.

00:25:01.095 --> 00:25:02.950
At first, she was
very excited she was

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.750
gonna get a sweater, a present.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:05.800
And she was like, yeah!

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.220
And then she got that.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.580
So there were
transitions in emotions.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.370
So these were the two tests.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.990
And what we found
is within five days,

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.150
the kids who went
to the camp improved

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.750
in both measures over the
kids who used the media.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.770
In other words, they
better understood

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.210
nonverbal emotional cues.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.170
So what does that mean?

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:29.030
We didn't think that meant that
the screens were taking away

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:32.510
their ability to
read emotional cues.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.840
We felt that the
reason that they

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.620
were able to do that was
because-- this was the New York

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.090
Times title, that one they
wrote about it, which I thought

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.640
was pretty funny.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.180
It was that they were
staring at people's faces.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.460
Even in sixth grade, these
were sixth grade kids,

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.880
they were still
learning emotional cues,

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.470
because they spent a whole
week looking at people's faces.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.100
So it's really important
to make sure you

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.360
build face-to-face
time into your life,

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.680
into your children's lives,
and into your own lives.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.960
So on the bottom line, kids
need to practice to learn

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.260
social and emotional skills.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.300
You should build face-to-face
time into each day.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.340
Hopefully you do, but especially
when they're really young,

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.560
you may not be thinking about
this, but as they get older,

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.160
it'll be harder and harder.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.340
Find spaces in your
house without screens.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.320
Take longer breaks if
you can sometimes, like

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.410
a couple of days.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.840
Go camping as long as you can.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.560
And of course, watch
your own behavior.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.240
And lastly, stay positive.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.660
So this is a quote
by Howard Gardner.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.120
He's the guy that wrote
"Multiple Intelligences."

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.970
Does anyone know that book?

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.290
It's a really good book.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.450
I loved it.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:50.240
It's talking about not just
IQ, all different kinds

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.617
of intelligences.

00:26:52.617 --> 00:26:54.200
These are all some
of the things we've

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.280
identified as great positives--
access to information.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280
You guys are at Google.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.130
You know that.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.260
Connect and collaborate.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.330
These are all things you know
about-- community support,

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:08.110
self-exploration, creative
expression, critical thinking.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.300
These are positive
things that if kids

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.490
don't learn about media,
and the digital world,

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.240
they're not getting
access to learning

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.060
all about these things.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:22.900
So I'm gonna talk about video
games for this audience.

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.850
Video games, this
is a slight aside,

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.607
but I wanted to share this
with this audience at Google.

00:27:28.607 --> 00:27:30.190
How many of you guys
know the research

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.910
on video games that's out there?

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.060
Anyone?

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.060
OK, so actually there's
a lot of research.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.194
And I do not advocate-- first of
all, I don't play video games.

00:27:42.194 --> 00:27:43.610
And second of all,
it's not like I

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.020
think-- there are some people
that actually have video game

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.100
schools.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.990
That's going a little bit
too far in my opinion.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.330
There hasn't been much success
academically, at least,

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.430
with some of those schools,
but video games in general

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.270
are not the horrible thing
that a lot of parents

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.300
think they are.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.860
They develop spatial skills.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.200
Do you guys know what
special skills are?

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.970
You need them in
engineering, mental rotation,

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:14.000
understanding how
things move in space.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.610
You use it when you park a car.

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.090
They contribute to
success in STEM fields.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.020
There's tons of
research on this.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.140
And girls who play video games,
so the spatial component,

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.230
they improve dramatically
in this arena.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.630
So there's actually a
difference in older girls

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.140
in spatial skills.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.020
But if a girl can
play video games,

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.150
you could almost
equalize the difference.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.720
And I describe several
experiments about that.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.300
And there's so many positive
effects with video games

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.950
that the American Psychologist
did a whole article

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.250
on the positive
benefits of video games.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.560
Many positive effect.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.190
But when parents are
surveyed about what

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.390
they think is the worst
media, video games

00:28:57.390 --> 00:28:59.220
are always at the bottom.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.394
I mean, at the top
of the worst media.

00:29:02.394 --> 00:29:03.810
The other thing I
wanna talk about

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.640
is that there's
gender differences.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.830
We know there's the Pew
study that just came in.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:13.260
Boys are more likely
to play video games.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.940
85% to 90% versus 60%.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:17.070
Why?

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.517
Is it genetic?

00:29:18.517 --> 00:29:19.850
I mean, I have a boy and a girl.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.130
I certainly see differences.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.370
He likes video games.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:23.110
She doesn't.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:24.710
She plays on her phone.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.520
Or is it socialization?

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.620
I don't think we know.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.290
We really, actually, don't know.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:34.450
But I googled for this talk,
Google Images, a picture

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:35.600
of girls and video games.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.530
And this is what came up.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:42.160
All those pictures aren't
exactly inviting to me.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.670
There's not enough
girls doing it.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.290
The girls that do do
it, they feel isolated

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.570
or they're objectified.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:53.790
So I think we may wanna
think about the culture

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.410
and how to change it.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.280
So this is a comic,
can we change

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.430
the culture for the girls?

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:05.180
And my bottom line is that if
your girl wants to play video

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:09.380
games, encourage them, and
don't assume that they don't.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.100
"Halo" may not be
the game you wanna

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:16.740
play with either of your kids,
but at a certain age, why not?

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.210
So the bottom line is, remember
the positive, co-view, co-play.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.360
Watch movies and
TV with your kids.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.870
Narrate your values.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.970
Play games with your child.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.580
Don't assume your daughter
is not interested in gaming.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.230
And have fun together with them.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:37.700
And last, we're gonna
start with a quiz that

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.480
came from a survey that
was done a few years ago.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.620
What's the number one way
kids prefer to communicate?

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.290
How many people think-- these
are adolescents-- Phone call?

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:52.120
Raise your hand.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.130
Texting?

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.570
OK, for the people who are
watching, most of the room

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.910
raised their hand for that.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.350
Social media?

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.900
I should changes this to
social media, not Facebook.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.710
Could be Instagram, Snapchat?

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.250
Face-to-face?

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:11.240
OK, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.580
Oh, didn't you raise
your hand for two?

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.950
It's face-to-face.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.370
The good news is, kids want
to be in each other's company.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.170
Let's encourage that.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.320
Let's make sure they have
lots of face-to-face time.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.130
4 takeaways, model
responsible media use,

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:34.360
consider the content, family
face-to-face time each day,

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.070
and remember the positive.

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.562
Thank you.

00:31:38.562 --> 00:31:40.992
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.380
So I'd love to take
questions if anyone

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.797
has questions,
specifically to your child,

00:31:48.797 --> 00:31:50.880
anything about the American
Academy of Pediatrics,

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.350
anything you have
questions about.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.930
Do you have one?

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:54.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:55.863
DR. YALDA UHLS: Thank you.

00:31:55.863 --> 00:31:58.080
AUDIENCE: Interesting talk.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.640
The one kind of
frustration point,

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.010
quality, which you
keep mentioning

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:10.560
how important it is, and I
think everyone would agree.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.175
But then the real
question is what

00:32:14.175 --> 00:32:17.360
is it that makes quality good?

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.490
And family, I mean, you
mentioned family values

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:24.790
as one way to measure
it, whether you're

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.450
uncomfortable with violence,
or with sex, or what have you,

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.560
but there's so
many other factors.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.060
I mean, I know that one of the
things that really bothers me

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.690
about some of the shows
that my kids watch

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:40.610
is the breakneck
pace of action there.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.680
And I don't know.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.280
Am I right?

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:44.850
Is it bad?

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:45.349
Is it not?

00:32:45.349 --> 00:32:50.170
I mean, I don't have a lot of
time to really look into it

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:51.190
and research this.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.290
So what's a good place
to get information?

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.880
Not just the number of
stars between good and bad,

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.410
but on these different--

00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.410
DR. YALDA UHLS: Mediums.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.220
I don't know.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.820
Common Sense might have
some of that information.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.880
I mean, they give very
descriptive stuff.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.070
I don't know if they
talk about cuts.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.880
And you asked, are you
right or are you wrong?

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.510
I don't think the research
is conclusive either way.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:17.200
There was a study that was
done a few years ago where

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.850
they looked at "Spongebob."

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:23.040
And they said that the
person who did the study

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.930
was worried that
the fast cuts were

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.970
going to affect children's
executive functioning, which

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.440
is their ability to focus.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.820
And they did find an effect.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:41.600
However, it was done in
a very short time period.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.450
So the kids watched the show
and were immediately tested.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.120
They may have found
that same effect

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.670
if the kid was on the
playground, and running around,

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.740
and then immediately
tested for focus.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.050
It was not clear
whether it was actually

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:59.070
the show or some
other circumstance.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.500
I do know that not me
but somebody at UCLA

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.120
tried to replicate the
study to find out if they

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.580
would get the same results.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.550
They did not find any effect.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:13.090
They couldn't publish
it, because most journals

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:15.960
don't care about non-effects.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:20.219
I know that that's the way
the world works in science.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:25.800
So I would say my knowledge
of it, and I'm happy.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.820
I love looking at research,
and trying to figure it out.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.750
I'm happy to look more at that.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.820
I mean, I've heard this
mentioned a few times.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.199
You mentioned it as well.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:42.100
But right now, I don't know if
we know if there's any effect.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.610
AUDIENCE: I mean, I
gave that as an example,

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.964
but there are all
sorts of other things,

00:34:46.964 --> 00:34:51.205
the way the kids talk to
each other in the program.

00:34:51.205 --> 00:34:52.320
It's kind of hard to tell.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.150
In a way, I always feel
a little bit alone.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:00.085
I don't like that, or I think
it conveys something wrong.

00:35:00.085 --> 00:35:02.350
But it's kind of hard to say.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.694
It looks like so many dimensions
to this thing, and it's hard.

00:35:05.694 --> 00:35:07.110
DR. YALDA UHLS: I
mean, ultimately

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.420
you have to go with
your parental gut,

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.070
and give yourself as much
information as you can.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.760
Trust your family values.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.820
I mean, there's a
short period of time

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.260
when kids wander from
your family values,

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.980
and their into their friends,
and into media almost more

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.750
than you.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.100
But then they always come back.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.050
I was give myself as an example.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.610
I went into the
entertainment business.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.580
My parents are
scientists, and they only

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.320
let me watch one hour of
media, TV, a week-- a week.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.420
And then I went into
the film business.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.310
I studied media.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.190
That's all I ever do.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.220
And I went away from this
stuff, but then I came back.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.230
I'm a scientist.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.780
I care about this stuff.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:53.510
Family values trump
more often than not,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.500
especially if there's
a healthy environment

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.564
that the child's growing up in.

00:35:57.564 --> 00:35:58.730
There's a people behind you.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.282
Thank you.

00:36:00.282 --> 00:36:01.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.448
I just wanted to
comment on that as well,

00:36:03.448 --> 00:36:04.920
just to add a practical example.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.486
I would say, personally, we're
very conservative with our kids

00:36:08.486 --> 00:36:10.610
television, and I might
hear you on the quick cuts,

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.010
but I agree with you that
it's really about the content.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.130
And I can give an example.

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:19.130
I think "Phineas and Ferb" is a
show that's kind of fast paced,

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:21.660
but it's really educational,
and I don't really

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:24.907
find it to be in the same
realm as a "Spongebob"

00:36:24.907 --> 00:36:26.740
or some of these shows
where it's like, wow,

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.198
if I talked like that in the
'80s, I woulda got in trouble.

00:36:29.198 --> 00:36:31.250
But it's mainstream culture now.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.560
So I would also talk
to other parents.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.450
In addition to the
web example you gave,

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.060
we talk to parents a lot.

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.990
I was gonna ask you a
question about young kids,

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:44.629
since probably everyone here
is either gonna have kids

00:36:44.629 --> 00:36:45.670
or has really young kids.

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.760
I have a three and
a six-year-old.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.430
And I don't know
the exact research,

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.920
but in a lot of
our social groups,

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.104
people quote things like,
children are under two really

00:36:55.104 --> 00:36:56.520
shouldn't have
screen time at all.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.210
It's best for them.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.084
And if you have an older
sibling, it's tough,

00:36:59.084 --> 00:37:01.020
but for a first child,
it's not that hard.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.760
And after that, two hours a
day, which as you mentioned,

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.420
is way below the
national average.

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.550
We try to stick to that.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.220
Obviously, not perfect, but your
thoughts on smaller children?

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.678
And I mean, our
thought as a family

00:37:12.678 --> 00:37:15.780
is they will learn how to
use an iPad and an iPhone,

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.279
and have their own phone
and ignore us at some point,

00:37:18.279 --> 00:37:20.070
probably by the time
they're 8 or whatever.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.390
But at three and six, I really
do wanna limit it severely.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.860
And I don't really see that
as being a disadvantage

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:27.710
when they get older.

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.020
So your thoughts on
really small children?

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:33.210
DR. YALDA UHLS: I mean, I think
that you, again, every family's

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:33.710
different.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:37.570
And I think if you are
able to limit your child,

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.160
and you feel that
that works better

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.380
for your family, kudos to you.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.050
The American Academy
of Pediatrics

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.250
did say under two, no media.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.050
But then, what
ended up happening

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:51.150
was when they revised--
when they published

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.130
this article that you'll see,
they stepped back from that.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:56.770
Because there's
really no evidence

00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:58.940
that kids are irreparably
harmed if they have

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.380
a little bit of screen time.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.330
There's a study
I quote in there.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.050
It doesn't even affect
language learning up to an hour

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.210
a day under two.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:12.160
So I think 15
minutes, 30 minutes.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.520
If you're in the room, or if
you have to take a shower,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.750
send an email, there's
nothing wrong with it,

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:18.320
especially when
the kids are older.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.260
It's so much harder when
you have older kids,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.160
because they're
used to watching it.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.789
But it is probably
wise, especially when

00:38:25.789 --> 00:38:28.330
they're young, make sure they
have lots of face-to-face time,

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:29.570
moving their bodies.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:31.624
Motor skills are
really Important.

00:38:31.624 --> 00:38:32.540
But don't feel guilty.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.770
The research doesn't back
totally limiting hit and not

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:40.550
having it at all.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.850
But if you can, good for you.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:54.420
AUDIENCE: I have two
questions if I may.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.682
One is something you touched on.

00:38:58.682 --> 00:39:02.400
My understand, for
example, was that there

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:08.910
was a more recent study
about cognitive fatigue that

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:17.530
showed that a longer time
with fast paced media

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:22.750
affected the
cognitive abilities.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:24.930
The question is
more, do you have

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.830
a recommendation
on a resource that

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:33.850
would list the current
understanding of impact

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:39.150
and the level of the degree that
the scientific community treats

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.920
this as an acceptable
fact, versus there

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.032
was a study we need
to look at once more.

00:39:45.032 --> 00:39:47.240
DR. YALDA UHLS: So you're
talking about the fast cuts

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:47.980
and if they're--

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.460
AUDIENCE: No, I'm actually
talking more generally.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.120
Understanding.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:40:03.460
There is a lot of hype out
there about fast cuts, violence

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:08.320
in media, [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.260
There are a lot of hype.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.260
There was some studies.

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.295
And it's very hard to--

00:40:14.295 --> 00:40:16.170
DR. YALDA UHLS: Yeah,
it's very hard to know.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.550
I mean, my book has a chapter
in it for very early learning,

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.720
and I do summarize quite
a bit of the research.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.570
Lisa Gurnsey wrote a
book a few years ago.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.070
I can't remember
the name, but it

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:32.110
was about screen time
in early childhood.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.870
And she also
summarized the data.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.690
I am happy to go and see
if I can find-- I mean,

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.210
the resources in terms of
finding out about content,

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:41.980
I mean, I love
Common Sense Media.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.360
There's Kids in Mind.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.810
There are a few other
sources, industry sources,

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.900
as well for figuring it out.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.600
But to get the level of
detail of what you want,

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.550
I think he was right.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.070
Ask other parents too.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.802
I mean, form a group
with other people.

00:40:56.802 --> 00:40:58.260
There's enough
people in this room.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.900
You can say what do
you feel OK about?

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.200
What do you not feel OK about?

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.900
You can also talk to
schools and preschools,

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.386
if your kid's at
preschool, about content.

00:41:08.386 --> 00:41:13.360
AUDIENCE: But I meant
more scientific consensus

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:20.910
rather than anecdotal evidence
or [INAUDIBLE] single study.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.282
There is no current
authoritative source

00:41:24.282 --> 00:41:26.740
you would recommend according
to the Academy of Pediatrics?

00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:31.890
DR. YALDA UHLS: I
was at a conference

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.560
last week called
Children and Screens.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.370
I wrote the social media paper.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:37.820
There are gonna
be working papers

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.450
that will be published on
a whole bunch of topics

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.750
about this.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.380
The Society for Research
in Child Development, which

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.050
is a psychological
organization, we're

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:49.570
gonna do a whole
conference on that.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.410
There's gonna be more
and more information.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.310
The issue is this stuff
moves really quickly.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.850
Research move slowly.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.955
So it's hard to figure out.

00:41:56.955 --> 00:41:59.760
And research costs a lot of
money, and takes a lot of time.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.280
And for it to be controlled
in a perfect world,

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.940
it's challenging.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:09.210
So it's not there
yet, all the evidence.

00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.510
We don't know.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:15.330
But most of the evidence, the
American Academy of Pediatrics

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:17.690
is very conservative.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:20.050
They were the ones that
said no media under two.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:21.760
And they've change
their guidelines,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.424
because the evidence does not
support being totally distant.

00:42:27.424 --> 00:42:28.840
And we've gone
through this again.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.250
That's how I started the talk.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:32.130
We've gone through this
over and over again.

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:33.090
We adapt.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:36.340
And as parents, the one
thing I never say is,

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.250
and I didn't I
didn't say here, is

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.480
we need to step in and
not be afraid of this.

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.110
And that's why I say, be a
media mom and digital dad.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.830
Parent online as
well as offline.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:47.330
Sorry.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:50.000
Hi.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.640
AUDIENCE: Since the screen's
closer and brighter than maybe

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.870
a TV, are there any studies that
show the effects of on vision

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:57.760
overtime?

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.740
DR. YALDA UHLS:
Yeah, I did see one,

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.560
and I don't know the details.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:06.800
And I hesitate to say
it, but I will, since I

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.470
already brought it up.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:12.450
I did see something about
becoming more nearsighted.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:16.520
There is now also a lot of
studies about the blue light

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.970
and sleep.

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:23.680
And that if you read a device
with a blue light, an iPad, not

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.550
the Kindle, but an
iPad or computer,

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.260
it affects your
melatonin production.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:30.860
So it's harder to go to sleep.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:31.870
They're small samples.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:36.860
My own experience has
not convinced me of that.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:40.050
I read my iPad right
before sleep, and I sleep.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.430
But there is gathering evidence,
and it may prove to be true.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:50.030
Do you have any other advice
with your four children, older

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.180
children?

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.790
Do you wanna go to the mic?

00:43:58.277 --> 00:44:00.360
AUDIENCE: I sometimes
wonder about the proposition

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.585
that kids love to socialize
more face-to-face,

00:44:03.585 --> 00:44:07.680
seeing all four kids of
mine, ranging from 15 to 23,

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.720
that they're on their
screens, it seems, more

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.865
than their socializing.

00:44:13.865 --> 00:44:18.910
So that data point that you have
doesn't jive with my reality.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.090
And I wondering,
the question is--

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.486
and a lot of
neuroscientists scientists

00:44:25.486 --> 00:44:27.360
think about this all
the time and write books

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:34.077
about it-- is there a
downside to the screen time

00:44:34.077 --> 00:44:35.660
that they're spending
when they're not

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.390
learning how to socialize?

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.280
DR. YALDA UHLS:
Yeah, I mean, that's

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.184
what that camp
study sort of was.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.950
They need to look at faces
to have social learning

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.740
and emotional learning.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:55.160
But the question is, is the
screen itself taking away

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:55.760
that learning?

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.590
Are they not learning anything?

00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:00.380
And especially when
they're really young,

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.360
they don't learn
anything from screens.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.010
That's what the Baby
Einstein study was.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.360
They don't learn about language.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.360
It takes them two to three
years to really understand

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.050
that the screen gives
them any understanding

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.840
about the real world,
any information

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.990
about the real world.

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:18.740
But as they get older with,
the internet, active FaceTime,

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.160
and things like that, they can
learn through that stuff, even

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.700
probably emotional
understanding.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.490
It's just not as
good as face-to-face.

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:29.680
Face-to-face is
the gold standard.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.110
In terms of your children
and your own experience,

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.030
that study was prefer.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.510
So they said, prefer.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:36.760
And it was self-report.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.590
So that doesn't mean
that they're doing it.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.430
It just means they're
saying they prefer it.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:48.140
I do think in and that sometimes
this device has been made--

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.700
it was created by
introverts, and introverts

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.220
tend to love this stuff.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:55.200
I'm an introvert.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.550
My whole family's is introverts.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.090
We love this stuff.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.910
So sometimes it might
feel more comfortable

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:03.180
socializing through a
screen than face-to-face.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.300
Face-to-face can be really hard.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.950
And that's not necessarily bad.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:11.070
You can still learn
social skills online.

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.360
They may not be the same
kinds of social skills,

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.690
but they may be 21st
century social skills.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:20.410
So again, you
really need time off

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:24.220
the screen, but this device--

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:27.990
Our society has been so
focused on extroverts.

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:30.430
To be able to have a
way that introverts

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.140
can feel more comfortable
communicating,

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:37.260
I don't think it's necessarily
the downfall of human life,

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:41.300
even though my own study found
that kids improved after five

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.050
days, what I took away and what
Sherry Turkle just wrote about

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.280
in the New York Times, and
she mentioned my study.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:53.340
And what she said was
that it showed resilience

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.970
that kids, after just
5 days in a camp,

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.490
putting this stuff
down, got better.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:00.680
So it's not going away.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.390
It's just that we
need to change things.

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:04.650
Yes, Brad?

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:05.949
BRAD: So two thoughts.

00:47:05.949 --> 00:47:08.240
I'll give them to you, and
then I'd love your response.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.840
And I don't come
from this world.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.640
I come from the
world of education,

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.620
so I'm working with
all these kids,

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:17.410
watching them gravitate
to their devices.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:24.700
So first of all, it strikes
me that screens and content

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.820
flowing through screens, seeing
a movie that someone else has

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.890
created the visual
images for you,

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.550
it's a little easier pathway.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:35.784
And whether it's moving
kids to doing what's harder,

00:47:35.784 --> 00:47:37.450
which might be
face-to-face because when

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.510
you do communicate face-to-face,
you get a response.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:41.410
You get a reaction.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.760
Whereas when I can do
it in front of a screen,

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:47.470
I don't need to worry
about monitoring that.

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:50.866
And I think the same
thing holds true.

00:47:50.866 --> 00:47:53.860
The piece you showed
me before, and again,

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:59.570
that has struck me is the
video of the young children.

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:04.284
And I have a two-year-old
granddaughter who loves books.

00:48:04.284 --> 00:48:05.200
That's the good thing.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.990
But she loves that iPad, or
if anybody brings out a phone,

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:11.450
she's like a moth to a light.

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:16.180
And we're actually looking to
add a preschool, because we

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.010
realize that that
imprinting-- you

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.216
talked about Steve
Jobs and the OS,

00:48:21.216 --> 00:48:23.360
I like to think it is reversal.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.240
I think that if you can
work with kids earlier,

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.820
early enough, that
you can begin to build

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.784
those other skills that
are vitally important,

00:48:31.784 --> 00:48:33.950
along with all the pieces
that we know that we wanna

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:34.990
have in the digital world.

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:36.323
DR. YALDA UHLS: I totally agree.

00:48:36.323 --> 00:48:38.450
And I especially think
that at very young ages,

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.680
it's really, really important.

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:46.070
But I would say, I
agree that some people

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:50.420
think imagination and
creativity is being affected.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.800
We don't know for sure yet.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:52.930
Maybe it is.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.410
America is pretty
innovative though.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:59.300
The book is also one way,
and it's someone else

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.530
creating the story.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:02.910
But yet, we're like, yay!

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:03.800
They're reading!

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:09.610
So I just question that
thinking sometimes.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.284
The one thing I would
say about a book,

00:49:11.284 --> 00:49:13.450
although the movies do this
well, and I love movies.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.030
I made movies.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.700
I still watch them obsessively.

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.930
Books helps you have perspective
take, and put yourself

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:23.180
in another person's shoes.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.200
And I don't think there's any
other media that can do that,

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.240
although maybe
virtual reality can,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.910
or maybe some new things
that are coming up can.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:33.970
But I do think books are
really important for that.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.640
But I mean, they're private.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:36.780
They're one way.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.660
They're reflective.

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.590
And we have to realize
some people like that.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:42.010
And I agree with you.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:46.030
If you're avoiding people, if
your child's avoiding people

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:48.340
by staring at this thing,
and they're an introvert,

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.197
and that's their
natural inclination,

00:49:50.197 --> 00:49:51.780
push them outside
of their boundaries.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.990
My son's like that.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:58.180
I push him as much as possible
to be in front of people.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.550
That's not his
natural inclination,

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:02.740
but some people are like that.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.380
And there's a pathway.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:05.620
You guys work at Google.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.515
There's a pathway
to a huge career

00:50:10.515 --> 00:50:12.890
for these people, these kids
that are staring at screens.

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:16.010
So if that's who
they are, maybe you

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.530
can find ways to
support it, while also

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:21.300
supporting other kinds
of socialization.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:21.911
Yes?

00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:22.410
You're back!

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:23.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm back.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.220
I know we're almost out of time,
but you touched on video games

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:26.160
at the end, so I
thought we'd just

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.550
talk about it for a second.

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:30.340
So again, my kids are three
and six, six-year-old boy.

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:33.700
We just started possibly to
introduce him to video games,

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:35.410
and I think your
comments about how

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:39.320
it's very male-driven
and sexualized for women,

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:39.900
et cetera.

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:41.800
So again, going
back to your comment

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.550
about it being all
about the content,

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:46.910
I think a "LittleBig
Planet" and "Minecraft"

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.674
are a lot different,
especially to a six-year-old.

00:50:49.674 --> 00:50:51.090
Because of course
he's gonna wanna

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.890
play the new "Star Wars" game
that's coming out, and whatnot.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.660
But it's gonna be
pretty strict on that.

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.140
As far as the girl, I would
definitely agree with you

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.610
that I'll encourage her to
play those games at that time,

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:05.430
but at three, I still
think she's a little young.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:07.530
But anyway, yeah, good
comments on video games.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:09.321
DR. YALDA UHLS: Yeah,
I mean, I didn't even

00:51:09.321 --> 00:51:12.760
have a-- I was just getting
ready for this talk,

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.640
and I put in girls
and video games.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.970
And I haven't paid attention
to that dialogue out there,

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:21.820
but when that came up,
I was just like, wow.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:24.490
If I'm a girl, and I
wanna play a video game,

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:27.470
I can't find any girls that
are gonna play it with me.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:30.970
You know, boys, the Pew
Research study that just came in

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:34.970
found that boys use this stuff
to hang out with their friends.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:36.950
Girls use social media.

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:38.880
So that might just be genetic.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.700
Maybe that's it.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.010
Or is it because they can't
find any other friends playing

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:46.530
video games, and they wanna
hang out with their girlfriends?

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:50.110
So I think somebody
interviewed me,

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.640
and she's like, I find
video games really boring.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.610
And I was like, me too.

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:56.430
But maybe that's
because there's not

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:57.950
enough video games made for us.

00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:59.840
We need more girls
doing this stuff.

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.951
You know Jane McGonigal?

00:52:01.951 --> 00:52:03.200
Some of you guys may know her.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.220
She's a big video
gamer, gorgeous woman,

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.912
just wrote a book about it.

00:52:09.912 --> 00:52:11.120
We need more women like that.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.287
We need more women,
maybe not thinking

00:52:13.287 --> 00:52:15.120
it's gonna solve every
problem in the world,

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.450
as some people do with the video
games, but getting into it,

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:23.070
playing it early, thinking
about that, and encouraging--

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:25.880
You'll have to push your girl
a little more than your boy,

00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.930
because she won't have
peers doing it with her,

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:31.010
but hopefully you can.

00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:32.780
OK, any other questions?

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:33.890
Time.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.380
Thank you very much.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.220
Thanks, Nadine.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.970
[APPLAUSE]
