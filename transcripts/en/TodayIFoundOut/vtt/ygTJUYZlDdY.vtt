00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.030
Naming a newly discovered species is a rather
prestigious privilege.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.410
As you can probably imagine then, many see
the act of choosing a suitable name for a

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.910
newly discovered creature as a task that requires
a great deal of consideration and thought,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.210
though this doesn’t necessarily mean scientist
don’t occasionally have a little fun with

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.950
it, as we’ll get into shortly.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.730
However, what is noteworthy to the topic at
hand is they must follow a rather lengthy

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.640
list of rules in doing so.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.680
You see, to name a newly discovered creature
you have to stick within a well-worn framework

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.340
of binomial nomenclature that has existed
in some way, shape or form since the eighteenth

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.340
century.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.220
First formalised by famed naturalist Carl
Linnaeus, there’s a Lord-of-the-Rings-thick

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.970
tome describing exactly how one should name
a creature.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.390
Known as The International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature, this book goes into way more

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.579
detail than is necessary for the purposes
of this article, so we’ll just offer a Cliff

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.700
notes version of what it discusses.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.079
To summarise, to appease the International
Commission on Zoological Nomenclature the

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.240
chosen name for a newly discovered creature
needs to be unique and, most pertinent to

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.220
the question posed at the beginning of this
article, the rules do state, “No author

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.990
should propose a name that, to his or her
knowledge or reasonable belief, would be likely

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.390
to give offence on any grounds.”

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.470
In addition, a less concrete, but nonetheless
commonly adhered to, rule is that when naming

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.890
a newly discovered species you shouldn’t
name it after yourself.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.890
Why?

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.000
Well in the words of the Virginia Museum of
Natural History’s curator emeritus, Judith

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.979
Winston, “That’s tacky.”

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.000
According to Winston, it’s also considered
somewhat uncouth to combine Greek and Latin

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.420
when naming a new creature, with some taxonomy
“purists” out there who would look down

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.970
upon the person who did this, even though
it doesn’t break any specific rule.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.090
We can only assume such people are also no
fun at parties.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.439
Moving on, it’s noted that so long as the
rules are followed a person wishing to name

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.860
a new creature can pretty much give it whatever
name they like.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.500
In doing so, many have targeted celebrities,
both because it’s a great way to get more

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.370
publicity towards said scientist’s work
and sometimes it’s just to honor a famous

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.370
person they admire.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.290
For example, consider the story of Ferdinando
Boero, a jellyfish expert and fan of musician

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.109
Frank Zappa who decided to combine his two
passions purely so that he could honor and

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.629
meet his musical idol.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.230
To do this Boero, who resided in Genoa, Italy
applied for a prestigious fellowship to study

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.219
jellyfish in Northern California.

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.819
Once there, Boero kept his eyes peeled for
any new species of the creature.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.709
Once he’d identified a few, he wrote to
Zappa asking the singer if he’d like the

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.989
honor of being immortalised forever as the
official scientific name of a cool jellyfish.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.481
Zappa replied, telling Boero in a letter penned
by his wife, “There is nothing I’d like

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:54.939
better than having a jellyfish named after
me.”

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.980
After receiving the letter, Boero gathered
up a number of samples and rushed to Zappa’s

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.079
LA mansion to ask the singer which jellyfish
he felt most connected to.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.029
Zappa dutifully obliged, picking out his favourite
jellyfish which Boero went on to name Phialella

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.499
zappai in his honor.

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:14.230
In yet another case of a celebrity being honored
by such a naming, we have a snail from northern

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.849
Queensland that is the only member of the
genus Crikey, literally named Crikey steveirwini,

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.949
in honor of the late Crocodile Hunter.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:25.870
The key word to note in the previous sentence
is “honor” because as far as we can tell,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.390
virtually every case in which a celebrity
or person of scientific prominence has had

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.219
something named after them, they’ve considered
it to be a compliment.

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.219
Likewise, in virtually every case we researched
the person naming a given creature considers

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:35.749
the act of doing so to be a compliment, even
if the creature isn’t exactly something

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.470
you’d think a person would be happy to be
forever associated with in scientific literature.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.519
For example, consider the curious case of,
Baracktrema obamai, the official scientific

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.049
name of a type of parasitic flatworm that
lives in the blood of Asian box turtles.

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.000
Now, when it was first reported that parasitologist
Thomas Platt had chosen this name for the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.010
parasite, it was framed by some in the press
as a deliberate, knowing jab at the then president.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.560
However, Platt would later clarify that he
intended for the gesture to be an honest compliment

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.239
to Obama, noting that the creature reminded
him of the president because – “It’s

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.239
long.

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.239
It’s thin.

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.239
And it’s cool as hell.”

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.349
This sentiment was echoed by other taxonomists
who explained in various interviews about

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.840
the parasite that naming anything after a
person is generally considered a huge honor

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.780
in the world of taxonomy because it is basically
enshrining that person in scientific literature

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.780
forever.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.070
A similar example from the other side of the
political aisle is the moth Neopalpa donaldtrumpi,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.380
a species of moth endemic to North America
named after then President-elect Donald Trump.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.250
As with the reported discovery and naming
of Baracktrema obamai, some in the media chose

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.550
to interpret the name as a jab at Trump.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.560
The fact that the moth is mostly unremarkable
save for the fact that the male of the species

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.480
has oddly small genitalia compared to its
moth compatriots only made for even more hyperbolic

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.480
headlines.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.910
In truth, though, the moth’s discover, Vazrick
Nazari chose the name because the moth possesses

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.550
scales on its head reminiscent of Donald Trump’s
distinctive hairstyle, which, looking at the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.070
picture at the top of this article.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.070
Kinda’ does…

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.110
Nazari would also note that he hoped naming
the moth after the president would highlight

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.310
“the importance of conservation of the fragile
habitats that still contain undescribed and

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.810
threatened species”.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.670
On that note, Nazari’s decision to name
the moth after Trump due to it resembling

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.620
him in some manner is a popular naming trend
with new species, some of our favourite examples

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.650
of which include –

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.921
A spider named after Johnny Cash discovered
near Folsom prison in California that, like

00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:33.730
the singer, is dressed all in black- Aphonopelma
johnnycashi.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.460
A bee named after Beyonce notable for having
a gigantic golden butt, with the namer stating

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.570
“I figured, if I’m ever going to name
a species after Beyoncé, this is it.”-

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.570
Scaptia beyonceae.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.450
A beetle named after Arnold Schwarzenegger
due to it possessing a pair of legs that resemble

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.710
large, flexed biceps- Agra schwarzeneggeri.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.770
A parasitic wasp named after Shakira due to
its habit of causing whatever it infects to

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.100
convulse and twist like it’s bellydancing-
Aleiodes shakirae.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.370
There are literally so many of these that
we couldn’t possible cover them all and

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.620
we invite anyone who’s interested to explore
this giant list of creatures named for individuals

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.620
to your heart’s content.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.030
But going back to the original posed question-
surely there must be at least one exception,

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.230
right?

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.950
One scientist who named a creature after someone
they disliked out of spite?

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:26.730
It turns out, there is at least one, credited
to none other than Carl Linnaeus himself.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.990
Linnaeus apparently got so sick of a botanist
called Johann Siegesbeck criticising his work

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.480
that he named what has been described as a
“small, useless European weed” after him.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.380
For the curious, the weed’s scientific name
is simply Siegesbeckia.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.330
Outside of this, however, it appears that
academics almost always choose to adhere to

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.220
the rule of naming things in such a way as
to not cause anyone offense, and it’s generally

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.460
considered a great honor to have a creature
named after you, regardless of how unsavory

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.200
said creature may be.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.820
There’s an unremarkable species of blind
cave beetle named Anophthalmus hitleri named

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.900
after Hitler.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.530
Yes, that Hitler.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.420
The discoverer of the species, Oscar Scheibel
named the beetle after Hitler after he’d

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.140
become chancellor of Germany, much to Hitler’s
delight who wrote Scheibel a letter of thanks.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.190
The name of the beetle is understandably a
source of controversy in taxonomy circles,

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.550
but it’s generally agreed renaming something
should never be done.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.840
This is rather unfortunate for the beetle
as it’s name has resulted in it becoming

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:47.789
popular among collectors and neo-nazis who
have now hunted it to near extinction.
