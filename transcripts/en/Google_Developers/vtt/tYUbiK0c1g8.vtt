MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.830
Well, it's getting pretty late.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.970
I think that was a
pretty good take,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.511
so let's just do one more, and
then we'll be out for the day.

00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:06.030
OK, Rob?

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.654
ROB: All right.

00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:07.870

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.347
MALE SPEAKER: Three.

00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:09.687
[HEAVY DRUMS START AND STOP]

00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:10.187
Two.

[HEAVY DRUMS START AND STOP]

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:11.560
ROB: Otherwise, as always--

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.637
DAVID EAST: Hey, Rob.

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:13.470
ROB: [CLEARS THROAT]

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.880
Oh, hey.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.460
What's up, David?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.960
DAVID EAST: Well,
uh, did I tell you

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.310
that I got my own YouTube show?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.295
ROB: Oh, no, dude.

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:18.920
That's awesome.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.340
What's it, uh-- what's
it going to be about?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.960
DAVID EAST: So,
like, you know, I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.840
was thinking there's not a
lot of screencast content

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.590
out there.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.620
And so I'm going to go and
make a bunch of screencasts

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.510
on Firebase.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.490
ROB: Well, that's sort of
exactly what we're doing here

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.980
for "Polycasts," a show about--

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.771
DAVID EAST: It's nothing
like that, really.

00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.260
Like I said, my show is
going to be on Firebase.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.490
You know, like, building
real-time, cross-platform apps

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.749
without any server code.

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.290
ROB: Well, I have
all this equipment,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.180
and I have this crew.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.976
So if you want, I can show
you the ropes some time.

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:48.017
So like how you put the--

00:00:48.017 --> 00:00:50.570
DAVID EAST: So I was thinking
of calling it "Firecasts,"

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.160
you know?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.170
Like the Firebase
is for the "fire."

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.460
ROB: Yeah, Firebase, yeah.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.800
DAVID EAST: And, you
know, like, the "cast"

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.259
comes from screencast.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.050
ROB: Screencasting.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.040
Yes.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.290
DAVID EAST: What do you think?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.470
