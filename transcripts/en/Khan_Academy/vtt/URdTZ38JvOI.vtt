00:00:00.565 --> 00:00:02.642
- [Sal] Let's say we wanted to compute

00:00:02.642 --> 00:00:04.559
eight and 38 hundredths

00:00:06.303 --> 00:00:08.720
minus four and 54 hundredths.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:14.474
See if you can pause this video,

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:17.437
and figure it out on your own.

00:00:17.437 --> 00:00:20.407
There are multiple
strategies for doing this.

00:00:20.407 --> 00:00:23.736
I'll tell you the way that
my head likes to do this.

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:25.274
I would view this as the same thing

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:27.524
as eight and 38 hundredths,

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:33.360
and then I would subtract
four and 38 hundredths.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.610
The reason why I pick 38
hundredths is that will cancel out,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.639
it'll take away these 38 hundredths.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.713
And then I still have to
subtract a little bit more.

00:00:40.713 --> 00:00:43.028
If I also subtracted 38 hundredths,

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:45.919
I have to subtract a
total of 54 hundredths.

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:49.127
Let's see, 54 is how much more than 38?

00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:51.969
I am doing this in my head as I speak.

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.969
To go from 38 to 48, I
need six, I need 10 more.

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:01.599
I need to subtract another 16 hundredths.

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:03.145
How did I think about that?

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:04.478
54 is 38 and 16.

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:08.864
If I'm subtracting 54,
I could break that up.

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:11.061
I could subtract 38 hundredths,

00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:13.460
and then I could subtract 16 hundredths.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.840
Why did I pick 38 hundredths?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.584
Because it matches up with this.

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:20.751
And so, if I say eight minus
four is going to be four,

00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:27.883
and then I have 38 hundredths
minus 38 hundredths,

00:01:27.883 --> 00:01:30.119
those are just gonna
cancel out with each other.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.396
So this minus that is just gonna be four.

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:35.896
And then I'd say four minus 16 hundredths.

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:39.674
So how do we think about that?

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:41.502
Well, you might be able to do this

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:42.760
in your head at this point.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.284
You might say: "OK, I
have to go 16 hundredths

00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:50.240
"less than four, that's gonna
be three and 84 hundredths."

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.234
Or, you might wanna just break it up.

00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:55.921
You could say: "OK, four
is the same thing as

00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:58.254
"three plus 100 hundredths."

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:01.296
Hundredths.

00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:06.528
And then I wanna take
away minus 16 hundredths.

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:10.409
100 minus 16 is 84.

00:02:13.087 --> 00:02:16.286
This part right over
here is 84 hundredths.

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:17.790
I'll write it out.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.707
Hundredths.

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:22.319
Which I can write as 0.84.

00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:27.007
Three plus 0.84, that's going to be,

00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:29.614
this is going to be equal to,

00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:33.349
we figured it out already multiple times,

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.349
three and 84 hundredths.

00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:38.589
Now, as I said, there's multiple ways

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:40.619
that we can try to tackle this.

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:43.613
For example, another way that I could do

00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:46.753
this one right over here is I could say,

00:02:46.753 --> 00:02:49.170
all right, lemme do the ones.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.820
I'd say, eight minus four.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.237
Eight minus four.

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:57.642
Plus.

00:02:57.642 --> 00:02:59.715
Let me try to do the tenths.

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:03.715
So, I could have three
tenths minus five tenths.

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:06.203
0.3 minus 0.5.

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:12.223
And then, I would have the hundredths.

00:03:12.223 --> 00:03:15.234
So, eight hundredths
minus four hundredths.

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:18.901
Plus eight hundredths
minus four hundredths.

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:22.589
Now, this is pretty easy to compute,

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.663
this is pretty easy to
compute, but what about this?

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:27.952
I don't have five tenths to take away.

00:03:27.952 --> 00:03:32.380
What I could do is, instead
of having an eight here,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.612
I could take one away from
it, and make that a seven.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:40.141
And so, I have one that I can
regroup someplace over here.

00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:41.933
I can reorganize it.

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:45.766
So, I could view this
as seven plus 10 tenths.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:50.497
And so, I can take those 10 tenths,

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:53.586
I could take those 10 tenths,
and add 'em right over here.

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:54.482
Lemme rewrite this.

00:03:54.482 --> 00:03:57.614
I could rewrite this as seven minus four,

00:03:57.614 --> 00:03:58.864
plus 10 tenths,

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:04.094
plus three tenths.

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.069
Actually, lemme just write
it all as plus three tenths.

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.461
I'm mixing different ways
of writing it this way,

00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:11.438
but that might be good.

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:12.938
Minus five tenths.

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:16.216
And then this part I could just compute.

00:04:16.216 --> 00:04:19.351
This is plus four hundredths.

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:20.979
Zero point zero.

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.429
Color.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:23.718
Plus four hundredths.

00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:27.198
This right here is gonna
be four hundredths.

00:04:27.198 --> 00:04:28.539
Now what is this going to be?

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.706
Seven minus four is going to be three.

00:04:33.177 --> 00:04:35.783
10 tenths plus three tenths.

00:04:35.783 --> 00:04:37.802
The right color.

00:04:37.802 --> 00:04:40.587
This is going to be three.

00:04:40.587 --> 00:04:44.754
And then, 10 tenths plus
three tenths is 13 tenths,

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:49.625
minus five tenths is eight tenths,

00:04:49.625 --> 00:04:51.537
and then I have four hundredths.

00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:53.447
Once again, 3.84.

00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:57.141
Three ones, eight tenths, four hundredths.

00:04:57.141 --> 00:04:59.474
Or, three and 84 hundredths.
