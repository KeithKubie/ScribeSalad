00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.080
SPEAKER: Welcome to the
talk by Betsy Teutsch on 100

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.040
for $100-- or, sorry.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.130
100 under $100: One Hundred
Tools for Empowering Women--

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.920
Global Women.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.700
And she gives a
comprehensive look

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.120
at effective and
low-cost solutions

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.700
for helping women in the
global south out of poverty.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.600
Most books on the subject
focus on one problem and one

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.050
solution, but Teutsch shares
100 successful proven paths out

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.600
of poverty in 11
different sectors

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.530
in a visually striking
book full of images

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.850
of vibrant, strong women.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580
The book is available
in paperback,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.570
and we have a number of copies
here for anybody who wants one.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.740
They're free of charge.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.794
And with that, I give
you Betsy Teutsch.

00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.540
BETSY TEUTSCH: Thanks so much.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.670
It's really great
to be at Google.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.460
Before I launch into telling
you about these tools in front

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.800
of me that are
both a combination

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.520
of low-tech and high-tech,
but they're all high impact,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.040
I wanted to just have kind
of a love letter to Google

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.360
and tell you how often
an author of any type

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.910
uses Google as search when
you're trying to verify things

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.450
as you go along in writing.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.100
But in my book in
particular, because it

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.800
was heavily photographic, there
were a lot of Google features

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.887
that made it possible.

00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:39.470
Really, I couldn't
have done this book

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.120
without Google Image search.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.900
It just was phenomenal.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.840
And sometimes I would
be looking for a picture

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.340
that I know I'd seen, which
is incredibly frustrating.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.680
I got better at keeping track
of pictures that I liked,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.490
but sometimes I
didn't realize that I

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.240
was going to want that
particular picture,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.890
and then I would have to
use a million tag words

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.740
and try to find it.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.590
And then Google Image,
and then scroll down,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.270
and there it would be.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.950
Because the book is printed,
I needed very high resolution

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.889
photographs.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.940
So I really liked
the tool that I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.980
could go in and
specify that I was only

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.890
searching for large photos.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.730
That was super helpful.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.490
And then I discovered
the feature

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.730
where you can click on an image
and move it up to the search

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.070
box, and that is super cool.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.910
You can then-- it shows you
a lot of different places

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.390
that that image
appears, and then

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.250
I could go through and
find-- sometimes it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.260
led me to places where
I could find more

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.910
information about the image.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.890
Because a lot of times,
an image on a website,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.780
you can't tell
where it came from.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.330
And I needed permission for
all the pictures in the book,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.710
so I had to track it
down to the source,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.270
and that was really challenging.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.570
Also, the book, I was
tracking 100 different tools,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.810
and I needed in 11 sectors.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.290
So I had all these
Google spreadsheets,

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.580
and I could color
code everything

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.670
and figure out how it all laid
out just with a visual scan.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.900
But then as I added tools, it
kept getting bigger and bigger,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.550
and then I couldn't
maneuver until I

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.340
learned about freezing rows.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.220
I mean, this might
be old hat to you,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.470
but to somebody that comes
in from a different field,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.310
I was like, wow.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.230
That is so smart.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.040
I can't believe somebody
thought of that.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.740
But it made the whole
thing absolutely possible.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.430
So what I want to focus on
today is the information

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.890
communication
technology section,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.490
which is six different
tools that I included.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.750
And the first challenge
of this section

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.880
was, how do you
subsume ICT, which

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.330
has transformed
the entire world,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.130
into a 500-word essay
and then six tools?

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.780
I mean, it was
hugely challenging.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.650
So I started out with the
primary tool, which to me seems

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.670
to be literacy in general.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.580
Because ICT is not
very useful if people

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.950
have no reading ability.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.760
It also is challenging
if the language is not

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.350
their native
language, but that's

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.260
another question that Google is
addressing through Translate.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.220
And I do use that often
when I'm going to a website

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.970
and it's in Spanish or
Chinese or something.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.650
And I'm very grateful for that.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.770
Literacy is really
the foundation.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.120
And the foundational tool
in the developing world,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.720
as many of you might
know, is cell phones.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.940
Does anybody
remember back to when

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.570
you had a cell phone like this?

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.794
It was how many years
ago, do you think?

00:04:51.794 --> 00:04:52.642
AUDIENCE: 10?

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:53.490
AUDIENCE: 15?

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.570
BETSY TEUTSCH: I would
say probably more like 15.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.620
This is a Nokia 1100, and
I bought this on eBay.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.620
It cost $20.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.690
Imagine that a 15-year-old
cell phone has a resale value.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.740
It was the best-selling
cell phone in the world.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.790
They sold about 250
million of them.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.300
And it really meets
the design factors

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.900
or the factors in
general that make

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.580
a tool popular in
the developing world.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.790
And it really upended
thinking about how to help

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.190
people who are impoverished.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.197
The people that we call the
bottom of the pyramid, people

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:32.780
that live on $1 a
day, there are a lot

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.060
of terms for the world's
poorest seventh or eighth.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.010
It's like one-- the world's
poorest billion people.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.380
So they live without
infrastructure of electricity,

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.740
they don't have
sanitation infrastructure,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.910
no running water.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.570
And obviously, things
like cell phones

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.450
don't do you much good
without electricity.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:01.780
But the proliferation of the
cell phone has been phenomenal.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.930
And there was a book
about 15 years ago,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.580
maybe 10, called "The Fortune
at the Bottom of the Pyramid."

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.280
And it was by an
economist named Prahalad,

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.630
and what he was pointing
out was that there

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.010
are business opportunities
among the world's poorest.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.910
That if you think of poor people
as customers, not as charity

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.710
cases, there are many ways
that you can design things

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.480
that people will want.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.710
And it was kind of a
capitalist argument.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.102
He wasn't really a
philanthropist or a do-gooder.

00:06:33.102 --> 00:06:35.560
He was just telling people that
there are a lot of business

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.600
opportunities.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.260
And when I looked back
at the book, most of them

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.530
are no longer
particularly relevant.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.820
And it was before the cell
phone had really taken off.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.300
So it really did prove his
case that if you could design

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.020
something that was-- that
meant a number of criteria,

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.480
it could be very successful.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.920
So the first is that it has
to solve a problem that people

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.420
perceive they have.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:04.050
One of the problems, for
example, with water filtration

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.430
is that in a lot of places,
people don't know germ theory,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.340
and they don't know that
their water is causing

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.677
them to be ill, and that the
water-borne diseases come

00:07:14.677 --> 00:07:17.010
from pathogens in the water,
because you can't see them.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.590
So teaching people
how to purify water

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.950
when they are unconvinced
that that needs to be done

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.930
is a hard sell.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.710
Getting people telephones
that never had them

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.560
was an easy sell.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.090
It is well designed.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.160
That's very crucial.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.880
You need things
to be attractive.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.010
And there's just something
about this little handheld, cute

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.840
telephone that everybody
loves intuitively.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.090
It also has a lot
of extra features

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.980
that are particularly compelling
for people in the developing

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.500
world.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:56.710
One is that when I press
this button, it lights.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.620
And if I press it twice,
the light stays on.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.840
And for people who were
using flashlights and having

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.080
to buy batteries all the time,
this was incredibly convenient.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.390
And you can think of all
the other functionalities

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.590
that even a really basic
cell phone like this has,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:18.404
such as texting
and a calculator.

00:08:18.404 --> 00:08:20.070
I've been in the
developing world trying

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.870
to communicate with a
vendor, and we've just

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.280
brought up our calculators.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.815
Negotiated back and forth.

00:08:27.815 --> 00:08:28.314
Yes?

00:08:28.314 --> 00:08:30.230
AUDIENCE: So what do
people do to charge them?

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.120
BETSY TEUTSCH: Well, you
raise an extremely important

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.799
question.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.429
There has always
been an interest

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.340
in getting people electricity
in the developing world.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.929
And people can--
sometimes they siphon off

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.750
electricity from a
grid, but the grids

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.400
are pretty unreliable
to begin with.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.850
People use batteries, but
they don't help very much

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.030
with the cell phone, because
you need to plug it in.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.960
They have generators and they
can run electricity that way.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.200
But cell phones have
been a huge driver

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.220
of the demand for electricity.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.780
So one of the things that
I wanted to talk about

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.800
was the way that these
tools are integrated.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.800
One thing brings another.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.540
And so that the cell
phone, people now

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.250
are reading books
on cell phones.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.220
They've gotten a little more--
obviously over the years,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.410
we've added more functionality.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.350
And I'm going to get
back to your question.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.050
But I did want to say
that we decided not to do

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.110
a photographic show today.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:34.086
But if anybody wants to
quick Google freedom241.com,

00:09:34.086 --> 00:09:36.910
you can see that there
is a smartphone that just

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.600
went on the market in India.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.570
Anybody-- this is a dumb phone?

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.600
This is called a feature phone.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.560
Does anybody want to
guess how much the Freedom

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.028
241 is going to cost?

00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:50.340
AUDIENCE: $4.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.130
BETSY TEUTSCH: $4.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.192
Had you already-- did
you know that already?

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.108
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:54.108 --> 00:09:55.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.395
BETSY TEUTSCH:
Did you design it?

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:57.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.640
$4.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.610
I don't think there are
any reviews out yet.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:03.820
But I mean, the drop
in prices is amazing.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.120
And just for the
record, just background,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.890
in the developing world,
you don't typically

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.440
have a cell phone plan.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.270
You buy the phone, and
you buy different ones.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.650
Some of them have radios.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:20.240
They have all different
kinds of things in them.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.135
And they just keep
buying them used.

00:10:23.135 --> 00:10:25.260
This isn't made anymore,
but I'm sure you can still

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.710
buy them in the market.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.000
And people buy minutes.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.250
They insert a card.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.760
So the big rush to the
bottom, the big price

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.880
wars in the developing world
are the price-- the cost

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.990
of minutes, cell phone minutes.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.500
So that also means
that people don't

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.290
have a reliable cell phone
number at the entry level.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.830
Because once you get a new
card, you get a new number.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.700
So they use cell phones
very differently.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:02.870
And I mentioned that electricity
is the next challenge.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.560
People have always
wanted electricity.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.140
And lights would be
the primary thing

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.150
that you would want
electricity for.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.920
But as I've been researching
this whole field,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.760
it seems to me that
cell phone charging is

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.910
driving the demand for lights.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.150
So I have a bunch of
different lights here.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:30.110
The key to cheap lighting that
is improving what they have,

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.120
which is kerosene lamps,
which is-- kerosene

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.660
is a fossil fuel and
dirty, and it's usually

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.430
subsidized by governments
kind of perversely.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.730
And the emissions are
really toxic for people

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.660
at home, which are primarily
the women and children.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.750
This is an LED light.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.010
And because solar panels have
gotten so much more efficient,

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.880
this is actually
the solar panel.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.160
This is what you need to charge.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.270
You leave it out during the
day, and then at night you

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.320
get eight hours of light.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.490
If you need the light to extend,
this is the lower wattage.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.200
If you need it-- if
you want it brighter,

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.030
if you can waste all your
charge, you can do it that way.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.910
And also they've-- because this
is marketed both in the rich

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:22.620
world and the poor world or the
fat world and the lean world,

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.020
as some people call it, there
are flashers to make it useful

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:30.420
to you to have in your cars,
an emergency like if you need

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.400
to flag down help.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.020
This is called the MPOWERD.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.110
MP-- it's the Luci.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.220
I like that name.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.620
And here are some--
here's another design.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.670
This is kind of
the next level up.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.070
This is the solar
charging panel.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.750
It's a little bit bigger.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:58.060
And it has your lower
wattage and a task light.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.140
It has higher wattage.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.810
And cell phone charging.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:10.496
So this is the kind of thing
that has huge appeal to people.

00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:11.870
It's a little bit
more expensive,

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.270
but part of the pricing
programs for these

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.705
is that if you buy something
like this for $10--

00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:23.650
it's around that price, and
there are many, many versions

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.860
of this in the developing
world-- you no longer have

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.910
to purchase kerosene.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.070
So eventually, there
is a price point

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.440
at which what you
didn't spend on kerosene

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.220
has paid for the lamp.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.280
You need help getting over the
hurdle of buying it up front,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:44.400
either through a loan or--
most likely through a loan.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.520
But even with interest,
you still come out ahead.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.985
And then you have a solar lamp.

00:13:48.985 --> 00:13:49.770
You own it.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.300
And it provides three times the
light that you previously had,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.820
and you've gotten rid of
all the smoke in the house.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.330
Another thing that
cell phones are driving

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.480
is reading and literacy.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.370
Because if you want
to text, you need

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.150
to know how to spell and write.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:12.920
And it's also driving an
interest in eyeglasses.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.480
There are a huge number of
people in the world that

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.500
have never checked their eyes.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.290
Because if you don't
know that there

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.670
is a simple,
inexpensive correction,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.350
you wouldn't think to do that.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:32.390
And even the most basic readers
now cost just a few dollars.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.430
They come from China.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.490
They're really cheap.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.970
There are a number
of social businesses

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:42.490
that focus on getting
glasses to people.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.430
And people's productivity
is hugely enhanced.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.230
The rate of-- the return
on investment for glasses

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.940
is something like seven to one.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:56.370
If a craftsman can't see what
she's doing as she gets older,

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.770
and then she gets readers,
she's way more productive.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.520
Schoolchildren, about
10% of schoolchildren

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.610
need eye correction.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.690
And of course, you
might have known people

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.620
or been one of them that
sit in the classroom

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.995
and don't know what's going
on because you can't actually

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:13.790
see it.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:19.290
So these cute little glasses
are called OneDollarGlasses.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.260
And they were created by a
physics teacher in Austria.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.500
And their idea is to
get the cheap lenses

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:34.330
from China-- most cheap
things come from China--

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.900
and then he created a machine.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.500
And just the raw material,
which is this really light wire,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.540
and the machine-- they teach
people how to mechanically

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.800
make the glasses on site.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.990
And you get to pick
what color bead you

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.740
want to kind of
personalize it a little.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.830
And they are so light that
they don't need eye pads.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.430
So that gets you to
one of the design

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.950
concepts of designing
things that are

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.720
for the bottom of the pyramid.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.630
To make them frugal, to
make them affordable,

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.180
you have to engineer them in
a way that is stripping down

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.560
in essentials.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.960
That means that they have
fewer parts that will break,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.780
fewer parts that need to
be accessed to begin with,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.220
but it still needs to work.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.100
So this is a great
example to me of ingenuity

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.650
and frugal engineering.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.070
I'm going to pass it around
if you want to see them.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.980
So these products
need to be attractive,

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.170
they need to be frugally
engineered, they need to work.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.630
That's really essential.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.200
People in the
developing world have

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.360
had a lot of experience
with things that don't work.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:52.560
So if you add warranties and
you give people more confidence

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.710
that if something fails,
they have recourse,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.280
then the adoption
rate goes way up.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.900
Because a big part
of the problem

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.710
is not that we don't
have solutions,

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.050
it's that we don't have
good implementation

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.300
of the solutions.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.869
So in some cases,
market distribution

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:13.579
is far more effective than
trying to just give things

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.230
to people.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:17.754
People don't particularly
appreciate things

00:17:17.754 --> 00:17:18.920
that are just given to them.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.740
And if you just give people
things, the designers of them

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.940
are not accountable for how
they're going to be used.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.790
I wanted to show you
another way that literacy

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.920
is expanding around the world.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:37.350
And this is just
basically a reader.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.190
I just put up on
my Facebook page,

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.600
does anybody have a dead reader?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.920
Because I wanted a sample.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.720
This company is
called Worldreader.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.440
And Worldreader has the mission
of getting reading material out

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.770
to schoolchildren.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.400
And they distribute a
package to a school that's

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.520
underwritten by--
this is underwriting

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.690
because it's education.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.140
You can't expect
kids to pay for it.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:07.370
But they have--
the schoolteachers

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.270
get to pick the content
for their school.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.910
Half is in English, half is
in their native language,

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:15.150
wherever they are.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:20.860
And the system comes with a
box with all these readers

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.320
and a big solar charging panel.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.270
And as you might know yourself,
a Kindle or whatever kind

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.450
of reader you have holds a
charge for a really long time.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.480
They are stripped down
intentionally for that purpose.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.970
They don't have a lot of
other functions on them.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:41.390
So the energy goes towards
bringing up the material.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:46.000
So a kid who never had
any access to books,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.610
now she has a library
that she can bring home

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.020
every night with a couple
hundred books in it.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:55.240
And they get some-- they
can elect a couple too

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.220
from the system.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.900
And I'm happy to say that my
book is-- they have uploaded

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.260
it, so that's exciting.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.620
I can look in on
the metrics and see

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.950
who's opened my book
and what country

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.140
and how many pages they've read.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.880
And it doesn't tell you
if it had any impact.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.335
That is the trouble
with statistics.

00:19:13.335 --> 00:19:16.600
But it's an amazing setup.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:23.000
And these are
backlit, so that also

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.710
gets over the hurdle of not
having electric lights at home,

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.570
or any lights really, because
it brings its own light.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.450
It's very, very effective.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.810
So I wanted to show
you another way

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.340
in which the internet and
the exchange of information

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.580
is impacting how ideas
move around the world.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:48.540
Our original thought was that we
are the center of the universe,

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.530
and everything comes
from Cambridge or MIT

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.490
out to the world from
the global north.

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.400
But in fact, a lot of ideas are
originating in the global south

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.350
where people have
the-- necessity

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.020
is the mother of invention.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.380
So because people need
things, they figure them out.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.740
So one thing that's incredibly
frustrating for anybody

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.070
in any kind of a workshop is
having an unreliable electrical

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.010
grid.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.240
So a guy, Alfredo
Moser in Argentina,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.400
had this problem
just browning out,

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.550
or the lights just went off in
his little factory warehouse

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.440
often, and he just
couldn't work.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.910
So it wasn't that he
couldn't work his machines.

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.830
It was that he couldn't see
because there were no lights.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:40.320
So he figured out that if
he put a hole in the ceiling

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.480
and then he put a light
in, just a plastic bottle

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.010
and filled it with water-- this
one is not filled with water--

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:54.590
but filled it with water, and
then cut a hole, stuck it up,

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:58.530
the light refracts through
the water, and in daylight

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:02.460
gives about the equivalent
of 60 watts of light.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.650
And it does that without
any electricity at all.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.910
It's just natural light.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.340
It's kind of like a light
tunnel or a skylight,

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.320
but the water adds to
the refractory effect.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.750
So this was such a
simple and great idea

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:23.610
that it, through
various websites,

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.270
just kind of went
around the world.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.000
So it really took off
in the Philippines.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.230
And it's taken off in South
Africa and many other places.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.010
It's only helpful
during the day,

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.290
but still, free
light during the day

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:43.030
is a lot better than sitting
in the dark or with a lamp.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:47.840
And so I call this global south
to global south transmission

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.670
of ideas.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.080
Some of you might like
websites like Appropedia,

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.230
or there are all these how
to do it-type websites.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.010
So if you look up
solar light bulb,

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.820
you'll see dozens of different
ways and directions and slides.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.000
And most of them
don't rely on text.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.420
So if people in a
different part of the world

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.450
know how to find
them, and even if they

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:14.350
don't have good literacy or even
if they're not literate at all,

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.245
it's just images.

00:22:15.245 --> 00:22:16.870
They can figure out
how to make things.

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:21.402
So the internet has been a
fabulous way of spreading ideas

00:22:21.402 --> 00:22:22.110
around the world.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:28.270
And I'm sure will continue to be
so, only more so going forward.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:32.150
The way that this all
impacts women is women

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:36.310
have been pretty marginalized
in most patriarchal cultures,

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.440
probably all, from
tools and technology.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.010
And it's great to be in
the Ada Lovelace hall.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.270
I was last week
at the Commission

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.740
on the Status of Women
at the United Nations,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:51.290
and I saw a movie that
featured Ada Lovelace.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:56.540
It's called "CODE:
Debugging the Gender Gap."

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.500
And it's about the challenge of
the absence of women in tech.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.680
Not that you would know
anything about that.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.720
And this is a way-- the
internet and all these tools,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.490
once women can get
them, is a way for them

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:14.940
to kind of circumvent the
gatekeepers, the men that

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.780
would sort of think that they
shouldn't know this stuff

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:18.780
or have any access.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.800
And it isn't
necessarily that women

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.670
think they shouldn't
have access to it.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.080
It's because when you've
been denied access,

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.780
you think that you somehow
couldn't figure it out.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.590
It's way too complicated.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.280
Only men can do
this kind of thing.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.390
And when women
realize and understand

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.110
and through keeping
girls in school

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:41.130
that these are neutral
tools and girls are just

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.900
as good at working
them as boys are,

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.300
it begins to be an equalizer.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.090
I'm going to stop talking
and see if anybody

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.230
has questions or comments.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.780
AUDIENCE: How were the
instructions for the light sort

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.960
of transferred?

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.656
I mean--

00:24:01.656 --> 00:24:03.030
BETSY TEUTSCH:
Well, they usually

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.710
do it with a series of slides.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.810
They take pictures.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.160
And of course, that's
the other great thing.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.810
Just so many cell phones
now have video capacity.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.650
And I mean, not everybody
is stuck at this level.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.380
That's the entry level.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.610
Slides and videos, people upload
videos from all over the world.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.810
It's just amazing.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.480
And they try to break them down.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.560
And then if you go to a
bigger site like Appropedia,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:38.410
I think they have, like, 2,000--
200,000 pages or something like

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:38.910
that.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.680
And people, if you
need a translation,

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.140
you just post you need
somebody to translate it,

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.200
and people will do that.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.690
So the visuals and slideshows
are the most effective.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.810
And now I just
discovered Google Slides.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.720
You can even use Google
to do a slideshow.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.420
People use kind of the
same tools everywhere.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.010
And it's just so-- what I loved
about this research was just

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:11.130
seeing all the ingenious and
innovative ways that people

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.490
adapt ideas to their
local situation.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:19.570
A guy in South Africa took
this idea and he thought, well,

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.780
why don't we combine it
with the LED charging?

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.090
So he came up with a product
that is called the Lightie.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:31.110
And they usually use
a two-liter bottle.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:35.160
This is just a smaller
version for demo purposes.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:42.560
And he wrapped a solar
charging panel around it

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.330
so that you get free-- without
blocking the top light--

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:50.690
so you get free
light during the day,

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.460
and then I don't
know how it turns on.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.834
I don't know where
the switch is.

00:25:53.834 --> 00:25:56.936
But then you get light
at night as well.

00:25:56.936 --> 00:25:59.310
I presume that he has some
kind of a shield or something,

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.760
because you can't turn it
off, unlike an electric light.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.380
Once it's on, it
would just be on.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.410
So I don't-- but people
combine these tools.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.970
The last tool that I was
going to tell you about

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:15.400
was integrating a whole
bunch of different tools

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.820
in really cool ways.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.390
So they now-- solar panels
have dropped in price,

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.580
and they're more efficient.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.000
So a solar panel that used to
be this big is now this big.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.500
And it used to cost that much,
and now it costs this much

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.570
and gives the same output.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.370
So people can have
individual products

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.960
like this that are
solar charging,

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.900
but then they have to remember
to put them out every night.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.500
And if they forget, they
don't have light the next day.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.980
You know, people are people.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.484
So having a solar panel that
just sits there and charges

00:26:46.484 --> 00:26:48.150
is obviously going
to be more effective,

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.420
and give you enough
for many lights.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.250
And then the lights
are plugged in.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.480
They're not portable lights.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.510
They're attached.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:00.330
And the charging and
other small appliances.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.070
A tablet, people are
starting to have tablets.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.190
There's a $40
computer now in India.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:11.070
So even the poorest
of the population

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.889
now has a lot of
things, a lot of devices

00:27:13.889 --> 00:27:14.930
that they have to charge.

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:19.650
So combining microfinance,
which is small lending,

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.210
and cell phone, then you
can in some countries,

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.160
particularly Kenya-- Kenya
is in the forefront of what

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.290
we call mobile money,
using your cell

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.410
phone to send money,
which obviates the need

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.560
to have a checking account.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.420
You just have money
in your-- it's money

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.670
that you send around
electronically.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.330
It's kind of like Venmo,
but on a massive scale.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.030
About 70% of Kenyans,
rich and poor,

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:50.310
use-- it's called-- M-Pesa
is what it's called.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:56.050
So you can make a monthly or
weekly payment for yourself,

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:57.260
for your solar panel.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.110
They install it.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.270
You have to just put
a down payment down.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.920
Then you make regular
payments via cell phone,

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.980
which lowers the
transaction cost enormously.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.610
Part of what makes
microfinance expensive

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:15.900
is that the loan officer
goes around and, like,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.860
picks up everybody's cash.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.580
And he or she goes by bike.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:21.670
I mean, you can imagine.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.740
You've gotta pay that
person for their time.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.867
This way, joop!

00:28:25.867 --> 00:28:26.450
It's paid for.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.590
And then after a set
number of payments--

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.840
it's usually a year
and a half of payments

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:38.060
that are set-- then your
solar panel is unlocked,

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.140
and you own it.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.730
And then for the rest of the
life of the solar panel, which

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:42.520
is long.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.540
Can be 25-- we don't
even know how long

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.570
they last, because we
haven't tested that yet.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.930
You essentially have
free electricity,

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.820
except for maybe having
to replace the battery.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:58.570
So it's integrating cell phone,
microfinance, mobile money,

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:02.850
and the product, and getting
it to people that need it.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:07.110
So some more comments
or questions?

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.620
AUDIENCE: So you can get off
the grid with a solar panel.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.027
What do you do-- how do
we deal with connectivity?

00:29:14.027 --> 00:29:15.610
I would assume that
there would always

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.730
be the possibility that,
especially if there's

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:21.820
a single network provider,
that they would take a monopoly

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.330
position and charge too much.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.880
BETSY TEUTSCH: Well,
there are a lot

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.820
of people working on
this problem, including

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.660
Mark Zuckerberg.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.720
There's something
called internet.com.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.560
They're running into a lot
of resistance in India,

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.270
trying to make internet kind
of like a human right Wi-Fi,

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.810
that you should be
able to access it.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.760
What people in poor countries
do is go to internet cafes.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.630
It's very cheap, and it
becomes kind of a social hub.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.210
People in many places haven't
gotten to cell phones.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.850
I mean, we can romanticize.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.570
There are more people
in the world that

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.740
have cell phones than toilets.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.020
That's true.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.520
But there are a couple
of billion people

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.174
that don't have toilets.

00:30:06.174 --> 00:30:09.410
So it's a little bit
of a cheat to make

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:14.310
that-- to trot out that
statistic, amazing as it is.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:18.100
A lot of people are still
really relying on radio.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.640
Radio is a very effective ICT
tool, and it's hyper local.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.760
So in places that
no-- that don't yet

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.580
have access to the internet,
they rely on radio.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.370
I'm not sure how the
connectivity works.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:33.640
It's different
country to country.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.140
And obviously, there are a
lot more networks in cities

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.970
than in remote areas.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.960
But I would say that
there are probably very

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.244
few places on Earth that have
never seen a cell phone by now.

00:30:46.244 --> 00:30:47.910
I don't know what's
going to happen when

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:50.410
they have the $4 smartphone.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.960
They have a lot of apps.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.100
They preload them
with a lot of things.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:58.320
And what-- I think for
end users like myself,

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.330
I'm constantly confused
about what's in the cloud

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.820
and what's in my phone and
what's coming from where.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.630
When I've gone abroad and
turned off my-- gone on airplane

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.690
mode-- you know, I was
in London and I did that,

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.830
and, like, I'm walking along,
and all of a sudden, my phone

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:19.880
starts pinging.

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.120
You know, like 10
texts came through

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.070
because I walked through a spot
that had Wi-Fi or something.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.860
We're in this sort of
transitional state.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.660
I imagine eventually
the globe will

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.090
be-- you can just get
internet from anywhere,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.710
but we're not close to that.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.460
AUDIENCE: Could you
just talk a little bit

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.580
about what motivated
you to write this book,

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.910
and what you're hoping to have
happen after having written

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:43.571
such a book?

00:31:43.571 --> 00:31:45.362
BETSY TEUTSCH: Well,
what a great question.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.600
I was tremendously
excited the more

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.090
I learned about these really
impactful, really smart, really

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:55.030
affordable tools.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.870
And I felt like there's so
much bad news out in the world.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:01.710
And most people, when you say
that two billion people live

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.970
on $1 to $2 a day,
it's just overwhelming.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.210
It just sounds so dismal
and impossible that there's

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:09.400
anything that we can do.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.510
And in fact, there
are so many people

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.220
working on really great things.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.700
I was just over this
morning at the D-Lab at MIT.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.280
And that focuses--
it's a design lab,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.420
and it focuses on
using our design skills

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.640
to improve people's lives.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.620
I also came in from
a feminist side

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.680
and really wondering, like,
who's paying attention

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.560
to the women that are kind
of blocked out of the design

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.770
process, out of
the supply chain?

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:39.410
They're not that
active in the-- a lot

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.220
of women in the developing
world can't make

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.680
their own financial decisions.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.430
Their husbands decide what's
going to be spent on them.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.310
Children can't make
their own decisions.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.510
Their dads decide if they
stay in school or not.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.150
So I really felt like focusing
on what women were doing,

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:59.650
and how women could more own
this sector or this connection

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:01.722
of technology, and
what will empower

00:33:01.722 --> 00:33:02.930
them would be very important.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.150
So I went searching for images.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.970
I didn't start looking
to write a book.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:09.950
I really just wanted
to gather information

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:14.990
about how women were
engaging technology

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.190
to have good examples.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:19.040
And I just found the
most amazing images.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.660
And I guess Pinterest--
Pinterest isn't really

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.220
a competition for you.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.670
It's just a complementary
social media.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.654
But I started Pinterest
boards of various things

00:33:29.654 --> 00:33:31.070
that I was finding,
and eventually

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.550
I just found so
many great images

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.827
of women really owning the
tools that they were designing.

00:33:38.827 --> 00:33:40.910
A lot of them are the
engineers, but a lot of them

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.450
are people that are using them.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.080
And so I thought, this is
a whole different narrative

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.580
about women in the
developing world.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.920
Usually we see them
standing in line

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.660
in camps with emaciated
children and looking very--

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.460
they are often victimized.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:57.910
That's part of the narrative.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.880
But there is this vibrant,
developing world narrative

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:05.650
of women that are smart and
experienced and taking charge,

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.590
and joining women's
groups, and creating

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.580
a whole different
future for themselves

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.969
and for their families.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.529
So that's how I got
started on the book.

00:34:13.529 --> 00:34:16.710
And the book is a
very flexible tool.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.310
And it could be used-- I
kind of imagine my reader

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:23.540
to be somebody like
myself, like a baby boomer

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.610
woman with a little time and
interest in sharing her better

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.260
fortune with the
rest of the world.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.100
But it's turning out
that that's one segment.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.100
I also have-- I'm working
with science teachers

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.936
to create a junior high and
high school science curriculum.

00:34:40.936 --> 00:34:43.310
Turns out, everybody's been
scratching their heads about,

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.880
how do you get girls
interested in STEM?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:50.469
And how do you prevent that
drop-off so that by the time

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.030
they could even think
about majoring in STEM

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.920
at college, that they
haven't already left?

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.520
And it turns out, one big
answer is that girls really

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.370
like to know that they
can do something that will

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.790
help and make a difference.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:09.030
About more than half
of engineering programs

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.590
that focus on design for the
developing world are female.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.640
So it's a great strategy
to show boys and girls

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.230
that meeting these
global challenges

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.450
is a way to not--
you're not just

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:24.900
sitting in a science class.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.740
You're sitting in a
class that will help

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:28.500
you be able to do something.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.110
So that is really exciting.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.240
And I'm also finding
some traction

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.870
getting to organizations that
are sharing this on the ground

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.876
with people that live in places
where it's kind a cookbook.

00:35:38.876 --> 00:35:40.500
They can look through
and find a couple

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.530
of things that seem
like it might really

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.640
work for them, that
they hadn't known about.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.500
And that is very exciting to me.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.120
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to say,

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.010
it looks as though
your book has a focus

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:55.090
mostly on women in rural areas.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:00.760
And so do you think that by
and large, there aren't so

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.320
many problems in the
cities, or that they already

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.079
have the necessary tools?

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:07.370
BETSY TEUTSCH: I would say
that women are about equally

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:12.110
distributed between rural
areas, which we call remote,

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:17.140
last-mile areas, and slums.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.430
The world is really
trending urban.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:24.480
I looked in the book at,
what are the 20 largest

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.950
cities in the world?

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.360
And 19 of them are
in the global south,

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.520
and I had never heard of them.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.030
And what you're talking
about a city-- I mean,

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.347
that's just because I
haven't traveled that much

00:36:35.347 --> 00:36:36.180
in the global south.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.950
But it wasn't like Tokyo.

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:40.690
When I grew up,
everybody said Tokyo's

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:41.940
the biggest city in the world.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.900
Well, it's not.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.620
So what these cities are, they
have a core with a developed

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.990
center, with a modern
infrastructure,

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.900
and then they have
enormous perimeter slums.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.200
And they call them
shanty towns, favelas,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.214
a lot of different names.

00:36:58.214 --> 00:37:00.380
Depending where you live,
they have different names.

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:04.210
But South Africa's
are pretty famous.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.160
And they don't have
infrastructure.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.590
They don't have plumbing,
they don't have running water,

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:12.560
they don't have
electricity, they

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.540
don't have a municipal
system, so the kids

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.800
don't have public schools.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.160
So anybody that wants
to access anything

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.270
has to just kind of figure
out how to make it up.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:28.300
So that has huge impacts
on women as well.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:35.140
And in some ways, it's easier to
improve women's lives in cities

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.620
because it's denser population.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.330
If you want to have, say,
public health interventions,

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.780
it's much easier to
roll them out in a city

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.760
where it's not so
hard-- you know,

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.290
there are so many people there,
you can have more impact.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.070
The challenge of really
remote areas is just,

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:53.397
how do you get the
information there,

00:37:53.397 --> 00:37:55.230
but how do you get the
physical stuff there?

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.350
You know, the roads
are really bad.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:59.370
That's why when
internet comes, it

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.870
does give people
access to things

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.387
that they didn't have before.

00:38:03.387 --> 00:38:04.220
So it's interesting.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:09.490
I do have a large section of
the book on smallholder farmers

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:16.180
and about-- in the developing
world, about 70% of the food

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.880
is grown by women.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.020
So when you think of a
developing world farmer,

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:24.110
you don't-- a woman doesn't
pop up in your head.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:24.920
You think of a man.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.400
But that's actually-- and
that's because partly, the men

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.930
are trickling out to
cities and migrants

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.510
going around, working,
going to other countries

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.350
where they can work.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.360
And often, the women
are left behind.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:42.430
So I would say that
rural women are

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.010
kind of doubly disadvantaged.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.620
They don't have
exposure to new ideas.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.800
The traditions are
far more constraining.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.230
And there's
patriarchal traditions.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.150
And also, there is
still an incentive

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.150
to have more
children if you farm,

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.729
because you have more hands.

00:39:02.729 --> 00:39:04.270
You have more mouths
to feed, but you

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.440
have more people to help out.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.970
Whereas in the
city, women and men

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:13.210
alike have really
adopted family planning.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:18.100
The family size has
plunged in one generation.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:23.200
In Mexico, it was five children
per mother a decade ago--

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.970
I mean, a generation
ago, and now it's two.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:29.190
That's why a lot of what
we're hearing about-- we

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.630
don't have that many people
coming from Mexico anymore.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:34.090
They're coming through Mexico,
but they're not actually

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:34.990
Mexican.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:38.480
So women in the cities are
more exposed to new ideas.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.960
And one of those new
ideas is education

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.340
for girls and empowerment
and smaller families.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:45.930
Thank you.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.067
