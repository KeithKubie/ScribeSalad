00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.630
let's explore the API a little bit.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.470
Now, we saw earlier that we could set
the location of the panorama by calling

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.000
setPosition on the Street View Panorama
object and give it latitude and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.580
longitude.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.470
In addition to that,
we could also get the location, and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.430
this will return
a StreetViewPanoramaLocation Object.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.610
This object itself will have
a latitude and longitude on it.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.060
So you can use this if the user has
moved around the map to understand

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.160
where the user is presently, and then
you can plot that location on a map.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.290
So, for example, if the user was
hiking down the Grand Canyon,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.750
you could have a map beside
the StreetViewPanoramaView, and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.750
as the user moves down the Grand Canyon,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590
or the user moves along in Street View,
you can have a pin on the map update to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.730
show the user's location based
on what they're looking at.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.170
You can also getPanoramaCamera
on the StreetViewPanorama.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.780
Now you might remember the camera
from earlier in this course, and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.450
the concepts are the same.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.420
This will return
a StreetViewPanoramaCamera

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.570
as you saw when we
were creating the app.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.930
And this will allow you to read or
edit things such as the zoom, the tilt,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.550
the bearing, etc.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.840
Let's take a look at the code now and
look at the panorama camera again and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.940
see how we had set it up.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.150
So, if you remember back to the code,
I've changed the camera view

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.460
to be one where it points south
by setting the bearing to be 180.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.640
I created a StreetViewPanoramaCamera,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.540
and I tell the panorama to animate
to that camera at this bearing.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.220
I could have done similar
things with tilt or

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.660
zoom, just like I would with
the mapping application.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.510
So, if you're not familiar with this,
check back to the sections where we

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.530
explored using the camera on a map
view earlier in this course.
