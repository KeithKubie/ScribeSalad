00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.398
Fantasy is certain, certainly a very common thing that everyone engages in. And

00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:08.296
when I'm talking about fantasy, it doesn't necessarily have to be erotic or

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:13.564
sexual fantasy. a lot of people daydream or fantasize about multiple things

00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:18.862
throughout the day. So, maybe the perfect job they want or maybe like a certain

00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:24.680
house or maybe the latest, you know, iPhone or whatever the situation may be.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.904
And so, its completely natural that people might fantasize about sex or erotic

00:00:28.904 --> 00:00:34.410
touch or just liking someone and being with them. In fact, in some recent

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.970
studies 93% of men and 86% of women reported that they do engage in, in

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.306
fantasy. It can be really helpful for individuals to be engaging in fan,

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.902
fantasy-type thoughts on their own as long as, again, they've got some

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:54.090
cognitive kind of restructuring that they've done. If they have any walls or

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.538
blockades around sex or sexuality. so that they aren't kind of beating

00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:02.170
themselves up later for fantasizing. So as long as they know that it's okay and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.840
they're comfortable doing that, then it's fine. Couples also can engage in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.930
fantasy together. So they can tell each other their fantasies, tell each other

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.955
their desires. And it doesn't necessarily mean that they have to act on those

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:21.374
as a couple or as individuals. Fantasy is, in it's definition, a fantasy. which

00:01:21.374 --> 00:01:24.713
often times is things we might not do or maybe that we have done and we're just

00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:29.904
thinking about in hindsight. and as long as it's done in a way that is healthy

00:01:29.904 --> 00:01:35.166
for the individual, healthy for the couple, then absolutely. It's totally

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.520
natural normal healthy and nothing wrong with it.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.730
&gt;&gt; At what age is it possible for people to reach orgazam, men and women?

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.992
&gt;&gt; That's a great question. So, I hear this question a lot. you know when, when

00:01:45.992 --> 00:01:50.972
can people orgasm, when can they kind of experience sexually, you know,

00:01:50.972 --> 00:01:58.636
positive feelings, And so it's really interesting is, there are images of

00:01:58.636 --> 00:02:04.758
infants in utero. Particularly male infants or infants with penises we don't

00:02:04.758 --> 00:02:09.312
really know their gender yet, but there are images of them in utero touching

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:15.406
their penises, fondling themselves. So one of the things that the techs that

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:20.550
look at ultrasounds in the medical field will tell you is that oftentimes. It's

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.575
hard to identify male infants because their hands are usually between their

00:02:25.575 --> 00:02:32.277
legs so much in utero that they never actually are able to see the penis. And

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:35.876
so, although we can't be certain because, certainly there is no way to get

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:41.283
inside the mind of an infant or even really ask them any questions. There's

00:02:41.283 --> 00:02:45.236
pretty good literature to support that both babies that happen to be male and

00:02:45.236 --> 00:02:49.248
babies that happen to be female are experiencing sexual feelings, orgasmic type

00:02:49.248 --> 00:02:55.326
feelings when, when their touching their genitalia. Which is a totally natural

00:02:55.326 --> 00:03:00.491
normal thing. Even for small infants and toddlers to engage in. now are we

00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:07.900
talking about, you know, an orgasm where a male actually like ejaculates. Well,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.030
no, certainly not in infancy. that doesn't happen until males tend to be like

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.508
12, 13 years old. But if we're talking about orgasmic feelings, there's,

00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:22.203
there's actually, we don't really know exactly when that starts. It's, it's as

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:26.729
young as the person you know, becomes curious about their own body and, and

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.500
starts exploring, so
