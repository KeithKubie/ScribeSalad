00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.990
Do you remember back in our lesson on motivation and emotion when we discussed

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.772
Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and we talked the top level of the hierarchy,

00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:13.290
which was self-actualization? Well, our next type of psychotherapy was

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.890
developed by Carl Rogers, and its purpose is to help a client reach their

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.016
greatest potential. So, this top layer of the hierarchy. This is called

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:25.668
client-centered therapy. This is a form of humanistic therapy where the

00:00:25.668 --> 00:00:29.633
therapist shows unconditional positive regard for the patient, meaning the

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.720
therapist genuinely accepts the individual and empathizes with the client, no

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.695
matter what the person has done. The basic idea behind Rogers' humanistic

00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:44.477
therapy is that the mismatch between who people think they are and who they

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:47.832
think they should be, or would like to be, is the source of their low

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:54.610
self-esteem and problems. In other words, there's a mismatch between the real

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.730
and the ideal self. The job of the therapist, therefore, is to be so accepting

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.450
of the person that their real self and ideal self becomes one and the same.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.182
That is, they like who they really are and they accept who they really are. The

00:01:09.182 --> 00:01:12.584
end result of a successful treatment would be that the individual develop a

00:01:12.584 --> 00:01:16.040
strong sense of self worth, and that he or she has the confidence to strive for

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.750
self-fulfillment.
