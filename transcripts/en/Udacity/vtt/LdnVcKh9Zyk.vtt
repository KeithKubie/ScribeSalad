00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.100
So to quickly summarize,
we learned about image transformations,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.110
not just about image filtering.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.880
Remember, we talked a lot
about how to do warping in

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.690
things like even when we
played around with panoramas.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.890
This is some of the foundations
that we're going to use.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.379
We're going to talk about morphing,
but we're going to come back and

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.360
use these, not just image filtering,
but image transformations and warping

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.440
to help us do the kinds of computational
photography that we are interested in.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.580
We basically looked at all kinds
of transformations, rigid,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.540
projective transformations of images.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.430
And we actually kind of
looked at what parameters and

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.900
how to do this simple types
of things using matrices.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.860
If anybody's curious,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.730
more, more detail exists on chapter
2 of the Rick Szeliski book.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.480
I look it up.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.440
And also, I just, of course, as usual,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.440
relied on other people's slides to
generate the slides that you saw.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.440
More information will be
available on the website.
