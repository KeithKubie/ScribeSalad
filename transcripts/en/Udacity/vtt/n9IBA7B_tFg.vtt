00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.390
The security parameters for
type of traffic.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.812
For example all HTTP
connections from host A to

00:00:06.812 --> 00:00:10.070
B are described in
a security association.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.170
Security association is asymmetric.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.410
For example for TCP connection
from A to B, we need one SA for

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.630
traffic from A to B, and
another SA for traffic from B to A.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.010
An N host may need many SA's, and
it uses an SA database to store them.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.610
Each SA has a unique index, and this
is the Security Parameter Index or SPI.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.580
The SPI is included in an algorithm
packet, so that the receiver can

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.530
use it to look up the SA to unprocess,
for example, to decrypt the packet.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.990
For example, when A and
B agree on the security parameters,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.680
both sides will store the same
SA to describe these parameters.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.690
And a unique index for
B's copy of the SA is sent to A, so

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.020
that A can store this SPI in its SA.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.300
Then when A process the packet, it uses
the parameters defined in this SA, and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.890
also includes this SPI so that P
can unprocess the packet correctly.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.340
The security perimeters define the
security mechanisms, and the determined

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.580
by the security policies, which
are stored in a security policy database
