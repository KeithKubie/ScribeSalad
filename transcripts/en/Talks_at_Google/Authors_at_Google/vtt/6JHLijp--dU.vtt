00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.100
ALDEN MILLS: Thank you for
sharing your lunch with us.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.420
SPEAKER: Good to have y'all.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.200
ALDEN MILLS: Thank you, Austin.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.980
SPEAKER: So listening to
that, I had CEO, entrepreneur,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.870
inventor, Navy SEAL, author,
father of three, four--

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.620
ALDEN MILLS: Four.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.320
SPEAKER: Four.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.190
Where does it end?

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.565
Are you a software
engineer, too?

00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:26.740
ALDEN MILLS: Two dogs.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.120
Two dogs.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.920
No, I am not a
software engineer.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.345
That's too hard.

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:33.970
SPEAKER: I have a
hard time believing--

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.470
ALDEN MILLS: No,
that one's hard.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.040
SPEAKER: You'd be surprised.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.707
You could do it.

00:00:38.807 --> 00:00:40.390
So we're here to
talk about your book.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.550
You just wrote
"Unstoppable Teams."

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.970
I'm proud to say, I
read the whole thing.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:46.817
Thanks.

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:48.400
ALDEN MILLS: Thank
you for doing that.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.720
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.350
Well, I thought it
was funny because I

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.370
read nothing but sci-fi.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.578
That's the only thing I read.

00:00:52.578 --> 00:00:54.670
And I've never finished a
serious book in my life.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.100
And I was reading
that on a plane

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.680
and it was motivating
me to finish reading it.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.650
So I thought that was really
funny, because I otherwise

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.165
don't read a whole
lot of non-fiction.

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:08.290
ALDEN MILLS: You know what?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.810
I could use an Amazon
review just like that.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.180
The fact that it motivated
you to go from one chapter

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.475
to the next, that's
a great compliment.

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:19.100
SPEAKER: Great.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.050
Yeah, I'll put it on--

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.340
ALDEN MILLS: Thank
you for reading it.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.790
SPEAKER: You're welcome.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.380
I'll put it on
Google Play, though.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.130
ALDEN MILLS: Good.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.800
Google Play.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.300
Better.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.490
SPEAKER: So what inspired
you to write this book?

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.280
ALDEN MILLS: I had written
my first book called

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.340
"Be Unstoppable," and it
took me 10 years to do it.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.330
And the trigger for writing
that book was in SEAL Team

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.420
make you write a
just in case letter

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.520
before you go off on a mission.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.890
And the idea behind
the just in case letter

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.600
is you kind of get
out all your regrets,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.970
all your thanks,
all your gratitudes,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.670
so you can go in with an
open heart and a clear mind

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.050
into a mission.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.720
And should you come back paying
the ultimate sacrifice and they

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.270
would hand a flag and a
letter to your next of kin.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.650
And it took me so long to
write that because I really

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.070
wanted the just in case
letter to be for my four boys.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.590
And one of my buddies did
come back on his shield.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.130
And I knew he had to write this
letter to an 18-month-old son.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.830
And I kept wondering, OK,
what do you write to a child

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.660
in knowing that you're not going
to be in that child's life?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.860
So what could that be?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.700
And after 10 years, "Be
Unstoppable" came out.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.220
And it was really a
parable with nonfiction

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.960
at the end of each of them.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.860
But the whole focus was
about leading yourself.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.460
And about leading yourself
was about how to persist,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.670
how to get up every
time you failed.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.950
And Anna read a whole bunch
of wonderful accolades,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.510
but the fact of
the matter is I've

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.550
failed way more than
I've ever succeeded.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.680
And I wanted to pass that
along to my four boys

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.270
that it's all about persisting.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.100
And at the end of
that last chapter,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.570
I talk about teaming up.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.860
But it was just 10, 15 pages.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.630
But there's so much more
to it because in the end,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.370
being able to lead
yourself is just

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.730
the beginning to teaming
up with other people

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.630
and doing something far
beyond what you originally

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.220
thought you could achieve.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.320
And so this was the intent was
to pick up where I left off.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.850
SPEAKER: So you kind
of switched gears,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.950
whereas this one talks
in the first third or so

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.560
about leading yourself and
the rest is about teamwork,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.810
the other one's
all about yourself.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.680
And then the last
section's about you.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.630
ALDEN MILLS: Right.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.230
You know, the
first one is really

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.370
about dealing with the internal
struggles that somebody has

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.240
and deciding what
they can or can't do.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.030
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.110
Well, I understand you
have in the first chapter--

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.170
so you have a story, something
about a monster from the Black

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.690
Lagoon and a man--

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.810
there's no two ways about it.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.360
He has half a butt.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.110
ALDEN MILLS: Yeah.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.080
SPEAKER: I was wondering if you
could maybe tell us that story.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.580
ALDEN MILLS: OK.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.760
SPEAKER: Mind if I step
back and give you--

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.970
ALDEN MILLS: Sure.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.640
So Austin is referring
to this character.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.570
And this character is the
Creature from the Black Lagoon.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.960
And this is what you see when
you walk through the entrance

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.893
into SEAL training
in the compound.

00:04:33.893 --> 00:04:36.060
You walk through the front
gates after they give you

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.350
permission to come in.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.890
And you turn to the right
and the creature's there.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.600
And it stands about
five feet tall.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.240
It's got that wooden plaque
around his neck that says,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.580
so you want to be a frog man?

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.860
Frog man's a World War II
term for a Navy SEAL today.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.830
And SEAL, by the
way, is an acronym

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.280
for Sleep Eat And Lounge.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.890
That's what my wife would say.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.380
Sea, Air, And Land.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.110
And when you get to see that,
it takes about two years

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.690
to see the creature.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.370
And you have to do this simple
little physical training

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.500
exercise of push ups, pull ups,
sit ups, a run, and a swim.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.690
It's condensed, but if you
train for it, you can pass that.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.340
And on average, you have
to have done that three

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.000
times before you get
to see the creature.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.370
And then even after you
get to see the creature,

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.430
you don't actually get
to start SEAL training.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.910
They put you in this pre-phase
training for about seven weeks.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.040
And at the end of
the seventh week,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.850
right before you were
to start SEAL training,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.460
they make you do that
test one more time.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.100
But this time around, they
bring in this character,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.910
which I'll bring to life the
story in the first chapter,

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.280
which I talk about.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.280
And he was missing
his left butt cheek

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.320
thanks to a rocket
propelled grenade

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.420
from his time in Vietnam.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.020
And he had this deep
Southern accent.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.300
And he walks with a limp.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.760
And he walks in front
of the creature.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.830
And we got about
122 of us there.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:20.660
And he says, class
181, gather round here.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.510
I want to let you in
on a little secret.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.760
You all interested to
know how to make it

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.420
through Navy SEAL training?

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.120
We're like, yeah.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.560
We want some of that.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.910
We were like kids to a
campfire around this creature.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.110
Yeah, I figured as much.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.606
You see, it ain't complicated.

00:06:39.606 --> 00:06:46.090
You just have to decide how
much you're willing to pay.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.420
Now, here's the rub.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.880
I know for a fact 80%
of you ain't going

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.230
to be willing to pay the price.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.970
You know why?

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.780
Because you all want to
be a SEAL on a sunny day.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.550
And that's a problem.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.130
You see, your country, she
don't need SEALs on sunny days.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.360
She needs them on scary days
when it's cold, it's dark,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.120
and it's wet.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.612
And that crack over your
head, that ain't thunder.

00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:24.930
That's somebody
wanting you dead.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.430
How bad you want to
be a SEAL on that day?

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.590
Well, that's my job.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:37.390
You see, it's my job to create
a conversation between here

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.910
and here.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.730
A conversation
that's going to drive

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:48.870
you to make a decision on how
much you're willing to pay.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.250
Oh, how am I going to do that?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.290
Well, I'm going to do it
just like those Japanese do

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.000
making a samurai sword.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.380
You know how they do that?

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:03.240
They take out the medal and they
heat it up and they pound on it

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.680
and they stick it in cold water.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.930
You know how many times
they have to do that?

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.700
I don't want to know
that answer, right?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.380
About 2,000 times.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.880
That's what I figure
I'm going to do

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.180
to you just in my phase alone.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.220
My crucible right here.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.380
What's this crucible?

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.550
A large piece of
broken up asphalt

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.690
with little white
flippers painted on it,

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.590
some pull up bars
and some dip bars.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:31.190
That's it.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.240
There is nothing
sophisticated there.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.380
And oh, the cold
water, well that's

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.757
49 seconds sprint from here.

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:39.590
Mother Nature is going
to provide that right

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.159
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:46.980
And while he's talking, these 26
instructors come up behind him.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.020
He goes, oh yeah, and
my hammers, well, that's

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.830
these guys right here.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.720
And they're all
standing there smiling.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.710
It's not a drill sergeant
approach in SEAL team.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.890
It's more like a Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde kind of thing.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.950
So do yourself a favor.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:13.410
You think real hard before you
start this training on how much

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.730
you want to be here and how
much you're willing to pay.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:22.475
And while you do, enjoy
the sunny San Diego day.

00:09:22.475 --> 00:09:22.975
Bye now.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.765
That was instructor Memphis.

00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:29.160
I talk about that.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.790
And it really is the scene that
sets the beginning of the book.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.260
And I wanted to include that as
the opening salvo to the book

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.470
because it's that
conversation between what

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.730
I call the head and the heart.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:50.530
Now, you may think
of it as can't, can.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.230
I call it the whiner
and the whisperer.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.700
And we all know the whiner.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.450
You don't have to go
through SEAL training

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.690
to be introduced to our whiner.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.668
We all have it.

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.210
You know how hard
that's going to be?

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.130
We'd have to recode that?

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.760
Oh my god, it's going
to take forever.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.760
How do you know we can
even get it done on time.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.370
That's an unrealistic deadline.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.700
It can't happen.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.480
We haven't even created
the technology yet.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.410
And then there's that whisperer.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.680
Wouldn't it be
cool if we did it?

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.110
How would we get it done?

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.430
Hey, let's try it this way.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.210
The point of the fact that
I use a couple of Navy SEAL

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.030
stories in the book isn't
to try and convince people

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.020
to be a Navy SEAL.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.630
It has nothing to do with that.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.520
It has everything to do with,
hey, some of the same things

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.340
they taught us being
in the SEAL are exactly

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.630
the same things we all use to
overcome any obstacle there is.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.210
And that conversation of
learning to lead inside

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.170
yourself, which is really
the first chunk of the book,

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.800
is a very important
start to leading a team,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.950
because the team becomes a
direct reflection of you.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.730
And how you deal with that
conversation internally will

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.300
also be how you deal with the
conversation that other people

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.900
on your team are having, as
well, dealing with the doubts,

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.440
dealing with the I can'ts,
and flipping the conversation

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.350
to get them to
focus on the I can.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.330
Let's do it.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.670
SPEAKER: That was a great story.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.670
ALDEN MILLS: So there's a story.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.180
SPEAKER: That was awesome.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:27.680
Thank you.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.847
ALDEN MILLS: You're welcome.

00:11:28.847 --> 00:11:31.280
SPEAKER: Well, you talked
about the head and the heart,

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.870
I'm kind of curious--

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.068
so I have an example of my
life where I don't necessarily

00:11:36.068 --> 00:11:38.110
have the motivation I need
to get something done.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.960
So when I go solo hunting,
no one is depending on me.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.690
No one cares other than
myself if I finish the mission

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:50.190
and actually go several
miles or just go 20 feet in--

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.425
ALDEN MILLS: And eat
some Snicker bars.

00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:53.550
SPEAKER: And head back out.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.700
I mean, if anything my
wife openly advocates

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.180
for me to come back sooner.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.833
So I'm curious-- but
I still kind want

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:00.750
to complete that goal.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.960
I want to go out and be
serious and camp by myself.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.720
How do I motivate
myself and kind of fight

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.627
that conflict between my heart,
which says you can do it.

00:12:09.627 --> 00:12:10.960
It'd be awesome if you did this.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.600
Versus my head, which
is kind of freaking out.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.430
ALDEN MILLS: We
humans have something

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.820
that, as far as we all
know, no other animal

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.010
has capability to do.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.530
That's called transcendence.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.800
Transcendence is nothing more
than a psychological term

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.910
for our ability to
envision something.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.220
We can envision a future.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.450
We can envision
somebody's feelings.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.480
That's called empathy.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.044
We can envision an outcome.

00:12:44.044 --> 00:12:49.840
And I certainly didn't
know the term transcendence

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.360
when I was going
through SEAL team

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.320
or when I was
looking at bankruptcy

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.820
in developing my
first set of products,

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.850
realizing they were
just not going to work.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.660
But I kept going through
the suffering phase

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.820
because I would
think about, hey,

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.860
what would this feel like
if I got to the other side?

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.230
And how cool would this be--

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:18.900
and sometimes, like in
the case of SEAL training,

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.040
I got to a point where I was the
only officer left in Hell Week

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.480
and I seriously
considered quitting.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.948
And the reason I started
considering quitting is that--

00:13:29.948 --> 00:13:32.240
I didn't finish off that
story with Instructor Memphis.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:38.480
We started with 122,
64 passed that test.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.350
Six weeks later, we're
at 34 starting Hell Week.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.950
And Hell Week is this--

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.768
probably the
greatest conversation

00:13:46.768 --> 00:13:49.060
that you have in at least
first phase of SEAL training.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.630
And they take you from a Sunday
evening to a Friday afternoon

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:56.260
and they give you a total of
about 3 and 1/2 hours of sleep.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.620
And if anybody's spent
multiple days without sleep,

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.850
you know what happens
around day 72 hours into it.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.440
You start hallucinating.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.165
Your brain is no longer helpful.

00:14:07.165 --> 00:14:09.700
You start running
totally on your heart

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.920
and what's important to you.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.340
And during those darkest
moments where I started thinking

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.430
of quitting-- and the way I was
thinking and quitting is that

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.440
they were coming to me going--

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.200
and they'd be
whispering in my ear--

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.390
sir, how do you
think you're going

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:31.580
to be able to lead a
platoon when you're already

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.800
down to 18 people in Hell Week?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.860
And this is only six weeks in.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.680
You're a terrible leader.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.960
You shouldn't be here.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.240
You can't lead.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.830
Do you see this?

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.740
And it was a real
bruise to the ego

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:52.700
because we had lost
that many people.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.790
And I was really
like, wow, he's right.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.640
We're 17 enlisted and me.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.110
And he got me doubting myself.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.250
And just when I would think
about these darkest moments,

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.410
I would flip the switch
and think about, OK, well,

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.030
what would the outcome be?

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.370
Because I knew that I
wanted to be a father

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.290
somewhere down that road.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.180
What's my conversation
with my child going

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:24.320
to be like 20 years from now
when I say to him or her,

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.180
don't do what Dad did.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.320
Stick it out.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.550
Keep going.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.510
Don't quit.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.010
Because the only
reason I'd be doing

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.133
is that I just lost
faith in myself.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.300
SPEAKER: That'd be a hard
conversation with a child.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.967
ALDEN MILLS: That's
a hard conversation.

00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:41.070
And it was those
moments, those moments

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.910
of focusing on an outcome
where I was focusing

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.430
on the impact of how
somebody else would

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.890
feel that was really
important to me,

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.180
that made the difference.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.580
So I bring it full
circle to you,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:59.290
sneaking around trying to
shoot an elk or a deer.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.390
Perhaps you want
to have children.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.130
And perhaps you
want those children

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.840
to go out and hunt
with you at some point.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.060
Well, boy, wouldn't it be cool
to teach your child how to get

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.962
that first hunt together?

00:16:12.962 --> 00:16:14.920
And how are you going to
do that if you're just

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.350
chickening out and sitting
in a pile of rhododendrons

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.470
eating Snickers bars?

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.190
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.692
So that transcendence, then,
I guess I can use that.

00:16:21.692 --> 00:16:22.900
ALDEN MILLS: So there you go.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:23.692
SPEAKER: It's good.

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:25.900
ALDEN MILLS: It's a long
winded answer, but--

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.090
SPEAKER: Well, that's
very related to your book.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.640
And one thing I
thought was interesting

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.460
is I don't remember a
single time in the book

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.350
where you mentioned that
anyone can be a leader.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.340
In fact, you, in the
first few sections,

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.630
ask the readers to
kind of introspect,

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.340
ask people around them to find
out what their skill set is.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.340
So if someone's not--

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.310
their skill set isn't
prone to leadership,

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.768
should they just
set the book down?

00:16:51.768 --> 00:16:54.820
Like, what's their MO
for reading this book?

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.730
ALDEN MILLS: So what he's
referring to is triangulation.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.650
And how do you find
your superpower?

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.770
What I do say is leaders,
maybe they're born.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.280
But everybody's a leader.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.692
Every single person is a leader.

00:17:09.692 --> 00:17:11.609
Now, you may say, like,
well, that's not true.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:13.829
OK, do you drink Mountain Dew?

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.540
Well, yeah.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.040
Do you have a couple
of friends that

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.980
go drink Mountain Dew with you
over in those swinging chairs.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.700
Well, yeah, I do.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.750
Well, guess what?

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.369
You just led your
friends to go have

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.960
some Mountain Dew with you.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.770
Now, other people are
smokers or coffee drinkers.

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.320
You know, the only way
that you're not a leader

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.910
is if you don't have a follower.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.750
But even then, you're
leading yourself.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:40.430
So the idea that you can only be
born with a certain leadership

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:42.740
gene, that's not what
that chapter is about.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.190
That chapter is about, hey,
what's your superpower?

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.650
Because all of us, when
you're building a team,

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.410
it's like taking a whole
series of puzzle pieces

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.710
and trying to figure out
how these pieces are going

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.380
to go together to go in
a direction to accomplish

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.780
something bigger than yourself.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.180
The hardest thing for
the leader is going,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.450
well, I've been
ordained as the leader,

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:09.250
therefore they must follow and
do exactly what I say to do.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.125
That is not going to work.

00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:15.750
SPEAKER: Right.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.490
Yeah.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.310
And that's a theme that I've
pulled out of your book,

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.083
as well as many other
readings I've done--

00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:24.750
fictional readings,
of course, because--

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.708
ALDEN MILLS: Of course.

00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:28.260
But there's a lot of great
leadership in science fiction.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:28.770
SPEAKER: Yeah, there is.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.150
ALDEN MILLS: "Ender's
Game," you read that, right?

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.233
SPEAKER: My favorite book.

00:18:31.233 --> 00:18:32.350
ALDEN MILLS: There you go.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.710
Marine Corps reads that book.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.377
SPEAKER: Really?

00:18:34.377 --> 00:18:36.160
Very interesting.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:43.400
So out of that, I was noting
that humility as a leader

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.280
was really important.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.440
Can you speak to
that a little bit?

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.610
Because you bring
it up in your book.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.260
I've read it in a
lot of other places.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.260
And it seems like leadership
isn't, as you write it,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.730
about showing how
awesome you are,

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.460
but instead showing how
awesome all your teammates are

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.040
all the time.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.860
So can you talk about humility?

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.590
ALDEN MILLS: The best way
I can describe humility

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:13.110
is if it becomes all
about you all the time,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.790
there's no room
for anybody else.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.260
It becomes this--
it's all about me,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.290
therefore you're
here to work-- and I

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:24.170
am a real stickler
with the teams

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.940
that I've built when people
say, well, yeah, Alden, I

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.380
got this team and I have
10 people working for me.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.730
I can't stand that
preposition "for."

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.190
No, it's "with."

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.200
Every team,
including what we had

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.660
in SEAL team, this company,
an entrepreneurial adventure--

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.520
they're all volunteers.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.500
And they're all
volunteering to decide, hey,

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.530
I want to work because
I think this would

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.980
be an interesting place to
take my energy and my efforts

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.550
and do something greater
than I could do by myself.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.920
It will be one of the
biggest challenges

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.860
that all of us leaders
will face in the future

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.990
as the gig economy
continues to grow,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.150
people get more and more
power to individually go,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:09.772
you know what?

00:20:09.772 --> 00:20:10.480
The heck with it.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.300
I'm going to drive
Uber or Lyft and I'm

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.700
going to rent my sofas out
in my apartment and voila.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.730
I'm a new entrepreneur.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.445
But the real exciting thing is
when people go, you know what?

00:20:23.445 --> 00:20:25.570
I tried that for a little
while and the gig economy

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.510
it's not really all
it's cracked up to be.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.970
I really want to go
solve a big problem

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.920
and I can't do it by myself.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.700
And if you only have somebody
out there thumping their chest

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.150
saying no, no, no, no,
you're here to work for me,

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.170
that pushes people away.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.190
But if the person then
says, I'm here to help you.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.360
I'm here to help you.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.170
I'm here to help all of
us move in this direction

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.270
to create something
greater than any of us

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:57.310
could ever imagine to do,
well, that's an attraction.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.860
And all of us have
pride and ego.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.890
And we also have a fair
amount of insecurity.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.560
It can be very difficult
for us to set aside

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.290
all those different things
to then say, you know what?

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:11.300
You're awesome at coding.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.220
I suck at coding.

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:14.440
I need your help.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.750
You are fantastic
at communication.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.970
And we need somebody
to communicate this

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.250
to the other silos in Google.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.990
And when those sorts
of acknowledgments,

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.260
which is the humility
piece, calling it right out,

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.090
this is what I'm terrible at.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.100
I really need this help.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.470
People will more
often than not--

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.030
and because this is actually a
proven scientific thing now--

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:43.260
is we reciprocate with care.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.080
Unless you're a psychopath
where the amygdala is no longer

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.950
firing and you don't get
an emotional connection,

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.890
the large majority of
us, our amygdalas fire.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.190
And when somebody holds a
door open for somebody else,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.030
you typically turn
back and say, oh, I'm

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.110
going to hold the door
open for-- is there

00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.930
somebody behind me?

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.590
Should I hold the
door open for them?

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.660
That's the same thing
that I'm referring

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.800
to when it comes to humility,
and most importantly, the care

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.200
framework that we talk
about in the book,

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.710
is that the more you start
to show how much you care

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:18.420
authentically for your team,
the more they will care back

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.540
and eventually start
to dare because they

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.560
won't be worried about
their own selfish desires.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.100
They'll be moving to
a selfless desires

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.677
of what the team stands for.

00:22:32.677 --> 00:22:33.260
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:33.760
Thank you.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.960
And you said the word CARE.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.320
That's a big acronym, right?

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.320
ALDEN MILLS: Yes.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.237
SPEAKER: You have a lot
of acronyms your book.

00:22:41.237 --> 00:22:43.910
Not as many as there are
at Google, certainly, but--

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.360
ALDEN MILLS: Yeah, that is one
thing software and military

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.290
have in common--

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.150
acronyms.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.060
I try to make mine really
super simple because I'm

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.230
terrible at memorizing things,
so I made it out of CARE,

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.380
because that's the main
thesis of the book is

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.480
what I call care-based leading.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.970
And the more that
you can build care

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.310
based connections
with your team--

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.490
and that is emotionally--

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.020
the more they will mentally
be triggered to say,

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.480
hey, I'm going to go all in.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.270
Because the hardest thing is
getting somebody to go from,

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.200
yeah, I'm engaged.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.190
It's cool.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:20.073
I'm doing my work.

00:23:20.073 --> 00:23:20.990
I'm here 9:00 to 5:00.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:23.210
But I'm not thinking
about the team

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:24.770
problem in the
middle of the night

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.687
when I go to the bathroom.

00:23:26.687 --> 00:23:28.520
The people on my teams,
I want you thinking.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.430
I want to engage.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.720
I want you to own this.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.260
And how do you get people to
make that jump from only being

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:41.200
selfish about them to, like, oh
no, we have to make this work.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.520
And that takes an
emotional connection.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.850
SPEAKER: So can you tell us
what the CARE framework is,

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:50.840
kind of break it down for us and
maybe give us a story about it?

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.710
ALDEN MILLS: Yes.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.366
I can do all of that.

00:23:53.366 --> 00:23:56.398
SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:23:56.398 --> 00:23:57.940
ALDEN MILLS: Let me
think about that.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.650
Let me see the best
way-- so we had a couple

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.690
of slides that we put together.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.750
And that first one
was the creature.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.250
Oh, yeah.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.340
Now we're here.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.460
So I'm going to bring
this slide up to you.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:18.210
And this slide was my
greatest invention.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.250
I was going to solve the
world body fat problems.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.490
It's the world's
greatest body fat device.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.850
It's called the rotating
weight system, otherwise known

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:28.900
as a body ref.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.036
Do you know what it does?

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:34.350
No, super cool, though.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.460
It's rotating.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.020
It's got weight in it.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.990
Move it all around.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:43.200
No, that was a problem, right?

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.700
I didn't really
get that message.

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:49.230
Nobody really understood
that I don't understand

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.950
why something I hold my hands
is going to burn fat in my butt.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.360
It didn't make sense to them.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.220
And I raised a million and
a half dollars to do that.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.920
And I did it through
37 friends and family.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.890
And I had this small
team that was with me

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.050
throughout the whole adventure.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.510
And they were buying
what we were selling.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.810
And that is four years of work.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.850
And eventually what
happened is I got brought

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:19.500
in to a small group
of investors who said,

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.640
newsflash, you don't
have enough money left,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.970
because I'd learned
$1,475,000 worth of ways

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.661
not to launch a product.

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:32.280
I'm down to my last
$25,000 and they're like,

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.650
you don't have enough money
to pay the manufacturers,

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.930
the lawyers, the accountants.

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.730
It's over.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.550
You're embarrassing yourself.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:44.550
Go get a job.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:48.620
And that was one of the first
big civilian moments for me,

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.180
because I'd gone to
the Naval Academy

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.472
and then I'd gone to SEAL team.

00:25:51.472 --> 00:25:53.900
So my first real job,
actually, was in software.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.000
And then I started
this business.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.490
And I heard Instructor Memphis
and a few other instructors

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.580
going, you know, how much
are you willing to pay?

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.140
And it was only because we had
built such strong relationships

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.900
with everybody on the team
and they worked for months

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.700
without pay that--

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.270
and I was introducing these
other people, these investors,

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.440
to this next product.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.270
And that was this.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:27.100
And this, the perfect
push up, was three months

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.000
from never existing.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
And it was because
the people on the team

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.770
had cared so much about--

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.450
we weren't a fitness company.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:40.590
We were a company that was going
to create a next generation

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.480
health care company,
that we were

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.870
going to help people understand
that the best health was taking

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.720
care of each other
and themselves.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.910
So I bring those two
pieces up because that was

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.190
the trigger that took the CARE.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.460
And fellas, if you can bring
me to the first step of team

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:04.450
actions on the PowerPoint?

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.680
SPEAKER: You could also
click through here, I think.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.805
ALDEN MILLS: I didn't want
to ruin one slide that's

00:27:08.805 --> 00:27:09.560
hidden in there.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.137
I can jump forward.

00:27:11.137 --> 00:27:11.970
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.320
--what they were doing there.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.070
SPEAKER: I've heard
of the second product.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.500
I have not heard of the first.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.780
ALDEN MILLS: Yeah.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.020
Four years of work right there,
and the second product, boom,

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.870
took off.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:28.600
So in a nutshell, those
are the team actions.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.720
And I'm happy to go through
them in a lot of detail.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.160
But I want you to think
of it like a flywheel.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.650
It's Connect, Achieve,
Respect, Empower.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.440
And when you look at each
of those different actions,

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.560
you may say, well, it
doesn't go exactly like that.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.680
Think of it from just
the beginning stages of,

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:56.550
OK, we have to assemble a team
to create a new microservice.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.660
Who do I need on that team?

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:03.060
Well, I need A, B, C,
D, E, F, and G, right?

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.070
What's the very
first thing you do

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.420
when you're creating that team?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.220
You want to connect with them.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.017
You want to make a
connection to say, hey,

00:28:14.017 --> 00:28:15.100
this is where we're going.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.010
This is what we're all about.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.180
And how do you connect?

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.670
And what's the purpose of
connecting with somebody?

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.450
And is it just send
an email, or is it

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:28.230
having that human moment
together, like you and I did

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.750
earlier this week when
we got on Zoom together

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.970
and we saw each other's
facial expressions

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:34.800
and shared some
stories together.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.030
Right?

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.770
I break it down
into what connect,

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:43.410
which is through communication
credibility and commitment.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.170
Communication, by the way,
as you may or may not know,

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.590
55% of our communication
is broken down

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.450
into how we move our body.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.340
It's all body gestures.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.410
And then 38% is our tone.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.230
How important is this?

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.280
Or not?

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.120
And the last 7%
becomes the words.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:07.470
That's what they say.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.290
But all of those pieces
come into deciding

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.620
in a very quick period of
time inside your brain, hey,

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.660
do I trust this person?

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.650
Is this worth trying?

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.610
Because the whole idea of
connection is to build trust.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.710
And as you build trust,
as you go out to achieve--

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.960
because achieving is
what a team does--

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.560
is to set direction.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.730
And in setting direction,
there's a whole series--

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:35.380
and depending how long our
fictitious micro webservice

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.990
team has to go go
to work, let's say

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.600
they've got to take two
years to build their thing.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.170
There's going to be a series
of achieving that's going

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.880
on where you're aspiring.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.100
You're assuming that they're
doing the right things.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.950
At the same time, you're
also setting up assessments

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.270
to check on people.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.030
You're assuring them
and you're appreciating

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.030
the efforts that are going
in and the perspective

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.130
of what they've been doing.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:05.770
If you'll notice, I did
C's, A's, R's, and E's,

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.060
because again, that's my
way to remember things.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.560
So thankfully, in
the English language

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.400
you can describe lots
of different ways

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.030
in the same words.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.580
And then from achieve
it comes to respect.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.230
And respect is one
of the areas where

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.180
I think you'll find a lot of
people make some mistakes,

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.440
that a lot of people
go, I'm the team leader,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:30.200
therefore I have the authority.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.920
You must respect my authority.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.140
Even in the military
in the SEAL team,

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.550
I was the young lieutenant going
off to do my first deployment.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.580
Yet, the large majority
of everybody on my team

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.190
had multiple years
of deployments

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.680
underneath them, multiple
more combat missions

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.910
than I ever had.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.980
So if I walked into a
platoon going, well,

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.472
I'm the senior guy here,
pay attention to me,

00:30:55.472 --> 00:30:57.430
that would have lasted
all of about 10 seconds.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.390
And by the way, they
could have fired me.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:01.150
ALDEN MILLS: Oh, really?

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:01.850
SPEAKER: No.

00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.970
So the way you get respect
is either through authority

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.630
or through actions.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.350
And that's what
respect's all about.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:12.590
And by the way, what's the
point of even having respect?

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.460
Why do you want it?

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.280
Anybody?

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.780
SPEAKER: Yeah, you
can shout it out.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.760
AUDIENCE: Get things done.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.260
SPEAKER: Get things
done, he said.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.180
Contribution.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.140
Exactly.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.210
You want to create
an environment where

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:30.080
everybody's point of
view is respected enough

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.950
that you may go, hey,
I have a new idea,

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.920
and you're not worried about
somebody laughing at you going,

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.300
that's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.110
No.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.390
Mutual respect is about
getting different points

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:47.050
of view that diversity of
thought, which, to me, is what

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.600
diversity is really
all about, is

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.230
you want diversity of thought,
not diversity of heart.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.690
And the great thing about
multiple different cultures

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.913
is that you get the
different points of view

00:31:59.913 --> 00:32:01.830
that can give you the
different opportunities.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.100
But if you don't create a
mutually respectful workplace,

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.640
then the great ideas
won't percolate.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.900
And then that brings
you to empowerment,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.057
which is about educate,
enable, and engage.

00:32:13.057 --> 00:32:15.140
SPEAKER: So we actually
care a lot about inclusion

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.420
hear, diversity and
inclusion at Google.

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.030
And it sounds like respect
really goes in line with that,

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:23.240
with making sure
voices are heard.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.920
I think you had a story about
someone when you were going

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.616
to Bosnia who had an idea--

00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:32.215
it was a laptop?

00:32:32.215 --> 00:32:32.965
ALDEN MILLS: Yeah.

00:32:32.965 --> 00:32:33.980
SPEAKER: Maybe
you can tell that?

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:34.700
ALDEN MILLS: You want
to hear that story?

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:35.750
SPEAKER: Yeah, it's a good one.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.290
ALDEN MILLS: Well,
you got to promise me

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.832
you're going to read the book
if I tell all these stories out

00:32:39.832 --> 00:32:41.370
here.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.220
He's referring to a mission.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:45.050
And I don't talk a
lot about missions.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.690
But there is one mission I talk
at the highest level about,

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.550
and that's in Bosnia.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:54.780
And we were hunting a person
indicted for a war crime.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.750
And these people,
there were 88 of them,

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.270
and I think ours was number
two or three on the list.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.750
It was nicknamed Dr. Death.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:07.730
And to really
understand Bosnia is

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:13.250
to understand how awful the
human race can actually go.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:15.380
Thanks to the internet
today, everyone's

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.100
got to see how awful it can
be most recently with some

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.330
of the issues we've been
dealing with over in Syria

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.480
and in the ISIS caliphate.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.070
But all of that was
happening in Bosnia.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:36.450
And we were on a mission to hunt
this person down, but capture

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.850
them and bring them
live to the Hague

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.830
to be tried for war crimes.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.680
And the challenge
was that they wanted

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:48.180
us to hunt this person
but take a picture where

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.930
another team could go in and
take the person with a series

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:53.190
of armored vehicles and stuff.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.050
We were going to do
these ambush roadblocks,

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.592
because believe it
or not, we weren't

00:33:56.592 --> 00:33:58.070
allowed to be offensive.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.570
They had to be defensive.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:06.160
And I got presented with the
first generation digital SLR

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.760
camera.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.889
It had a Kodak body
and a Nikon lens on it.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:15.960
It was valued at
$34,000 dollars,

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.080
and I know that because
I was making $32,000

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.600
and the colonel was laughing
at me that I just signed away

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.830
a year's worth of salary
for this digital piece

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.449
of equipment.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:30.834
And we had a Toshiba
laptop, protege laptop.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:39.719
And we were going out into these
thick woods of northern Bosnia

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.580
and set up shop around--

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.400
there were a bunch of
troops cruising around.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.500
And we were trying
to take this picture.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.070
And it turned out
very early on that

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:54.030
the Nikon lens and the
autofocus couldn't keep up

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.840
with the caravan that would come
by every once in a blue moon.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.380
And we got the word that
this thing, this mission

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.780
is going to get canceled.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.730
And I asked the Colonel
Isaacs, Colonel can you--

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.890
talking radio talk, you know--

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.840
request 24 hours, over.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.540
And he came back
and "Roger that."

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.090
It turns out, he's a
deep Southern guy, too.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:21.950
And we're all sitting
around-- there's

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:27.170
five of us huddled, and
there's enemy in the area.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.350
And we're like, what
are we going to do?

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.370
How are we going to do this?

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:37.190
And my youngest, newest member
of the team raises his hand--

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.470
and you've got to imagine,
like, we're under--

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.005
we're all camied and we
get sticks all over us

00:35:42.005 --> 00:35:43.550
and we're in this hide.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:49.610
And he says, (WHISPERING) sir,
I think we should dig potholes.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.165
Potholes?

00:35:51.165 --> 00:35:52.540
(NORMAL VOICE) Of
course, we were

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.840
thinking about cutting
trees down and felling them

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.960
over different ways.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.950
And we were going to create all
these obstacles for these cars

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.220
to slow down, because we had
to get the car slowed down.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:07.600
And sure enough, his
idea was the simplest.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.750
And we went to work with
our night vision goggles

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:11.950
and we had IR lights.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.450
And your had to set
up-- because you

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:14.890
had to evade the
enemy while we're

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.800
out in the middle of the
night with one e-tool

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.700
chopping away at the road
making a pothole that would be

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:26.200
big enough to make this
Mercedes caravan slow down

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.980
so we could get the picture
with our first generation SLR

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.780
camera.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.030
That's part one of this story.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.235
We got the picture.

00:36:34.235 --> 00:36:37.290
But part two is, you
always do a debrief.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.320
And I lead the debrief,
being the platoon commander.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.340
When you come back to
the team and they say,

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.507
OK, give us a debrief of
all the different missions,

00:36:44.507 --> 00:36:46.140
what did you learn?

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.690
And all the new guys--

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.530
because you're constantly
bringing in new people--

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:52.710
they're sitting in there.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.613
And I call out the
new guy who was

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:57.780
on our team, who's no longer
a new guy, because he's

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.950
done one full deployment.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.920
I'm like, and that
gentleman over there

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.340
came up with a
mission-saving idea.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.650
And that's what it was.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.450
And I bring that kind of
full story to the circle--

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:15.230
full circle to the story--
because after that, you

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.330
saw these other kids
standing up like, oh, you

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.370
mean I can participate
in coming up

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.560
with a good idea on a mission?

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.250
And that's exactly what
they want to have happen.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:28.070
They want to close the distance
between the new person who

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:31.910
shows up on the team and
the most experienced person.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:34.002
So that's the
punchline to the story.

00:37:34.002 --> 00:37:35.210
SPEAKER: That's a good story.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.813
Sorry to try to spoil
the book for everyone.

00:37:37.813 --> 00:37:38.480
ALDEN MILLS: No.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.670
SPEAKER: There's a lot more
stories than that, though.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:48.570
So I think you had a story
about an individual relating

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.850
to the CARE circle there
that you wanted to tell?

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.300
ALDEN MILLS: I do.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:38:00.747
Could you gentlemen pull up the
soldier slide up there please?

00:38:00.747 --> 00:38:02.830
SPEAKER: Appreciate all
the hard work in the back.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.900
ALDEN MILLS: So people
often ask me, well, you

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:11.050
know, CARE is great and all,
but what does that really mean?

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:15.620
And how far is somebody going
to really care for the team?

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:21.730
And I can't think of a
better, more selfless story

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:25.440
as an example than
Michael Monsoor.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.760
Michael Monsoor is a Petty
Officer, second class.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:30.930
It was September 2006.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.730
He was working in Ramadi.

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.640
He was not in my platoon.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:40.902
He was years after I
came out of SEAL team.

00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:42.670
But I knew Michael.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.970
I knew lots of Michaels.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:50.490
And Michael was on a
routine training mission

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:54.360
through Ramadi with a
couple of other SEAL snipers

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.420
and a handful of
Iraqi combatants

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.330
that were getting trained
up to start taking over

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:03.272
defensive positions
for their city.

00:39:03.272 --> 00:39:04.855
And while they were
going through it--

00:39:04.855 --> 00:39:09.990
and Michael is what's called an
SSR, Sniper Support Rifleman--

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:15.210
they come under unexpected
enemy engagement.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:18.400
Michael finds, along with
two other SEAL snipers,

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.990
a low rooftop second story of--

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:23.640
open story of a building.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.750
And they set up shop.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:28.230
And Michael's main job is
to be the peripheral vision

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.700
for a sniper.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.360
So snipers can go to work in
a very close, confined area

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.950
with that scope.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.410
And he's also the one
responsible for calling

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:42.660
in support and for
guarding the exit

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.150
and entrance onto the
rooftop and getting

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.770
the Iraqis out of the way.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.530
He calls up, hey, we know
we're under enemy fire.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.700
I need some help.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.010
Sorry, assets are other places.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:58.550
Over about an hour
or so, Michael

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.100
ends up yelling the
word that you never

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.220
want to hear, certainly
in a closed space--

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.720
grenade!

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.530
Combatant had thrown a
grenade up, hit his chest,

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:17.640
and the grenade rolled by
the exit of the building.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.450
You got about a
second, maybe two,

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:22.370
to figure out what to
do with that grenade.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:29.750
And Michael did what we
would all talk about,

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.510
but you don't get
trained for that.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.055
And he covered his
body over that grenade.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.390
And what makes somebody do that?

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:45.110
You don't get a bonus
for jumping on a grenade.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:48.950
Like, there's no standard
operating procedure for, hey,

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.050
today is practice
jump on grenade day.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:59.450
There's no medal that's like,
gee, if I jump on the grenade,

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:01.450
everybody in my family
is going to be taken care

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.720
of for the rest of my life.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.060
I get a bigger life
insurance policy.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:08.710
There's no monetary gain.

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:12.170
And I bring that example
up because Michael

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:14.510
did pay the ultimate sacrifice.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.200
He did posthumously
receive the Medal of Honor.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.590
And most recently, there
is a ship in his name

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.890
that was just commissioned
in San Diego in January

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.525
called the USS Monsoor.

00:41:26.525 --> 00:41:27.650
I invite you to look it up.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:29.260
It's a super cool-looking ship.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.900
It's a destroyer.

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.390
Reverse bough and everything.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.290
He'd be very proud of it.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:38.900
But the point of that
selflessness was he

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:42.310
cared so much about his team.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.810
I know everyone's
thinking, gee, you

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:45.268
can't wait to die
for your country.

00:41:45.268 --> 00:41:47.530
But believe it or not, we're
not really that fired up

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:50.280
to die for our country.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:53.420
The country is a
big, amorphous thing.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.400
Like, yes, we're very patriotic.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.600
No doubt about it.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.490
Several of us have tattoos
of the American flag on us.

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.800
But what we really love
are the people we're with.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.240
And the idea of letting down
somebody else on that team

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.585
becomes worse to us than dying.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.060
And that is an extreme example.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.250
I totally admit that.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.000
But that's how
far, when you start

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.880
thinking of building
care-based teams,

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.880
how far those extents will be.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.550
You'll never, thankfully,
have to jump on a grenade.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:35.300
The grenades are different in
the workplace as a civilian.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.580
The grenades are,
oh, I've got to deal

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.740
with a tough personality
today or I've

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.567
got to deal with a client,
or we've got to figure out,

00:42:42.567 --> 00:42:44.900
this one's going to cause me
to work through the weekend

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.820
kind of grenade.

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.340
But if everybody
on the team feels

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.130
that there is a
shared responsibility

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.340
and accountability
for that, then that's

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.980
where the magic
occurs to take you

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:02.030
from being selfish
to selfless and being

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:04.008
really an unstoppable team.

00:43:04.008 --> 00:43:04.550
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.090
That's a really powerful story.

00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:07.490
Thank you for sharing it.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:09.400
Appreciate yours
and his service.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.370
ALDEN MILLS: Yeah.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.210
Michael.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:13.626
That's Michael Monsoor.

00:43:17.138 --> 00:43:17.930
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.830
So near the end of the
book you get into this idea

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.858
called a 10 times advantage.

00:43:24.858 --> 00:43:26.150
Could you explain what that is?

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.380
ALDEN MILLS: So
you built a team.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:35.040
We built our fictitious
micro webservices team.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:40.480
And we are going to go out and
conquer a new category, right?

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:46.790
And the easiest way to
consider your team is

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.950
a through f or however many
people you've got, right?

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.430
Let's call it it's
a 12 person team.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:56.780
But there are a whole bunch of
other contributors to your team

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:01.800
that are actually important
to helping your team succeed.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.100
Now, for some of
you, you may laugh.

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.400
But it may be-- maybe
it's your personal trainer

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.770
that's helping a couple
of you three times

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:12.650
a week stay healthy
enough and strong enough

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.930
and have enough stamina
to work through a weekend

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.050
or pull that 24 hour when you
got to meet that deadline.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.470
Maybe it has something to do
with a team that's sitting over

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:27.610
in India that's supplying some--
checking your code for you.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.110
And it's always
within the community

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:34.350
that you're supplying
or trying to succeed in.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.870
What I find is a lot of
people like, I got my team.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:38.010
We're super CARE-based.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.760
We're doing great.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.980
I'm like, great, how
have you involved

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.810
your external teammates?

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.280
And I break the
external teammates

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.490
into what I call the
three C's of the Customer,

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:50.430
the Contributor,
and the Community?

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.590
And I give a creative
parable in there

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:56.040
and give a lot of different
examples of corporations.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.700
I think Google is on a path of
doing some of that where they

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.450
involve the community in and
let them become part of the team

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.260
in helping build and
giving that feedback.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.620
SPEAKER: Yeah, we hope so.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:14.050
So the 10 times advantage
is about extending

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.810
that CARE-based framework beyond
just your immediate team, then.

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:17.602
ALDEN MILLS: Right.

00:45:17.602 --> 00:45:21.220
And I came up with the term
10x because that is actually

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:25.210
how military strategists
look at a special operations.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.600
And I say special operations
because it's not just SEAL.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.600
It could be Green Beret.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.340
It could be forced recon.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.610
It could be Air Force CCT.

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.440
Like, there's a whole bunch of
different special operations.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.210
They look at special operations
as a 10x force multiplier

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.080
on the battlefield.

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.780
Now, that's great.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:50.110
There's 16 SEAL platoon
or a 10 person ODA team.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:53.260
And I actually don't give a
SEAL example on this story.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:59.890
I give the story of "12
Strong," the movie, ODA, 595.

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.620
That is a perfect
example of what

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:06.910
I'm talking about for how
they did the 10x advantage.

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:09.790
Their whole job wasn't about--
they couldn't fight off

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.350
10 times their force.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:14.320
But what they could do
is build relationships

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.360
with the Northern Alliance,
which was totally fractured,

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:24.910
and take on something which was
50,000 Taliban much smaller--

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:29.080
or much larger-- than the 500
US troops that were in there.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:35.250
And so 500 US troops,
total, took on 50,000.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:37.860
And how they did
that was extending

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.320
the team-based
relationship building

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.720
to a series of
different contributor

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.355
and communal groups.

00:46:44.355 --> 00:46:44.980
SPEAKER: Great.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.990
Well, thank you very much.

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:49.770
I think that's all the
questions I have for you.

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.020
We'll open it up for
questions to the audience

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.148
in a second, and--

00:46:53.148 --> 00:46:54.690
ALDEN MILLS: I'd
love some questions.

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:56.398
SPEAKER: Really thank
you for coming out.

00:46:56.398 --> 00:46:57.060
Thanks.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.018
ALDEN MILLS: Thank you.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:03.380
SPEAKER: Matt, would you mind
tossing around the mic for us?

00:47:08.528 --> 00:47:09.570
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:10.570
SPEAKER: You're welcome.

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:11.780
AUDIENCE: I'm on, oh great.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.070
So LJ Irwin from Google
Cloud for Startups.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:18.600
My question is, have you found
anything or experienced--

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.390
either personally or through
some of your reading,

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:25.020
or even from your network
of activities or events

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.272
for civilians that mimics
some of the training

00:47:28.272 --> 00:47:29.730
that you went
through in the SEALS,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:31.410
like the physical training,
the mental training,

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:32.880
and the skill-based training?

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.230
ALDEN MILLS: Yes.

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:38.250
There is a-- he is a
little bit my senior.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:40.140
His name is Mark Devine.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:45.450
Mark Devine runs a Navy SEAL
Hell Week-like experience down

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:47.788
in San Diego.

00:47:47.788 --> 00:47:49.080
He's written a couple of books.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.490
He runs a very professional
outfit down there.

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:54.690
Just type in Mark Devine.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.130
You'll see SEALFIT.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.595
And you can pay to suffer.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.085
You're welcome.

00:48:04.085 --> 00:48:04.710
SPEAKER: Great.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.110
AUDIENCE: Just kind
of curious, so it

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:12.600
seems like real world
challenges, I guess,

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.090
aren't as clear cut as, say,
like a military challenge.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.860
You know, like the endurance
of doing 600 pull ups

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.710
versus maybe working overtime
for a month or something.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:25.080
Working overtime for a
month isn't necessarily

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:27.620
maybe the endurance that
we're supposed to be doing,

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:28.800
or a good thing.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.140
Do you have any
kind of guidelines

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:34.860
for helping to see what
the right choice is?

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.540
ALDEN MILLS: That
is a great question.

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:38.580
And there's a whole
chapter that I

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.730
talk about in the story
called X Division.

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:46.950
And it's what makes
SEAL training easier

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:51.040
from a leading perspective
than being a civilian.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.690
I am not here to say,
hey, just do what SEALs do

00:48:54.690 --> 00:49:00.030
and you'll be fine, because
civilians aren't SEALs, right?

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:03.330
That's the key thing
is to understand, OK,

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:06.300
how can you take what
we've been talking about

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.800
and apply it to the civilian?

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.340
On the lowest common
denominator, we all are human

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:13.200
and we all respond with care.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:18.270
But I am not talking about care
as a form of soft and cuddly

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.552
and let's give everybody
rose petals every day,

00:49:20.552 --> 00:49:21.510
and how are we feeling?

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.700
You need a massage right now?

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.220
The real care is
much the same way--

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.665
like somebody asked me before--

00:49:27.665 --> 00:49:29.040
you know, those
instructors don't

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.810
look like they care
too much about you.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:33.570
Actually, they care a whole
hell of a lot about us

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.060
because they're going
to rotate out and become

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.790
part of our platoon again.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.280
So they want to make sure
that they are putting people

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.500
through the process
that are going to be

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.340
willing to be on that team.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.300
So I do want to clarify,
when I talk about care,

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.460
I'm talking about the
care of helping people

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.680
become the very best
version of themselves

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.610
for what the team needs.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.840
Second piece is X Division.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.910
In SEAL team we
had SEAL training

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:02.640
and in teams, if
somebody decides

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:06.300
they don't want to be
there anymore or they quit

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:10.320
or they decide from an
attitude perspective

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.700
this person is not helpful,
they go to X Division.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:18.780
X Division is where
they place everybody

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.400
that isn't on the team.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.900
And you can't talk to them.

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.760
And they can't talk to you.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.380
They're removed.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:29.670
They don't want that bad apple
spoils the bunch in there.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:33.450
And attitudally is one
of the big challenges

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:34.630
that they look at.

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.780
We can't do that as
a civilian, right?

00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.470
You can't create an X Division
and be like, today you

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:41.940
have a bad attitude.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.430
You're in the box.

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:46.430
Doesn't work that way.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:51.080
So the first part is, what's the
culture of the team that you're

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.520
trying to build?

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.920
When we talk about
triangulation and trying

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.630
to find people's
superpowers and I

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.030
talk about these seven
traits for unstoppables,

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:05.390
is first finding the people
that fit the culture of the team

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.010
that you're on.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.530
More often than not, one
of my first questions

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:12.900
when I interview
people, hey, tell me

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.560
about your greatest failure.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.820
Well, you know, I just
succeeded all my life.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.400
I've just been really
lucky, I guess.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.750
You know, that
tells me two things.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.910
One, they may not have pushed
themselves out of their comfort

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:31.510
zone to really try something.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.870
And by the way, we're trying
to create something new

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.830
to the world here.

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:37.560
We are going to fail.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.690
And failure is going
to give us feedback.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:43.560
And we want to fail fast
and get moving, right?

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:48.060
And a break, when I
was getting interviewed

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.300
for the psychological
screening for SEAL team,

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.370
the very last question
they ask you--

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.150
and you're sitting
at this long table

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.130
and you've got this
super intimidating person

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:58.030
at the other end, been
a Navy SEAL forever,

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:00.630
and he looks at me
and he goes, I'm

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:03.200
going to ask you
one last question.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.670
And if you take longer
than a second, you're out.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:09.448
Like OK, I'm ready.

00:52:09.448 --> 00:52:10.990
It's like "Family
Feud," right, going

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:13.480
to hit the button or something.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.520
What are you most afraid of?

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.570
Boom.

00:52:16.570 --> 00:52:18.250
I give him my
answer, which is not

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.670
100% appropriate for
being videoed right now.

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.740
But it was about
losing body parts.

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:29.790
And he said, what?

00:52:29.790 --> 00:52:30.620
And I told him.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:33.030
And I gave him the
whole reason behind it.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:36.520
And he goes, you know how
many people have said failure?

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.700
And they fail when I hear that.

00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.440
And so SEAL team was trying
to screen people right out

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:46.490
of the gate for, if failure
is your biggest obstacle,

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.880
well, you already have
a cultural problem

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.960
with what we're
dealing with, right?

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.890
So you had that piece of it.

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:55.580
And then the final piece
is, we all have bad days.

00:52:55.580 --> 00:53:00.110
Leading is sausage making.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.190
It's hard.

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:05.460
All of us are
different, yet all of us

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:09.600
have basic operating systems.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.050
We all have different APIs.

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:16.650
And the more we can learn
to work with different APIs,

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:20.310
the more we can
build great teams.

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:24.780
We're actually limited on
our leadership capabilities

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:29.667
by the amount of different
APIs we can interface with.

00:53:29.667 --> 00:53:31.000
AUDIENCE: That's a great answer.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:31.630
Thanks.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:32.050
ALDEN MILLS: You're welcome.

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:33.217
Thank you for that question.

00:53:33.217 --> 00:53:34.547
That's a great question.

00:53:34.547 --> 00:53:36.130
So is your other
one, too, by the way.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:42.260
Anybody else?

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.810
Anybody?

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:47.100
I'm happy to sign
books, by the way.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:48.120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.910
SPEAKER: --sign some
books, and then we'll

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:50.640
take him out to lunch.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.060
So if there's no more questions,
I guess we'll end the talk.

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:53.340
All right.

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:53.990
Thank you very much.

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.948
ALDEN MILLS: Thank you.

00:53:54.948 --> 00:53:56.850
Go and make great stuff, Google.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:59.900
[APPLAUSE]
