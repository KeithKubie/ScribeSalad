Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N y. S. C. E. Yup. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Today we have a mystery that is vanishingly tiny, shockingly hot and manages to combine submarines, Keanu Reeves, red lobster and game of Thrones. And of course our producer Molly Webster and many members of your family. Hello. Hello? Hello? Nope. Where are the children? So we all know you want to begin in the beautiful state of South Carolina, South Carolina. The time on appear. Yeah. Is My radio gear waterproof? No, on a dock. Oh, okay. So we're going to walk down to the donkey, which is just like this place where they all put boats in the water and that's where we always [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:56          I'm going to explain why dockets. Okay. My parents recently moved to this marshy, swampy area on near the intracoastal waterway, which is like a connecting series of salty channels. And we grew up in Ohio and so this is like a totally different landscape than what we grew up in. Okay. And those little people would be my nieces and nephews, my bike, Sylvie can ride it. You that America is there. My children getting along and compromise. That would be Chrissy Webster and one of my sisters and we sound a lot alike anyway, so, okay, so this is the story. The story is, um, so when my parents first moved there, I remember going out on the docks with my dad and we were sort of looking at the beautiful marsh, right. And there was this really weird sound like coming off the water. E Y D I recently took my nieces and nephew out to see if they could hear it. Okay. So we're not going to move and we're not going to squeak. Yeah. Can we talk? We're not gonna talk. Oh, okay. So we leaned down off the dock. Ready? Now we're going to see if we can hear it.

Speaker 2:          01:58          Huh?

Speaker 1:          02:05          Oh my gosh. I hear some crackles.

Speaker 2:          02:09          That crackling sound. Yeah. What is that? That was the question. It sounds like rice crispy.

Speaker 1:          02:26          Most of the scientists you talk to say it sounds like bacon frying or twigs crackling in a fire. Maybe have a large Perrier factory just yet. I would say that except there's no bubbles popping like on the water. Oh, so it's not a gaseous emission. It's a clickety clack. Let me just play you a better recording. Yeah. Pull it up. Wait, do I have to put it through the producer PC?

Speaker 3:          02:50          Uh, this is actually an underwater recording. Oh my God. Oh

Speaker 4:          03:01          Gosh. In a teeny world. That would be like the 4th of July. Yeah. Wow. That's big. It's bigger than bigger than Bacon and Bacon. I know. It depends on how much bacon you're frying.

Speaker 1:          03:11          So what, sorry, what is this sound? What is it? This sound is, um, a very tiny [inaudible]. Let me just back it up a second.

Speaker 5:          03:19          Well, th the story started in the forties. That's Michelle verse Laos, professor of Physical Acoustics and medical acoustics at the University of Toronto in the metals. Basically what he said is World War II is the first war where we're like really using submarines and [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          03:35          sonar. And so you've got all of theseU s navy submarines down deep in the ocean and they're like listening out for the enemy. But what happens is all they hear is this like crazy crackling sound,

Speaker 5:          03:47          the sound levels that were measured. So, so this lab, this sounds very, very intense.

Speaker 4:          03:53          He says in some instances it was actually interfering with the sonar [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          03:56          That was a a bit of a problem.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Yeah. So I found it. I found a classified document that was declassified right after the war where the navy, they actually hired this, they actually hired this scientist, this guy named Martin Johnson. This is in cal,

Speaker 5:          04:12          I believe it was in San Diego.

Speaker 1:          04:15          They hired this guy to figure out what is the sound like? What is the sound we're hearing like all over the ocean. What is it already jazz like, just tell me what the damn sound is. Yes. Well it turns out I don't want to go too fast here.

Speaker 5:          04:29          It was noted in those years that that sound originated from the ship.

Speaker 1:          04:36          It was a shrimp. Oh yeah. The shrimp is called the snapping shrimp or a pistol. Shrimp. Ooh, I like that. Yes.

Speaker 4:          04:49          And interestingly, I found these like old navy recordings rolled about one foot in length that they would give to the navy guys where they had to learn the sounds they were hearing coming in through the ship and through the sonar in your own work with the expendable radio sono bully, you will probably hear in many songs. Although then the submarine song,

Speaker 1:          05:07          it was like, this is the sound of [inaudible],

Speaker 4:          05:09          nothing different. It produces a harsh clicking noise.

Speaker 1:          05:15          And I was like, okay, shrimp sonar. Cool. I get it. Thought maybe it would end there. And then I found what felt to me to be a crazy article, which was this newspaper clipping from 1946 basically says shrimp's help win the war. And it's about how the American navy admitted that one of their tactical things during like World War II was that they would hide their submarines in the beds of these shrimp. So like the Japanese submarines couldn't detect our ships. Oh my goodness. It was like a marine in visibility cloak. Yes. And according to Michelle, the u s would also put speakers on the hall of the ships

Speaker 5:          05:58          too, to simulate snapping

Speaker 1:          06:01          what it was. Sound Cammo. Yeah, see, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are these trims? Are they like normal normal shrimp cocktail type shrimp?

Speaker 5:          06:09          Well, there are about five centimeters. Two inches,

Speaker 1:          06:13          so like smaller than a shrimp. I might eat. Well, it depends what sort of shrimp you eat. I don't, I don't know. Whatever red lobster's. There's no wait a second. If they're that small, how are they making that sound? That is an excellent question. Wait, where do you think the sound comes from?

Speaker 2:          06:31          I'm thinking it's this room be are eating their food in the noises. Their little key. Ooh. Shrimpy tea. I think it, for me, I think it comes from their like snappy clot. Then you

Speaker 1:          06:49          and that's what you would think, right? Like especially if you look at these things up close, they have two front claws and the claws aren't the same on each side. That's Nancy Knowlton. I'm marine biologists snapping shrimp expert. There's that claw that's specialized for pinching and that claws tiny and a claw that specialized for snapping. And that claw is like exponentially bigger. It's like 10 times, 20 maybe three times bigger. It's quite a bit bigger. And so they use it to defend themselves against potential predators or competitors. And they're very territorial. She's as in one tramp runs into another shrimp. They can get into these prolonged snapping matches where they snap at each other to show me, me, me, me, me is bigger and stronger. [inaudible] okay, fine. And they can pretty much judge how big they are by the power of the snap, all of which is to say, my niece, Sophie's guests. Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:40          Because for there like snappy clot, then he's like,

Speaker 1:          07:44          yeah, of course. It's like the two sides of the cloth just like snapping together. Just like you snap your fingers like this, just a snap, snap. But that turns out not to be true. So not true.

Speaker 5:          07:55          Two things were wrong basically with a picture. I gotta know if you've ever tried to clap your hands in the swimming pool under water,

Speaker 1:          08:04          but it's very difficult. Yeah. You don't feel very smart when you make difficult work.

Speaker 5:          08:09          There's not a lot of sand. And that is because there's a lubrication layer of water in between that prevents a direct mechanical contact or

Speaker 1:          08:16          yes, there's this lubricating layer between the two claw haves and it makes snapping hard. And the second problem was that the sound just seemed way too loud. Like when they measured the decibel level of a single snap,

Speaker 5:          08:29          it's about 220 desi bells of sound that that can be produced by, by a single snap.

Speaker 1:          08:36          To put that in context, that is basically equivalent to

Speaker 2:          08:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:44          jet plane from just one snap. But it's very impulsive. So in a very, very short duration, it's still, it's like one of the loudest sounds in the ocean. So was like

Speaker 6:          08:56          probably more than snapping going on here. Yeah. So, so, okay, so it was 1999 Yup. The new high speed camera in our lab. And so they're like, okay, we're gonna point this camera at the shrimp and see what happens when this shrimp snaps its claw. So they take the little shrimps and they glue screws on their butts, glue screws on their button and they screw them into tiny platforms in like a little aquarium so that they were fixed in space and that that was important because a happens in like a microsecond and they need to keep it still so the camera can just focus right on the claw and to do the experiment, what we needed to do was to tickle them a little bit with the paintbrush. You tickled them with a paintbrush? Yeah, exactly. Then they cock their clothes and then they snap and then it fires and the camera captures the entire thing with like thousands of frames per second. And did they see anything? They did see something or what? What? How? What is it when they looked at the footage of the moment, just after it snaps in super slow Mo, you saw a very blurry object in front of the shrimp. What? Blurry Ha. It was just like [inaudible] blurry, something that was blood blurry.

Speaker 6:          10:15          I mean it turned out that we were sort of out of focus. So they refocus the camera. They do the same thing. They tickle the shrimp, the claws snaps. And they see that when the closs snaps, ah, they see this like bubble in front of the shrimp claw and it turns out that it's that bubble that's causing the noise and so much undersea turmoil. The bubble is at the root of everything. Okay. And with the high speed camera they were sort of able to see how it all breaks down and it sort of unfolds like this [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          10:48          what actually happens when this club closes? Is that the water that's in between these clothes, can we stop at high speed? The typical speed can be up to 60 miles per hour.

Speaker 1:          11:02          Like as fast as a car goes. Oh yes. Yes. So this jet of water shoots out like 60 miles per hour. And what happens is like behind the jet is that Ah, this like empty spaces created like a little void in the ocean and all the water molecules in that space. Cause they're like, Ooh, look at all this room. They start to expand outwards and essentially they just become like a little gas bubble. They actually change from liquid to gas. Yeah, they actually go from like liquid is like tightly packed molecules and then as they spread out they become like gaseous

Speaker 4:          11:37          and they create this like little gas bubble pocket in the middle of a huge ocean. And as they have all the space they like it bigger and bigger and bigger until the ocean is like nope. Microseconds.

Speaker 1:          11:49          Later the ocean start pushing back in on this bubble and the all the little, little uh, air molecules in the, in, in this bubble have nowhere to go and they're getting forced closer and closer together. And so they really want to get away from each other, all those air molecules. But you're pushing them together really hard and since they can't get away from each other, like the energy builds up super, super cute.

Speaker 7:          12:10          She had the pressure rises and the temperature rises really rises 5,000 degrees. The surface of the sun is also 5,000 degrees

Speaker 1:          12:21          and the gas that's inside the bubble turns to plasma

Speaker 7:          12:26          and that plasma and mix very short, intense flash of light

Speaker 1:          12:31          as the, the bubble implodes. And then like a microsecond later

Speaker 7:          12:41          it generates the shop

Speaker 5:          12:43          great. And that shockwave will basically kill or stun any, uh, prayed at this nearby.

Speaker 1:          12:50          Somebody from the College of exaggeration graduated this particular explanation because teeny Google that animal, whether the blood was bubble as hot as the sun, then I'll think, oh yeah. Okay.

Speaker 5:          13:05          Fairly crazy. But it's amazing how evolution has created this kind of sonic weapon.

Speaker 1:          13:12          So basically yes strips, they're like super awesome cause things call that generate huge bubbles of heat and it's like Gomez a trip because it's a black belt. Wow. So it's spitting out light and hot, hot hot temperatures. Yeah. Does that mean that God, the sun thing is crazy? That's crazy. I feel like it should be like a marvel character modeling. Yeah. Cause if you scaled this up, the bubble would be the size of a basketball in human scale. What could I do with the basketball of Sun, heat and light? I could rule the world with that. I'll be having that cat. Hey, hey that last piece of cake is mine. That was low. When my sister is hanging off the dock, she asked like, can we use this stuff power like the world or something? No. The answer was no, but the same physical processes that are involved in the shrimp bubbles. Right. So like the temperature and the heat that bubbles can create. Researchers became really excited about. Is there a way to harness this bubble power?

Speaker 5:          14:19          Yeah. There's also a Hollywood

Speaker 7:          14:21          movie. I think I did it. Is it stable on the powerful of bubbles with Keanu Reeves? I believe. Really? Really? Yes. Yes. There is enough energy in this glass of water to power the city of Chicago for weeks. They went too far. Oh.

Speaker 1:          14:40          [inaudible] fly boom. Taken with a weapon with a weapon. Possibilities. Yeah. My nephew got excited about this too. My name is Oliver. Huh. But I hate to tell you, I don't think there are any mean you can't like make a bigger claw. Put It on a sub. Nope. Sorry guys. [inaudible] oh, there is this one thing where uh, researchers are thinking about using bubbles and this goes beyond the shrimp bubbles in a way that could save lives.

Speaker 8:          15:24          Okay.

Speaker 9:          15:26          My name is Joseph Packard. I'm calling from Columbia, South Carolina. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information about sloane@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          15:45          this is Radiolab. And now we're going to go back to the story from Molly Webster. So you were saying people here are trying to use bubble power to save lives. Yeah, so when I was talking to Michelle verse Laos Applications, we're talking on the phone and he explains all the crazy bubbly stuff and somehow like in the middle of the conversation, he just said, um, if you think the shrimp bubbles are cool, everything we know about the shrimp bubbles like can also be like adapted to use bubbles in the body. Oh. And I was like, Whoa, wait, but bubbles in the body. Isn't that, isn't that an embolism? Loa? Yeah, totally. I had the same thought, like when divers get the Benz or when they like tap bubbles out of ivy lines and stuff. But these are very, very small bubbles, smaller than red blood cells. According to verse Laos, they're like one 20th the size of human hair and they are completely harmless. And he told me about how uh, in Toronto, and they actually just did this for the first time in November. Uh, on a patient they're using bubbles to get across the blood brain barrier.

Speaker 1:          16:50          What is, what exactly is the brain blood brain barrier? Is it cells or is it tissue? Super, super tightly packed cells. It sort of sits between the bloodstream and the brain. It's like this protective wall and it keeps out all of the nasty stuff so it keeps out any like a bacteria or viruses that would be in your bloodstream, can't get past the wall to get into your brain. I kind of keep thinking of it as like, I'm never actually watched game of Thrones except for like one episode and in it there was this giant wall to protect civilization from sort of all the bad things, the wild things and it was made of ice and it went up forever. That kind of feel like that wall in game of Thrones is like the barrier between the rest of the body. And the brain. But you said it's there to protect the brain. So why would you want to punch a hole in it? Well, you can imagine that if somebody has a brain tumor and we want to deliver

Speaker 10:         17:50          chemicals in there that we think can help fight the tumor, those chemicals, the brain does not want in there.

Speaker 1:          17:57          So the blood brain barrier can create problems. According to Todd main prize, I'm in neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook. He's part of the team in Toronto that's using this new bubble technique. And here's how it works. Wow. Okay. So say you've got a tumor on the right side of your brain, right above your ears. So main prize and his team will stick you in a chair and then they'll put a helmet on you. Special Helmet.

Speaker 10:         18:16          This helmet has 1024 ultrasound transducers

Speaker 1:          18:22          and we

Speaker 10:         18:23          aim the thousand 24 all to the same spot, right on the spot at the wall where the tumor sits just on the other side, just out of reach. Okay, so that all the ultrasound waves kind of [inaudible] I guess at that one area. And then we inject the bubbles. How many bubbles are in a dose? Um, like hundreds of thousands.

Speaker 4:          18:46          So they just put an IV in your arm and the bubbles go in and they'll go like into your arm, like over your shoulder, into your heart, to your lungs, back to your heart. Eventually some of them will get up to the brain. You know, it takes approximately 28 seconds from the time when you inject the bubble into an arm vein to by the time they start going into her brain and eventually some of those bubbles get up to the blood brain barrier, that wall to the spot where that laser beam is focused, that specific spot, that tumor sitting on the other side up. And when they cross paths, would that be

Speaker 10:         19:19          ultrasound waves causes the micro bubbles to oscillate in size. They'll go big and small. Big and small,

Speaker 4:          19:26          big smile, big smile, big smile, big smile. Oscillate inside. I think of it as like a, uh, like a bubble dance party. So at this really specific part in the brain, and it can be smaller than like one millimeter by one millimeter square. All these bubbles are dancing. And what that does is it causes the wall, that specific spot almost loosen. And so like a little like a window of space or a little hole is created in that wall. And if you happen to have chemotherapy in your blood, which you will because we'll give it to you ahead of time, the minute that hole is open. Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:04          The idea is the chemotherapy in your bloodstream would be able to just sort of flow through that opening and get straight to that brain tumor tissue. So they're using sound to turn the bubbles into little dancing drill bits. Yeah. And drill through them.

Speaker 10:         20:17          Yeah. Wow. Now the body's a living organism. So, uh, over the next six to 12 hours, they will close those gaps. Transient meaning it heals itself in about six to 12 hours. And you're saying they tried this on someone already?

Speaker 1:          20:36          Yeah, last November and they think it went well. One of the things these researchers said was once you're able to open these passageways to the brain, um, it's not just chemo that can get in there, but like suddenly any type of drug you might want to send through can get through. And we've just never had access to the brain before in that way. And there's this question of like, how will drugs interact with the brain? We kind of don't know. They've, they've never been there before. It's like a whole new frontier.

Speaker 2:          21:12          You think shrimp and time is done.

Speaker 5:          21:16          So I mean, basically all boils down to the same sort of physics of bubbles that we have learned from the shrimp and that we can apply to many other, uh, applications.

Speaker 2:          21:29          Fun. It's dinner time. We're gonna put it on the radio so you'll hear it. The people that like shrimp. What do people don't like? Shrimp Nail. Just skip it. I can't believe Molly's putting this on the radio. I make no promises. This has gone on the radio. Oh, Yay.

Speaker 7:          21:58          Molly Webster. This piece was produced

Speaker 5:          22:00          by Molly and Annie Mcewen with help from our guests. Sound designer Jeremy Bloom. Special thanks to Calavo James Byrd, Lawrence crumb, and Elliot, Sophie Oliver and Christie, all of them. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          22:22          next up, a story from our producer, Simon Adler, who, uh, who got interested in bubbles after Molly found her shrimp piece, got interested in bubbles and he managed to find a guy named Dave Stein who has taken bubbling to a whole new level.

Speaker 11:         22:37          It's a bigger bubble. Better, I think trying to make things bigger as a function of growing up. I don't know, I always thought that this was kind of inherent in the human psyche is to want to do certain things bigger and better. And so, well, may we, we might even make this a Stein's law. Okay. Steins Stein's law. Law of bubble of bubbling. No Stein's law of size is kind of off the top of my head here. But for any given object, there is a larger size such that the nature of the object is transformed in, in simple English. What would that mean? That as something gets bigger it gets what? Okay. Jake in Jupiter. Okay. Gaseous planets. Okay. All right. If you make Jupiter bigger and bigger, bigger and bigger, there is a size at which it becomes a star. Hagen, it ignites, it becomes a Sun.

Speaker 11:         23:48          It transcends what it was. Then can a bubble get so big that it's no longer even a bubble? Well, before the invention of the bubble thing, 1984 bubbles, we always thought of as being relatively small and relatively round, but as soon as you get up to a certain size, say five foot diameter kind of in that range, uh, now a sudden suddenly they're not round anymore and they don't pop in the same way. People who would think of bubbles popping instantaneously because they're thinking of the little round bubbles from the dime store. And what really happens in very large bubbles like the ones I and my friends make, the bubble doesn't pop instantaneously. It gets punctured at a certain point and then it rips open like a zipper and there's a sound to it. It kind of goes

Speaker 12:         24:53          like that. So it's not [inaudible] from one end of this long bubble to the other. Can we back up to tell me the story of how you like why, who were you in 1984 when you're like, I'm going to make this bubble thing? What, what, what, what motivated all of this?

Speaker 11:         25:17          Well, what motivated all of this was I was an architect at the time. I was working for hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, a very fashionable firmed out [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         25:24          and he says he spent his days designing these really intricate buildings where like glass staircases

Speaker 11:         25:31          meet the stonework of the building at a 45 degree angle and the roof is going up at another angle, all has to work down to the 16th of an inch. Who wasn't very happy at it actually. In fact, I used to worry about structural collapse. Okay?

Speaker 12:         25:45          He says he'd be walking down the streets of Manhattan, imagining some building he was building in his mind,

Speaker 11:         25:51          say the a addition to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

Speaker 12:         25:55          He's imagining this building and then all of a sudden his mind would shift to worry about that building collapsing. And he says, this just kept happening with every project. All these buildings kept just crashing into the ground. Like, did this keep you up at night? Did you wake up? Yeah, I felt I had to. I felt that as a re architect, it's my responsibility to imagine all the possible disaster. He says it became this not so healthy occupational obsession and y. W. Y. Alright. That's a good question. Let me tell you something.

Speaker 11:         26:28          I'm probably getting some of these details wrong, but my grandfather Clarence bulky, was a metallurgist who had a, something to do with building the atomic bomb and so did my

Speaker 12:         26:43          uncle. And um, my mother was quite traumatized by being a daughter of the bomb, so to speak. And it says it became part of the family legacy and maybe warmed its way into his psyche and poisoned his work. Well, that's just the way I registered it. I'm just, what I'm trying to basically trying to say was that I was not really happy as an architect. Anyway, that summer, 1984 my little daughter Kayla, who was one and a half saw a man blowing bubbles with one of those little dime store wands and she was just transfixed. She was transported to another realm. She had a lot like any kid. And so from that point on we were always blowing bubbles, all kinds of small bubbles, medium ones, large ones. Pretty quick. He started to wonder, how can we make these bubbles bigger? And we used to, you know, we cut out the ends of the coffee cans, dipped one end in the soap, blew through the other, got maybe a bubble that might be a foot foot in diameter, tried getting a coat hanger and bending it into a circle, dipping that into a frying pan full of soap.

Speaker 12:         27:53          With that you can make a bubble, may be a two foot or something. And is your daughter getting more and more excited as the bubbles get bigger? Is this about you? She was getting kind of bored with it actually. Dave started to get a little upset. Yes, that's definitely true. And I was thinking, you know, this is an interesting design problem, maximizing the size of bubbles and know how you go about that. Initially his thought was, and this is kind of everyone's thought when they start thinking about this, you just need a bigger circle, a bigger hoop through which to blow the bubble. It's like a hula hoop with a handle on it and you would need a a little one of those little plastic swimming pools full of bubbles, soap, which starts to seem kind of like a lot of, so from a design perspective, like how do you scale that up?

Speaker 12:         28:38          You can't just keep making the hoop and bucket bigger. Like that seems crazy. So at that point I was sort of stuck, but whatever he was going on with his life designing buildings. But then he says one day in the summer of 1984 I was lying in bed one morning. I can still remember the the pattern of cracks in the ceiling. The idea hit him like a ton of bubble shaped bricks. Why not have a collapsible hoop? I sort of instantly saw this thing in my mind, which was what we now know as the bubble, the bubble thing, and so Dave leaps out of bed heads to the hardware store, buys his stuff and I bought the Gel and the chain and the fascinating stories. Home starts assembling the device where you in your kitchen where, where were you when you were doing well you don't do this indoors.

Speaker 12:         29:24          Ultimately he stepped outside and what he had in his hand was really nothing more than like a stick with a loop of chain attached to it and one end of the loop you could kind of slide up and down on the stick so that you could expand and collapse the loop. That's the beauty of this design. To have that control and be able to close any weight back in the backyard. I closed the loop so it was just like a cord, like a straight cord. I dunked it in the bucket of soap. I raised it up, I open the loop right away. There's huge

Speaker 7:          29:58          bubbly

Speaker 13:         29:59          starts coming out, tube stretches for seven, eight feet. He's not sure, but at a certain point that closes the loop to pinch it off.

Speaker 7:          30:07          Now it's a free floating bubble and it's sailing away over the, over the house top and through the farm. Suddenly there's this gigantic bubbles floating away, the biggest bubble ever blown, I believe since it was somewhere between the size of a refrigerator in a car iridescent and wobbly and then suddenly it popped. What did you feel in that moment where you were you, Dr Frankenstein, who had just let this monster out into the world who I had, I got this cold thrill going down my spine. I'll never forget that. And as he sent more and more of these into the air, pretty soon people started arriving

Speaker 13:         30:50          in their cars and trucks. Everybody was totally astonished and um, I thought this might be my ticket

Speaker 12:         31:02          architecture. So Dave was able to patent the bubble thing and made enough money to get out of architecture. And in the process he transformed bubble blowing from a thing that just like kids do to this, I don't know, kind of sport where you have like bubble athletes.

Speaker 14:         31:18          My Name's Gary preroll. Matt and Megan Park,

Speaker 12:         31:21          Rick Findlay, all over the world in Mexico, they call me [inaudible] hall.

Speaker 14:         31:24          I currently am the a champion, the heavyweight, the big boy.

Speaker 12:         31:28          People are blowing like really big bubbles.

Speaker 14:         31:30          You could picture a say a two 18 wheelers, a stacked on top of one another. That's about how big the bubble was.

Speaker 12:         31:37          That's a slight exaggeration. But anyways, there are debates going on about what kind of soap to use, which is the best polymer to add to that soap and what kind of fabric to use for the loop. But despite all this experimentation, pretty much everyone uses a variation of Dave's original idea that these, these people are sort of my followers. You see, I find it very interesting that you had this fear of your buildings collapsing and here you go into this world where all of the things you're making are meant to collapse. Well, here's the thing. Uh, it's true that every bubble will collapse, but there is no blame. See and nobody got it.

Speaker 7:          32:22          I think we might be able to get some here.

Speaker 13:         32:29          So that night Dave took me out bubble baking powder. We have thermometer, we have test strips for measuring Ph. He'd been watching the humidity was okay, but the wind, this amount of wind is usually very difficult. So we'll go down and try to find some shelter

Speaker 7:          32:47          corner of what? West end and one oh six here, midnight in Manhattan. Pretty much empty couple of cars, almost no one walking. So now I'm going to dunk it in the soap and now I'm going to raise it up and I'm going to open the loop and I'm going to see if I can make a bubble here. There we go. Okay, that one's pretty good. Okay. It is sailing along into the intersection and I wanted to now chasing the bubble is now chasing the taxi. How, how big is that one? Uh, that's about the size of a killer whale. I'd say maybe 20 feet long. When you get these giant bubbles sailing around among these buildings, it activates the space. He says it seems to transform the architecture and it definitely did. Um, like it made this city look suddenly beautiful and like a lava lamp and alien.

Speaker 7:          33:46          And we've got some people walking by that are now taking videos of them. Jay, look at that one. Oh, that's a great one. That's, that's the size of a, of a smallish baby elephant and maybe, okay. And the taxi has now just done a u turn to watch us and see us. We got, we've got a bike messenger who, who's rubber necking as he goes by. Even if midnight and audience just materialized. It just incredible. Like everybody, okay, New Yorkers are assholes and people are stopping stopping with smiles and their click. This taxi has just stopped in the middle of the road to want you to do this. So you do, you often stop your taxi to look at a, to look at things are really different things. So big. I see this small on before, but this is totally different like this and it's so silly, right? It very similar. Sillies it's very wonderful. Very dizzy. Very Kitty. Oh there. That's the size of a killer whale for sure. You ever feel silly out here? I,

Speaker 11:         34:58          uh, sometimes do, but I also sometimes compare myself to my grandfather and I'm much happier to have invented the giant bubble thing than having invented the bomb. I also think, you know, I, in a way, I feel like I have started an art form and that is going to go on. And, uh, and
