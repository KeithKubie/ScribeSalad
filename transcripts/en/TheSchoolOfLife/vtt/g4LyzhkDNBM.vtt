00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.700
Franz Kafka was a great 
chech writer who
has come to own a part of the human

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.430
emotional spectrum, which we can now call
the Kafkaesque and which thanks to him

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.369
we are able better to recognize and to
gain a measure of perspective over and

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.250
relief from. Kafka's world isn't
pleasant. It feels in many ways like a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.430
nightmare and yet it's a place where
many of us will, even if only for a time,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.030
in the dark periods of our lives,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.030
end up. We are in the world defined by
Kafka when we feel powerless in front of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.329
authority, judges, aristocrats,
industrialists, politicians and most of

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.469
all: fathers. When we feel that our
destiny is out of our control, when we

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.969
are bullied, humiliated and mocked by
society and especially by our own

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.030
families. We are in Kafka's orbit when
we're ashamed of our bodies, of our sexual

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.070
urges and feel that the best thing for
us

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.640
might be to be killed or squashed
without mercy as if we were an

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.090
inconvenient and rather disgusting
bed bug. Franz Kafka was born in

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.060
Prague in 1883, the eldest child of a
terrifyingly, psychologically abusive

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.909
father and a mother who was too weak and
in all of her husband to protect her boy

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.070
as she should have done.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.450
Kafka grew up timid, bookish, meek and
full of self-hatred. He wanted to become

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.570
a writer but it was out of the question
in his father's eyes, so one of the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.619
greatest German literary geniuses since Goethe was forced to spend his brief

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.860
life on Earth working in a series of
jobs utterly beneath him: in a lawyer

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.649
office and then an insurance company. He had
a number of unsuccessful relationships

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.000
with women, he couldn't marry or raise a
family and was tormented by the strength

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.450
of his sex drive, which made him
constantly turn to brothels and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.060
pornography. Kafka published very little
in his lifetime: just three collections

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.270
of short stories including his
best-known work, The Metamorphosis, and he

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.320
was entirely obscured and unnoticed.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.680
His gigantic posthumous reputation
is based on three novels: The Trial, The

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.760
Castle and America, which were all
unfinished because Kafka was so

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.790
dissatisfied with them. He gave orders
that they be destroyed after his death.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.170
Fortunately for Humanity, these were
disobeyed. It shouldn't sound prurient or

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.370
reductive to suggest that one of the
major keys to understanding Kafka is

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.050
to fathom the nature of his relationship
with his father. Kafka never wrote directly

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.380
about this man in any of his works but
the psychology of the novels is directly

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.160
related to the dynamics he endured as
the very unfortunate son of Hermann Kafka

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.900
Any boy who has ever felt
inadequate in front of,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.930
or unloved by a powerful father, will at
once relate to what Kafka went

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.400
through in his childhood. In November
1919, at the age of 36, five years before

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.440
his death, Kafka wrote a forty-seven page
letter to Hermann in which he tried to

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.700
explain how his childhood had deformed
him. Like many victims of abuse, Kafka

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.549
never stopped hoping for some kind of
forgiveness from the person who had so

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.049
wronged him.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.970
"Dearest father", went the letter. "You asked
me recently why I maintain that I'm so

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.280
afraid of you. As usual I was unable to
think of any answer to your question

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.900
partly for the very reason that I am
afraid of you and partly because an

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.180
explanation of the grounds for this fear
would mean going into far more details

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.600
than I could ever keep in mind while
talking". The grown Kafka abased

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.000
himself before this father. "What I would
have needed was a little encouragement, a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.860
little friendliness but I wasn't fit for
that. What was always incomprehensible to

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.570
me was your total lack of feeling for
the suffering and shame you could

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.579
inflict on me with your words and
judgments. It was as though you had no

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.620
notion of your power". Kafka complained
of one particularly traumatic incident

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.010
when as a young boy he called out for a
glass of water and his irritable father

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.780
pulled the boy out of his bed, carried
him out onto the balcony and left him

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.610
there to freeze in nothing but his nightshirt. Kafka writes: "I was quite obedient

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.500
after that period but it did me so
much

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.120
incalculable inner harm. Even years afterwards
I suffered from the tormenting fancy

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.050
that the huge man, my father, the ultimate
authority, would come almost for no

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.740
reason at all and take me out of bed in
the night and carry me out onto the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.440
balcony and that meant I was a mere
nothing for him".

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.889
Boys need their father's permission to
become men and Hermann Kafka didn't give

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.800
Franz a chance. "At a very early stage
you forbade me to speak. Your threat: "not

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.930
a word of contradiction" and the raised
hand that accompanied it have been with me

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.660
ever since". Franz's sense of inadequacy
was total. "I was weighed down by your

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.820
mere physical presence, I remember for
instance how often we undressed in the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.130
same bathing hut. There was I: skinny,
weekly, slight. You: strong, tall, broad. I

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.680
felt a miserable specimen. When we stepped
out, you holding me by my hand, a little

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.850
skeleton, unsteady, frightened of the
water

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.190
incapable of copying your swimming
strokes; I was frantic with desperation.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.320
It could hardly have been worse, except
it was. Kafka finished the letter, gave it

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.550
to his mother Julie to pass to Hermann
but, typical of her weakness and cowardice,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.150
she didn't. She held onto it for a few
days, then returned it to Franz and

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.530
advised that it would be better if her busy,
hard working husband never had to read

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.720
such a thing.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.320
The poor son lacked the courage ever to try
again. In The Judgment, Kafka's great short

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.060
story, written in 1912; a young
businessman, Georg, is engaged to be married

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.240
and lives in a flat with his widowed
father. He's about to get away from home,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.770
the father is old and frail. Georg tucks him up in
bed but then the father mysteriously

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.050
regains his strength, springs upright,
towers over Georg and denounces him for

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.080
betraying everyone. His friends, his
father and the memory of his mother.

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.550
Georg can make only feeble protests.
Eventually the father condemns Georg to death

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.020
by drowning and Georg obediently rushes out
and plunges into the nearby river.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.300
After passing sentence, the father cries
out: "You were an innocent child, really,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.030
but at heart you were a diabolical
human being".

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.660
The idea of horrific, arbitrary judgment
was to be a constant in Kafka's fiction:

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.030
it reappears in the unfinished novel The
Trial, written two years later. But now

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.910
Kafka had developed it away from a
father to a vast legal apparatus with

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.620
judges, lawyers, guards and extensive
bureaucratic procedures. When Joseph K is

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.360
arrested on the morning of his 30th
birthday, he isn't told what he is

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.890
charged with. He barely makes any attempt
to find out. He feel so guilty inside, he

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.200
just knows that he deserves punishment.
He does try to declare in court that

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.280
he's innocent, still without knowing what
the charge is and hires a lawyer but the

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.740
court gradually grinds him down. He
becomes unable to think of anything.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.260
Words fail him, he can no longer do his
job properly and is defeated in the game

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.040
of office politics. Finally, a year after
his arrest, two grotesque looking

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.700
officials come to Joseph case flat, they
lead him to a quarry outside the city

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.920
and execute him by plunging a knife into
his heart. Between The Judgment and The

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.330
Trial, Kafka wrote The Metamorphosis, a
short story in which a traveling

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.200
salesman, Gregor Samsa, wakes up one
morning transformed into an insect akin

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.170
to a beetle or a bed bug. It's a story of
self-disgust, about the treachery of

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.250
family and, like The Trial, about
terrifying arbitrary power. When Gregor

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.070
crawls across the floor, he is in danger of
being stamped on by his own father.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.660
Gregor's family find they manage quite well
without him. They can fine him to his

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.860
room and chuck rubbish at him. The
family hold a council and decide that

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.690
the insect in the bedroom can't really
be Gregor. They start to refer to the

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.440
insect as "it" instead of "him". They
decide that somehow the insect has to go.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.970
Gregor, listening, agrees and dies quietly.
After Gregor's death, the family are

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.010
slightly ashamed of their behavior, but
only slightly.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.140
Kafka suffered from ill health for a
lot of his life. In 1924 when he was

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.210
forty-one, he developed laryngeal
tuberculosis, which prevented him from

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.390
eating almost anything without huge pain.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.910
He wrote a short story, his last, called
The Hunger Artist. It tells the story of

00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:42.170
a public performer who makes his living
undertaking fasts for the pleasure of the

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:47.480
public. One time he manages to fast for
forty days but gradually the hunger

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.330
artist's audience gets bored of his work.
However hard he fasts, they're no longer

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.890
impressed. He gets put in a dirty old
cage and weakens terribly. Before he dies

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.940
he asks for forgiveness and confesses
that he should never have been admired

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.960
since the reason he fasted was simply
that he couldn't find any food he

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:11.260
enjoyed. Shortly after he dies, he's
replaced in his cage by a panther, an

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:16.790
animal full of vigor whom the crowd love
and who has a voracious appetite. A few

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.220
days after finishing The Hunger Artist,
Kafka died and was buried in the

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:26.040
Jewish cemetery in Prague. Within a few
years of his death, his reputation began.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.560
By the Second World War, he was
recognized as one of the greatest

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.790
writers of The Age. Notwithstanding, all
his close family were gassed by the

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:38.740
Germans in the Holocaust. He is a monument
in German literary history and at the

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.910
same time he is a sad, ashamed, terrified
part of us all. Kafka once wrote that

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.360
the task of literature is to reconnect
us with feelings that might otherwise be

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.210
unbearable to study but which
desperately need our attention. "A book

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.940
must", he wrote, "be the axe for the frozen
sea within us". His books were among the

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.040
most touching, frightening and accurate
axes ever written.
