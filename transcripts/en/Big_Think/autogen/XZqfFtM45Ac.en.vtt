00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.610
 
well I was interested in science

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620
well I was interested in science
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.560
well I was interested in science
actually and decided to go into medicine

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
actually and decided to go into medicine
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.419
actually and decided to go into medicine
as an area of science that could do some

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
as an area of science that could do some
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.150
as an area of science that could do some
good and I started out in the area of

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
good and I started out in the area of
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.730
good and I started out in the area of
internal medicine seeing patients

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
internal medicine seeing patients
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.560
internal medicine seeing patients
something I liked got involved in

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
something I liked got involved in
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.570
something I liked got involved in
setting up and working in some of the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
setting up and working in some of the
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.380
setting up and working in some of the
First Community Health type projects and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390
First Community Health type projects and
 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929
First Community Health type projects and
enjoyed that but wanted to expand into

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
enjoyed that but wanted to expand into
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.060
enjoyed that but wanted to expand into
public health and after I did my

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070
public health and after I did my
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.380
public health and after I did my
residency I went to the Centers for

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
residency I went to the Centers for
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.090
residency I went to the Centers for
Disease Control and did infectious

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
Disease Control and did infectious
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.900
Disease Control and did infectious
disease work and after that went to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
disease work and after that went to
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.880
disease work and after that went to
Massachusetts worked in the State Health

survival asked me if I would go to

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
survival asked me if I would go to
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.510
survival asked me if I would go to
Uganda to help president Museveni who

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520
Uganda to help president Museveni who
 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.540

had just taken over to try to rebuild

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
had just taken over to try to rebuild
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.459
had just taken over to try to rebuild
the health system of Uganda which was an

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
the health system of Uganda which was an
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.680
the health system of Uganda which was an
absolute tattered mess after 15 years of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
absolute tattered mess after 15 years of
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050
absolute tattered mess after 15 years of
kind of craziness and it was an amazing

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
kind of craziness and it was an amazing
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480
kind of craziness and it was an amazing
opportunity to go do it I took a look at

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
opportunity to go do it I took a look at
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.359
opportunity to go do it I took a look at
it I did not go to do aids but when I

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
it I did not go to do aids but when I
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.880
it I did not go to do aids but when I
was there of course I started asking

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
was there of course I started asking
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.219
was there of course I started asking
questions like what's the male-female

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
questions like what's the male-female
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.800
questions like what's the male-female
ratio of you know cases so far what's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
ratio of you know cases so far what's
 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.539
ratio of you know cases so far what's
the age distribution simple things and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
the age distribution simple things and
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340
the age distribution simple things and
people have looked at that so I began to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
people have looked at that so I began to
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.640
people have looked at that so I began to
look at it and then we set up the first

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
look at it and then we set up the first
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.830
look at it and then we set up the first
surveillance system for AIDS and my

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
surveillance system for AIDS and my
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.859
surveillance system for AIDS and my
moment you know my epiphany came when we

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
moment you know my epiphany came when we
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.039
moment you know my epiphany came when we
did a thorough survey of a survey of the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
did a thorough survey of a survey of the
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020
did a thorough survey of a survey of the
population random and took blood and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
population random and took blood and
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.429
population random and took blood and
looked to see whether people HIV

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
looked to see whether people HIV
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.289
looked to see whether people HIV
positive and the numbers came back and I

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299
positive and the numbers came back and I
 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.210
positive and the numbers came back and I
said to my girlfriend who's doing the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
said to my girlfriend who's doing the
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.010
said to my girlfriend who's doing the
analysis I said this can't be right i

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
analysis I said this can't be right i
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050
analysis I said this can't be right i
mean you've made a decimal place era and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
mean you've made a decimal place era and
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880
mean you've made a decimal place era and
she said i think it's right and by the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
she said i think it's right and by the
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.499
she said i think it's right and by the
lab people said lab test doesn't work

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
lab people said lab test doesn't work
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.370
lab people said lab test doesn't work
and of course it did and that was really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
and of course it did and that was really
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.499
and of course it did and that was really
what defined to me the magnitude of the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
what defined to me the magnitude of the
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539
what defined to me the magnitude of the
problem or at least that you know the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
problem or at least that you know the
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.760
problem or at least that you know the
iceberg part of the problem the big you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
iceberg part of the problem the big you
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.340
iceberg part of the problem the big you
know part under the water and and so at

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
know part under the water and and so at
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.399
know part under the water and and so at
the end of that I I left came back and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
the end of that I I left came back and
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.240
the end of that I I left came back and
ran the health programs of the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
ran the health programs of the
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.679
ran the health programs of the
Rockefeller Foundation and they're a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
Rockefeller Foundation and they're a
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.479
Rockefeller Foundation and they're a
group of people came to me since this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
group of people came to me since this
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.919
group of people came to me since this
was my area of research and said the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
was my area of research and said the
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.190
was my area of research and said the
AIDS vaccine effort is dead

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200
AIDS vaccine effort is dead
 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.890
AIDS vaccine effort is dead
how I got involved in in looking at and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900
how I got involved in in looking at and
 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.790
how I got involved in in looking at and
I'm starting around at that moment in

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800
I'm starting around at that moment in
 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.220
I'm starting around at that moment in
time people perceive the AIDS epidemic

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230
time people perceive the AIDS epidemic
 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.220
time people perceive the AIDS epidemic
is being bad very bad and and it's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230
is being bad very bad and and it's
 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.300
is being bad very bad and and it's
interesting because even now the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
interesting because even now the
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.240
interesting because even now the
statistics you know are much worse than

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250
statistics you know are much worse than
 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.949
statistics you know are much worse than
they were perceived even at that moment

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959
they were perceived even at that moment
 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.680
they were perceived even at that moment
but you know the question was you know

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690
but you know the question was you know
 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.630
but you know the question was you know
why was there not a vaccine and when

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640
why was there not a vaccine and when
 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.550
why was there not a vaccine and when
people first figured out that this was a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560
people first figured out that this was a
 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.710
people first figured out that this was a
virus people said we need a vaccine

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720
virus people said we need a vaccine
 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.300
virus people said we need a vaccine
that's how we deal with viral illnesses

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310
that's how we deal with viral illnesses
 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.370
that's how we deal with viral illnesses
and so it would have been the natural

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380
and so it would have been the natural
 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.360
and so it would have been the natural
thing to do in fact there are

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
thing to do in fact there are
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.220
thing to do in fact there are
predictions that have a vaccine within a

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
predictions that have a vaccine within a
 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.490
predictions that have a vaccine within a
couple of years initially it was turned

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500
couple of years initially it was turned
 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.740
couple of years initially it was turned
out to be very difficult science

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750
out to be very difficult science
 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.360
out to be very difficult science
challenge and on top of that there was a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
challenge and on top of that there was a
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.460
challenge and on top of that there was a
lot of pressure to try to develop drugs

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470
lot of pressure to try to develop drugs
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.009
lot of pressure to try to develop drugs
for this virus um at that moment in time

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019
for this virus um at that moment in time
 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.240
for this virus um at that moment in time
we didn't know how to make drugs for

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
we didn't know how to make drugs for
 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.100
we didn't know how to make drugs for
viruses but the activists in a sense

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110
viruses but the activists in a sense
 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.750
viruses but the activists in a sense
they deserve the Nobel Prize they pushed

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760
they deserve the Nobel Prize they pushed
 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.910
they deserve the Nobel Prize they pushed
and said you know you've got to make

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920
and said you know you've got to make
 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.530
and said you know you've got to make
money available you got to drive science

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540
money available you got to drive science
 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.990
money available you got to drive science
and so that's what they did so there was

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000
and so that's what they did so there was
 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.210
and so that's what they did so there was
this intense push to get drugs which is

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220
this intense push to get drugs which is
 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.770
this intense push to get drugs which is
by the way why we have more drugs for

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780
by the way why we have more drugs for
 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.319
by the way why we have more drugs for
HIV than all other viruses put together

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329
HIV than all other viruses put together
 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.690
HIV than all other viruses put together
now but the vaccine effort really

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700
now but the vaccine effort really
 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.300
now but the vaccine effort really
dropped down and and it was not a lot of

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310
dropped down and and it was not a lot of
 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.620
dropped down and and it was not a lot of
money that was not a lot of attention

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630
money that was not a lot of attention
 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.090
money that was not a lot of attention
not a lot of activist and not a lot of

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100
not a lot of activist and not a lot of
 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.590
not a lot of activist and not a lot of
focus on the needs of the developing

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600
focus on the needs of the developing
 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.190
focus on the needs of the developing
world and so the question was could we

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200
world and so the question was could we
 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.960
world and so the question was could we
do something about that and that was
