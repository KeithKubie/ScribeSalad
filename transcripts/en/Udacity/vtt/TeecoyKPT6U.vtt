00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.218
No, they are not equivalent.

00:00:03.218 --> 00:00:06.875
To see why, we have to do what's
in the parentheses first.

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.360
5-3 is 2.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.152
So, 2-(5-3) can be rewritten
as 2-2 which equals 0.

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:19.992
2-5=-3.

00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:26.798
So this can be rewritten as -3-3,
which equals -6.

00:00:26.798 --> 00:00:33.150
0 does not equal -6, so we can see that
these expressions are not equivalent.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.300
That means that the associative
property does not work for subtraction.
