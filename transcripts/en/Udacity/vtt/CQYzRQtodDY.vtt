Why did you sign up for this online general psychology course? Or why did I

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:07.210
take twelve months of training to try to get to the top of half dome at

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.843
Yosemite National Park. Why did you wait in line for three hours to see the new

00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:15.659
Star Trek film? Or why did I order a double cheeseburger and chocolate shake,

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:20.050
even though I know they're not good for me? Well, maybe the cheeseburger makes

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.513
me feel good, so emotion can play a role. Or maybe I ordered it because I was

00:00:23.513 --> 00:00:24.765
just plain hungry.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:27.411
&gt;&gt; Well, in order to do all the things that Susan just talked about, you can need

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:32.110
motivation, and that's exactly what we're going to talk about in this lesson.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.440
First we're going to start with talking about the theories of motivation. Then

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.281
we'll talk about how motivations actually drive our behaviours. And we're going

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:41.055
to end the lesson by talking about emotion.

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:45.402
&gt;&gt; That's right. Now the word motivation comes from the Latin verb, which means to

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:49.270
move. And so here we're interested in our movements and actions and what

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.270
determines those movements and actions. And now Lauren is going to start

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.705
talking a little bit about motivation in depth.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:56.947
&gt;&gt; Let's go do that.
