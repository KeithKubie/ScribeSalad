MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon, and welcome

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.970
to Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.850
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Beth Shapiro.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.140
Dr. Shapiro is here today
to discuss her book,

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.400
"How to Clone a Mammoth: The
Science of De-Extinction."

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.400
We have the science today
to restore extinct species

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.710
to life, but should we?

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.620
The ethical challenges
are enormous.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.160
Using DNA collected from
remains as a genetic blueprint,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.070
scientists aim to engineer
extinct traits, traits

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.040
that evolved by
natural selection

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.460
over thousands of years,
into living organisms.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.480
But rather than
viewing de-extinction

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.380
as a way to restore
one particular species,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.280
she argues that the
overarching goal

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.550
should be the revitalization
and stabilization

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.280
of contemporary ecosystems.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.620
Dr. Shapiro is an
evolutionary biologist

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.460
who integrates
molecular phylogenetics

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.680
with advanced
computational biostatistics

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.620
to reconstruct the influences
on population dynamics

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.410
in a wide variety of organisms.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.120
She is Associate
Professor of Ecology

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.640
and Evolutionary Biology
at UC Santa Cruz.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.350
Her work has appeared in
numerous publications,

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.770
including "Nature and Science,"
and she was a 2009 MacArthur

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.680
Foundation Fellow.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.464
Please join me in
welcoming Beth Shapiro.

00:01:39.464 --> 00:01:40.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.100
BETH SHAPIRO: Thank you.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.830
Well, thank you very much
for inviting me to come here,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.231
and for taking the time out
of your busy and hectic days

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:50.730
to come and listen
to me, especially

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.000
after David Duchovny,
who I'm sure was

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.460
quite entertaining, and
probably more entertaining

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.840
than I can possibly be.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.280
So let's just leave
it at that, right?

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.860
I thought I'd begin with a
video that kind of explains what

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.300
I do when I'm in the field.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.060
So the quality of the
sound is a little bit poor,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.320
but the video is kind
of neat, so bear with me

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.702
here for just a sec.

00:02:11.702 --> 00:02:14.474
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:14.474 --> 00:02:15.850
-So this is really cool.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.160
What we just found,
you can see, is

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.836
one, two, three, four
pieces of mammoth bone here.

00:02:22.836 --> 00:02:26.120
This is part of a vertebrae,
so you can see how big this is.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.450
And the neat thing
about this is that these

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.640
are the small pieces, which
means that the stuff that's

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.210
washed downstream.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.375
See, these pieces are actually
still frozen in the permafrost.

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:38.750
We can't get them
out of the wall,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.282
which means they're going
to be really well-preserved.

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:43.991
Just heard that big splash of
water back there that means

00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:46.196
another hole's broken through.

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:47.110
Here comes the water.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.665
We better get out of here.

00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:52.150
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.850
So admittedly that last part
is a little bit ridiculous.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.400
But in my defense, the
water is really gross.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.020
What that is is, that's active
placer mining, gold mining

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.160
sites up near Dawson City
in Canada's Yukon Territory.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.910
So during the spring
when the snow melts,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.720
the miners collect all the water
in these big holding ponds,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.230
and then they pump it up
to wherever they're trying

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.920
to wash away that permafrost.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.140
And they wash away
whatever's thawed and then

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.265
let it stop for a bit, let the
next little few inches thaw,

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:20.360
and then wash that away.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.680
Their goal is to get rid
of all of that permafrost

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.040
to get to the gold-bearing
gravels beneath.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.500
But while they're doing,
that we find hundreds,

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.790
thousands, sometimes tens
of thousands of these bones

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.506
that are incredibly
well preserved.

00:03:33.506 --> 00:03:34.880
And we bring them
back to the lab

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.200
and use them for our research.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.220
So I'm a biologist, an
evolutionary biologist,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.870
or a geneticist, or a
molecular paleontologist.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.050
Lots of ways to
describe that, including

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.360
some new ones that were used
in the introduction just

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.870
a moment ago.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.760
So what does a biologist want to
do with frozen bones collected

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.440
from the permafrost?

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.760
Well, my research
is actually focused

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.310
on trying to understand how
populations and communities

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.140
and ecosystems respond to rapid,
large scale changes in climate

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.960
in the present day.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.550
So when we see and hear about
climate change going on today,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.350
often what we hear about
are large scale changes

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.830
in precipitation patterns
that change the distribution

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.450
of water, maybe
difference in the storms,

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.029
and of course species that are
on the verge of extinction.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.940
And when we hear about
this stuff reported

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.720
by the popular
press, often we're

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.874
just told that everything is
going to hell in a hand basket.

00:04:28.874 --> 00:04:30.290
But if you're a
biologist, and you

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.370
want to avoid some of these
particularly dire predictions

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.600
here, you might
want to understand,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.180
or be able to predict in some
useful way, how the species

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.310
and communities that
we're trying to protect we

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.110
are going to respond for the
change in the climate that's

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.274
predicted for the next
decade to century.

00:04:48.274 --> 00:04:50.440
So if you keep up with the
climate change literature

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.930
at all, you'll no
doubt be familiar

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.730
with this particular graph here,
or something similar to this.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.310
This is Michael Mann's
Hockey Stick graph,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.040
and it's called a
Hockey Stick graph

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.980
because it kind of looks
like a hockey stick

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.790
laying on the side.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.640
Here's the end of the stick
and the part that goes up here.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.450
This is the average
temperature around 1960,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.600
and this is really
just a plot of how

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.800
that temperature has changed
over the last 1,000 years.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.990
So you see the temperature
remained pretty constant,

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.364
maybe declining a little bit
through time, until a couple

00:05:17.364 --> 00:05:20.640
hundred years ago, when
it shot up pretty quickly.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.000
Now this plot can be
extended into the future,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.630
and we see all
sorts of predictions

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.640
of climate increasing,
the temperature increasing

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.570
exponentially throughout the
next 50 years to 100 years.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.090
Of course, this is not the first
time in Earth's recent history

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.690
that the planet has experienced
a really rapid increase

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.320
in temperature.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.910
If we extend this plot backward
to the last 50,000 years,

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.370
we see an interval right here,
in between around 18,000 years

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.490
ago and maybe 12,000
or 13,000 years ago,

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.560
when the average global
temperature increased

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.680
by about eight degrees.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.190
This here is only about
1 and 1/2 degrees.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.989
This is an
eight-degree increase.

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:58.780
Some of the work that
we're doing right now

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.030
is suggesting that
this last period

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.440
of really rapid increase-- this
is the transition from the peak

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.360
of the last Ice Age into
the Holocene warm interval

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.320
that we're experiencing
today-- this last period

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.770
possibly happened over
less than 100 years,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.840
or even as quickly
as a few decades.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.260
So this is a very rapid period
of widespread global warming

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.350
that's going to be associated
with all sorts of changes

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.980
in temperature
and precipitation,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.940
and changes to the
biological species that

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.340
are living out there.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.420
So what I try to do with my
research is ask the question,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.570
how did species and communities
and populations and ecosystems

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.300
change in response to this past
period of rapid climate change?

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.860
And is there
anything that we can

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.800
use from learning about
what happened in the past

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.010
to make better decisions about
how to spend the limited time

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.950
and energy and resources we
have to conserve species today?

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.850
So the field I work in
is called ancient DNA.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.850
It's pretty clear what
ancient DNA means.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.610
It means old DNA, not old
people DNA, but actually

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.000
really old DNA, like
mammoths preserved in ice.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.940
I work at a place
called Beringia.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.650
Beringia spans
this part of Alaska

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.170
here, across the Bering land
bridge into eastern Siberia.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.230
All of this white stuff here
is just an indication that it's

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.640
not as deep in the ocean there.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.910
So during the Ice Ages, when
much of the water on the planet

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.680
was taken up into making
giant glaciers sitting

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.530
on top of the continents,
this was actually exposed.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.690
This was exposed land.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.230
And this, of course, is
a very important corridor

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.520
for movement of many species,
camels and horses going

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.520
in this direction, bison and
people going in this direction,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.860
to move between
the two continents.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.420
So today Beringia
looks like this.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.950
I'm actually in that
helicopter, taking this picture.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.230
And I'll show you a picture
of that fantastic flying

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.710
machine in just a moment.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.560
Looks like this.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.550
But in the past, and
during the last Ice Age,

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.880
it looked more like this, with
a very rich and diverse plant

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.730
community that was grazed on
by a rich and diverse herbivore

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.550
community that
was hunted by lots

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.160
of different types
of carnivores.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.340
There were mammoths and
mastodons at various times,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.920
and North American camels,
several different species

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.555
of big cat.

00:08:07.555 --> 00:08:10.760
There were giant bears,
arctodus, that if it stood up,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.300
was 16 feet tall.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.770
And there was even
a giant beaver

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.410
that was the same
size as me, which

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.870
is the funniest extinct animal.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.737
So we fly out here in this
fantastic flying machine.

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.820
You'll notice that there
are some windows missing,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.620
which is great, in
case anybody wants

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.799
to smoke on board in
celebration of taking off.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.640
I'm not saying that happened,
but I'm not saying it didn't.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.380
And we stay in
five-star accommodation,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.250
as you can see here.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.950
This is a picture
that I took of my tent

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.464
by backing up and
unfocusing my camera lens

00:08:42.464 --> 00:08:45.560
so that I could really get a
picture of the depth of field

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.220
of mosquitoes that we
were dealing with up there

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.410
in the Arctic.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.510
And we walk along
all sorts of places,

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.350
wherever the
permafrost is thawing,

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.750
like these placer mining sites.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.829
This is, again,
back in Dawson City.

00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:58.995
The previous pictures were
from the Taimyr Peninsula

00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:01.170
in North Central Siberia.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.132
This is, again, an
active mining site,

00:09:03.132 --> 00:09:05.090
where you see them washing
down the permafrost.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.700
And here are my folks kind
of wandering around, waiting

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.922
to pick up bones that are coming
out as the dirt washes away.

00:09:11.922 --> 00:09:13.380
So in a day out in
the field, we'll

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.110
generally collect anywhere
between five and 20 bags

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.770
of bones like this.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.460
Most of the bones
there are bison.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.880
There are also mammoth
and caribou and horses.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.480
And sometimes we get lucky and
get wolves or bears or lions.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.050
And we take a piece out of these
bones, a tiny piece-- that's

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.640
just a regular Dremel tool
with a little cutting disk--

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.220
and bring that piece
back to the lab,

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.930
grind it up, and extract DNA.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.180
And then we correlate the
amount of genetic diversity

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.690
that we observe in any
species at one point in time

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.570
with the size of the population.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.600
So in essence, we can use
DNA extracted from thousands

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.890
of these bones to learn
how populations were

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.010
growing or shrinking or
moving across the landscape,

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.120
or whether there were
local extinctions followed

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.760
by replacements of populations
coming in from somewhere else.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.890
And we've learned an
awful lot of stuff

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.060
over the last couple
decades of doing this.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.780
For example, we've learned that
bison, horses, and mammoths all

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.270
peaked in population size
around 40,000 years ago,

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.550
and then started to climb.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.255
And this is
interesting, because two

00:10:15.255 --> 00:10:18.870
of the main hypotheses about
what caused the megafauna mass

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.290
extinction at the end
of the Pleistocene,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.665
when we did lose
mammoths and many other

00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.380
of these big species,
were that they didn't

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.880
like the peak of
the last Ice Age--

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.671
it was too cold and
too terrible for them--

00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.510
or that people turned up
and hunted them to death.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.190
But if the initial decline
begins about 30,000 years ago,

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.810
that's 10,000 years before
the peak of the last Ice Age,

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.710
and 15,000 years before any
evidence of large numbers

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.980
of humans in North America.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.320
So it looks like we're off
the hook for the beginning

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.110
of these extinctions, although
I'm not quite willing to let us

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.080
off the hook for the
ultimate extinction

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.390
event of many of these species.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.280
We've watched carnivore
populations grow and move

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.020
in response to changes in the
dynamics of the herbivores

00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.870
that they preyed on.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.900
And we're starting to learn
why some species, like caribou,

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.616
survived.

00:11:03.616 --> 00:11:05.240
They liked to live
where humans didn't,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.100
which is a pretty good trick.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.330
And other species, like
cave lions, went extinct.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.090
And I and colleagues who
work on this stuff often

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.120
get to publish these papers in
pretty high profile journals.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.204
They get lots of press
attention, and people care.

00:11:18.204 --> 00:11:19.411
People are really interested.

00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:20.000
They call.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.790
I'm often really excited to
talk about what we've learned,

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.110
and how it applies to
present day problems

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.840
in biodiversity conservation.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.395
But they only ever really
ask me one question.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.760
And it's kind of annoying.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.020
And since there really is
no sound bite-size response

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.590
to this, I decided to
write this book, right?

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.440
So the field, the
field of bringing

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.720
extinct species or extinct
traits back to life,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.240
has come to be known
as de-extinction.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.621
Now, we are all partly
familiar with de-extinction

00:11:50.621 --> 00:11:52.870
because we were there when
it happened the first time.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:53.900
And we know what happened.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.566
We know it all went
off without a hitch.

00:11:55.566 --> 00:11:57.180
Everything was
perfectly good, right?

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.360
We remember this?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.480
But today we're not going
to talk about dinosaurs,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.170
because we can't
clone dinosaurs.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.710
There are no dinosaur
bones that contain DNA.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.730
They're all rocks.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.800
There's no DNA in rocks.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.100
Regardless of what you
read in high profile,

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.080
nice publications like
"Science" and "Nature,"

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.520
there's no DNA in dinosaurs.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.657
You heard it here.

00:12:16.657 --> 00:12:18.490
So how are we going to
bring back a mammoth?

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.494
We know there's DNA
in mammoths, right?

00:12:20.494 --> 00:12:22.410
The first step, the first
thing that everybody

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.000
thinks we're going to do, the
first process that's proposed,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.270
is, let's clone it.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.580
Let's clone a mammoth.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.030
Well, cloning is actually a
specific scientific process,

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.330
a specific type of work that's
actually known as somatic cell

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.224
nuclear transfer.

00:12:37.224 --> 00:12:38.640
So in our cells,
we basically have

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.020
two different kinds of
cells, germ line cells,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.590
which are sperm and
eggs, and somatic cells,

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.730
which are everything else.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.670
What normally happens,
a sperm and egg

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.810
come together, fertilize,
create a small thing, a zygote,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.250
that differentiates.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.060
And that particular
cell that they create

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.670
has the power to become any type
of cell in a whole body, hair

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.610
cells, skin cells, heart cells,
liver cells, every type of cell

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.510
there is.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.890
Somatic cells already
know what their job is,

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.640
and they can't do anything else.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.190
So the idea of somatic
cell nuclear transfer

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.970
is to trick a somatic cell into
forgetting all the instructions

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.270
necessary to be
that type of cell,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.150
and to revert into a state
where it can actually,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.620
then, become every
type of cell in a body

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.004
and create a whole being.

00:13:21.004 --> 00:13:22.420
So the most famous,
and the first,

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.680
example of somatic
cell nuclear transfer

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.610
was an experiment in
the mid-1990s that

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.790
brought us Dolly the Sheep.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.100
Probably everybody's
heard of this.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.780
This was work by the Roswell
Institute in Scotland.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.650
And they took a somatic
cell-- in this case

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.760
it was a mammary cell from
an adult sheep, a ewe--

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.500
and they took those cells
and basically starved them.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.106
They starved them of
nutrients in a dish in a lab.

00:13:44.106 --> 00:13:45.730
At the same time,
they took an egg cell

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.920
from a different breed
of sheep, and they

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.780
removed the nucleus, all
the genetic material,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.230
from that unfertilized egg.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.070
So you had an egg
with nothing in it

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.720
and starved cells right here.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.360
Put them next to
each other, zap them

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.300
with electricity, the membrane
bursts, the nucleus here

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.710
dumps into the cell.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.910
Zap it again, and the
proteins in that egg

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.880
somehow cause the
genetic material

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.320
from that somatic cell
that's a bit stressed out

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.480
to forget all the instructions
and turn into the type of cell

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.927
that can become everything
in a particular animal.

00:14:15.927 --> 00:14:18.260
This is then implanted in the
surrogate host, who is yet

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.660
another species of
sheep or breed of sheep,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.520
and eventually Dolly was born.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.950
And Dolly was a genetic clone
of the mammary cell donor,

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.000
and not of either the egg cell
donor or the surrogate mom.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.910
Easy.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:32.652
So how do we do
it with a mammoth?

00:14:32.652 --> 00:14:34.110
Well, we go out in
the field and we

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.510
find one of these fantastically
preserved mammoths.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.910
And we remove some cells,
and then we stress them out,

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.875
and then we stick those cells
in the nucleus of an egg.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.200
And it does that
little magic thing,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.630
and then we stick it
inside an elephant,

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.040
and it grows up to be a baby.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.800
Release it, and it's all good.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.300
Right.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.420
Here we have our first problem.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.550
So we do find a lot of
incredibly well-preserved

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.890
remains up in the Arctic.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.780
This is an example.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.510
This is a horse jaw
that we found up

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.580
in the permafrost
near Dawson City that

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.900
dates to sometime in the
last 100,000 years or so.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.524
This is one of the very many
well-preserved mummies that's

00:15:12.524 --> 00:15:13.440
been found in Siberia.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.690
And a couple summers
ago, there was a report

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.690
of this incredibly
well-preserved mummy that

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.440
was associated with what looked
like a viscous red material

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.890
that they thought
might be blood.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.100
But regardless of
how well-preserved

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.910
these things are,
there is not going

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:33.030
to be a living cell to be found
in any remains of any mammoth.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.310
Once an organism dies, the
cells and the DNA within them,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.970
begins to get broken down into
smaller and smaller pieces

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.230
almost immediately.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.380
First it's enzymes within our
own body that chop up the DNA.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.440
If you're a mummy, you might
have the guts burst, and then

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.777
all of that microbiome
that lives in there

00:15:49.777 --> 00:15:51.610
is going to circulate
throughout the system.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.150
And those are living microbes
that will just catabolize,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.680
eat up that DNA.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.270
Sun is particularly bad.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.360
UV light will hit those mummies,
just like it hits us when we're

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.930
alive and we walk outside.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.960
But unlike us, the mummies are
dead, or the bones are dead.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.580
So there's no
proofreading mechanism

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.720
to fix the damage caused
by solar radiation.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.870
Water, hydrolysis,
oxygen, all these things

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.100
are terrible for DNA survival.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.810
And in fact, the DNA begins
to break down immediately

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.170
and is eventually broken
down to a state where there's

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.330
nothing that's recoverable.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.040
Where there are no living cells,
there's no living genomes,

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.972
there's no intact DNA, we
cannot clone a mammoth.

00:16:32.276 --> 00:16:34.640
Thank you for coming.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.800
Just kidding.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.170
Obviously I'm just kidding.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.470
So what's the next step?

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.069
So we all probably
heard last week,

00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:41.860
because there was a
lot of press attention,

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.450
that an international
group of scientists--

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:50.090
but mostly a group that was in
Stockholm, led by Love Dalen --

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.180
had published the
genome sequence,

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.670
complete genome sequences,
of two mammoths,

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.380
one mammoth from Wrangel Island
that was around 3,500 years

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.980
old, and another mammoth from
Siberia that was somewhere

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.930
in the realm of
40,000 years old.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.849
So now what we have this
is nice and big list of As,

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:06.880
Cs, Gs, and Ts, the
nucleotides that

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.950
make up DNA, that will
spell out the instructions

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.569
to make the genes that make
the proteins to make a mammoth,

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.990
to make it how it looks
and how it behaves.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:16.470
So surely, the
best thing that we

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.329
can do to bring a
mammoth back to life

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.400
would just be to synthesize
these long stretches of DNA,

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.119
and then get them
into the chromosome,

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.900
and then put the chromosome
into this egg cell,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.530
and then do the thing with
the going around and making

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.816
the mammoth.

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:31.315
Yeah.

00:17:31.315 --> 00:17:33.590
That.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.007
So the problem with this is
that a complete genome-- well,

00:17:36.007 --> 00:17:37.881
there's lots of problems
here, but let's just

00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:40.230
start with this-- they said
it was a complete genome,

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.420
but in fact, it's not
really a complete genome.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.660
In fact, we don't actually know
the complete genome sequence

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.120
of any vertebrate
animal, including humans.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.170
And I know that that sounds
a little bit strange,

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.740
since we've been saying
for quite a long time

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.400
that we know the
human genome sequence.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.659
And to be fair, we do know most
of the human genome sequence.

00:17:59.659 --> 00:18:01.200
We know, at least,
all the parts that

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.900
contain genes, the
important parts that

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.070
make the proteins that make
us look and act the way

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.890
that we do.

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.690
But there are parts
of the human genome,

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.040
and of every other mammalian
genome and vertebrate genome,

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.500
that are extremely hard
to sequence through,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.220
these complex patterns of
highly condensed repeat things,

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.180
often near the center
of the chromosomes

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.770
and near the end
of the chromosomes.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:24.720
But there isn't any existing
sequencing technology

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.720
that can get through.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.215
And this means that we don't
know the whole sequence.

00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:29.590
We don't know how
long these are.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.010
We don't know if
they're important.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.093
We don't know whether there
are any genes in them.

00:18:33.093 --> 00:18:35.560
We don't really understand
quite yet what they do.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.760
But the truth is, we don't
have the complete sequence.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.390
For mammoths, it's
even harder than that.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.430
And there are two
reasons why it's

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.152
harder for anything that's
extinct-- in particular,

00:18:46.152 --> 00:18:47.610
we're talking about
mammoths here--

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.950
than it would be to assemble
a complete human genome.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.590
The first is that
the sequences that we

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.600
recover from these bones
are very short and damaged.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.420
And this is because
of all of the stuff

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.280
that I just talked about--
solar radiation, enzymes

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.890
from in the body
and from microbes

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.450
that are in the soil that will
get into the particular bones

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.600
after they're buried and eat
up the DNA-- all of this stuff

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.150
is acting to break those
DNA sequences down.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.390
So if you imagine that I
could get modern DNA out

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.170
of something that looks like
a nice big party streamer,

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.150
ancient DNA looks
more like confetti,

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.516
but not confetti that's
in that good of a shape.

00:19:20.516 --> 00:19:21.890
More like confetti
that you might

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.190
find on the ground
in the gutter the day

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.030
after the parade, when it
rained the night before.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.605
And maybe there were
elephants in the parade,

00:19:30.605 --> 00:19:33.540
and flocks of passenger
pigeons flying overhead.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.090
Not good It's not good.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.940
The other problem
is that the samples

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.900
are full of all kinds of stuff
in addition to mammoth DNA.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.620
So if you imagine that I
took a piece of my own hair,

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.200
or a cheek swab, and extracted
all the DNA in there,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.080
and then sequenced
everything I got

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.550
when I extracted DNA, nearly
everything that I could get out

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.910
of there would be my own DNA.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:55.150
That's because I'm
living, and my DNA's

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.960
in pretty good condition,
and there's not

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.720
that much that might be
contaminating my DNA sample.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.960
In 2006, I was involved
with a group that

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.860
used the new sequencing
technology, next generation

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.160
sequencing, to
shotgun sequence--

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.970
that's what we call sequencing
everything we get out of a DNA

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.440
extract-- a mammoth
bone for the first time.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.320
And this is what we got.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.510
About half of the
sequences that we

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.540
recovered from that sequence
mapped to mammoth DNA.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.830
The rest of it was stuff
like soil bacteria,

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.360
environmental microbes,
other stuff that was probably

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.650
also soil microbes that we
just hadn't sequenced yet,

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.510
so they weren't in the database
for us to compare the data to,

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.830
some contamination-- we often
find human, dog, domestic cat

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.470
and bird sequences
in our extracts.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.010
That's not that surprising.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.320
So about half of what
we got was mammoth.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.060
We were pretty
bummed about this.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.120
We thought, well, half.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.097
That's terrible.

00:20:46.097 --> 00:20:48.180
How are we ever going to
be able to piece together

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.500
a complete genome with only
half of what we're getting

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.090
is actually ancient DNA?

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:56.510
It turns out, a decade later,
we know that this was actually

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.460
an exceptionally
well-preserved sample,

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.550
and that most of the remains
that we recover have less than

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.920
20%-- less than 10% percent
of the DNA that we want is

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.700
actually the DNA from the host.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.880
If you've heard of the
Neanderthal genome that

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.090
was published recently, the
first Neanderthal genome

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.120
sequence, they used a
couple of different bones.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.580
And none of those
bones had more than 1%

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.110
Neanderthal DNA in them.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.540
That's pretty
standard, especially

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.420
when you're not coming
from a kind of cold region.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.220
So what we have is this kind
of junked-up bit of confetti,

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.070
if you can imagine confetti that
looks more gross than this. a

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:31.930
And what we really want
re just the purple bits.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.970
So how do we go about
finding the stuff

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.170
that we want from amid
the entire mess of stuff

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.550
that we actually get?

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.740
How do we well what
DNA is mammoth,

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.990
when most of what we're
getting is actually just

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.340
soil microbes that we
really want to throw away?

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.090
What we do is we map
the data that we have,

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.470
these broken little tiny
pieces of fragments,

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.380
to the already-published
complete genome

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.165
sequences of living
animals, or complete-ish.

00:21:57.165 --> 00:21:58.206
They're in good shape.

00:21:58.206 --> 00:21:59.580
They're much better
than anything

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.250
that we would be
able to generate

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.650
from an ancient sample.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.300
So, for the mammoth, we would
map it to an Asian elephant.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.930
And for the Neanderthal, we
were able to map it to a human.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.250
We take these broken
fragments, and we match them

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.510
where they go, using this
genome sequence as a guide

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.950
to figure out where they go.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.340
One of the key problems
that arises immediately,

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.120
when you think about this, is,
what if something weird has

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.030
happened in the evolutionary
time between when

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.690
a mammoth lived and when
the Asian elephant lived,

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:28.840
since that common ancestor?

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.150
If something weird happened,
like a big duplication--

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.520
there's a whole new bit of
DNA, or something changed

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.540
a lot-- that would be missing.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.030
We wouldn't have that part
of the genome on our map.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.560
We would think that whatever it
was of mammoth DNA that matched

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.620
that real part of
the mammoth genome--

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.466
because it's not part
of the elephant genome

00:22:46.466 --> 00:22:48.340
that we're using as a
scaffold-- was probably

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.330
just environmental DNA,
and we would throw it out.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.680
So it's harder to generate a
complete sequence for something

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.560
that isn't alive,
where we can't generate

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.110
the genome sequence by itself.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:59.700
And one would think
that if you're

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.080
trying to identify the
parts of the genome that

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.220
are most important
to make a mammoth,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.430
look more and act
more like a mammoth

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.310
instead of like
an elephant, those

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:11.500
might be some of the
important places to look.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.340
The other problem is that
having the DNA sequence

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.720
is not the same thing
as having a living cell.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.930
We're getting better at
being able to synthesize

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.146
these long strands of DNA
that we might use to generate

00:23:23.146 --> 00:23:24.520
a complete sequence,
but we don't

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.690
know how to wrap those things
up properly and get them

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.815
into a chromosome in a
state where they're actually

00:23:28.815 --> 00:23:30.854
going to make genes
and make proteins.

00:23:30.854 --> 00:23:32.520
And we don't know how
to get chromosomes

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.190
into a cell in any logical way.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.110
So it looks like, if
this is the pathway,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.520
Plan B is what
we're going to use

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.950
to bring a mammoth back to life,
we're stuck at that first step.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.360
And that's not going
to work either.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.980
Of course, there's another way.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.280
So the last plan-- and
this is the one that really

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.950
is at the core of
what people are

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.040
thinking about
for de-extinction,

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.920
is to engineer a mammoth.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.030
And this is really similar to
just thinking about cutting

00:23:58.030 --> 00:23:59.780
and pasting your DNA.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.740
So you find a part of the genome
that you want to swap out--

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.250
say, some gene that's
different between elephants

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.540
and mammoths-- you cut it
out and paste in the version

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.850
that you want.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.040
So mammoths and Asian
elephants diverged

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.330
from each other something
like six million years ago.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.320
We now have genome sequences
from both of these sequences.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.120
And we can start combing
through those genome sequences

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.390
to look for places where
the two species are

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.850
different from each other.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.630
Sequence a whole bunch
of Asian elephants,

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.910
find the place where they're
all the same as each other,

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.110
a whole bunch of mammoths, and
see where they're all the same.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.901
And if these two are
different, then that's

00:24:31.901 --> 00:24:34.470
probably kind of critical
to making a mammoth look

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.230
and act like a mammoth.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.060
So imagine, then, you
had a little machine

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.893
that you could use, a
machine that you could

00:24:39.893 --> 00:24:43.120
send into the genome
of an elephant cell

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.850
and identify exactly that
place that you want to change.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.810
And also you could give
that little machine

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.430
a package to take with it, which
was an artificially synthesized

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.530
bit of mammoth DNA that
it would take with us

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.380
to this place in the genome.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.090
And that's machine could
then cut out the elephant

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.450
version of the gene, and
swap the mammoth version

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.620
gene in there in its place.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.170
Well, we have that machine.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.420
That machine is
called CRISPR/CAS 9.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.920
And this is something
that you might

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.550
have heard a lot
about in the news

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.840
in the last couple of weeks.

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.370
There was a Chinese
team recently

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.480
that used this
particular enzyme.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.410
This is a naturally
occurring enzyme,

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.910
not a machine that
we've built. It's

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.550
something that
bacteria and archaea

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.334
use to protect themselves
from invading diseases.

00:25:22.334 --> 00:25:23.750
People have figured
out how to use

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:26.840
this to harness this machine
to identify parts of a genome

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.560
and cut it out.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.060
And this Chinese team had
done that with human embryos,

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.260
raising all sorts of ethical
issues about this incredibly

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.400
powerful new technology.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.460
So this machine here,
this molecule here,

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.700
is your little machine.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.760
This is an enzyme.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.670
And here's the part
of it that recognizes

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.570
the specific part of the
elephant genome sequence.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.040
We send in there a bit of
synthesized mammoth DNA.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.910
The machine here
chops it in half.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.210
It's like a molecular
scissors, that's its job.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.660
Of course, DNA in a cell
doesn't like to be in half.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.740
So it has a couple of
different mechanisms

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.980
that it uses to fix those
double-stranded breaks.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.240
We harness the cell's
own repair mechanism,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.350
and stick in there that
synthetic piece of mammoth DNA.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.090
So we end up with
an elephant that's

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.570
just a little bit mammoth-like.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.180
So what do we change?

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.800
I said there are about six
million years of evolution

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.260
separating these two species.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.790
And indeed, there have
been some efforts, so far,

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.380
within last couple
of weeks even,

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.870
to catalog the differences that
existed between these two guys.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.260
One of the first
differences that was found

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.075
was a work was done by Kevin
Campbell's lab in Manitoba

00:26:31.075 --> 00:26:32.320
in 2010.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.870
They found that there were
only three differences, three

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.220
changes that needed to be made,
to change the Asian elephant

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.140
red blood cell, hemoglobin, a
component of the red blood cell

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.230
which is responsible
for carrying oxygen

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.810
around the body, into the
woolly mammoth version

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:47.740
of the red blood cell.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.230
And they made these changes
in cells in the lab,

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.330
and they were able to, then,
do a little tissue culture

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:55.190
experiment, a gene
expression experiment,

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.070
to try to figure out what
those differences did

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.600
for that version of
the hemoglobin protein.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.110
And they found that, when
these changes were made,

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.950
the hemoglobin was much
better at carrying oxygen

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:08.730
around the body at
low temperatures.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.650
This is clearly something
that is an adaptation that

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.680
arose in mammoths as the
tropically-adapted ancestor

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.080
of these two species
moved out of the tropics

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.660
and into the Arctic.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.360
So this might be a
powerful new first approach

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.950
to going about trying to create
or change an elephant genome so

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.810
that you could create a mammoth.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.530
So what else should we change?

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.181
Well, there's a team
that's nearby here

00:27:32.181 --> 00:27:33.930
that's led by George
Church that have been

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.600
working on this for some time.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.260
And using this CRISPR
type of genome editing,

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.610
they've so far been able to
swap out 14 different genes.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.540
Every one of them that
they've tried so far

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.030
has worked with this
CRISPR technology.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.560
These genes are associated with
increasing thermal regulation,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.130
maybe thicker subcutaneous
fat layers and thicker hair,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:55.770
or the red blood cells.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.850
Also things that are
associated with diet,

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.680
the metabolism, all sorts of
things that one might think

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.880
were important to making an
elephant look and act more

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.390
like a mammoth.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.270
And so far, they have
succeeded in creating something

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:13.290
that is about a small
fraction mammoth in a dish,

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.500
in a lab, which, of course, is
a very long way from creating

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.690
a living, breathing mammoth.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.220
But it is helpful,
and it does say

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.890
that, with this genome
sequence, which we do have,

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.570
for the most part, and with
this CRISPR/CAS engineering

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:30.000
technology, which we also have,
we can then create an elephant

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.850
cell that's alive that
contains a few mutations that

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.850
make it look and act
more like a mammoth.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.630
And at that point,
we can go ahead

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.580
and use cloning, the
traditional technology used

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.550
to bring something back.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:47.980
Of course, the next step here,
creating a surrogate mom,

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.260
growing it up, putting it in the
environment-- I like to call it

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.690
Phase 2 of de-extinction--
is probably

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.550
even harder than what we've
been able to accomplish so far.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.160
And when you read
about de-extinction

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.260
or hear about it on the
radio, often there's

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.790
a focus on this first part,
Phase 1, with the thought

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.520
that just because
we can get this far

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.960
means that we are super
close to being able to bring

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.280
a mammoth back to life.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.780
But that is really,
really not the case.

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.017
We are far from being
able to create a mammoth.

00:29:18.017 --> 00:29:20.100
So the next thing we would
have to do in this step

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.690
would be to find
a surrogate mom.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.000
So for many species,
this might be easy.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.460
If they have very close
evolutionary relatives that

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.480
are still alive, then
it might be relatively

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.900
straightforward to finding
a surrogate mom that could

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:36.850
carry an edited embryo to term.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.400
But the more evolutionary
distance accumulates

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.950
between the living species
and the extinct species

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.540
you're trying to bring back,
the harder this is likely to be.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:50.060
There may even, in some cases,
be some unpleasant constraints

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.959
associated with
trying to do this.

00:29:52.959 --> 00:29:55.250
I know I say here that you
probably don't want a photo,

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.000
but you're a bunch of
computer scientists,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.340
so you probably do want a photo.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.730
So here is one.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.630
You were hoping for
something grosser, right?

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:03.479
I knew that.

00:30:03.479 --> 00:30:05.520
I'll try to find something
grosser for next time.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.920
This is a Steller's sea cow.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.140
And the Steller's sea
cow, this is a foot.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.640
This is the scale
bar right there.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.794
This is a big animal.

00:30:12.794 --> 00:30:15.210
Steller's sea cow went extinct
a couple hundred years ago.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.440
We hunted them to death.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.454
One of these guys could
feed a crew of 30 or so men

00:30:19.454 --> 00:30:20.370
for a couple of weeks.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.750
So you can see why,
potentially, they

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.000
were nice prey for people
who were out on the ocean.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.860
They lived along the
coast of California,

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.720
up across the Aleutian Islands,
and onto the Commander Islands.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.410
And they went extinct
really recently,

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:32.535
a couple hundred years ago.

00:30:32.535 --> 00:30:35.360
The closest living relative
to the Steller's sea cow

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.310
is a dugong, here.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.330
And if one were to estimate the
size of a newborn Steller's sea

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:44.810
cow by looking at the
of newborn manatee

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.220
and dugong to the
size of their mom,

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.000
a newborn Steller's
sea cow would

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.580
be larger than its mom, which
just wouldn't be pretty.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.180
So in some cases, there may
be some physical constraints,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.650
technical problems, technical
challenges associated

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.050
with this part of Phase 2.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.670
it's also pretty clear
by now, and becoming

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.120
more and more
clear through time,

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.800
that we as organisms--
and every organism--

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.120
are more than the
sum of just our

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.970
As, Cs, Gs, and Ts that
make up our DNA sequence.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.240
In fact, we are a product
of both our genome sequences

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.870
and the environment
in which we live.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.340
And that environment
begins in the world.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.660
The same would necessarily
be true for an elephant,

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.660
or an edited elephant that was
attempting to be a mammoth.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.170
Asian elephant and
mammoths genomes

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.270
are already, without thinking
about anything, about 99%

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.810
the same, the same as
we are with chimpanzees.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.500
And so if you put
something that's tiny,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.690
tiny bit changed
inside a mom who

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:45.650
has pretty much the same genome
and pretty much the same genes,

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.597
and the developmental
process here

00:31:47.597 --> 00:31:49.180
is going to be
controlled and affected

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.810
by her hormonal environment and
her diet and what's going on,

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.830
how do we know that the
changes that we've made

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.370
are going to have any
effect whatsoever on what

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.960
this animal looks like?

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.870
And once it's born, it's
going to be born into

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.730
and live in an elephant society.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:06.600
Elephants eat the
dung of their moms

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.500
just after they're born
in order to establish

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.200
the microbial community
that they need to break down

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.340
the food that they eat.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.146
This newborn mammoth
elephant hybrid

00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:16.520
would eat the dung
of an elephant

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.400
so that it could establish an
elephant microbial community.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.440
We know how important
the gut microbes

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.270
are in determining how we look
and how we act and how we feel.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:27.575
Why would the same not be
true for an animal like this?

00:32:27.575 --> 00:32:29.810
It would then join
an elephant society

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:31.910
and eat whatever
food elephants are

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.000
fed in captive environments.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.310
And all of these
things are going

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.490
to affect the way that
this animal behaves

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.630
and the way that it looks.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.690
This is something
that's unquestionable,

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:45.110
and yet something that we
haven't really questioned.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.180
And speaking of captive
environments, this, in my mind,

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:50.590
is probably the biggest
challenge associated

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.940
with mammoth de-extinction.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.270
We know that elephants
don't fare particularly well

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.350
in captivity.

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.680
They often fail to
reproduce in captivity.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.670
If they do, they
injure and sometimes

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.570
even kill their offspring.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.340
Until we have figured
out how we can

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.620
meet the physical and emotional,
psychological needs of mammoths

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.240
in captivity, I think
that we should not

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.850
be using mammoths for
this type of research,

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.720
or keeping them in captivity.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.680
Maybe for other species, these
particular types of concerns

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:20.420
are less.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.210
Birds we may not need to
have-- some bird species

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.620
might not have very
much parental guidance,

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.780
so maybe it's ethically
simpler to bring birds back.

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.700
But there are, of course,
technical challenges

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.616
of bringing birds back
that we don't have when

00:33:33.616 --> 00:33:35.230
we're dealing with mammals.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.090
So there are many different
ethical considerations

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.732
to be aware of.

00:33:38.732 --> 00:33:40.190
But again, this is
something that I

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.140
think not enough attention
has been paid to.

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:47.070
And finally, it would be
remiss of me not to point out

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:51.410
or to acknowledge that the world
has changed a lot in the time

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.150
since many of these
species have gone extinct.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.560
And bringing something
back, and introducing it

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.750
into an environment
where it doesn't live,

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.320
is definitely going to
affect those environments.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.110
Environments are
not stable things.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.180
A species doesn't go extinct,
leaving this giant, gaping hole

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.085
into which we could
just stick it back.

00:34:08.085 --> 00:34:08.710
They'll change.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.293
They'll adapt.

00:34:09.293 --> 00:34:10.460
New species move in.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.800
Everything changes.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.060
This here, this is the range
of the passenger pigeon, which

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.480
is one of the
species that's been

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.690
proposed to bring back to life.

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:21.860
Where would a passenger
pigeon, a bird that

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.389
flocked in the billions
and fed on forests,

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:27.889
killing huge swaths
of forest all at once,

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:31.340
where would it go if we
were to bring it back?

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.350
Clearly, the ecological
implications of de-extinction

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:36.679
need to be considered
carefully for any species

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:38.179
that we're considering
bringing back

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:42.730
before we go down the road
to actually making it happen.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.310
So de-extinction, can we do it?

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.190
Not yet.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.489
We can't yet.

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:50.120
But the technology is increasing
rapidly, both in Phase 1

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:50.802
and in Phase 2.

00:34:50.802 --> 00:34:52.260
And there will come
a time where we

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.760
can do this for some species.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.710
So maybe we should start
focusing more on the question,

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.981
should we?

00:34:58.981 --> 00:35:00.980
And as somebody who's
written a book about this,

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.870
it's clear that I should have
a very informed and direct

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:04.950
opinion about this.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.400
And I do.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.159
I don't know.

00:35:09.159 --> 00:35:09.700
I don't know.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.200
I honestly don't know.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.700
There are a lot of
different species

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.316
that have been proposed as
candidates for de-extinction.

00:35:15.316 --> 00:35:16.940
This is the heath
hen that used to live

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.070
in Martha's Vineyard, mammoth,
passenger pigeon, thylacine,

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:23.270
Steller's sea cow, the gastric
brooding frog, the bucardo,

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:25.730
a type of ibex that used
to live in the Pyrenees.

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.540
All of these things
have been posed

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.760
by groups who were interested in
working them to be resurrected.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.430
But I think that the
most important thing

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.730
to do in deciding whether
we should proceed with any

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.860
of these species, or any
other species that someone

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:44.430
might want to bring back, is to
really try to understand why.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.330
Why might we want to
bring a species back

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.790
that's been extinct
for a long time?

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.150
Why is this such a
compelling area of research?

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:56.085
Why are so many people so
fascinated by this idea?

00:35:56.085 --> 00:35:58.460
And to answer this question,
just in the last few minutes

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.430
here, I'm going to
return to mammoths.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.560
And I'm going to ignore the
fact, for a moment, that it's

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.460
not possible to do and that,
ethically, it's probably

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.840
a terrible idea to
deal with elephants

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.580
and to bring mammoths
back to life,

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.290
and talk about why we
might want them back.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.200
Because I do think there are
a couple of compelling reasons

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.480
to think about bringing mammoths
back, or at least creating

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.490
an elephant that looks and acts
a little bit like a mammoth.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.760
The first is ecological.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.700
So there's a place up
in Northeastern Siberia

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.240
called Pleistocene Park.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.954
It's been established
in about the mid-1990s

00:36:30.954 --> 00:36:32.995
by scientists with the
Russian Academy of Science

00:36:32.995 --> 00:36:34.630
named Sergey Zimov.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.650
He started buying up
land near his home

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.430
at the Northeast Science
Nation and preparing

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:43.420
a park for the resurrection
of Ice Age animals.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.050
So far he has bison
imported from Canada,

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.930
some species of horse, five
different species of deer.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.790
And he's been doing
some experiments, where

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:54.430
he's keeping them out of some
parts of Pleistocene Park

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.050
and letting them graze on
other parts of Pleistocene Park

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.160
to see what the effect
of having those animals

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:04.680
there is on the ecosystem, the
environment itself as a whole.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.310
So here's a picture
that Sergey took.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:08.070
This is very early spring.

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.630
This is the side that doesn't
have any grazing animals,

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.620
and this is the side that
does have grazing animals.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.200
And what you see here is
a really stark contrast

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.000
between the type of
vegetation that's there.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.540
Here we have pretty much
only one species of grass.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.020
It's very low productivity.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.370
Really can't support grazing
herbivores in any way.

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.660
And over here-- remember,
this is early spring,

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.120
so the grass hasn't had time
to regenerate-- you still see

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:32.730
lots of green.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.230
And you can't really
tell, but there

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.700
are a bunch of different
species of grass that are there.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.840
What he's found is that these
animals, by their presence

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.800
alone, moving around, turning
over the soil, recycling

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.600
nutrients, distributing
seeds, have essentially

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.750
created their own habitat.

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.910
They've made the habitat that's
necessary for them to survive.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.700
In fact, they've made
so much that even

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.900
after the very
cold Arctic winter,

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.790
there's still some green grass
there left for that community

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:00.355
to come back the next year.

00:38:00.355 --> 00:38:02.620
And he's observed not only
that these animals are

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.670
happy and healthy and
living in these areas,

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.860
but that other species have come
to visit the park because it's

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.700
such a rich source of food,
things like saiga antelope,

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.520
an endangered species.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.810
Essentially, these animals,
with their presence,

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.460
have recreated that
rich tundra grassland

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:21.360
that used to be there,
potentially making habitat

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.350
and saving species that
are in danger of extinction

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:26.540
today because this
is all they've got.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:33.250
The next reason
is more emotional.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:38.110
I think few of us are willing to
accept the idea of a world that

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.870
doesn't have elephants.

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:43.362
But elephants are an
endangered species.

00:38:43.362 --> 00:38:45.170
Asian elephants are in trouble.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.520
Their habitat is declining.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.470
We're having a difficult
time stopping poaching.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.040
Human populations are growing.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.090
And every year fewer and
fewer Asian elephants exist.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:56.900
What if we could
use this technology

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.460
not to bring mammoths
back to life,

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.850
but to create elephants
that are capable of living

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:06.350
in a more diverse environment,
elephants that could live

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:08.200
in temperate zones
or Arctic zones,

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.000
moving into the types of
habitats that once occupied

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.850
by mammoths?

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:15.130
We could use this technology
not to bring something that's

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.930
gone and has been
gone for a long time

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.330
back, but really to save a
species that's still alive

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.910
today, but in danger
of extinction.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:24.900
Let's not use this
crazy technology

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.040
to de-extinct mammoth.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.640
Let's use it to save elephants.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.090
And that's what I think
the most compelling use

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:35.110
of the technology that's being
developed here really is.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.460
Not to bring stuff
back that's gone,

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:41.290
but to change and manipulate
and give a genetic booster shot,

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.480
if you will, to populations and
species and communities that

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.100
are in danger of going
extinct because of our actions

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.590
today, because of
climate change,

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.610
because of decreases in
habitat that evolution itself,

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.420
alone, can't keep up with.

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.230
This, in my mind, is
the most powerful use

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.890
of de-extinction technology.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.414
Thank you for your attention.

00:40:00.414 --> 00:40:07.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:13.910
I'm happy to take any
questions, if anyone has any.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.410
AUDIENCE: So my
first question comes

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:17.826
back to what you said at the
very beginning, which is this

00:40:17.826 --> 00:40:20.060
is not what your field was.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.490
Has the question caused
you to become interested

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:24.630
in this question and change
what you're working on?

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:28.150
Or has it just caused
you to write this book

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:29.401
that you're now on tour about?

00:40:29.401 --> 00:40:30.191
BETH SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:32.215
No, I'm definitely
more interested now.

00:40:32.215 --> 00:40:35.110
And actually, writing this
book was an experience

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:36.910
in becoming more
and more interested.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.660
We now have a couple
of different projects

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.910
where we are hoping to use
ancient DNA technology to learn

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.670
what the diversity was
in populations that

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.890
were extinct in the
past-- not extinct,

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.970
but where recent
changes in population

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.150
size-- like black-footed
ferrets in the central plains,

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:57.954
for example, are nearly
genetically depauparate.

00:40:57.954 --> 00:40:59.120
They're all almost the same.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.570
And that's because of a
recent, really tight population

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:02.970
bottleneck and near extinction.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.050
These guys are now in trouble.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.700
There is a disease
that's killing them off.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.290
It's not something
that we can do yet,

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:12.790
but it would be possible to look
at black-footed ferrets that

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:14.490
are preserved in
museum collections,

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:16.780
or living cells that they
have in the collection

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.965
at the frozen zoo in San Diego,
and learn how much diversity

00:41:19.965 --> 00:41:22.090
there was in the past, and
then use this technology

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.100
to inject that diversity
into living populations

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.610
of black-footed ferrets.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.130
I'm also really
interested in birds.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.840
There are tons of
species of birds that

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.710
are in danger of going extinct.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.100
And yet the biggest
technical hurdle here

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.760
is that we can't clone birds.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.910
There's no way to
actually get that egg

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.510
cell at the point where
it's ready to be fertilized

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.270
but it hasn't yet
been fertilized

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.700
because of the peculiarities
of the bird reproductive tract.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.690
And so there is no
way to clone birds.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.670
There's a different
type of technology

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:54.270
that one would use to change
the genome sequence in birds.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.890
And we've been working
with other groups

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:00.690
to try to refine that technology
for endangered bird species.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:01.540
It's kind of neat.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:05.070
When a bird, chicken egg
is laid, for example,

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.450
the germ cells, or the
primordial germ cells

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:09.850
that are going to go on
to become sperm and eggs,

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:12.510
aren't actually in the
gonads yet because the gonads

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.340
don't exist yet.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.050
But they're migrating around
the outside of that embryo

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.440
to the place where
the gonads will be.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.180
At that point, you can stick
a needle in the egg cell

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.640
and suck out some of those germ
cells, primordial germ cells,

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.050
without harming the
embryo or the egg.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.990
And you can put
those into a dish,

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:32.000
and you can actually edit
those primordial germ cells.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.450
And then you can stick
them back in to another egg

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.680
as it's just been laid, and
they will migrate around

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.100
the embryo to become those
primordial germ cells.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.420
So the egg, when it hatches,
will be totally normal.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.030
But its offspring will have
the edits that you've made.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:46.600
This is a really cool,
and potentially powerful,

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.610
technology that's really
at the early stages

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:51.650
of being developed.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.970
AUDIENCE: So you
posed the question as,

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:57.560
can we and should we?

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.240
Do you not feel like
we live in a world

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.440
where it is inevitable
that, probably

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.980
within the lifetime of
people in this room,

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:05.700
people will actually
decide to do this,

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:09.120
and there will be baby elephants
with a little bit of woolly

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.530
mammoth, or baby humans with
a little bit of Neanderthal,

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.840
or whatever your
favorite choice is,

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.820
as one of these inevitable--

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.070
BETH SHAPIRO: Those are two
particularly hard choices,

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.010
right?

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.302
There are a lot of technical
hurdles with both these.

00:43:21.302 --> 00:43:23.760
And with Neanderthals there's
a big ethical question there.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.280
Neanderthals are
people too, right?

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.194
So how are you going
to get informed consent

00:43:27.194 --> 00:43:28.860
to bring one of those
guys back to life?

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.380
It's a slippery, touchy thing.

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.340
I don't think we
should go there.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.140
Whether we do or
not, I don't know.

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.650
Scary.

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:36.200
But there are a
lot of scary things

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.340
that can be done
with CRISPRs, so I

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.550
don't think we should
talk about those either.

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:43.820
Mammoths, some of
the biggest hangups

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:48.030
are actually in the
cloning process itself.

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.900
Every time an
elephant gives birth,

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.630
the hymen actually grows back.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.380
And the hymen has a
tiny little hole in it

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.370
that's just big enough for
the sperm to get through.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.067
It sits there during the
pregnancy to actually maintain

00:43:59.067 --> 00:43:59.650
the pregnancy.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:02.560
It's a big, heavy thing, and
it's a two-year pregnancy.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.280
So gotta hold it in
there for two years.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.840
There certainly is no way to
insert a developing embryo

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.370
into the uterus of an elephant
without destroying that hymen.

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:14.000
I think that to
this stuff is going

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.230
to involve m growing elephant
eggs on the backs of mice--

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.480
I know that there are groups
that are actually working

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.250
on doing that-- and maybe
completely artificial wounds

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.090
where the entire
gestation process takes

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.270
place outside of a species.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.960
And all that stuff might
be developed, probably not

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.610
for de-extinction,
probably because we

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.150
want to use it for humans.

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.480
There certainly
isn't any money being

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.510
invested into
developing technologies

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.120
for the purposes of extinction.

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.860
But yeah, I do I think that
somebody's going to try?

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:44.757
Yeah.

00:44:44.757 --> 00:44:47.340
More likely, somebody is going
to achieve what George Church's

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.060
lab achieved, and then
the press is going to say,

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:51.950
George Church cloned a
mammoth, which is not

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.280
what George Church said at all.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.790
And to be fair, there
was only one media

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:58.540
outlet that said
that, and I won't

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.790
say what it is, since I know
this is going on YouTube.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.600
AUDIENCE: OK, so to play
devil's advocate here.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:10.690
So let's say that we succeed
in genetically engineering

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:13.040
elephants so that they can
survive in different habitats

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.430
than they naturally live in now.

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.220
That feels to me like
going up to the elephant

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.021
and saying, well, we've
destroyed your natural habitat

00:45:21.021 --> 00:45:21.520
here.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.100
But we found this other
place in North Dakota

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.650
where you can live.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:29.490
And so we're going to
genetically reengineer

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.247
your offspring and
have them go to that.

00:45:33.247 --> 00:45:34.830
BETH SHAPIRO: I'm
not saying that this

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.970
should be a substitute to try
and protect the species that

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:39.720
are alive and in danger today.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.530
But I think that we have
come to a point where we're

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:43.920
playing conservation triage.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.980
And we might need to reach
deeper into our arsenals

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.770
and find the most
powerful weapons we

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:51.070
have to stop these species
from going extinct.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.440
I would rather have
elephants in Africa,

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.710
but I would rather have
elephants in North Dakota

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:56.635
than no elephants.

00:45:59.514 --> 00:46:00.930
AUDIENCE: On the
one hand, I don't

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.513
like to anthropomorphize
the argument,

00:46:02.513 --> 00:46:05.500
but on the other hand, if we did
anything like that with humans,

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.215
it would be ethically abhorrent
on a number of fronts.

00:46:09.215 --> 00:46:11.910
AUDIENCE: If we tried to save
humans from going extinct,

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.410
it would be ethically abhorrent?

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.770
AUDIENCE: Or if we relocated
them and said, well,

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:18.270
we're genetically engineering
you, so that's going to be OK,

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:20.692
without consent
from participants.

00:46:20.692 --> 00:46:22.150
AUDIENCE: You're
making an argument

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:24.190
that says we should
focus on saving elephants

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.820
where they are.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.690
And I totally agree
with you on that.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:29.230
I completely agree
that we should do that.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:31.022
But I'm saying that
it's not enough,

00:46:31.022 --> 00:46:32.730
and it's probably not
going to be enough.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.430
There are situations
we can't control.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.590
Look at the rhino, right?

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:39.070
We haven't been able
to save the rhino.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.540
The habitat where it
lives is something

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:43.840
that we can't deal
with because of

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.410
current political situations.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:48.660
What if we relocate
elephants to North Dakota,

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.810
and then in that time,
when they're gone,

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:53.820
completely fix the political
climate and the expansion

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.534
of human populations in Africa?

00:46:55.534 --> 00:46:57.200
And then we can put
them back in Africa.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.860
Would having them live in
North Dakota for a short period

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.680
of time be a terrible thing
to do if our ultimate goal was

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.450
to create a native
habitat for them

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:07.470
to thrive as a living species
rather than something that's

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.310
just gone?

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:12.579
AUDIENCE: How do
we actually know

00:47:12.579 --> 00:47:14.120
modifying which bits
is going to help

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.750
elephants live in North Dakota?

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.000
BETH SHAPIRO: We have no idea.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.660
And this is really
part of the process.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.320
So we now have these
genome sequences,

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.860
which is like somebody
handing you two massive phone

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.400
books for New York
City and San Francisco,

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.750
but without any names
and addresses in them.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.440
The next step is trying to
figure out where the genes are,

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.482
what the genes do, doing
these experiments like George

00:47:35.482 --> 00:47:36.940
Church and his lab
are doing, where

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.670
they switch a little bit out,
and then they test those cells.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:43.766
You can actually perform
some assay in tissue culture,

00:47:43.766 --> 00:47:46.140
in culture, to figure out
whether those changes have done

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.950
something, and what
those changes might

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:51.110
be before using them to
go on and make an animal.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:54.570
But yeah, we're very much at
the early stages and trial

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:55.370
and error.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:58.190
We don't have to make animals,
though, that are somehow unfit.

00:47:58.190 --> 00:48:01.460
We can do those early
stages in the lab.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.020
AUDIENCE: I guess I was
thinking, like, even later.

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:07.760
Like if we know how to modify
the blood cells to live

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.870
in a colder climate, how
do we know how much of that

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.734
we need to do, or whether
that's going to be helpful,

00:48:13.734 --> 00:48:15.400
and whether the
elephants are even going

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.525
to survive in North Dakota?

00:48:16.525 --> 00:48:17.316
BETH SHAPIRO: Yeah.

00:48:17.316 --> 00:48:18.250
We don't know, do we?

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:21.880
But yeah, we'll know
more after we've tried

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.090
than we knew before we tried.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:28.110
All right.

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:29.760
Thank you very much
for your attention.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.310
