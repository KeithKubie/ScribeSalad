interesting is that if the brain spends

interesting is that if the brain spends
a lot of time with the specific mental

an upside and that is that the brain is

malleable at any age we found that in

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.550
young people as well so we can
understand what we're doing to our

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560
understand what we're doing to our
 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.560
understand what we're doing to our
brains and we can change our behavior

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570
brains and we can change our behavior
 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.779
brains and we can change our behavior
and our brains will repair themselves

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789
and our brains will repair themselves
 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.540
and our brains will repair themselves
will come back pretty quickly

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550
 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.209
well just as we found with our brain on

we can change people's behaviors which

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:53.279
we can change people's behaviors which
 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.729
we can change people's behaviors which
will alter their brain neural circuitry

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:55.739
will alter their brain neural circuitry
 

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:58.429
will alter their brain neural circuitry
so it's the same principle is how much

00:04:58.429 --> 00:04:58.439
so it's the same principle is how much
 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.790
so it's the same principle is how much
time you spend on the task how that will

determine those neural circuits most of

these changes are not permanent

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879
these changes are not permanent
 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.579
these changes are not permanent
certainly very early in development

there can be permanent damage if there's

there can be permanent damage if there's

long-term habits people are often very

resistant to change especially if

it's very hard to give up smoking and

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969
it's very hard to give up smoking and
 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.029
it's very hard to give up smoking and
it's very hard for some people to give

it's very hard for some people to give
