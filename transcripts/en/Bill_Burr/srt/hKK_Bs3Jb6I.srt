1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:03,150
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:07,200
It's time for the Monday
morning podcasts for Man da. Um,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,180
April 4th, 2016. How's it going? How, why?

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,620
Yeah. I am an Ottawa,
Canada right now. Oh,

5
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,020
can uh,
uh,

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,790
it's fucking freezing here.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,510
Every time I come,

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,670
I know Australia's Dick
Together. Um, yeah,

9
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,230
we came, we did fucking, um, almost said
Wichita. I don't know what the fuck.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,060
Damn Police Windsor.
If we did Windsor,

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,730
me Versie and fucking Joey be Joe Barton.

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,000
We did a Windsor the first day.

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,420
Not even know what day that is yet.
Friday we did it on Friday and um,

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,250
I brought this little fucking bitchy
coat. Yup. Nia calls it the Kleenex coat.

15
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,460
It's just a saline. All those
little ones. Babylon in the 70s,

16
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,380
when they had the big puffy coats,
well,

17
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:11,630
they're still making the puffy coats
to not just like Dylan Little ones,

18
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,230
you know what I mean? They look
like little, uh, you know, like you,

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,170
you're a rib shack in the open a little
think and then giving a little morsel.

20
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,210
Talent looks like there's a bunch of
those sewn into the code. You know that.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,800
Thank you know what the fuck coat I'm
talking about when I was a little north

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,980
north face numbers.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,040
So it got down in a hoodie because they
looked at the fucking forecast and it

24
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,030
said that um,
you know,

25
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,840
it's going to be like 50 degrees
and that coach good down to 40 site.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,300
Donna was fine.
I was fine.

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,610
I was snuggling a little bug in the
rug with first. Was it two days?

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,793
Yeah.

29
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,150
Well now was I the second day?

30
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:53,390
Yeah.

31
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,100
Oh the second day I was at Casino Rama.
That's right.

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,160
And that's when it started the snow and
that's when I started questioning my,

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,340
my jacket game is the young kids
say my jacket game was not on point.

34
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:10,040
However,
by the way,

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,070
I didn't bring any of my fucking podcast
equipment because you know this trip is

36
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:18,170
a mother fucker. All right.
This is one of these,

37
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,340
it's known in my businesses is thrash.
All right.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Sometimes you go on the road, it's
a fucking cake walk. All right.

39
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,030
Whatever the fuck that means.
What is a cake walk? I know.

40
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:30,170
I've never even looked that up.

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,270
Is there a certain kind of way you
walk when you fucking carrying a cake?

42
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:38,440
Maybe that's what it is. Sorry if I'm
fucking, the levels are too high year.

43
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,780
Just trying to talk to him. I
recorded like a microphone. Um,

44
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,390
that's going to be my guess.

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,210
Yeah.

46
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,480
Is that when you have a fucking kick,
you know?

47
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,480
Yeah.

48
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,060
If you have a cake, you're going
to be walking a little gingerly.

49
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,440
No offense to me,
right?

50
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,460
Yeah.

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,670
So you walk a little lately with it.

52
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:02,170
Maybe you know what you're walking like
you walking like Paul Versey when he

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,200
puts on his fucking Jordan
fours for the first time,

54
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,720
you should have seen him
walking down the casino.

55
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,810
He was walking like on his heels
because he didn't want to create some,

56
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,830
I gotta tell you something.
I don't fucking understand.

57
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,870
People who fucking stand in line and then
stab each other over a fucking pair of

58
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:27,730
sneakers. I just really, dude, did
you see the gut to new Jordans?

59
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,000
Three's arou dude,
that fucking crazy.

60
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,230
The new Jordan trees are fucking crazy.
I swear to God,

61
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:40,120
they all look like nurse shoes to me.
Big Stupid, bulky look and fuck it takes,

62
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,000
I think I have a pair of Jordan ones.
I like the colors.

63
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,700
I never liked those fucking things either.

64
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,210
When they came out and
they were red and black,

65
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,130
I thought those were the ugliest fucking
things ever. I told you before, I'm,

66
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,250
I'm part of the back in the day.
I like those Bruce Jenner.

67
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,930
Um, the cattle on shoes, you know,

68
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,200
just simple pair with fucking
three stripes on the side.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,850
I was cool with sneakers right through
towards the end of the eighties when they

70
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:09,400
started having like
the fucking Bo Jackson,

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
the neon Deon fucking whatever
that neon green and neon pink,

72
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:18,010
those fucking sunglasses to
second and went into that shit.

73
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:22,600
Those pastel colors and the
stupid fucking Reebok pump. Oh,

74
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:26,200
maybe if I put some more air in my
sneakers, I won't have white guy legs.

75
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,790
The Reebok pumps were,

76
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:35,130
we're as stupid is Batman
versus Superman there. Alright.

77
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,900
Okay Shirley,
here we go with this cake walk.

78
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,470
Surely you've heard the term cakewalk.

79
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:43,930
Did somebody write a whole
fucking article on this?

80
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:45,580
Yeah.

81
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,450
Good Lord. Cut to the
fucking chase. All right.

82
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,740
I'll read this as fast as I can.

83
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:54,550
Surely you've heard the term cakewalk
used to describe some sort of challenge or

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,990
task that is reckoned to be
pitifully easy. Surely you have,

85
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,130
will you stop saying that? Stop calling
me. Surely. Surely you have. Please.

86
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:07,300
Please don't lie. Good Lord.
Who fucking wrote this?

87
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,433
MMM.

88
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,940
The figurative definition has been
around since the early 19th century.

89
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,860
As long as the literal one,
in fact it appeared in print,

90
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,870
but did you know that the term is
actually pretty racist, racist, racist,

91
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,350
racist.
I'll bet you didn't.

92
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,740
What the fuck is wrong with this idiot
who this is such a classic, you know,

93
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:35,880
if you actually had to get a real job
writing, you wouldn't have one. You know,

94
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:38,550
everybody on the Internet fancies
themselves like there's some sort of

95
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,210
journalist, you know when
they're writing, this is just no,

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,280
you just fucking write it on a w.

97
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:45,930
Okay.

98
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,700
It's like acting in a web series

99
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,670
and you're upset. You didn't get nominated
for a fucking Oscar. Um, nor did I. Okay.

100
00:05:56,671 --> 00:06:00,260
Did you, it was pretty
racist. Um, I bet you didn't.

101
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,140
What? Because you don't know some shit
and that means everybody else doesn't you

102
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:07,780
fucking cunt. I mean, I didn't
know it, but I'm a moron.

103
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,860
I really don't like this person.
Uh, he said, nor did I. Okay.

104
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:14,650
That's the first humble thing. This
person said, maybe you can come around.

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,513
Maybe I was wrong.

106
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,900
I still don't think I could drive
cross country with this person. Um,

107
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,130
nor did I until I looked into the origin
of the term and found out it had roots

108
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,993
in the,

109
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:26,520
yeah.

110
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,750
I don't know how to say
this word. Antebellum south
of the early 19th century.

111
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,930
Can you just tell me
what the fuck it means?

112
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,620
How it started during this era of
firmly entrenched slavery in the states,

113
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,320
the cake walk was a dance event where
slaves were invited to dress up in the

114
00:06:45,451 --> 00:06:50,451
fine clothes and took on the
heirs of the white aristocracy.

115
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,540
Oh, so this is like when the
Wayans brothers did white chicks.

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,970
What are they doing?
Is this like the first def jam comedy?

117
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,980
They started doing the white guy voice.
I said,

118
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,250
get out in the field to do the
work that I should be doing.

119
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,150
And everybody starts flipping
out, dying, laughing.

120
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,490
The next wave coming to
the stage. Um, all right.

121
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,410
They were held in the plantation home
and the same rooms where the risks,

122
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,330
splendid balls were held among
whites of society. Oh my God.

123
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:26,250
How much did those people
fucking stink back then?

124
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,260
Putting on all those extra
layers of clothes? No such
thing as deodorant. Right.

125
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,453
Just joined you.

126
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,140
That's one of those things where you're
wash yourself in the same fucking trough.

127
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:41,070
The goddamn horses drank out
of the cakewalk was similar.

128
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,240
It was a ball held for the slaves.
Oh, so this is a Christmas party.

129
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,460
I didn't know they did that. I
didn't see that in roots. You know,

130
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:50,241
it wasn't all bad.

131
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:55,241
Every once in awhile they had like a
company party after 364 and a half days of

132
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:01,880
absolute horror than they would. They
let them in the house. Yeah. Hey,

133
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,500
sorry about all that other shit.
Uh,

134
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:08,360
would you like some pumpernickel
wife just made it, oh,

135
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:10,480
let's get them out of the house. Uh,
they seem to be a little restless.

136
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,820
That's fucking nuts. Oh, what an
ugly period. Um, the cake, like,

137
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:21,260
you know, like it's not, I'm prepared now,
but you know, it's less ugly. All right,

138
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:23,390
let's continue. Okay. The
cake walk was similar.

139
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,720
It was a bald ball held for the slaves.
Couples promoted, promulgated, sorry,

140
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:33,020
through the ballroom,
bowing deeply and frequently.

141
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,270
Chins and noses held highly a loft.
If you're going to tell me,

142
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:41,810
they finally gave him a fucking party
and they still were assholes about it.

143
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,430
The couple who performed
the best interpretation of
how the white folks did it

144
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,490
want a cake baked one imagines by a slave.

145
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,130
I, I didn't imagine that
stuff. Words in my mouth.

146
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,250
I would figure the white people after
all that fucking time. But yeah, I mean,

147
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:02,670
you know what, uh, consider
we ruined their fucking lives.

148
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,260
I think we can make
them a cake once a year,

149
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,880
but we're only given it to one of them.
Jesus crave time.

150
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,550
You think you've found the depths
of how evil that shit was. He,

151
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,200
you find another layer. True. Oh my
God. Another layer. Just like a cake.

152
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,210
Jesus. I'm an artist this morning. All
right. The cake walk looks similar,

153
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,370
but it was also very different.

154
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,240
It's intent was to emulate white
society in order to market or the Jesus,

155
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,170
there's a dangerous fucking gave me,

156
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:36,171
I told you this is like the first def
jam comedy and much the same way as

157
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,080
yeah.

158
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,913
Oh Jesus Christ.

159
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,720
Saturnalia the ancient Rome
winters solstice festival.

160
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,100
Oh yeah, exactly. Watching
the same fucking way, uh,

161
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,330
where the rules of some of social order
were turned upside down in the slaves

162
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:56,380
and laborers became the rulers
and Matt and masters attended

163
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,280
attend their servants.
Oh they did this in Rome.

164
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,463
Okay,

165
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,610
this is just all fucking weird.

166
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,790
Can you imagine the tension during that?
So then the master's fucking

167
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,030
tended to the slaves and you know, the
slaves wanted to be just as fucking mean.

168
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:18,841
But then they were like,

169
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:21,690
well we got to kind of aggregate around
this shit cause it goes back to the

170
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:25,650
regular way tomorrow. And then I would
think the master be like, alright,

171
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,300
you want me to wade into that
sea of hatred towards me?

172
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,440
Um, uh, just keep an eye on me.
Please stay tight. Okay. Bye.

173
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:41,830
A itch the left side of my nose, that
means a, I'm fearing for my life. Uh,

174
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:46,831
the slaves involved did indeed mark
the ridiculously refined customs of the

175
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:51,270
aristocracy. Yes. And they surely
meant it. But during the cakewalk,

176
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,010
yeah,

177
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,020
they were allowed to mock them.

178
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,010
And by ruling over even the very event
that should undermine his authority,

179
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:05,160
the plantation owners, it to assert
is at 30. You know something?

180
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:07,860
I was in such a fucking good mood.
I hate this shit.

181
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,350
Yeah,

182
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,020
it's a fucking cake walk while you
know what I already clicked off.

183
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,730
So how does that mean?
It's easy.

184
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,410
What does that mean?
It's, it's a cheap laugh

185
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,140
and all I got to go back.
I gotta I just closed the fucking window.

186
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,083
I've got to go back and,

187
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,020
okay,

188
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,810
so how the fuck did that become?
That does not sound easy to me.

189
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,450
Being a slave all year and then doing one.

190
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,660
Do you get to do one fucking day where
you get to make fun of this? The master?

191
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,150
It's not a cakewalk and
struck a difficult. Right.

192
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,373
Okay.

193
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,491
All right.

194
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:46,810
As if its roots in slavery don't make
the cakewalk racially charged enough.

195
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,150
It transitioned in the minstrel show.

196
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,650
Yeah.

197
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,650
How did it transition into meaning
something easy of the Jim Crow era or even

198
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,610
are even worse? Um,
God was even the power.

199
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:01,940
A lot of to the slaves too

200
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,740
by the mark and just have the
original cakewalk in stage.

201
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:08,840
Reproductions of balls of the balls.

202
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:13,841
White performers in black face performed
as blacks who made sincere clumsy

203
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:18,020
attempts at emulating whites
out of a desire to be like them,

204
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,920
not to undermine them. Ah,
okay. And then it became that.

205
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,610
I still don't understand why it's easy.
The original cakewalk

206
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,750
walks being local affairs.
How that, you know what? Fuck
the fucking Internet. Yeah.

207
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,070
All right.
Can I fast forward to this?

208
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,090
Yeah.

209
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,680
Oh God.
He used the word apparently.

210
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:46,820
Yeah.

211
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,390
There's no other word. Alternative comics
like to use more than that apparently.

212
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,130
All right.
Clumsy attempt.

213
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,360
So I thought the original cake walks
for being local affairs held in the

214
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,370
confines of the set southern plantation,

215
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:02,680
the minstrel shows traveling as a matter
of course, it was later interpretation.

216
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,270
They became just find the concepts of
the rest of the country in the world.

217
00:13:05,271 --> 00:13:08,810
And what you could describe perhaps a
deep desire to stop being so incredibly

218
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:11,390
racist,
American societies of all the banner,

219
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,670
the racial basis of the
cakewalk in favor of,

220
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,290
it's simply describing something so
easy that just walking could yield the

221
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,600
reward of a cake. There. It is.

222
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,300
The definition is still vaguely racist.

223
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,070
Okay.

224
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,240
It isn't racist if you think the
definition means it's going to be easy.

225
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:34,570
You're not even being remotely vaguely
racist. You just don't know the history,

226
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,443
right?

227
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,350
Yeah. Jesus Christ. All right, well
there's that was fucking depressing. Um,

228
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,350
well, fortunately I'm up here
in Canada where, you know,

229
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,180
they have all the angelic white people
according to Michael Morrison, you know,

230
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:56,470
up here, they're all a bunch of angels
that nobody has to lock the doors. Uh,

231
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,560
what's your costs? We don't, that's
true. Just generally speaking,

232
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:01,290
people don't get along with
one another. Um, all right,

233
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,780
so that was an excruciating 15 minutes.
I don't know how you guys enjoyed it.

234
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,840
So anyways, kind of fuck,
did I get onto that shit?

235
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,050
Oh, because yeah, I taught the whole, um,

236
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,560
I thought the,
uh,

237
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,440
I taught this whole trip was going
to be a muffin dance about that.

238
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:25,740
Can I say something like that and say,
ah,

239
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,580
that was going to be a little
muffin dance. Did you know that?

240
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:31,170
The origins of Moffat dance.

241
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,480
Okay.

242
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,430
Um, you actually are pro domestic
violence. I bet you didn't.

243
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,980
Surely you've heard the term muffin
dance before. Please, please,

244
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:46,410
please don't tell me you have not.

245
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,380
Yeah.

246
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,380
The origin of Muffin dance
comes from the early 19 hundreds

247
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,170
when women,
when they asked can we vote to,

248
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,380
were forced to show their clams and
dance out of the voting booths as people

249
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,050
through desserts at the,
uh,

250
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,060
this became known as the muffin dance
because clam indicated that their pussy

251
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:16,610
stunk and turn men off.

252
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,620
Later in 1929,
the great,

253
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,010
great grandson of Abraham Lincoln said,
I cannot tell a lie.

254
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,250
Some of these bitches clamps to stink,

255
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,700
but there's still reason to
make them do a muffin. Dads,

256
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,680
they should be allowed to vote to, and
all the guys said, yeah, you know what?

257
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,900
You're right.
And everybody had muffins.

258
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,100
So next time you use
the term muffin dance,

259
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,920
just know that you're being
vaguely sexist. Um, okay.

260
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,940
All right. I'm sorry. Why am I doing
this? Why am I talking like this?

261
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:56,320
Why of why am I sitting here in this
fucking freezing cold hotel room?

262
00:15:56,321 --> 00:16:00,290
I can't find where the fucking heat is.
I'm saying in one of these um,

263
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,030
red rum.
Um,

264
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,003
yeah.

265
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,710
Well just one of those, you know, I like
old shit to a point, you know, I like,

266
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,110
I thought I liked having an old house
until I fucking had to deal with it.

267
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,050
Oh, all the bullshit of how on in an
old house, old hotels, I kind of like,

268
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:23,050
I loved the lobbies, but the second
you fucking go up to your room,

269
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:24,610
you start walking down the hall.
You know,

270
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:27,700
you feel like you should be riding a big
wheel and you're going to come around

271
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:31,630
the corner and those too creepy fucking
chicks are going to be standing there.

272
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,293
Yeah.

273
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,320
God Damn it. That fucking movie freaked
me out. That would be still got,

274
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,300
it's still disturbing. That's just a
disturbance fucking movie, you know.

275
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,760
And it's not the fact that he
goes completely fucking insane.

276
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:49,761
It's just as a comedian watching the man's
suffering through writer's block like

277
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:53,550
that, and having that woman
coming up who's face is
shaped like a fucking parking

278
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:57,450
meter, asking you how it's
going every fucking 20 minutes.

279
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,730
I love how they blame the
fucking hotel rather than that,

280
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,610
you know? What would
you say she means? Well,

281
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,890
yeah, they just were a bad couple.
I think that that's what it was.

282
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:14,450
And when they were down in society,

283
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,780
they could go to events and
they could sort of watered down.

284
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,420
They're awful relationship
by interacting with others.

285
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,670
And then once they just got,
you know,

286
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,410
yeah,

287
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,330
let's say would just stand there
at the fucking hotel, you know,

288
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:29,470
for the whole goddamn winter.

289
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,580
I don't understand why they had to be
there to watch it. You know what I mean?

290
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,860
Like what do you, what are you going to
be doing up there? I mean it's, it's some,

291
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:43,060
it's the level with which said,
it's gonna fucking snow. No asshole.

292
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,140
He's going to go up there and vandalize
the place if they come there because

293
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,220
they need shelter.
It was really no reason

294
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,440
for it,
you know?

295
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,850
And that was also a vaguely
racist movie, wasn't it? Yeah.

296
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,543
Yeah.

297
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,830
Saying that reverse racist, that
white people will be like, oh yeah.

298
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:08,150
Oh the fucking snow's 50 feet
in the fucking air. Oh yeah,

299
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,930
I got to write a book. Yeah. Why
don't I fuck it. Go up there.

300
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,010
Y'All hang out there and I'll, I'll do
my own room service every fucking day.

301
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,080
I'll stay in room fucking
706 in everyday.

302
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:24,290
I'll take a fucking elevator all
the way downstairs to the kitchen.

303
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,760
How, who the fuck would sign up for that
free? You didn't have any separately for

304
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,043
yeah,

305
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,200
I'm just fucking with you.
I think it's a great movie.

306
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:39,440
I'm just in a grumpy goddamn moved
cause today I get to drive from fucking

307
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,060
Ottawa all the way up to Sudbury.

308
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:46,380
And then right after this show
I got my travels all fucked up.

309
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,270
I drive over to fuck Detroit,
which is like a fucking eight hour drive.

310
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,203
You know,

311
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,080
it takes me back to the days when I was
doing college kicks and I remember one

312
00:18:57,081 --> 00:19:00,860
time I had this gig in the upper
peninsula of Michigan, right.

313
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,900
Some fucking town up there.
The began with an h. All right,

314
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:09,050
so like an asshole. I'm like, all right,

315
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,080
I'm in Michigan and I didn't
look on the map to see where,

316
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,703
uh,

317
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:16,710
okay

318
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,570
to see where, you know, basically the
fucking college was at and I just,

319
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,630
I just flew right into fucking Detroit
and then I realized that the upper

320
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:30,540
peninsula as actually it's sort of,
you know,

321
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,310
it's the Dick of Wisconsin.

322
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,020
I should have flown into
fucking Milwaukee and driven up,

323
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,940
but I didn't,

324
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,940
I flew into Detroit and I had to go drive
all the way all up the whole fucking

325
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:52,200
state. It was pretty cool cause I got to
drive over to whatever bridge that is,

326
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,540
the MACKINAC bridge or
whatever the fuck it is.

327
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:58,200
I'm trying to look it up right now, but
I can't remember the name of the fucking,

328
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,460
I think it was Marquette. Oh, you
said it began with an age maybe.

329
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,520
I was thinking Lake Huron.
I think it was in Marquette.

330
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,010
I did a fucking gig up there.
Yeah. And I had like a,

331
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,060
I forget what time my flight was,
but I had to basically,

332
00:20:15,061 --> 00:20:16,880
it was an early morning flight in Detroit.

333
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,950
It was like a fucking eight hour
drive or some shit, seven hour drive.

334
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,370
And the show didn't start till nine I
was done at 10 o'clock and I'd like a six

335
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:30,330
or 7:00 AM flight. I can't remember.
And I just, I was just like, you know,

336
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:32,040
all right.
Goodnight everybody.

337
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,370
And I jumped in my fucking car and
just drove like a fucking lunatic after

338
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,370
already having done the drive,
drove all the way back,

339
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:43,720
just like nodding off.

340
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:48,130
Almost falling asleep is
one of the dumbest things I
ever did just to save like

341
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:51,130
the fucking $50 change for
you or some shit like that.

342
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:53,980
So you would think that
I would learn from that.

343
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,450
Not all freckles,
but this time we actually have a,

344
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:03,220
again like Barnett and you to help me
with the fucking drive. Oh my God, Dude.

345
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:04,750
Sudbury is,

346
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:06,520
yeah.

347
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,260
Yeah.
It's as high up as fucking,

348
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,690
okay.

349
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,980
The upper peninsula.
Michigan.

350
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,930
What a fucking ass off for some
reason they're going. Yeah,

351
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:15,670
there's no really no airports around here.

352
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,540
I don't know why we didn't just take
a couple of puddle jumper so I have no

353
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,030
fucking, oh, I know why. I know why.

354
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,570
Initially I was picking up a rental car
in Detroit and I was going to drive this

355
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,610
whole thing and then at the
last second they like, you know,

356
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:29,110
it's a pretty long fucking drive.

357
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,250
So I said I will fly most of it and
then we'll do the thing, you know,

358
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,490
then we'll get the rental car, I'll
get the rental car and fucking Ottawa,

359
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,570
blah blah blah. We'll do it one way. But
then I was still leaving out of Detroit.

360
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:44,350
This is so fucking stupid.
Oh this is going to suck.

361
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,150
But anyways, what will be,
because tonight I'm playing a,

362
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,730
a small like a hockey arena and a,

363
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,660
I was going to be great.
Ask Him fucking good time.

364
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:00,460
I played one of those last night
here in Ottawa, Yellow Silk Center,

365
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,270
whatever the fuck it was called.
Uh,

366
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,120
anyways, this isn't what the
fuck I wanted to talk about.

367
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,180
I have something else I want,
I want to talk about.

368
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,690
I gotta read the fucking advertising here.

369
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:13,120
I know this podcast is all over the place.
Okay.

370
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,150
I can't say it's a
fucking cake walk anymore.

371
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,170
Can't say a cake walk anymore because now
I know it's fucking racist. All right,

372
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,080
well actually I go, I can't say it to you
guys, but I could say it somewhere else.

373
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,831
You know who's kidding?

374
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:27,580
Who I'm going to say I'm going to say
it cause I've been saying it my whole

375
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:30,750
fucking life. You know,
it's just going to cut that.

376
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,890
That's how you've looked at
how you become an old person.

377
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,410
Where someone's going like grandpa.
Do you know the origin of that? Oh,

378
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:43,150
shut up your first year. Freshman.
All right. Fucking concept.

379
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,520
Been around 80 years.
Stop breaking my balls.

380
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:47,090
If I'm going to say 23 Skidoo Goddamn.

381
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,860
And I've got to say you do you want
me to cue you almost kill your fucking

382
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:55,690
grandfather. Tried to get them to stop
saying something. All right, let me,

383
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:58,470
let me get to the uh,
advertising here.

384
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:04,310
Oh yeah, we go, oh, the old trunk
club. Trunk Club. Everybody.

385
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,300
Do you hate going to the
mall? Sure. We all do.

386
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,550
You surely you've been to a mall.

387
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:14,550
Surely you're not going to sit
there and say you haven't. Um,

388
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:19,250
trunk club shopping takes forever
and no one has time for it. Well,

389
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:23,240
people who enjoy it too, they
live for it. Let's go shopping.

390
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,490
Eagle is fucking dopes.

391
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
It just go down and they would sit
there and look at outfits, you know,

392
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,970
never once putting their ear up to the
shirt and hearing the crying child that's

393
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,720
sewed it together.
You know,

394
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,580
throwing out their old fucking clothes
just end up in the ocean or in some

395
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:44,900
hipsters back who pretends he
had the job you had. Right. Um,

396
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,010
shopping. You know, I used to always drop
off clothes at goodwill. Who's kidding?

397
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,340
Who I still do. And I thought it went to
fucking homeless people and it doesn't,

398
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:54,950
it just goes right on their racks and
they've turned around and they sell them,

399
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,350
which makes me feel good knowing that
they don't end up in a goddamn ocean.

400
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,493
Right.

401
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,850
I anyways,
and now it's spring.

402
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:08,380
So you need pastel polos and boat shoes.
Right.

403
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,860
And it'd be nice to have your
own personal stylist too.

404
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:16,680
I think that it has to be a joke.
Nobody needs pastel polos and boat shoes.

405
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,140
I think that those should only be
for the upper 1% of this country.

406
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,123
You know what I mean?

407
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,600
It's for the Robert Baron's in their
date rape his children, you know,

408
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,350
and they can walk around and what'd be
great is you make an exclusive for them.

409
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,710
So they'll feel like, oh, look
at us. We are a cut above.

410
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,120
It'll be like a status symbol.

411
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,920
But really what it is is it's a warning
for anyone that dates their children.

412
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:48,060
You know what I mean? It was set out,
have aware wearing the scarlet a,

413
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,350
that euro whore. You just have those
pastel colors. Just be like, you know,

414
00:24:52,351 --> 00:24:55,380
it gives,
it gives the ladies a little heads up.

415
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:00,210
You know that there's going to be a
sense of entitlement coming at him with a

416
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,440
heart on, right? You've got to give
him the fucking heads up. Jesus Christ,

417
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,630
which is trying to do my part here,
right?

418
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,420
Let me pour out a little wine
cooler for Edith Wharton here. Um,

419
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,080
and it'd be nice to have your own
personal style is too with trunk club.

420
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,830
You don't ever have to set a foot in a
store and you get your very own stylist

421
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:26,850
for free. Make it easy to look your
best and clothes that fit you perfectly.

422
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,880
Can't check by your own personal stylist
for free with Trunk Club. Go to trunk

423
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,040
club.com/bird type in your measurements,

424
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,880
share your likes and dislikes and you
get your very own personal stylist.

425
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,590
A, they'll pick your clothes
from milk now. Oh my God,

426
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:45,030
this is a muffin dance right here.

427
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,220
They'll pick your clothes from over 80
top brands and ship them right to you.

428
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:52,510
Do A,
you keep what you like.

429
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,560
Can you send back what you don't
and the trunk a trunk club.

430
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,970
You know they're going to fucking
send these close to some maniac. Okay.

431
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,970
Some serial killer. Cause you know,
they don't like to go to malls either.

432
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,860
Unlisted trolling for victims.
Right?

433
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,160
And what's gonna happen is they're going
to get confused and they're going to go,

434
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,300
you know, you know, which
is the fucking, the, uh,

435
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:15,330
I don't like this shirt
trunk in which is the one,

436
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,220
this stuff in the body and they're going
to fucking throw a bunch of shirts in

437
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:23,190
the bottom of a lake and they're going
to send a body back to trunk club.

438
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:27,150
I'm calling that right now,
calling that right now.

439
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,890
Then they're going to do a first 48
about it. But when this truck showed up,

440
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,990
they couldn't understand why they shirts
smelled so bad. I'm sorry. That's bad.

441
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,140
Trunk Club is not just another way to
shop online. It isn't. Your style is,

442
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:46,010
takes the time to your unique,
your unique look. Okay.

443
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,413
If you live in,

444
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,600
it's just so funny about that.

445
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:55,330
I was just picturing somebody standing
in a mirror looking at themselves,

446
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,830
trying to figure out, they look, you know,

447
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,470
you know that little thing where you
have your hands on your hip and then you

448
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:00,940
stick one foot in front of the other.

449
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,220
Like you're a horse answering a
question because you want some oats. Um,

450
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:10,590
and if you live in Dallas, Do York,
Los Angeles, Chicago and DC. Uh,

451
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:15,591
you can stop by one of the trunk club
club houses to work with your stylist in

452
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:18,760
person for free.
Now wait a minute.

453
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:23,450
I thought the whole point was
not to go to a fucking store. Um,

454
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,840
trunk club is not as subscription service.
There's no monthly fee.

455
00:27:26,841 --> 00:27:29,240
This is what I like here.

10 days to try to try on the clothes.

457
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,510
Risk free. What are you putting
it off? Like a term paper.
Oh God, I gotta try that.

458
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,650
Sure enough. Make a statement at the
next big events on your calendar.

459

just for you and your style. Mike,

460
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:50,310
what are you trying to say?
I'm trying to stay on Metairie.

461
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,500
Rapists were quite pastel colors.

my voice is a lot of out of it.

467
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,340
I've been screaming at my jokes
for three nights in a row. Oh God.

Boudou do do me undies.

473
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,190
Me On the skating down the fucking
canals here in fucking Ottawa.

474
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,290
You're on the canal.
You wearing your Randy's with your power.

475
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,540
Both your balls are really fucking dry.

476
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:45,470
In fact it getting really chafe
cause it's cold. You me on these.

477
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,040
We'll keep him warm. Alright
me undies. By the way,

478
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,830
if you have escaped the canal out here,
I've always been afraid to do it.

479
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,410
You know I, I've done it, but
I was nervous when I did it.

480
00:28:54,411 --> 00:28:57,590
I just kept thinking about the omen
like I was going to fall through and

481
00:28:57,591 --> 00:29:00,890
everyone's going to be hacking at
the ice trying to get me out again.

482
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,350
The canals only a foot deep, you
know, it's really no big deal.

483
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,220
So worst thing that could happen
is you could get severe frostbite.

484
00:29:10,221 --> 00:29:14,630
They have to remove both your
feet like in that movie misery.

485
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,460
Um, well in the movie she just
fucking breaks his ankles in the book.

486
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:21,050
She cuts off his fucking feet.

487
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:22,220
Yeah.

488
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,380
I love when they do shit like
that and it's just like, okay,

489
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:28,340
so you've severed a major artery and this
guy somehow doesn't bleed out in a bed.

490
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,200
Cause let me guess. You tied your
fucking belt around his calf.

491
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:34,440
Yeah.

492
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,850
Does that even work by the way?

493
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,500
If somebody fucking did you see the
fucking redneck that blew his God damn leg

494
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,940
off?
Oh my God,

495
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,750
there's this new fucking thing
that rednecks are doing, you know,

496
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,240
cause they just love shooting
stuff and blowing stuff up.

497
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:52,570
And as much as people you know,

498
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,140
who don't have their own spread
living in the middle of nowhere,

499
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,590
judge them somewhere in the back
of your head. You know, it's fun.

500
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,170
Yeah.

501
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,750
You know,
riding around on a fucking four wheelers,

502
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:09,340
shooting a gun on your own
fucking property. You know,

503
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,270
it's got to feel great. That's a level
of freedom that I, I've never heard,

504
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,740
I've never felt, you know, I live in
the city where there's noise ordinances,

505
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,420
you know, which basically noise on
my property should not carry over.

506
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,590
Like you can basically call the cops
if somebody splash around that pool too

507
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,580
loud.
He's marketing the fact I don't have one.

508
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,740
Um, the cops go over there and he
just started beating people, right?

509
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,440
Or air quote, getting the
situation under control. Um,

510
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,510
Christ, what the fuck was I just talking
about? Oh yeah. Riding around, you know,

511
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,700
so I watched this,
this new thing that they do,

512
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,730
they take this some sort of explosives
and they put it in these old cars and

513
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:59,341
then hopefully they stand far enough
away and the fucking thing blows up.

514
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,070
Well this fucking guy,
right?

515
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:05,530
Redneck blows.

516
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:09,820
Look at this shit right here it goes.
Redneck blows himself up,

517
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:14,440
blows up house,
blows himself up in a bonfire,

518
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,670
blows up pigs almost blows his head off.

519
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,900
This is such redneck stuff.
Stupid redneck blows himself up.

520
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,580
A fire blows up,
blows himself up.

521
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,520
Boat Motor blows up.

522
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,740
Fucking rednecks at crazy blows leg off

523
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:41,080
and see where is it?
Come on. All right. Yup.

524
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,770
And an American gun enthusiasts,
a yet to throw American in there.

525
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,980
American Georgia man loses leg effort,

526
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,550
explosive filled lawn mower.

527
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,510
Um, I will link you this. You
don't see his leg blow off,

528
00:31:56,511 --> 00:31:58,880
but you blow blow off his body.

529
00:31:58,881 --> 00:32:03,470
But yet this guy basically it's called,
uh,

530
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,480
I hope I say it right Tanner,
right?

531
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,560
It's some sort of explosive in the new
thing that these rednecks do is they

532
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,394
fucking

533
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,330
okay.

534
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,790
He fucking, uh, you know,

535
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:18,130
you put it in whatever
vehicle in order to,

536
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,210
it's really what's going on here with
these rednecks are starting to be a little

537
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:25,890
more classy, you know, after
all these fucking years of, uh,

538
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,200
you know, having a car die, they
just leave it on their front lawn.

539
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,030
Now they're getting rid of it.
They're blowing them up.

540
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:36,720
So they put this Tanner right over the
fuck you said it's just explosive and

541
00:32:36,721 --> 00:32:39,940
there's some sort of formula
like basically forever, forever.

542
00:32:39,941 --> 00:32:43,940
You such and such amount,
you need to be like a hundred feet back.

543
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,110
All right, so let's say whatever,
what it will just say this guys,

544
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,040
if he's got a handful of
this fucking Tanner out, God,
we're doing math now, Bill.

545
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,210
All right. And he needed, he basically
needed to be about like, I don't know,

546
00:32:56,211 --> 00:33:00,140
500 feet back and he was 40
feet away from this lawn mower.

547
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,390
Any fucking shoots the shit.
Right? He fucking shoots it

548
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:07,850
and uh,

549
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,650
yeah,

550
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,090
he blows the fucking thing up.

551
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,950
Alright,
listen to this shit.

552
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,220
Yeah, there are some had to do their
fucking written Dj remix of it.

553
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,840
Anyways, he shoot it and
he's shooting the lawnmower.

554
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:27,630
She all of a sudden fucking blows up and
then he's on the ground and you see it.

555
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,500
You just, you can't see
anything. You just, it, the
camera's pointing at the ground.

556
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,000
He just hear him go,
I blew my leg off.

557
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,210
Fucking unbelievable. I'm amazed
that he could actually say that.

558
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,470
I would just be staring at the
stop going. Ah, okay. I mean,

559
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,720
what am I, he's got gotta tell
that story for the rest of,

560
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,960
at what point does that, can he laugh
along with everybody else? You know,

561
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,130
I bet he's considered like
a tragic, tragic figure now
in the redneck community.

562
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:05,320
You know, like he'll probably, you know,

563
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:08,260
at the next cross burning the,
they let him late it,

564
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,620
he hobbles up and everybody
gives him a round of applies.

565
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,420
Like they're all fucking sad.

566
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,380
Like what happened to him with some
sort of a terrorist act rather than self

567
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:22,120
imposed fucking stupidity.
Jesus Christ. You know,

568
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,620
I feel bad for the guy,
but

569
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,870
yeah,

570
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,490
the fuck are you doing shooting a
goddamn gun at dynamite basically.

571
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:33,640
Whatever the fuck it is
in a God damn lawn mower.

572
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,300
Okay.

573
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,890
That's the fucking blade alone.
The shrapnel from that.

574
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,443
Okay.

575
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,640
I gotta look this shit up.

576
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,920

00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,690
Yeah.

581
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,770
Top 10 dumb ways to die.
Uh,

582
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,020
there's always the opening the elevator
doors before the elevator gets there and

583
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:14,580
not looking and then stepping in,
falling to your death,

584
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,940
playing with guns.

585
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:19,680
Yeah,

586
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,150
I don't fucking know I or t top
10 dumbest wasted day. Here we go.

587
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,570
All right.
Starving in a supermarket.

588
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,110
I don't even want to read that one.
Diving off a cliff,

589
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:35,810
but survive but die of shock from the
high price of your hospital bill. Oh,

590
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:40,180
Jesus Christ. Uh, Jesus.

591
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,230
Okay.

592
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,920
I don't need the hacky jokes.
I have plenty of those come on.

593
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,870
10 absolute dumbest wasted day.

594
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,123
All right.

595
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,370
Oh for this is all going
to be clickbait horse shit.

596
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,790
Okay. You know what? Go Fuck Yourself.

597
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,730
You guys should be dying right now
waiting for me to read this shit.

598
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,880
Trying to kiss a reflection
of the moon in a lake.

599
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:05,820
Yeah.

600
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,310
All right. Somebody died doing that
and then I got to click another page.

601
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,940
You know what I mean?

602
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,850
Once he can have advertising on every
fucking page and somehow you can fucking

603
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:15,570
afford Twinkies this month.
Go Fuck Yourself. All right,
so let's talk about the,

604
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,763
um,

605
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,080
yeah,

606
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,830
the tour year. So the first, the
first day we were in Windsor,

607
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,290
right across from Detroit and um,

608
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,630
it was awesome. Our upstairs is great
hotel and you could look right across the,

609
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,730
uh, what are the fucker was, I
guess it is in Lake Eerie, isn't it?

610
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,220
Yeah.

611
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,060
Is it just a river?

612
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:39,760
Yeah,

613
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,090
I dunno what the fuck you
call it. Is it a sound? Oh,

614
00:36:44,091 --> 00:36:44,980
the Detroit river.

615
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,210
And you see beautiful downtown Detroit
and Detroit never looks more beautiful

616
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:50,500
when you're not in Detroit.

617
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,440
When you crossed the fucking
river looking at it from Windsor.

618
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,430
And I just kept asking a bunch of
people like, cause I'm going to invest,

619
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,450
I'm going to buy something in Detroit.
I'm going to do it. God dammit. You know,

620
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,980
invest back in America.
I think I totally believe in that city.

621
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,360
I know it's going to come back.

622
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,770
And I was asking people where to fucking
invest and they would just all laugh.

623
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,370
And you're like about 40 miles north.
Like nobody believes in it,

624
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:19,240
which is what's making me want to
fucking buy. They're even more, you know,

625
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,890
it's fucking dirt.
Goddamn cheap.

626
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:23,620
It's going to come back at some
point and it has to come back.

627
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,980
Sit right there on the river.

628
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,280
I know the fucking Cleveland Cavaliers
guy bought up a bunch of fucking

629
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:33,020
skyscrapers there has gotta you know,

630
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,280
he put like the people from Google
and one of them, I have no idea,

631
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,110
but the shit is so cheap there. I don't,
I don't get how you fucking loose.

632
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,390
And I like the idea.
You go in there, right?

633
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,530
You fixed the fucking place up that you
buy and then you don't kick the people

634
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:51,800
out that live in there.
And then they got a nice place to live.

635
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,520
Right,
okay.

636
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,520
Maybe that gets them in a better mood.

637
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,950
Slowly but surely you just start turning
it around. I think any American, right,

638
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,930
what we should do with
these fucking cities,

639
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,060
cause God knows the government's
not going to do anything.

640
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:10,500
I don't think they can because it bitches
to the fucking Federal Reserve bankers.

641
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,790
Right. I don't have any fucking money.
They're robbing Peter to pay Paul.

642
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,110
So I think with whatever money they let
us keep, we ought to just don't fucking,

643
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:23,580
you know, fine up some shit
and Detroit, turn it around,

644
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:24,960
don't kick the people out,

645
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,250
get it.
Go on and get,

646
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,540
maybe then they can start making
American cars right again.

647
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:33,943
Okay.

648
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:36,260
Start fucking with the Audis.

649
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,100
And it's a fucking travesty that we
don't really have anything they can fuck

650
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:39,934
with those cars.

651
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,630
The fact that they're going to allegate
around the base level Cadillac,

652
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,200
the base level, Lincoln
continental, all right,

653
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,060
are going to pale in comparison to what
those maniacs in Germany are doing.

654
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,180
I mean, I don't understand why, you
know, you know, we can fucking do it.

655
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,280
I guess Buicks are selling like
fucking hotcakes. Is that a racist?

656
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,700
It's a racist thing. Anything we'd cakes
in that I think is racist. Hotcakes. Uh,

657
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,270
back in the day when they
were actually every 10 years,

658
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,770
let us slave of a birthday,

659
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,760
one of the things the slave owners would
do was actually heat up the cake so we

660
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:16,600
would burn and burn their mouths
because they were that evil.

661
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,680
Here's another chapter of white
evil that you didn't know existed.

662
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,810
Um,
selling like hotcakes.

663
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:28,930
I guess high kicks were pancakes back
in the day and you know, God damn well,

664
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,350
you know, having pancakes
must've been a fucking tree.

665
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,500
Cause I remember back when you
read The Times, Sawyer book, right?

666
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,940
Uncle Barry Fen is fucking kids
paint a fence just to get an apple.

667
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,640
Like that was considered like a treat

668
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,570
because all day long you would
just sitting around eating fucking,

669
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:49,960
I don't know if she went on shrubs,
I don't know what the fuck you doin.

670
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:55,450
So anyways, I'm, I want to buy there,
man. I want to buy something there and uh,

671
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:01,120
not become the fucking evil person that
boots the people out that are in their

672
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,130
need is fixed the fucking place
up. It gives a shit, you know,

673
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,060
that's of course the people in
there than fuck the whole place.

674
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:11,080
Something I would be upset,

675
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,190
you know how much that plastic because
it was trying to do something nice.

676
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,520
Um, whatever. Eventually I'm
going to look into that. Um,

677
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:24,550
so we did wait Wednesday and uh,
we had a great time and Rosie was there.

678
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:27,220
So of course I smoked a
cigar. So, you know, you know,

679
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:31,150
I only do two cigars a month now.
So last month I only smoked one.

680
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,470
February I had two and a half because
we started to smoke one and it wasn't

681
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:39,340
smoking well and we have got halfway
through and like this fucking cigar sucks.

682
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,730
So actually smoked two and a half.
So I smoked two in January.

683
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,940
I flicked it fucking rain man right now.
So then four and a half, five and a half.

684
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:52,240
So I'm actually half a cigar
under my goal for this year.

685
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:56,620
So April 1st and he's
already smoked a cigar.

686
00:40:56,621 --> 00:41:00,370
So now I can only have one more are
technically one and a half more.

687
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,530
But I'm actually going to try
and get down to one a month.

688
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,620
And to be honest with you,

689
00:41:05,621 --> 00:41:09,790
I'd Kinda like to go all the way to my
birthday in June and not smoke another

690
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:14,570
one. Alright. Uh, God damn.
And I enjoy him. I joined,

691
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,620
enjoy the fucking lifestyle.
I enjoy the whole fucking thing about it.

692
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,700
I love going in. I love picking
them out. I love the excitement.

693
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,480
I love the smell. I love the old
fucking chairs. You sit there.

694
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:29,890
I love that there's no fucking
young people there, you
know? And by young people,

695
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:33,980
I mean anybody 39 in younger, I
used don't run into, you know,

696
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,340
everybody's just chilling the fuck out.
Smoking a cigar.

697
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,140
I don't care what kind
of a maniac you work.

698
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,200
All these fucking kids that they put
on Ritalin and all this type of shit.

699
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:46,500
You just give these kids a cigar. Sam,
sit down, puff, you know the casino.

700
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,690
You just,
you thinking about.

701
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,140
Yeah.

702
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,810
Just think about how great life is.
December smoked a cigar.

703
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,920
That's how you start taking out.

704
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,000
Upgraded is graded as he
can enjoy the fucking day.

705
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,160
You start planning your retirement.

706
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,300
How the fuck are you going to get out
of this bullshit so you can just sit

707
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:09,590
around in whatever zen you've
somehow come into. I mean,

708
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,190
I swear to God,
if cigarettes make you feel like that,

709
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:16,760
I understand why people do that
shit. It's funny, but you know,

710
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:18,410
nonsmokers like myself,
you know,

711
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,640
I actually am a smoker now with
the fucking cigars, but um,

712
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,350
yeah,

713
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,880
yeah know he's always looked down on those
fucking people that smoke cigarettes.

714
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,590
They were huddled outside knowledge shit.

715
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,383
You know,

716
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,300
I don't know. Maybe, maybe they,
maybe they know something. I don't,

717
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,920
I'm not advocating smoking. I don't
know what I'm saying. By the way,

718
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,370
Canada, Windsor Airport, Jesus Christ.

719
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,140
What a fucking gem that is.
I love small airports.

720
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,470
There's nothing better than
that little ass fucking airport.

721
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:54,520
Then when I went to Toronto,
we flew into, we flew over, um,

722
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,470
the propeller plane. Jesus Christ. If
you sub Rosie walk into that, he's,

723
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,380
he's one of those guys. I don't, I
don't want give you sees propellers.

724
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,450
He feels like he's riding in like
a model t Ford, you know? Um,

725
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,910
I always just say to myself, oh, well,
it's, uh, it's gonna fly better. Well,

726
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:17,200
we have much less of a chance because
there's less working parts here for

727
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:21,640
something to go bad, you know?
I don't know. That's what
I tell myself. So anyways,

728
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,840
um, we went to Toronto. We didn't fly
into their nightmare of fucking airport.

729
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,560
We flew to the TR Toronto islands,
which I'd never heard of,

730
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,570
is a fucking little ass airport there.

731
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,730
We get picked up and we took a little
fairy, you know, it's fucking hilarious.

732
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,480
I crossed at Western channel.
It literally,

733
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,570
like we started to go and
I started videotaping it.

734
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:48,070
And by the time I pay and from out
my side window to the front window,

735
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:52,570
we had already gotten to cross it. You
get across it in like 30 seconds. Um,

736
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,630
or they have a tunnel, you can walk
underneath the western channel.

737
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,240
We did that on the way back. It's
a nice little ass airport. Um,

738
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,900
after all these years of traveling, I
love a little mom and pop airport, get in,

739
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,020
get the fuck out. It's
hilarious. She show up.

740
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,210
They still have the old
school metal detectors.

741
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,780
So you don't have to go through that
fucking radiation shower that for some

742
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:17,830
reason, I just don't understand
that. So to stop terrorism,

743
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:21,580
you're going to give all of
your countryman cancer. Well,

744
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:25,270
if we fucking kill everybody
who they gonna blow up.

745
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:31,220
Um, so anyways, how far into this
fucking town? 45 minutes. Um,

746
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:37,920
anyways, but these shows cannot, it cannot
have, uh, been going any better. And,

747
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:42,150
um, I've been working my
ass off in Los Angeles, um,

748
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,300
for a reason that I'm not allowed to
say yet for whatever fucking reason.

749
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:52,530
So I've been worried that I, I
can't, um, you know, I can't fucking,

750
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,080
uh, do standup as much as I'd liked, but
us, I've been doing a bunch of spots,

751
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,130
like little 10 minute spots trying to
see shap they just do a little bit of my

752
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:05,040
act. Even the jokes they here
to make judge fucking see it.

753
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,650
So you remember how it goes.
And um,

754
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:13,500
I could not be having more
fun up here, Matt. Just having
a fucking great time. Um,

755
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,730
just figuring out my act even figured
out this new way to trash women that like

756
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,050
in his fucking mean as they used to do it.

757
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,370
But I still get to make the same points,
so I just still come off, you know,

758
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,540
it was a complete fucking lunatic all
the time and I don't want to be that guy,

759
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,450
you know what I mean? As much, you know,

760
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,290
something I realized I never finished
reading the [inaudible] think that,

761
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,750
you know, okay. Whether you're
wearing a suit or sweats,

762
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,300
you spend almost 24 hours
a day in your underwear,

763
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:45,510
but instead of making a statement like
Superman's tights under his everyday

764
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:50,070
clothes, your underwear is probably
boring. We, and he's about to change that.

765
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,820
Oh yeah, they're, they're about ready
to take your balls to the next level.

766
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,540
They're going to go hang a little disco
ball. You know, it's called the third eye,

767
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,660
the third ball right now, if
you're fucking nuts, you know,

768
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:05,550
can you imagine her excited face when
she sees a disco ball hanging off the end

769
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:09,250
of your Dick? Right? She'd
probably get that checked. Uh,

770
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,380
please include all of the following.
No Mo modal is pronounced modal.

771
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,300
Every pair of me undies is made
from sustainable source modal,

772
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,770
modal fabric that's twice
as soft as cotton. Uh,

773
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,400
nothing can describe the fit and feel
of me undies, but once you try them on,

774
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:30,210
you understand why they're called the
world's most comfortable underwear.

775
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,800
Um, then if you don't love your first
pair of me undies, they're free.

776
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,910
No questions asked me.

777
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:40,110
And he says dozens of styles and limited
edition prints to help you make a

778
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:44,520
statement with your underwear.
Whether anyone could see them or not.

779
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,890
Remember Superman.
I don't like that joke.

780
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,290
I remember Superman worth that.
He's fighting Batman.

781
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:56,400
You know somebody on Worldstar hip hop,
one of my favorite fucking websites.

782
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:02,190
You know, why don't you
people funny veins, you know,

783
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,270
music that I am completely not even
aware of. I get to learn about that shit.

784
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,990
And then, uh, to some of the most fucking
insane fights you're ever going to see.

785
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,700
And there's always a tipping point when
you watch fights on Worldstar is there's

786
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,650
always the amazement and then
somewhere it just starts to become sad.

787
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,410
If you just start thinking,
what is wrong with human beings?

788
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:26,580
Why do we do this shit? Why can't we
just go out to a fucking McDonald's?

789
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,070
Or if I dance club,
you know,

790
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,040
and not have like a 50 on 55.

791
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,820
I do have to tell you the respect I have
for someone that actually would go into

792
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:44,260
one of those modern day
Braveheart fucking things. I mean,

793
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,450
I don't give a fuck how many martial
arts classes you've taken in your life.

794
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,910
There is nothing that they teach you in
those fucking classes other than to turn

795
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:55,960
around and run,

796
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,700
which you already know how to do when
you get in the middle of a fucking Malay

797
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:04,390
like that. It's just
inevitable. The fucking odds,

798
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,041
you know,

799
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:09,790
that's the fight version of being like
the helicopter gunner in Vietnam where

800
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:14,350
they had like a fucking a life expectancy
of two fucking weeks. It's just,

801
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,030
you're just standing there and you
know it's going to happen. All right?

802
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,880
You're going to, you're going to,
something's going to fucking hit you.

803
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:26,881
You're going to get knocked out and I
have to tell you the influence of MMA on

804
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,670
these fucking street fights.
Now, back in the day,

805
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:33,670
I seem to remember when you
knock somebody out, that was it.

806
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,760
You didn't sit on their chest and throw
another 40 punches to their head wedding

807
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:42,610
for big John to come over and fucking,
you know,

808
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,990
usher you out of there. There's
no ref, that fucking shit.

809
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,570
We already knock somebody out and
then your boot him in their head.

810
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:54,610
I mean at that point that's like
attempted murder man. You want,

811
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,490
you're knocked him out. He'd
come up, you can do this.

812
00:48:57,491 --> 00:49:00,250
You sit on that chess and do
a fucking speed back then.

813
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,970
Fucking brutal. But anyways,
you know these me undies,

814
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,810
I'm going to get through this shipping

816
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,010
you know it's like a
fucking end zone dance.

817
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:20,650
I always thought it was cooler when
you fucking just scored a touchdown.

818
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:23,230
You flip the ball to the ref like yeah,

819
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:25,870
I'm going to be doing this all day
if you knock somebody out. Yeah.

820
00:49:25,871 --> 00:49:27,850
He just turned around like yeah,
my job's done here.

821
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:32,380
You walk away like Clint Eastwood,
one of those drifter movies, you know,

822
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,880
you sit on that to like,

823
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:38,140
you fucking just kind
of spazz out screaming.

824
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,550
What did I tell you bitch?

825
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,830
You know with your voice goes up nine
octaves when your voice goes up like nine

826
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:45,641
octaves like that.

827
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:50,320
You kind of portray your Badass and
thus he kinda is ye here a level of

828
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:55,270
excitement? Like, oh my God,
I can't believe I won. That's
what I always hear. Um,

829
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,030
having said that, I wouldn't want
to fight anybody in those videos

830
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,810
and it's not even the fact
that I knew I would lose.

831
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,740
I just know that after I was knocked out,
you do irreparable plucking.

832
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:09,520
I can't even say the word brain damage,
which is unnecessary.

833
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:13,210
If I could brain damage, you're knocked
me up. You want, I'm laying there.

834
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,580
Okay. My hands are pointing
out into outer space. Um,

835
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:19,900
uh, knocked out. You know,

836
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,800
what are you going to go there
and knock my melon around and um,

837
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,500
if I was running for president, I
would bring that up. I see in America,

838
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,600
that goes back to when
you knock somebody out,

839
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,750
you walk away like Clint Eastwood
in a Spaghetti Western. Uh, alright.

840

Shipping is free in the U S and Canada

You'll get a free month of the executive
razor when you buy a tube of Dr

849
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:11,420
Carver's. Easy Shave. But I've seen Kawis.

850
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,760
All right cause that's how I been seeing,
even though it's carvers,

851
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,530
I like seeing [inaudible] and I'm
a big fan of Dana Carvey. Alright,

852
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,350
so there you go.

853
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:22,480
This is the first time they've ever done
something like this and once you trade

854
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:23,690
dollars,

856
00:51:26,511 --> 00:51:29,930

amazing reasons right to your door for a

857
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:33,620
third of the price of what the
Gri razor corporations charge.

858
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,750
That means when you

862
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:50,180
your wallet. What is
the executive blade? Um,

863
00:51:50,181 --> 00:51:55,181
another reason is their Dr Carver's
easy shave butter using it with the

864
00:51:55,551 --> 00:52:00,200
executive makes the bleed glad
gently for the smoothest shave ever.

865
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,490
Dr Carver's shave butter isn't
your average shave cream.

866
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:08,180
It's a unique conditioning formula
with high quality natural ingredients,

867
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:12,110
leaving your skin unbelievably
soft and smooth. And right now,

868
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,780
new members who buy a
tube of the shave butter,

869
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,250
get the executive razor for free.
You know,

870
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,960
like they'd never done
anything like this before.

871
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,570
So take advantage of it before
they come to their senses.

872
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:27,140
And it's only available by going
to dollar shave club.com/bar.

873
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,320
That's dollar shave club.com/bar hey
dollar shave club.com/berm alright,

874
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:37,820
stamps.com everybody chips to that. This
is the last one, mercifully alright.

875
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:41,150
stamps.com trips to the post
office are never convenient.

876
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:44,030
While if you don't like your wife,
they've fucking great.

877
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,740
You know what I'm going to walk.

878
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:52,820
So why not get postage right from your
desk with stamps dot coms downside calm

879
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:57,440
even gives you special postage discounts
she can't get at the post office,

880
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:01,670
including FirstClass priority mail
express international and more.

881
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,490
You'll never pay full price for postage.

882

886
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:24,920
No wonder have a 600,000 small businesses
are already using stamps.com I use

887
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:28,320
stamps.com whenever I send out one of my
fucking posters. You know, it's funny,

888
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,450
I have a poster for this,
this tour,

889
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,750
the plowing ahead tour and it was
an old telly Savalas movie poster,

890
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,180
right?
And you know,

891
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:42,900
I spent all this money having this guy
do the whole thing up and we had the

892
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:46,620
whole fucking tagline on it. You
know, it looks like an action movie.

893
00:53:46,621 --> 00:53:49,530
Like I'm sitting there, but he was
telly Savalas was holding the gun.

894
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,270
I'm holding a microphone. We both
are baldheaded right? And, uh,

895
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,133
he had a casino.

896
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:58,020
Ali's should I have like a helicopter
and all this dumb shit that I'm fucking

897
00:53:58,021 --> 00:53:59,730
into,
so it looks like this action movie.

898
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:03,840
Then we had the all this fucking
just re, you know, silly shit.

899
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,320
Like they tried to internet porn,
they fished out the oceans,

900
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,520
but nothing could stop the
man with no answers. Right.

901
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,620
And then it was like this coming,
you know,

902
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:15,270
I was supposed to be at this movie poster,

903
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:18,450
so I don't think the
casinos understood it.

904
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,600
They took away all of the, uh, the,

905
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,590
the words, whatever the fuck
you call it, all the tax.

906
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:28,860
They took all of it away and they
just have this stand alone poster.

907
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,480
And now I just looked like a magician.

908
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,740
Like is he going to come in and the
helicopter and make a truck disappear?

909
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,210
Like it doesn't make any sense.

910
00:54:36,211 --> 00:54:40,260
And I spent all this fucking money on
it and most of them are just using my

911
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:42,990
poster for my last tour,
you know,

912
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,660
when I had with what's left of
my hair grown out in a beard.

913
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:50,340
So I don't even look the same as it's
been a shit show anyways. Right now,

B, u.

920
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,710
There you go. Was that for a beat?
I'm enough. I'm such a control freak.

921
00:55:19,711 --> 00:55:23,400
I can't even handle people who are given
me money telling me what the fuck did

922
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:28,230
do. Um, 55 minutes. All right.

923
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:31,110
This whole days get away from me having
been read any of the fucking questions

924
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,960
and I haven't even talked about the
Bruins, how we're one point out.

925
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,890
We beat St Louis and
then we lost to Chicago.

926
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,160
Um, of course they'd see any games
because I was fucking traveling.

927
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,040
Um, you know, it's funny,

928
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:52,050
I had like five or six country
Chicago fans talk and shit. You know,

929
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,890
it's so funny. Last time we played them,
we beat them. I don't talk any shit.

930
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,910
Do I talk any shit? No. Right? Hate
these fucking people eat these,

931
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:01,820
these whack them all fans that,
you know,

932
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,280
we could euros today than they ducked
back down. They're nowhere to be found.

933
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,380
You know when you fucking lose like
Chicago's gun and doing the playoffs,

934
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:13,740
you fucking
Goddamn cons.

935
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,490
I actually liked the Blackhawks had
fans like that make me fucking root root

936
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:20,820
against them. So anyways,
I'm coming up this week,

937
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,890
my Bruins, my beloved Bruins.
All right, we are playing.

938
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:31,400
Our next game is uh,
uh,

939
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,960
where the fuck is that? I
think we're playing to, no,
we played Carolina I believe.

940
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,820
I think we played Carolina next street.
I get the schedule right here.

941
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,590
Where is the schedule? All right,
we play Carolina on Tuesday.

942
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:49,630
It's at the TD bank,
north fucking Home Depot Garden.

943
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:53,320
Whatever the fuck they call it, the
Carolina and notoriously plays as tough.

944
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:57,550
They always match up well. It's always
a tough game. And then we have Detroit,

945
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,540
which is huge. They're one point
against the ahead of us on Thursday.

946
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:06,790
And then our last game is against
Ottawa on Saturday. All right.

947
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:10,390
So basically the two teams
in front of us are, uh,

948
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:16,150
Detroit and Philly both one
point ahead of us, I believe.

949
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,340
So the great thing is during this week,
Detroit in Philly play each other.

950
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,270
So no, I think Philly's a
few points they had. So I,

951
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,940
I'm just rude fulfilling to just when
the rest of the way out. Right. I,

952
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:32,470
I, at this point, I have
to root against Detroit.

953
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:36,550
I don't have anything against Detroit
other than their fucking country fans.

954
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,610
And they really are conti fence.
You know what I mean?

955
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,810
The funny thing about them is they don't
realize that they're run is over and

956
00:57:43,811 --> 00:57:47,230
that it's now all about Chicago and
La and they're wearing the crown.

957
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:48,000
You know what I mean?

958
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,180
For some reason Detroit is still living
off like an Aes Herman, you know,

959
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:56,380
I guess they won one last decade
to Oh, actually they went to, yeah,

960
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:01,060
but you can just see, you can see
it in Detroit. It's over. You know,

961
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:05,050
it's something that I'm
going to experience what
Brady and Bella Checker gone

962
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:08,200
and I'm going to be like, yeah, but
where are the Patriots? It's like, yeah,

963
00:58:08,201 --> 00:58:13,120
but they're gone and yeah,
they're wearing the same uniform,

964
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:16,660
but it's not the same. I'm fucking
with the, I actually love Detroit.

965
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:21,640
I love the franchise. I don't
like the fence. Um, you know,

966
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:26,500
and I've never been that way as I like
to think with all the success that I only

967
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:30,160
talk shit. If people give me shit.
That's how I try to be, you know,

968
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:33,550
I don't try to act like,
because my teams are successful.

969
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,400
That means somehow in my own
personal life, I'm a success.

970
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:40,880
Like some people do those. You know what
I'm really judging all black cocks in,

971
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,470
in Redwing fans, by half a dozen people,
which isn't fair. So, you know what,

972
00:58:44,471 --> 00:58:49,030
good luck to all you. And uh, I
hope to Bruins fucking pull it out.

973
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:49,631
And if we don't,

974
00:58:49,631 --> 00:58:54,280
we got no one to blame but
ourselves just fucking good Lord.

975
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,560
What a fucking sees it up, down,
up, down, up, down, up, down.

976
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,730
That's what the fuck is spent. Now. I
just need up for the last two, three up,

977
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:08,380
just fucking these three game winning
streak and no one will remember any of

978
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:12,430
this shit. Dead Shyness is sitting there
with the fucking hard on being like,

979
00:59:12,431 --> 00:59:15,430
I can finally write an article
about hockey that I understand.

980
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,640
Somebody blew it. Oh yeah, I can write
this off like in. Dang. All right,

981
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:26,090
let's get to the questions then. I gotta
get the fuck out of here. All right. Um,

982
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,020
the all star Cafe, uh,
on March 28 podcast,

983
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,040
you briefly mentioned you were regular
muncher and Nia was a waitress.

984
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:41,420
The old state, not the all star, uh,
bef from easy road all star up here.

985
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:46,421
And then I'll state before she got pink
slipped and now and now and the now

986
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:49,400
closed down Allstate cafe
on the upper west side.

987
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:53,090
I thought your listeners
might be intrigued to learn
that your meeting place was

988
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:58,091
also a meeting place for a young teacher
and her murderer in January of 1973

989
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:01,280
during a one night stand,

990
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:06,530
murdering a partner guarantees there ain't
no second night, right? Jesus Christ.

991
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:11,531
They didn't know that the grotesque
multi stabbing crime got so much infamous

992
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:13,700
publicity that the pub,

993
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:17,990
his name from the Wm
tweets to the Allstate,

994
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,230
the murderer inspired the
book and subsequent movies
starring the then scantily

995
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:26,690
clad Diane Keaton also.

996
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:30,200
Apparently Kevin Bacon had
once tended bar there too.

997
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:33,920
I wonder if they fired him also.
I didn't know that.

998
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:40,010
Jesus, that's fucking creepy. I don't
believe in ghosts or anything like that.

999
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,670
Not even remotely, but that type
of shit is just scary by the way.

1000
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:44,840
I love here in a body history,

1001
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,570
even as much as they fucking that
cakewalk thing I was trashed and that guy,

1002
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:49,940
I liked that type of shit.
I'm all right.

1003
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:53,510
Girlfriend bothered and annoyed
by sexy TV show character.

1004
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:56,630
Uh,
dear Billy blank balls.

1005
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,470
My girlfriend and I were recently
watching the new season of daredevil and,

1006
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,340
and we're enjoying it.
However,

1007
01:01:07,341 --> 01:01:11,210
one character electra
was introduced and uh,

1008
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:16,100
she bothered the hell out and
my girlfriend for a reference,

1009
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:18,290
Electra is this character that is sexy,

1010
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:21,770
provocative and an all
around Badass Ninja woman.

1011
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:26,300
Electra is also like a,
that weird sort of,

1012
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,870
isn't that that mythology
thing? What is the, uh,

1013
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,990
what is that weird fucking thing?

1014
01:01:34,430 --> 01:01:37,890
Isn't that where I'm aiming going
to say it because of I'm wrong.

1015
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:42,020
Asked to do with some sort of creepy
sexual relations within the family,

1016
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:45,770
doesn't it, you know, died her father.

1017
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:51,020
And then the other one is son, mother
with a son kills the doubt or some shit.

1018
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,760
It's just fucking weird when I see
those types of stories actually start

1019
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:57,560
believing in Adam and eve. Well, yeah,

1020
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:00,680
there was just two people and they
banged and then they had this incestuous

1021
01:02:00,681 --> 01:02:04,620
fucking horse shit for a couple of
generations until we fucked ourselves up.

1022
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,660
Maybe that did up and maybe that's why
the neanderthals and all like or whatever

1023
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,600
the, uh, the original cavemen, their
heads are all fucked up looking

1024
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:17,890
is because everyone was related.
Um, who the fuck knows? Anyways?

1025
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,670
She was a cool character,
but my girlfriend hated her.

1026
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:25,050
I noticed that it wasn't anything against
the characters since she couldn't tell

1027
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:28,080
me why she didn't like her
other than she just bothers her.

1028
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,620
Other people have told me that their
girlfriends slash wives are the same way

1029
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:34,500
with the electro when watching this
show with their significant other.

1030
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:39,090
I know it isn't just this character
because any female that is in a sexy,

1031
01:02:39,091 --> 01:02:43,530
Badass role, I have noticed
women specifically ones
with boyfriends don't like,

1032
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:44,371
uh,

1033
01:02:44,371 --> 01:02:48,420
is this just some kind of insecurity
women have that they really disliked their

1034
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:53,520
boyfriends? Seeing someone that may
be sexier than them? Um, well yeah,

1035
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:57,130
if you fucking put it that way, they're
going to be annoyed. Okay honey, you know,

1036
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:00,000
they see that girl look how much
sexier she is. Then, you know,

1037
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,790
when she watched his fight club,
you know,

1038
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:07,680
does she say how well fucking much
better or Brad Pitt's looking anyways.

1039
01:03:07,681 --> 01:03:11,700
Are they worried that this fictional
TV characters is going to steal me away

1040
01:03:11,701 --> 01:03:12,534
from her?

1041
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,320
I am wondering if I should say anything
because quite frankly it's starting to

1042
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:17,250
get on my nerves.

1043
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:21,930
She will root against the character for
no reasons besides the ones listed above.

1044
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,030
Um, I don't know if I
would just make her move,

1045
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,870
make her more pissed off though. Have
you ever been in a situation like this?

1046
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,380
Love the show and as always go
fuck yourself. Here's the thing,

1047
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:38,880
one of the worst things you can do when
you get into a relationship with the

1048
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:43,881
woman is to start having your behavior
be dictated by just trying to keep them

1049
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:50,520
in a good mood. All right? I'm not
saying walk around and be an Asshole,

1050
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:53,400
but if you're not being a fucking
asshole and they're just being moody,

1051
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:58,170
fucking assholes. Like you got to
call him out on it. Yeah. Like,

1052
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:00,180
and,
and this is another thing too.

1053
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,080
You gotta treat them like adults rather
than treating them like children,

1054
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,010
which is what a lot of guys do because
physically we're stronger than them.

1055
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:11,370
So you feel like if you say anything to
them, it's like a yelling at a child.

1056
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:12,120
You're not,

1057
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:16,050
not only is that an adult and a lot of
ways they're more advanced because they

1058
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:18,480
can't beat the fuck out of you.
They have to go,

1059
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:20,640
they have to go with their mental,
right.

1060
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:24,360
That's why they consist manipulate
you like a fucking little puppet there

1061
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:27,720
because they can just play Jedi
mind games because they, they,

1062
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:30,900
they're not gonna they from day
one they're like, all right,

1063
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:33,570
this fucking thing is going to be
stronger than me at some point.

1064
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:37,020
So I need to learn how to control
it. Just using my brain. Right.

1065
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:39,023
That's how you end.

1066
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:43,590
End Up holding fucking yarn owes can
hook no woman's cells anymore. Right.

1067
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:47,130
They barely even cook.
So you end up at fucking brunch.

1068
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,980
This is what you got to say.
Um,

1069
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:54,570
you've just got to just hit pause
and just, I would just be like,

1070
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:59,490
what is your problem with this character?
You're ruining this show for me. Okay.

1071
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,600
If you look at and look at daredevil,
he's got abs.

1072
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,320
You see me acting like a fucking
baby about this. You know,

1073
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,110
if you don't like the way you look,

1074
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:13,950
go to the gym at the once you be
inspired by this fog there. That's,

1075
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,000
that's what I've failed when I,

1076
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:19,060
when I watch a superhero movie other
than I the other, other than like a,

1077
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:20,740
when the fuck is his dumb horse,

1078
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:24,160
Shit gonna be over and always makes me
feel like, yeah, I gotta hit the gym.

1079
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,163
Okay.

1080
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:31,430
I could literally sit there and watch
Thor who's probably a foot taller than me,

1081
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:34,130
a thousand times better looking
than I'm ever going to be.

1082
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:37,760
And all that dude does is make me
want to go to the gym. But then again,

1083
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:38,900
if you look at our roles,

1084
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:44,030
like all I need to do is earn enough money
where I can get a Ferrari in a toupee

1085
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:47,780
and next thing you know, I can bank some
core that's been an a fucking magazine.

1086
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,100
And that's basically how it works.

1087
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:53,210
If I drive the car in the
right part of the world, right?

1088
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:57,650
Drive around fucking French
Riviera Jesus Christ,

1089
01:05:57,651 --> 01:06:00,500
you have no idea what you're going to
be banging. They don't have that option.

1090
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:04,250
You know what I mean? They can't be
like, well I'm a six, but you know,

1091
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:08,450
if I start making money I can go
get myself a Brad Pitt. You can't,

1092
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,200
Eh, you know what? You
can't blame society.

1093
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,650
You've got to blame the good Lord
for that one. So maybe that's why.

1094
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,343
Maybe that's why.

1095
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,370
Because no matter what she does, she
can. I don't know. I don't fucking know.

1096
01:06:22,371 --> 01:06:24,680
Ask Her, but you know something
I wouldn't be on, you know,

1097
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:28,790
she's ruining your show. You got to
call her out on it. Um, all right.

1098
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:33,230
Okay. Going bald. Dear Billy bald cap.

1099
01:06:33,231 --> 01:06:34,850
I'm 24 and I'm going bald.

1100
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:39,230
This runs in my family is both my
grandfathers were bald so I don't have any

1101
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,390
sort of identity crisis about it.
In fact,

1102
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,810
I'm leaning into it and we'll
joke about it when appropriate.

1103
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,040
My question to you is,

1104
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:50,000
when do I finally start buzzing
my ev buzzing everything away.

1105
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,490
The last thing I want to do is rocket.

1106
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,070
George could stand the
kid cause stanza look,

1107
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,820
but we'd like to have a full head of hair
while I can before I look like I'm in

1108
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:01,400
denial.
No comb overs for this cut.

1109
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,580
My hair is thin but still
covers everything on top though.

1110
01:07:04,581 --> 01:07:07,580
My Barbara did crack more
jokes than usual at my last,

1111
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,240
at my expense last time
I went to get a cut. No,

1112
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:14,600
I didn't provide a picture because this
isn't a fucking Rogaine commercial.

1113
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:17,570
Given your experience,
I'd love to hear your input on what,

1114
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:20,240
when you pulled the
trigger to buzzard all,

1115
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:24,500
all away and possibly the
input of the lovely Nia.

1116
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:28,160
When Jesus Christ, what am
I? You fucking stylists.

1117
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:29,623
Okay,

1118
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:33,250
well I think you know something. If
you, Barbara starts making jokes,

1119
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:34,720
you know what I mean?

1120
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:38,480
I feel like there's not enough time left
on the clock for you to make it come

1121
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:38,840
back.

1122
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:43,000
That's basically like now you're lining
up and the dude across the is talking

1123
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:46,720
shit about how they're moving on to the
next round of the playoffs and you're

1124
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:48,370
not.
So it sounds like it's already over,

1125
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:50,483
you know,

1126
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:52,830
I dunno dude.
Why and what am I,

1127
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:57,580
what kind of a fucking man asks another
man a question like this? Just fucking,

1128
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:58,443
you know,

1129
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:03,880
shave your fucking head or go get
a hair plugs or put Rogaine on it,

1130
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:08,740
or a diet, a different fucking cover. I
don't give a fuck what you do with it.

1131
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,120
What is my experience? My experience
was when I was just sick of it,

1132
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,490
I was sick of the slow and I
was just like, you know what?

1133
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,380
Let's just put this
thing out of its misery.

1134
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:22,783
Um,

1135
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,850
and I gotta tell you it's not nearly
as bad as everybody fucking thanks.

1136
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:31,490
Who's kidding? Who? Everybody would love
to have a full head of hair, but you know,

1137
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:34,550
stuff that I gotta be honest with you.
Once you start buzzing in your head,

1138
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,660
it's kind of fucking awesome. You know
what's great about having a shaved head?

1139
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,220
You're always ready to go.

1140
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:47,330
I got to tell you, as much as I would
love to still have a full head of hair,

1141
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,270
I love the fact that
I'm always ready to go.

1142
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:54,770
All I gotta do is throw a shirt on,
splash a little water on my face,

1143
01:08:54,771 --> 01:08:58,040
and you have no fucking idea that I was
laying in my sweatpants five minutes

1144
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:02,390
earlier. Oh, speaking of which, I'm just
kidding. I always make sure I get ready.

1145
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,590
You know, there was this fucking
person, you know, I went out, you know,

1146
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:12,040
I took some pictures with
people after the show and uh,

1147
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:13,580
okay.

1148
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:17,900
Did these fucking people that have
like this fucking guy comes up,

1149
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:21,270
I can already smell him.
Alright.

1150
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,930
And then he goes to put his arm around
me during the fucking picture and I'm

1151
01:09:24,931 --> 01:09:29,190
telling you like literally
could make paint,

1152
01:09:29,191 --> 01:09:32,730
peel off the fucking walls was
how bad this guy's body odor was.

1153
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:36,510
And he's with other people and
they don't smell. It's like,

1154
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:39,900
why don't you say something to them?
Because I'm not going to say it.

1155
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:41,340
Yeah.

1156
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:42,173
Okay.

1157
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:42,840
Okay.

1158
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:46,470
You paid money to see me,
right? I gave you show.

1159
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:49,700
And then I come out there
and take a picture and then
I tell you, you smell bad.

1160
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:51,700
I wouldn't do that to somebody,

1161
01:09:51,701 --> 01:09:54,460
but Jesus fucking question you was
fucking hilarious about this person too.

1162
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,860
I kept running into him.

1163
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,930
Okay.

1164
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:01,860
And then this person just loved to tell
a story that somehow involved, you know,

1165
01:10:01,861 --> 01:10:06,390
lifting his arms up past his
fucking shoulders. Jesus. Fuck man.

1166
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:09,810
I never noticed how much you lift your
arms during telling a story until I ran

1167
01:10:09,811 --> 01:10:14,310
into this guy fucking raped fucking rate.

1168
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:16,030
Yeah.

1169
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:19,390
Just completely fucking unacceptable.
Well into his fucking twenties.

1170
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:22,570
And he's standing, he's got a couple
of friends with them who don't reek.

1171
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,540
Oh my God. You know, a bad, I would shade
one of those old school fucking, you know,

1172
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:31,320
the spray on deodorant. And as he was
telling this story, I'd be like, yeah.

1173
01:10:31,321 --> 01:10:34,770
And just holding my nose and Jay, I
would just spray under one arm pit, no.

1174
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:38,790
Keeps telling this story and then spray
under the other one and then I just hand

1175
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:43,530
them the cad. Do the math
there. Fuck Go. Alright.

1176
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,060
Psycho girlfriend.

1177
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,693
Yeah.

1178
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:52,230
Um, alright. Psycho
girlfriend. Uh, where am I?

1179
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:52,501
Okay.

1180
01:10:52,501 --> 01:10:56,490
So my girlfriend and I have been together
for about five years and lately I've

1181
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:59,730
been feeling the get engaged
pressure from her family. Well, yeah,

1182
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:04,830
I'm 23 and she's 21. All right,
let me rephrase that. Well, no,

1183
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,710
um, I thought you guys were older. Uh,

1184
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,070
we've been together since high school
and I haven't experienced much else

1185
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,630
besides, of course the young
middle school, tug job girlfriends.

1186
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,890
I'm afraid of Sunday regretting missing
out on meeting a ton of different girls.

1187
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:24,150
Like all my buddies have been, I
mean you're only young once, right?

1188
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:29,420
My girlfriend flips out on me about
watching porn because I'm thinking about

1189
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:34,290
other girls and she acts like I'm cheating
on her and half the time when we're

1190
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:37,950
out she thinks I'm checking out other
girls cause you probably are dude because

1191
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:40,290
you want to cause you want
to break up with her as what?

1192
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:44,130
I'm guessing she's a drop dead gorgeous
girls so I don't get what she's so

1193
01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:48,360
insecure about. But like I said,
she's crazy. She gets abusive with me.

1194
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,470
I just kind of sit there and
take it all the time. Um,

1195
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:57,450
she's Latina by the way. Honduran
Nicaraguan. She's got that wild temper.

1196
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,193
Um,
all right.

1197
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:05,120
I was that considered racist to see that
Latino chicks are a little crazier than,

1198
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:09,230
than what? Unlike what pasty
drunken Irish chicks. Oh yeah.

1199
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,520
They're always so even keeled.

1200
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,140
When I asked for space,

1201
01:12:15,141 --> 01:12:19,220
I woke up the next day
and my car was keyed.

1202
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:23,120
She claimed she had nothing to do with it.
I love the girl,

1203
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:25,880
she's all I've ever known and
she's amazing most of the time,

1204
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:29,840
but I'm not sure if I can live like
this forever with their temperament or

1205
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:33,620
jealousy. What would you do
anyways? Love the podcast.

1206
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:37,100
Thanks for the advice and go fuck
yourself. P s good luck with the home gym.

1207
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:42,440
Everybody knows you got no
business in irregularly.

1208
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:45,580
I go fuck yourself. I got business in
a regular gym. Oh, when you do what?

1209
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,810
You sitting here and you're a fucking
God. Damn. You know something?

1210
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:53,640
I actually had fucking,
I actually had sympathy for you.

1211
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:57,390
I was going to give you some good
advice. You know what? Go Fuck Yourself.

1212
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,890
You know what your problem is in
this thing. You know you're just,

1213
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:05,400
you're allowed to. You're young. I'm
not going to be a dick to you. Okay?

1214
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:09,510
Cause you're young. This is the deal.
All right? You got yourself a hot girl.

1215
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:14,430
All right, and you did not
have set up the relationship.

1216
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:17,880
She fucking rolled all over you. You're,
I see what I do in your situation.

1217
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:21,870
If I was 23, I'd be doing what you were
doing. I'd be staying in the relationship,

1218
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:26,130
wanting to get out, um, and
dealing with this bullshit.

1219
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:28,860
But I can tell you this right now,
her looks aren't always going to be there,

1220
01:13:28,861 --> 01:13:31,200
but she's always going to have keys.
You know what I mean?

1221
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,940
So that's what you're signing up for.
The looks. Go out the fucking window.

1222
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:39,840
You're marrying the fucking person at
this fucking lunatic every time, you know,

1223
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:44,460
God forbid your mailman is a fucking woman
who's younger than her at that point,

1224
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,413
you know?

1225
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:48,260
Yeah.

1226
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,680
I th I don't know. I don't
know. I can use too wishy washy.

1227
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,220
I can't tell whether you
fucking want to be in it or not,

1228
01:13:55,670 --> 01:14:00,570
but I can tell you this right
now. Um, any woman keys your car,

1229
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,550
that's it.
It's fucking over.

1230
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:04,230
Yeah.

1231
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:08,130
Okay. That is a, the level of
being a complete fucking psycho,

1232
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:13,030
a complete disrespect for your own
property. And that when she was a child,

1233
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,840
she was never told no. The fact that you
would go out and do something like that.

1234
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:20,860
Yeah,
I dunno.

1235
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,670
It sounds to me like you want to go
fucking get some notches on your belt and

1236
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:27,820
you're afraid that if you do and you break
up with this girl that she's going to

1237
01:14:27,821 --> 01:14:32,600
fucking stab you. Um, I dunno,

1238
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:35,630
I got claustrophobic reading
it if that means anything,

1239
01:14:35,631 --> 01:14:38,240
but I'm a fucking load of tech.
Alright. Sketchy ex-girlfriend.

1240
01:14:39,380 --> 01:14:42,310
Hey you can t leprechaun,
Jason.

1241
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,760
Everybody's staring into the
red head shit this week. Every,

1242
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:47,870
every once in a while.
I got to give you guys shit to get.

1243
01:14:47,871 --> 01:14:51,170
Can you be a little more original?
I liked that Billy blank ball.

1244
01:14:51,171 --> 01:14:54,290
That was fucking funny.
58 fucking, you know,

1245
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:00,780
fucking redhead jokes in a
row, but I get it. You know,

1246
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,380
I get it.
You don't have an hour's time.

1247
01:15:03,381 --> 01:15:07,820
You can do a 10 minutes set your a
showcase comic. Uh, all right. Hey,

1248
01:15:07,821 --> 01:15:09,170
you cut t leprechaun.

1249
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:14,360
I am 16 years old and my girlfriend
is 15 today. She texted me,

1250
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:18,980
she texted me with a picture of
a tattoo asking if I like it.

1251
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,560
Yeah,

1252
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:25,150
it is what it is. The date of her
grandfather's death. Personally,

1253
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:28,420
I hate tattoos and thinks
if she keeps getting them,

1254
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:30,460
she will look like a fucking phone book.

1255
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:34,360
I also think her mother is irresponsible,

1256
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:35,950
spelled with a bunch of fees.

1257
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:41,440
He responsible for letting her
get a tattoo spelled with one.

1258
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,130
Oh so young. What are your
thoughts about this and how she,

1259
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:47,203
how,

1260
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,100
okay.

1261
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,760
What's your thoughts about this and how
she didn't tell me till after she got it.

1262
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,090
Thank you. And I love your
shows and your podcast. Um,

1263
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:02,010
yeah. All right. She's 15.

1264
01:16:02,011 --> 01:16:03,660
She already got her first tattoo,

1265
01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:08,940
which you got to do is close your eyes
and age or when is she getting the face

1266
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:13,941
tattoo and the nose ring and the fucking
Olympic fucking rings in our ears to be

1267
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:20,670
different. Um, yeah, I'm not into tattoos.

1268
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,080
You know, I think as a certain
type of person can pull it off.

1269
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:29,880
Um,
and that's not 98% of the population,

1270
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:34,590
but 98% of the population for some
reason has tattoos. Now I don't get it.

1271
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:38,970
I feel like there's a certain level,
Badass dude in a certain level,

1272
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:43,410
badass chick that gets tattoos and when
you meet him and makes sense and it

1273
01:16:43,411 --> 01:16:45,210
actually,
you know,

1274
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,020
okay,

1275
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,440
I dunno if I see a woman and she's a
Badass and she has tattoos that actually

1276
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:55,390
makes them more attractive to me if
she's just some fucking dope, you know,

1277
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:59,080
and she has like some advice
column tattooed on the
back of her fucking neck or

1278
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:03,340
some Chinese sign above her ass
crack, you know, symbol then yeah,

1279
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:06,010
it's just like Jesus Christ,
you know,

1280
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,160
like the amount of people
out there that gets sleeves

1281
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,210
like back in the day when
you got to sleep, I mean,

1282
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:18,530
you were like some biker outlaw,
you know,

1283
01:17:18,531 --> 01:17:22,600
now it's like you work at urban
outfitters, you know, and you,

1284
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:27,440
you're the biggest badass thing about
you is your fucking music selection on

1285
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:29,690
your fucking iPhone. I
have no idea. I know.

1286
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,790
Is I got to get a rental car
in 10 minutes. If they don't,

1287
01:17:31,791 --> 01:17:34,880
I'm going to be late to my show.
So this is the podcast for this week,

1288
01:17:34,881 --> 01:17:37,640
the Monday morning podcast. God bless. Um,

1289
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:40,220
I love when you guys trashed me in
the fucking emails, but yeah. Can we,

1290
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:43,340
can we just keep, can you keep it
interesting for the reader here?

1291
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,400
I know I'm a redhead. I know
they're easy jokes, but come on.

1292
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,760
What if I did that with my standup act,
you know,

1293
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:53,360
which had come out and see
me if I was out there, go on.

1294
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:57,780
What's to deal with New York,
you know? Um, all right.

1295
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,980
Go fuck yourselves. I'll check
in on you on Thursday. See you.
