00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:34.176
&gt;&gt;What Khan Academy is most known

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:37.376
for is there's a library
for about 2,500 videos.

00:00:37.376 --> 00:00:39.286
Right now they're all
made by me in English,

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:41.286
although we are translating
them, and they're everything

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:44.716
from basic addition all
the way to vector calculus

00:00:44.716 --> 00:00:46.356
and the French Revolution.

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:51.586
And there's a video on the debt
ceiling, so a very comprehensive set

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:54.786
of videos, and we keep add --
I keep adding more right now.

00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:58.326
But we've augmented it now that
we've gotten funding this past year

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.016
with an exercise platform, and
it's an exercise platform that --

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:03.616
I'd actually written a primitive
version of it for my cousins many

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:05.716
of years ago, actually before
I'd even made the first video,

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.726
but I didn't have the
bandwidth nor the talent

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:10.876
to properly do that justice.

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.246
And so when we got funding, I
said, "This is where I think a lot

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:16.316
of the meat is is actually giving
people exercises and feedback

00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:18.146
and letting the videos
complement that".

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:25.136
&gt;&gt;My name is Salman Khan, and I'm
the founder of the Khan Academy,

00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:27.166
and I'm currently its
only faculty member,

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.196
but that might be changing soon.

00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:31.456
&gt;&gt;And we generally view
ourselves in kind of the top

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:32.556
of the first inning right now.

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:35.106
We got our funding about nine
months ago, and we were able

00:01:35.106 --> 00:01:37.566
to hire a real engineering
team to work on this,

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.156
so we still think it's in early days.

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:41.186
Our goal is to have this exercise.

00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:44.466
The video libraries keep going,
cover everything that we can cover,

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:48.226
do justice to in this type of
a form factor, have exercises

00:01:48.226 --> 00:01:50.066
where someone can start at
one plus one equals two.

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:52.776
It focuses on mastery-based learning,

00:01:52.776 --> 00:01:55.456
where you master a concept
before you progress to the next.

00:01:55.556 --> 00:01:57.576
It focuses on self-paced
differentiated learning.

00:01:57.886 --> 00:02:01.906
Any kid can learn at their own pace,
and they can also provide that data

00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:03.546
to parents or teachers,
so they can use them

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:04.896
in maybe a more structured framework.

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:06.566
So, if it's used in a classroom,

00:02:07.136 --> 00:02:09.826
a teacher can finally have every
kid going at their own pace

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:13.906
and have the teacher really focus
on what we would consider kind

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:19.286
of higher value-add activities, which
is running simulations with students,

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:21.566
doing actual interventions,
getting the students

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:23.606
to teach each other the concept.

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:28.406
&gt;&gt;We don't want to force a role
out to every school in the country.

00:02:28.406 --> 00:02:30.266
What we want to do -- and this
is what we're trying to do

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:34.666
in our pilot program this
year is we want to show

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:39.176
that this is a viable way to run a
classroom that has positive outcomes,

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:40.886
both subjective and
objective outcomes

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:42.806
in multiple different use cases,

00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:46.806
so it works in an affluent public
school district like Los Altos, but,

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.406
frankly, some of the most amazing
numbers we saw in Los Altos were

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:51.746
in the remedial classes, where
the students were not affluent.

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:54.166
But it works in charter schools.

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.116
It works in private schools.

00:02:55.116 --> 00:02:56.066
It works in public schools.

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:58.726
It works with different demographics,
and we think if we can show

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:02.406
that it works and that
if we can give a toolkit

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:04.866
so that we can document how it's
worked in all of these classrooms

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:07.526
and we can give it to any student --
any teacher or parent in the world,

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:10.576
then, you know, let the
world decide for themselves

00:03:10.576 --> 00:03:13.906
if it's something they want to do,
and we'll hope to support them more

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:20.976
and more in doing it and making
it a richer and richer offering.

00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:23.376
&gt;&gt;I mean, I think everyone
can testify

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:25.986
that in college they learned most

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:29.576
of what they're learning the night
before the exam from their peers,

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.886
and then all the way fast-forward
to now, what we're seeing

00:03:31.886 --> 00:03:34.316
in Los Altos is what's happening
is all the kids are working

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:34.846
at their own pace.

00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:38.146
They are watching the videos on
their own when they have a question.

00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:40.076
Some students might get
90 percent from a video.

00:03:40.076 --> 00:03:43.066
Some students might get 60 percent
from a video, but when they start

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:46.116
to connect with each other, they
can start to point out other things,

00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:47.936
and then they can look for
other resources on the Web

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:49.796
and they get each other
to 100 percent.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.446
And this is something I really
want to stress is that we don't --

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:55.786
there's a mindset, and I think some
of the press that's been written

00:03:55.786 --> 00:03:58.286
about this makes it sound like
we think or someone thinks

00:03:58.286 --> 00:04:00.946
that Khan Academy is this
tool that's going to get --

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:03.306
you just watch a video
and, bam, 100 percent.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:04.936
And hopefully that happens.

00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:07.146
You know, we're going to try to
make the videos as good as possible,

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:09.716
but what we think it does is it
takes lecture out of the room.

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:13.106
We think we're really effective in
getting the lecture out of the room

00:04:13.506 --> 00:04:16.126
and allowing these videos
to be consumed in a way

00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:18.636
that different people can
take what they can from them

00:04:18.896 --> 00:04:20.766
and from other things on
the Internet, frankly,

00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:22.306
and then when they go
into the classroom,

00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:25.706
since the lecture's off the
table now, they are now liberated

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:28.226
to actually communicate with
each other and they're liberated

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.946
to have a conversation
about mathematics.

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:32.456
They're liberated to, like,
sit next to their teacher.

00:04:32.456 --> 00:04:37.346
So the power, the real beauty
isn't actually like, you know,

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:40.316
some magic that Khan Academy has
a neural plug-in to your brain

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:46.026
and can deliver -- the real
magic, I think, is that class has

00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:49.346
so much potential that we're letting
happen now, because we're taking all

00:04:49.446 --> 00:04:50.516
that other stuff that was kind

00:04:50.516 --> 00:04:52.486
of disrupting traditional
class out of the way.

00:04:52.586 --> 00:04:57.676
And so the real magic
is actually what happens

00:04:57.676 --> 00:05:02.976
when you let people
talk to each other.

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:06.196
&gt;&gt;For me, like, the deepest learning
happens with a project-based story,

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:09.366
but the projects can only be useful
if people go into the projects

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:13.146
with the core toolkit that -- so they
can understand what's actually going

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.606
into -- going in an analytical way.

00:05:14.606 --> 00:05:16.986
So every student working
at their own pace,

00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:19.676
it doesn't matter what grade
they are, what age they are.

00:05:19.676 --> 00:05:22.306
In fact, we're starting a few
pilots with multi-age groups

00:05:22.306 --> 00:05:26.326
in the same classroom, and
some can work on things

00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:27.656
that are below grade level.

00:05:27.656 --> 00:05:30.046
Some can work on things
that are above grade level,

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:33.196
but what it does is at least on the
core concepts it allows every student

00:05:33.376 --> 00:05:36.536
to make sure that they have at least
the core basics done and gives data

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:39.926
to the teacher on where
there is need.

00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:42.676
And then what we're hoping is
it informs the teacher enough,

00:05:42.676 --> 00:05:43.196
saying, "You know what?

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:46.226
I think the students in my class
are ready for this type of a project

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:47.416
and that type of a project".

00:05:47.416 --> 00:05:50.956
And I think right now we are
putting it on the teacher, like,

00:05:50.956 --> 00:05:53.816
"We've kind of liberated a lot
of this core stuff off of you.

00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:55.276
You won't have to give
the traditional lecture.

00:05:55.276 --> 00:05:59.356
You won't have to do the traditional
homework, but you how have,

00:05:59.356 --> 00:06:01.236
I would say, maybe a larger
responsibility to do more

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:04.596
of this less-traditional stuff, which
is invent an interesting project

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:05.916
or find an interesting project".

00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:08.656
Two summers ago I was running
a little summer camp myself

00:06:08.796 --> 00:06:11.406
and I wanted to experiment with
this, just eat my own dog food,

00:06:11.406 --> 00:06:12.876
to some degree, on what's going on.

00:06:13.236 --> 00:06:15.206
So what I did is I had the
students that used the videos

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:17.106
and the primitive kind of
the exercises back then

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:20.716
to learn a little bit about
probability and multiplying decimals

00:06:20.716 --> 00:06:21.986
and fractions and all that.

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:25.556
And then what I wanted them to really
internalize what probability is

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:27.066
and what expected value is.

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:28.476
I did a bunch of simulations.

00:06:28.476 --> 00:06:29.546
One of them had the -- I don't know

00:06:29.546 --> 00:06:30.896
if you've ever played
"Settlers of Catan".

00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:32.736
It's like a trading game, right?

00:06:32.736 --> 00:06:34.286
So, like, we're all
in one civilization

00:06:34.286 --> 00:06:36.446
and we can build roads, but we trade.

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:38.196
Like, to build a road you
need, like -- I don't know.

00:06:38.196 --> 00:06:41.006
I forgot -- like, two woods and three
bricks, and you can build a road.

00:06:41.006 --> 00:06:43.126
And you might have four woods,
and so we'll try to trade.

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:45.336
We're competitive, but we're
also trading with each other,

00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:48.996
but obviously if you see students
who've already mastered the basics

00:06:48.996 --> 00:06:52.976
of probability, they've watched some
of those videos on expected value,

00:06:53.216 --> 00:06:55.386
then this would be an
ideal exercise for them,

00:06:55.386 --> 00:07:01.976
because they're really going to
internalize what expected value is.

00:07:02.086 --> 00:07:05.176
&gt;&gt;A large degree of what we're
doing is being inspected directly

00:07:05.176 --> 00:07:07.856
by teachers, so a lot
of those dashboards,

00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:09.066
a lot of the new modules you see,

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:12.896
a lot of the videos you see are
direct feedback from teachers saying,

00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:14.756
"Hey, Sal, we need a video
like this," or, "Hey, Sal,

00:07:14.756 --> 00:07:15.576
can you do another video"?

00:07:15.576 --> 00:07:16.836
or, "That's not the language we use.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.326
Can you change the language
in a different one"?

00:07:18.556 --> 00:07:24.076
You know, the traditional reform
mindset towards education is let's

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:25.466
micromanage teachers more.

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:29.236
Like, a good number of really great
teachers are getting handicapped

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:32.626
by this micromanaging, teaching
to the test, whatever else,

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:36.426
and forcing on Tuesday, September
27 you have to cover this,

00:07:36.736 --> 00:07:39.786
and you can't question that
and you have to say these words

00:07:39.916 --> 00:07:43.076
and you have no time to run your own
project and you have no time to think

00:07:43.076 --> 00:07:44.956
of your own curriculum or
whatever you want to do.

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:47.806
We genuinely feel like the
teachers are getting liberated here.

00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:50.186
Do what you want on whatever
day and the students are going

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:53.116
to do what they want on this day,
and we're freeing tons of class time

00:07:53.396 --> 00:07:56.126
for you to do what I think you
went into teaching to begin with.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:57.926
Like, when I ran my
little summer camp --

00:07:57.926 --> 00:08:01.266
and I won't claim to have 30 years
of experience and all the rest,

00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:04.776
but what was fun for me was
not having to give a lecture

00:08:04.776 --> 00:08:08.446
on these common multiples, not having
to give a lecture on probability,

00:08:08.676 --> 00:08:10.866
to know that that was out
of the way and getting

00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:12.296
to do this super fun simulation

00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:14.646
where the kids are trading
pieces and all this.

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:16.956
And I felt like I was able
to express my creativity.

00:08:16.956 --> 00:08:18.996
I was able to go home and say,
"What would be a really cool way

00:08:18.996 --> 00:08:21.936
to understand this
concept intuitively"?

00:08:22.006 --> 00:08:24.326
And when I went to
classroom, that's what we did,

00:08:24.326 --> 00:08:25.986
and I felt like it was a
much richer experience.

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:29.796
And so we genuinely feel and we
genuinely hope that it's doing

00:08:29.796 --> 00:08:33.016
that for teachers, and the teachers
of Los Altos have expressed that,

00:08:33.086 --> 00:08:34.876
that they love -- that
they feel liberated.

00:08:35.186 --> 00:08:37.196
They feel like they have data
that they've never had before.

00:08:37.426 --> 00:08:40.856
The fifth-grade teachers, they teach
all the classes, because they're

00:08:40.856 --> 00:08:44.136
in elementary school,
and they feel handicapped

00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:49.156
in their other classes now, because
they are doing that -- the lecture.

00:08:49.156 --> 00:08:51.626
They are doing the stuff that
I would say is lower value

00:08:51.626 --> 00:08:53.906
than what they're doing in their
math classes, which is the projects,

00:08:53.906 --> 00:08:55.416
which are the one-on-one
interactions.

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:58.706
And so they're actually asking
us as quickly as possible,

00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:00.986
"When are the grammar videos coming?

00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:03.916
When are the grammar exercises coming
so I can do more interesting things

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:10.976
with that part of my day in class"?

00:09:11.046 --> 00:09:13.086
&gt;&gt;So, one of the neat things is

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:16.916
when I make these videos I
sometimes imagine that my kids,

00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:19.216
who are right now two and a
half and one months old --

00:09:19.216 --> 00:09:21.536
one month old will
be the future viewers

00:09:21.536 --> 00:09:23.906
of this video 15 years,
20 years in the future.

00:09:24.316 --> 00:09:25.886
So, all the videos, to some degree,

00:09:25.886 --> 00:09:28.376
I view as for them and
for other students.

00:09:28.686 --> 00:09:31.896
But the ones that I've kind of --
especially now having a daughter --

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:35.246
thought about making is actually
kind of like life-advice stuff.

00:09:35.246 --> 00:09:38.016
And I don't know if I'll put this
in a separate place someplace,

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:39.896
or it might not make Khan
Academy in the first couple --

00:09:39.896 --> 00:09:42.996
like, even dating advice,
because there's a reality

00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:44.776
that right now I can
call on my cousins,

00:09:44.776 --> 00:09:46.446
who are about 15 years
younger than me,

00:09:46.506 --> 00:09:47.986
and they take me kind of seriously.

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:50.126
They're like, "You know, Sal
isn't that far from the action.

00:09:50.126 --> 00:09:53.116
He kind of remembers what my life
is like," but they completely zone

00:09:53.116 --> 00:09:55.296
out their 50-year-old parents.

00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:58.996
And I kind of feel like my daughter
and son will be likely to listen

00:09:58.996 --> 00:10:01.816
to the 34-year-old Sal and
not the 50-year-old Sal.

00:10:02.136 --> 00:10:04.346
So I can kind of do a
time-shift now, just like, "Look,

00:10:04.346 --> 00:10:07.366
if you know you're not going to
marry the guy, end it," you know?

00:10:07.366 --> 00:10:09.916
Don't let this turn into one of
those momentum relationships.

00:10:10.016 --> 00:10:11.546
You don't know what'll
happen, you know?

00:10:11.546 --> 00:10:14.876
Or, like, these are what you should
look for and this is what it means

00:10:14.876 --> 00:10:16.516
to be a good person,
and this is what --

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:20.976
I think that that could
be an interesting thing.
