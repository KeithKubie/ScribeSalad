00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:02.438
- I may have to take over.

00:00:02.438 --> 00:00:04.271
- The vlog?
- The vlog.

00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:07.607
On a more permanent basis.

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:11.175
(rhythmic music)

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.904
- Hey everyone it's Mark
Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:17.094
and eatingthaifood.com
in Bangkok Thailand.

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:19.193
I'm sitting down right now
for a really quick breakfast

00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:21.497
at home but before I start
eating, I wanna tell you

00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:22.399
a quick story.

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.588
Back when I was going to
university in Arizona,

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:27.838
that was from 2004 to 2008,

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:32.606
I would always watch a TV
show called Bizarre Foods

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:35.667
with Andrew Zimmern,
one of my favorite shows

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:36.750
and still is.

00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:42.231
I never dreamed that I
would have the opportunity

00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:45.636
to not only meet Andrew but
to kind of hang out with him

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:48.107
and eat a meal with him.

00:00:48.107 --> 00:00:50.411
Andrew is in Bangkok right now.

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:53.525
He is filming for a brand new TV show

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:57.525
and I have the honor and
opportunity to meet him

00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:01.445
and I think we're gonna go meet him.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:04.339
I know we're gonna ride
around in a tuk-tuk

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.445
and then I know we're gonna eat at one

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:09.360
of my favorite restaurants
in all of Bangkok.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.348
The producer Patrick has said I can vlog

00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:15.117
which is awesome as well.

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:19.527
I'm excited, stay tuned for
an awesome day in Bangkok

00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:21.220
with Andrew Zimmern.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.845
This is (speaks foreign language)

00:01:22.845 --> 00:01:24.370
which I actually ate last night

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.059
so this is leftover
Thai food, my favorite.

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:31.716
Let me pick some of that
fish off the side there.

00:01:31.716 --> 00:01:34.582
May as well mix that with
some (speaks foreign language)

00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:36.412
onto the rice.

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:38.805
I gotta get that garlic
though, gotta get that garlic

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:41.388
and that chili on here as well.

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:51.783
(groans) The soup is sour,
you can taste the lemongrass,

00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:54.285
you can taste the garlic and you can taste

00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:56.819
that galangal in there as well.

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:58.606
Breakfast was excellent.

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:02.059
I'm on a motor bike now
on our way to the BTS

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:05.976
and we are headed to the
Dusit area of Bangkok.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.780
We just made it to Dusit
Zoo, gate number four.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.336
This is where we are meeting them.

00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:17.276
We got here a little bit
early, so we're gonna hang out.

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:19.726
This is right across the street from the

00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:22.058
Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.666
The whole team has just arrived.

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:26.293
They are setting up all
their gear and rigging

00:02:26.293 --> 00:02:29.663
the tuk-tuk with some
GoPros and some cameras.

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:32.417
And then back in that van, right there,

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:35.426
they're getting all the
cameras and equipment ready.

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.730
We're about to jump into tuk-tuks soon.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.919
- Show time, show time
- This is Patrick

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.502
the producer.
- Show time, Erin.

00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:46.224
Team intuitive content,
intuitive content, baby.

00:02:46.224 --> 00:02:48.391
Best place for television.

00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:53.136
- [Man] He's gonna come
and pick a bander, okay,

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:55.094
just do a circle here, okay?

00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:58.129
- I am in the tuk-tuk
now with P'Weera now.

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.085
We are doing a quick circle
and then we are gonna

00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:01.781
pick up Andrew Zimmern.

00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.236
I am now in the back of the
tuk-tuk with Andrew Zimmern.

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:09.457
Say hello to Andrew, very, very cool.

00:03:09.457 --> 00:03:13.624
I am excited and a real honor
to be hanging out with Andrew.

00:03:14.692 --> 00:03:17.665
We are heading on our way to Soei

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:21.118
which is one of my all time
favorite restaurants in Bangkok.

00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:23.908
I started off doing mostly blogging,

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:26.482
and now I do mostly
vlogging and food videos.

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:27.837
- Sounds more fun.

00:03:27.837 --> 00:03:29.679
- Yeah, I love the videos.

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:32.756
- No pressure, but let's
see how you are on camera.

00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:35.980
The question isn't what
aren't we gonna order,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.677
it's how are we going to
eat every item on the menu?

00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:44.135
'Cause I'm not really
a decided kind of guy,

00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:47.306
I'm kind of a one of everything guy.

00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:49.147
- [Mark] I think we will
get along together well.

00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:50.864
- [Andrew] It's a much
better way to approach it.

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:55.031
- We made it to Soei, hanging
out with Andrew and P'Weera.

00:03:56.157 --> 00:03:59.824
And we have just ordered
a few of the dishes

00:04:00.853 --> 00:04:04.270
and Andrew just ate a mackerel head which

00:04:05.138 --> 00:04:08.915
is called (speaks foreign
language) off of a GoPro

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.734
which is a pretty awesome move.

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.464
We're getting ready to
dig in and I gotta start

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:16.001
snacking on those mackerel heads.

00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:17.109
I'm gonna grab

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.609
a mackerel cheek.
- Crazy good.

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:30.264
- [Mark] Oh yeah, those mackerel cheeks

00:04:30.264 --> 00:04:32.767
are ridiculously good.

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:33.723
- [Andrew] Insane.

00:04:33.723 --> 00:04:38.044
- [Mark] Just completely
crispy all the way through.

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:39.377
How is the food?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.263
- Well, we've eaten six dishes,

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:49.600
five of which have been the
best dishes of their types

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.728
that I've ever eaten and the
sixth one is the first time

00:04:52.728 --> 00:04:55.265
I've ever eaten anything like it.

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:58.290
The quality of the cooking here, the skill

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.901
and the precision, a
lot of great technique.

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.734
This is an amazing, amazing place.

00:05:05.091 --> 00:05:09.370
Yeah, there's too much
talking going on at this table

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.507
and not enough eating.

00:05:11.507 --> 00:05:15.430
- We just finished the
main filming eating at Soei

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.714
and now we're just cleaning
up this roasted shrimp salad.

00:05:19.714 --> 00:05:21.131
It is crazy good.

00:05:29.306 --> 00:05:31.590
The flavors are just sensationally good

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.328
and what I really love is
that he slices the lemongrass

00:05:36.328 --> 00:05:39.531
or kind of shaves it so
that it's not too woody

00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:43.277
but then it just releases so
much citrusy lemony flavor

00:05:43.277 --> 00:05:45.346
along with the lime juice.

00:05:45.346 --> 00:05:48.459
The crew is all taking
photos and getting some video

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:51.714
of P'Soei as he's
cooking but I just wanted

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:54.076
to quickly show you this
one dish which is called

00:05:54.076 --> 00:05:57.151
(speaks foreign language) and often times

00:05:57.151 --> 00:05:58.819
at this restaurant, I like to order it

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.584
with (speaks foreign language) which is

00:06:00.584 --> 00:06:03.303
the soft shelled crab
but they ran out today,

00:06:03.303 --> 00:06:05.606
so we ordered it with
(speaks foreign language)

00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:07.439
which is shelled crab.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.472
It is an absolute stunner of a dish.

00:06:11.472 --> 00:06:14.472
It is a dish that you have to order.

00:06:16.728 --> 00:06:21.226
It is a dish that you have to
order when you come to Soei.

00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:24.726
How is, I've gotta get a bite in here too.

00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:27.860
Andrew just stole my bite.

00:06:36.022 --> 00:06:40.189
- When I really wanna make
a point, I do one of these

00:06:42.157 --> 00:06:44.428
and raise an eyebrow.

00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:48.783
That raised eyebrow has won
me three James Beard Awards.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:52.200
Practice your eyebrow raises, food geeks.

00:07:00.415 --> 00:07:03.492
- Yeah, it's just ridiculously good.

00:07:03.492 --> 00:07:08.445
There are egg yolks in here
too to elevate the richness

00:07:08.445 --> 00:07:09.445
even higher.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:18.224
We are now sitting down
for a whole crew lunch.

00:07:18.224 --> 00:07:21.541
This is (speaks foreign
language) which is fried rice

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:24.591
with mackerel and this
is the type of fried rice

00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:26.708
I've never had here at Soei so far.

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:29.422
I'm gonna hit that with a
little bit of lime juice

00:07:29.422 --> 00:07:32.466
and also you gotta eat this
with (speaks foreign language)

00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:35.902
which is fish sauce and chilies.

00:07:35.902 --> 00:07:37.735
Put that onto the top.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:44.339
- You should try these.
- Okay.

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:47.254
- They're excellent.
- Oysters, steamed

00:07:47.254 --> 00:07:48.504
with soy sauce.

00:07:50.134 --> 00:07:51.166
- Get everything on it or?

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:53.987
- Yeah, I like to include
a little bit of everything

00:07:53.987 --> 00:07:55.717
on one bite.

00:07:55.717 --> 00:07:57.942
- I like to avoid the little red dots

00:07:57.942 --> 00:08:00.788
they look like something
dangerous is gonna happen.

00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:01.686
- With the seeds in them?

00:08:01.686 --> 00:08:03.466
- Yeah, but everything goes.

00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:06.150
- Okay, yeah, let's eat
this together though.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.233
By the way, this is Adrian
who is the lead film--

00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:12.115
- One of them.

00:08:12.115 --> 00:08:16.198
- One of the lead film
crew, so he's really cool.

00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:23.651
- Wow, that's great.

00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:26.979
- Wow, that's ridiculous.
- Taking mine.

00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:28.995
(laughing)

00:08:28.995 --> 00:08:33.351
- [Man] He's the best photographer
in Worthington Minnesota.

00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:34.184
- Yeah.

00:08:34.184 --> 00:08:36.884
This is a dish called
(speaks foreign language)

00:08:36.884 --> 00:08:40.031
and it is deep fried pork skin.

00:08:40.031 --> 00:08:44.208
These little nuggets are
pork skin and there are

00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:46.606
kaffir lime leaves in here,
there's chilies, there's basil

00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:48.910
in here and it almost looks like little,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.577
the drippings of a deep
fried battered item,

00:08:54.178 --> 00:08:56.345
but that is all pork skin.

00:09:04.281 --> 00:09:06.475
Oh, that's ridiculous too, mmm.

00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:10.642
- Even you felt that it was
one of those transcended

00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:14.862
meals and that every time you go here

00:09:14.862 --> 00:09:17.959
it actually achieves
that level of quality.

00:09:17.959 --> 00:09:21.709
That's only because all
the food goes through

00:09:23.773 --> 00:09:27.122
the chef's hands, a
special attention towards

00:09:27.122 --> 00:09:30.321
health and wellness and
lightness with his food

00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:33.632
that I think makes it truly unique.

00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:35.727
- [Mark] Yes, perfectly said.

00:09:35.727 --> 00:09:39.018
- I may have to take over--
- The vlog?

00:09:39.018 --> 00:09:42.101
- The vlog on a more permanent basis.

00:09:43.271 --> 00:09:46.887
I really think that Migrationology
is one of the better

00:09:46.887 --> 00:09:50.000
food vlogs and blogs in the world today.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.589
You do a fantastic job,

00:09:51.589 --> 00:09:52.952
all kidding aside.
- Thank you.

00:09:52.952 --> 00:09:55.366
- We're gonna have to send
you to Andrew Zimmern School

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:56.839
of Truth Telling and Swearing.

00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:58.067
(laughing)

00:09:58.067 --> 00:10:02.234
This is the (mumbles)
action for your audience.

00:10:03.521 --> 00:10:05.700
- [Mark] Yeah, very cool.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.533
Hello.

00:10:07.781 --> 00:10:10.198
- [Andrew] Hello pretty lady.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.685
- [Mark] And we got a big bag
of sound equipment down here.

00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:19.989
- What is it, what do I need?

00:10:19.989 --> 00:10:22.403
This is the kind of
behind the scenes thing

00:10:22.403 --> 00:10:25.154
you only see on Migrationology.

00:10:25.154 --> 00:10:27.129
Thank you.
- You want an iced coffee?

00:10:27.129 --> 00:10:29.379
- I have to go to work now.

00:10:30.534 --> 00:10:32.587
- You want a Maserati, you gotta work.

00:10:32.587 --> 00:10:36.093
- You gotta work, I do want a Maserati.

00:10:36.093 --> 00:10:38.599
- I don't, I just wanna make people happy.

00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:41.137
That's all I wanna do, I
wanna make people happy.

00:10:41.137 --> 00:10:42.777
- If all you wanna do
is make people happy,

00:10:42.777 --> 00:10:45.457
then why do you make me
so miserable all the time?

00:10:45.457 --> 00:10:47.636
- 'Cause I love you and
you're so good at what you do.

00:10:47.636 --> 00:10:50.673
You inspire people, you inspired this man.

00:10:50.673 --> 00:10:53.115
You were an inspiration.
- Definitely.

00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:57.638
- Backwards on the motorbike.
- Backwards on the motorbike.

00:10:57.638 --> 00:10:59.905
With the awesome Jim-ball.

00:10:59.905 --> 00:11:02.068
- This is why he works with us.

00:11:02.068 --> 00:11:04.085
- [Man] It's the only
reason, it's the only reason.

00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:05.234
I'm not good at anything else.

00:11:05.234 --> 00:11:06.651
- He's fantastic!

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:08.656
Action!

00:11:08.656 --> 00:11:11.239
(upbeat music)

00:11:16.722 --> 00:11:18.590
- We made it to Ratchawat, we are about

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.340
to eat some hot dogs.

00:11:21.617 --> 00:11:24.784
Ying just got me an iced coffee, okay.

00:11:27.683 --> 00:11:28.841
- [Ying] Thank you.

00:11:28.841 --> 00:11:30.767
- [Andrew] I think you made
a horrible mistake though.

00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:34.330
Here's the deal, do you
ever go out to dinner

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.613
and just have a date
and you make him leave

00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.909
the camera at home?

00:11:37.909 --> 00:11:40.934
- [Ying] I really want him
to leave a camera at home.

00:11:40.934 --> 00:11:43.647
- [Andrew] I think that
should be a new policy.

00:11:43.647 --> 00:11:47.271
One dinner date with
camera and one without.

00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:49.340
One with, one without.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.871
- [Ying] Listening?

00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:53.064
- International rule.
- Thank you.

00:11:53.064 --> 00:11:55.647
- Relationship 101.
- Thank you.

00:11:59.998 --> 00:12:01.081
- Dried pork.

00:12:03.112 --> 00:12:05.939
We stopped for some fried meat.

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:07.919
This is fried pork belly.

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:09.643
- I haven't been walking,
I've been carried

00:12:09.643 --> 00:12:13.300
on a Sedan chair by a
whole herd of lackeys

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.467
and (mumbles) whose job is
to transport me that way.

00:12:18.554 --> 00:12:20.275
- Fried pork?

00:12:20.275 --> 00:12:22.406
- Then I'm dropped off and
I get out and it looks like

00:12:22.406 --> 00:12:24.489
I've been walking around.

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.615
- So crispy.

00:12:26.615 --> 00:12:27.646
- It's very crispy.

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:28.597
- And perfectly salted.

00:12:28.597 --> 00:12:32.145
- It's the absolute perfect street meat.

00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:34.788
Doesn't get any better.
- Yep, I agree.

00:12:34.788 --> 00:12:37.071
Mm, that's good, so good.

00:12:37.071 --> 00:12:38.279
We also had some (speaks foreign language)

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.616
which is the northern Thai sausage.

00:12:40.616 --> 00:12:43.199
(upbeat music)

00:12:47.589 --> 00:12:50.266
We just finished shooting a drone shot

00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:52.772
where we walked into the
tuk-tuk and it drove off

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.614
in a tuk-tuk all shot from above.

00:12:55.614 --> 00:12:57.484
That's gonna be a really cool shot,

00:12:57.484 --> 00:13:01.899
can't wait to see it
when the TV show airs.

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:04.649
There's the drone coming back in.

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:18.419
Andrew is right behind
me now doing a little bit

00:13:18.419 --> 00:13:21.914
of an introduction and
standing right at the entrance

00:13:21.914 --> 00:13:23.581
of Ratchawat Market.

00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:27.583
- Every single day.
- Say hello.

00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:31.083
(speaks foreign language)

00:13:35.916 --> 00:13:38.005
- We are all done filming here.

00:13:38.005 --> 00:13:41.386
Just wanna say a big thank you to P'Weera.

00:13:41.386 --> 00:13:44.667
(speaks foreign language)

00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:47.169
He drove us around in a tuk-tuk.

00:13:47.169 --> 00:13:50.941
If you ever need a tuk-tuk when
you're at Ratchawat Market,

00:13:50.941 --> 00:13:52.263
this is his tuk-tuk right here

00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:55.121
with the (mumbles) in the back.

00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:57.681
Ying and I just jumped onto a bus.

00:13:57.681 --> 00:14:00.037
The cool type of bus
with the wooden floor,

00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:02.106
the classics in Bangkok.

00:14:02.106 --> 00:14:06.273
We're heading back to Anusawari
which is Victory Monument.

00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:11.092
We're almost home but
we just decided to stop

00:14:11.092 --> 00:14:14.243
for a quick bite to eat
at this street food stall

00:14:14.243 --> 00:14:15.972
right behind me.

00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:18.128
They specialize in Isan food which is food

00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:20.397
from the north eastern region of Thailand

00:14:20.397 --> 00:14:24.564
and also they have jim jum
which is Thai Isan hot pot.

00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:27.690
I think there's chicken, there
might be some pork on here,

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.480
liver, some intestines and there's an egg

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.577
right in the center.

00:14:31.577 --> 00:14:33.714
What you're supposed to do
is just kind of break up

00:14:33.714 --> 00:14:37.460
that yolk and stir up
at least Ying told me

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.714
to stir it all up.

00:14:38.714 --> 00:14:40.844
Open up this soup.

00:14:40.844 --> 00:14:45.011
There should be some, there's
some galangal in here.

00:14:46.016 --> 00:14:48.485
There are some kaffir lime
leaves, what else is down here?

00:14:48.485 --> 00:14:52.652
Lemongrass and I'm just gonna
dump in all the meat first.

00:14:54.283 --> 00:14:57.252
Or just slide it in, whamp.

00:14:57.252 --> 00:14:59.143
Add in all these vegetables.

00:14:59.143 --> 00:15:01.933
There's basil down here, sweet basil.

00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:04.812
There is water morning glory,
so water morning glory.

00:15:04.812 --> 00:15:08.359
What you normally need to do, break it

00:15:08.359 --> 00:15:12.026
and then just dump it
all into the clay pot.

00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:16.551
Gotta add that cabbage in there as well.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.637
Okay, I'm gonna just stir this around.

00:15:23.134 --> 00:15:25.892
As the jim jum is cooking,
I also ordered a side plate

00:15:25.892 --> 00:15:29.417
of laab and this is minced pork salad.

00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:31.629
There are also some intestines in here

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:34.379
and this is a good looking plate.

00:15:36.221 --> 00:15:39.638
I'd better get an intestine in that bite.

00:15:44.826 --> 00:15:47.041
Oh yeah, what I like
about this version is that

00:15:47.041 --> 00:15:49.110
it's really heavy on the
(speaks foreign language)

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.179
which is the toasted
rice, sticky rice powder.

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:54.292
So it gives it that crunchy texture

00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:56.292
but also a smoky flavor.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.797
That dressing.

00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:07.735
Yeah, I think we're good
to go with the soup.

00:16:07.735 --> 00:16:11.485
I'm gonna dish myself
some of the vegetables.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.053
Yeah, that should be good for now.

00:16:18.053 --> 00:16:20.135
I'm gonna take that piece
of pork and this is another

00:16:20.135 --> 00:16:22.135
different dipping sauce.

00:16:25.573 --> 00:16:27.808
Oh, that's hot right out of the pot.

00:16:27.808 --> 00:16:31.585
I'm gonna eat some of
the vegetables as well.

00:16:31.585 --> 00:16:33.835
Yeah, you can really taste
that lemongrass in there.

00:16:33.835 --> 00:16:35.510
Ying and I are gonna sit
here and finish the rest

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.077
of this food so I'm going
to end the video now.

00:16:39.077 --> 00:16:42.389
It was a really cool
day and really an honor

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:44.867
and really amazing to hang
out with Andrew Zimmern

00:16:44.867 --> 00:16:46.616
and walk around and eat
at one of my favorite

00:16:46.616 --> 00:16:48.868
restaurants in Bangkok.

00:16:48.868 --> 00:16:51.203
Big thank you to Andrew Zimmern,

00:16:51.203 --> 00:16:54.285
big thank you to producer Patrick Weiland,

00:16:54.285 --> 00:16:56.661
also a very cool guy and also to Erin

00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:59.484
and the whole team, crew.

00:16:59.484 --> 00:17:02.833
Also wanna give a shout out to kylele.net.

00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:04.416
I was hanging out with him in Vietnam.

00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:06.267
I will leave his link
in the description box

00:17:06.267 --> 00:17:10.434
but that's how I met Patrick
the producer originally.

00:17:11.749 --> 00:17:13.089
Big thank you to everyone.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.430
(speaks foreign language)

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.826
