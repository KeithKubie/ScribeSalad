00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.474
So matrix multiplication is one of the classic examples of bulk parallelism.

00:00:04.474 --> 00:00:07.317
Different threads can take different elements of the matrices,

00:00:07.317 --> 00:00:09.710
multiply them all together and combine them.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.216
Finding faces in photographs is task parallelism

00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:19.062
because I am performing a similar operation on a large number of different input data sets.

00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:24.509
Each photograph effectively amounts to a task, and I'm doing all of these tasks in parallel.

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.197
Binary search is a recursive algorithm.

00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:33.311
I repeatedly look through increasingly small subsets of my data to find the value that I'm looking for,

00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:37.014
and parallel library calls from inside of a kernel amount

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:40.944
to creating new parallel work inside my existing kernel parallel work,

00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:42.643
so that is nested parallelism.
