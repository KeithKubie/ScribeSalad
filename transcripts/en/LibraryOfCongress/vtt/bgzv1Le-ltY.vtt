&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay, and
one thing I want to get,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.950
because you have such an arc.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.040
I want to get to your
visuals early on.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.340
There he is.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.510
There he is.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.050
[ Applause ]

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.820
So I'm always fascinated
with origin stories

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.140
of the creators behind
their creations,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.970
because cartoonists are
often a different animal.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.600
I think that the political
cartoonist, Jack Ohman,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.310
once said like "Meeting a
cartoonist is like a little bit

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.430
like meeting a weekend weather man.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.880
You know they exist, but meeting
them sort of in real life,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.320
it's like how did you get that job?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.690
Or what was, you know?"

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.220
But most cartoonists I know wanted,
as children, to be cartoonists,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.810
and they're the ones that
actually, though, had the skill.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.400
Did you always want
to be a cartoonist?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, I wanted
to be a cartoonist starting probably

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.960
in maybe second or third grade.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
what were you reading?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.100
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: I
was reading Peanuts.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, of course.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.700
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Of course.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.410
And I was reading, -- we got two
daily newspapers at my house.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.710
One came in the morning.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.010
One came in the afternoon.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.470
So I read the comics in the
Boston Globe in the morning,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.420
and in the afternoon,
I read the comics

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.890
in the Foster's Daily Democrat.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay, were you
living in New Hampshire at the time?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.870
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: In
New Hampshire, yeah.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And when did
you start drawing your creations?

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.270
[ Laughing ]

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: You know, I mean,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.410
I think there's a difference
between,

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.370
you know, copying and drawing.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.580
So I started copying when I was
probably five or six years old,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.390
and I think I copied for probably
a couple of years, you know?

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.020
Just copying -- like I
would draw Charlie Brown.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.180
I'd draw Snoopy.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.460
I draw Andy Capp, Fred Bassett.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.220
You know, all these comic strips.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.230
Even if I didn't necessarily
like the comments,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.530
I might like the way they look.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Something
about the visual was appealing.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.000
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.160
So here you've got the progression.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.440
It's a school performance
right there.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.300
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And there.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.740
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So that's
school picture day and I always,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.430
when I talk to kids, because I do
school visits, and I talk to kids,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.330
and I say that Nate
is not a bad kid.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.210
He is a good kid, to which
bad things oftentimes happen.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.160
Like a really disastrous school
picture day like that one.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Real good kid to
home bad things happened growing up,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.100
or a bad kid to whom
good things happened?

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.890
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: No,
a good kid, and I think,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.050
and the overall spectrum, I
mean, I wanted to be a bad kid.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.480
Bad kids are having all the fun.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.780
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: The bad kids, you
know, if you acted out in elementary

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.220
or middle school, and a
teacher really screamed

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.530
at you, you were a legend.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh yeah.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.150
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: You are a
legend, and so I always sort

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.850
of envied those kids, but I
was never quite bold enough

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.130
to really act out in a way that I
knew would disappoint my parents.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Know, I heard
John Purse never acted out either.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.960
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: He did not.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.520
He did not.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.720
So I had that sort of that
envy of the bad kids, but no,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.020
I was pretty much a good kid.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You
were a good kid.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.260
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Right.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Can
we go back one?

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.660
I think I clicked too far.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.540
So there you get a sense of Nate.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.770
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, so that's
a Sunday page, and I -- it has --

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.410
it's got like a pratfall in it.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.240
Like it's got slapstick in it,
which is one of the things I love,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.160 position:56%
and it has something -- what I think
you can do certain things in comics

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.570
that you can't do it other media.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.410
You know, like from
one panel to the next,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.710
you can imply that like
five minutes have gone

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.870
by without saying five
minutes later.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.480
So in this one, you know that a
significant amount of time passes

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.470
from the second to the
last panel to the last one.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.980
Enough time for Nate to go
flying up and climb in a tree

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.290
and have the lifeguard have to, you
know, or to climb up to get him.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.030
And so -- but it's funnier

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.170
if you don't show all
that; I think it's funnier.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.930
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.070
And so here we get to
see Nate, you know --

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.360
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: He's talking
about his learning style,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.840
which he describes as
stop, drop, and roll.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.920
Yeah, I just like that -- I just
thought stop, drop, and roll.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:01.060
That's a phrase that all
kids know, and just a staple

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.100
in my comic strip is Nate
sort of experiencing things

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.720
in different ways from the way
other people do, and so for him,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.490
that's sort of a perfect --

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.060
you know, that's a phrase that
is completely like emblematic

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.800
of his whole philosophy
and his coping skills.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
his method of survival.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.130
That could have been.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.870
That was the alternate title
of the strip, wasn't it?

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.450
Was stop, drop, and roll?

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.750
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
It could have been.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.830
So here you were talking about
Peanuts being an influence here.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.130
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yes.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So here
we see from your sketchbook.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.110
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, so my
mother, bless her heart, you know,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.910
she -- so I got an allowance
at the time, one dollar a week.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And those Peanuts
little paperbacks cost 50 cents.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.270
So if I didn't spend my money on
anything else, I could buy two

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.700
of those in a week,
and I bring them home,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.730 position:56%
and my mother would immediately
write our name and the date in them.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.400
Like probably because she --
she did that with everything.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.430
I mean, she wrote that
on my underwear.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.910
I mean, you know, like
as if I was going

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.530
to leave my underwear
lying around somewhere.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, well, if
you stopped, dropped, and rolled,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.940
and something had happened --

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.240
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
right, you never know.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.050
And then once she had written
the name and the date text

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.540
of the book was mine to do with
what I wanted, and what I wanted

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.200
to do a lot of time was
try to draw the characters.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.430
So yeah, that's my -- I had a
problem with feet back then.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.190
I hadn't mastered that yet.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.120
But yeah, that's Charlie Brown.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.510
He's carrying Snoopy's
supper dish out to Snoopy.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I love it.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.230 position:56%
Now you were first syndicated by
NEA, which was a division of United,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.360
and of course, Charles "Sparky"
Schulz basically helped to --

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.550
United was the house
that he helped build.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.850
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Absolutely.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did you ever
get a chance to meet Sparky?

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.580
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: I met him, yeah.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.670
I actually -- our first contact
was we spoke on the phone,

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.680
because back then the comics editor
was a woman named Sarah Gillespie,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.840
and when you are a new
cartoonist, sometimes,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.590
not always from what I understand,

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.420
but sometimes she would show the
work of new cartoonists to Sparky.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.250
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: It's so
she showed my strip to Sparky,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.300
and then she said, she said,

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.320
"You might be getting
a call from Sparky."

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.620
And I said wow.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.610
And then some time went by,
and then one day, my wife

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.410
and I were still living in
Brooklyn, and the phone rang.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.710
My wife answered the phone.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.780
I remember I was lying on
the couch in the living room,

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.530
and my wife came in, and she said
Charles Schulz is on the phone.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.130
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
and it was, you know,

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.430
I was talking to my boyhood hero.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.030
Absolutely.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.330
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And we
talked for like an hour,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.590
and then we talked,
you know, not often.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:47.490
We weren't like close friends
by any means, but we talked once

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.770
or twice a year, and then I met him
in person for the one and only time

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.130
in 1996 at The Ruben New York.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure, yeah.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.500
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And I attached
myself to him and monopolized him

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.860
as best I could, because how
often do you get a chance

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.180
to speak to your hero?

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did you
ask him how to draw feet?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.360
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
he was very helpful there.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, I
met him two years later.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:18.390
I was so busy kissing his feet
that I couldn't draw the -- yeah.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.690
You know, that's amazing.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.910
It's something about --
there was such a fraternity

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.550
in the comics industry that you
find yourself meeting your heroes,

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.850
and that special thing.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.150
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
there's nothing like it.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.450
It's great.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
yeah, so here,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.260
you have the evolution
of you as a cartoonist.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.530
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: This is my first
original comic strip creation,

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:39.830
Super Jimmy.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: How old were
you, do you think, when you --

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.240
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Probably 10.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay,
did your mom date this?

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.670
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Well, as you can
tell -- you know, so, of course,

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:55.030
I was a huge comics reader,
and I loved the funny comics,

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.050
but I also loved the
action ones, and I loved --

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.490
you know, I heard Roz
mention Mad Magazine.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.290
So I love those sort of
parities and satires.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.650
So my thought was,
I create a superhero

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.240
who combines all the things I love.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.410
He's funny, but he has superpowers.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:17.430
So, you know, he's a superhero
who is not very bright, basically,

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.460
and just makes everything worse.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, I love --

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.820
so, and then you have
your progression.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.980
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, so,
the character on the left,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.920
the fellow with the blond
hair, his name is Nate,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.370
and the guy on the
right is named Marty.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.740
So this submission was
the precursor to Big Nate.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.580
It was a comic strip
called Neighborhood Comics,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.350
and it was based on my
childhood and the neighborhood

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.460
in New Hampshire where I grew up.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.120
With the younger brother, me,
and the older brother, Nate.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.500
Nate is my nickname
for my older brother.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: This is
a more suave looking Nate,

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.800
a more polished-looking Nate.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.940
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, well, so
I sent this in, and they told me,

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.680
you know, the spiky blond
hair, he looks a little bit

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.650
like Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.920
You know, and of course, as a
cartoonist, the last thing you want

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.250
to be told is, you know,

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.250
your character looks too
much like another character.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.850
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So I went
back to the drawing board

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.510
and I redesigned Nate
in a fairly radical way.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.330
So I think in the next
slide, it might show --

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And you dodged the
lion you had in there, too, maybe?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.560
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Exactly,
all right, so there's Nate,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.950
the pudgy guy on the right.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.250
Yeah, that's Nate.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's
a massive makeover.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.290
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: That
was a huge makeover.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:41.550
So parents and people of a certain
age will back me up on this.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.110
During the late 1980s, there was an
unfortunate hair trend among young

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.010
men where it was sort of
long on the top and almost

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.360
like shaved all around the sides.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.820
It look like a mushroom cap.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.350
So I gave Nate hair like that,
and I made him overweight,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.130
because I didn't want him to
look like Calvin or anybody else.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.950
And then I got more
feedback from the woman

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.530
who eventually became my editor,
and she said, "Now Nate looks

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.300
like an overweight,
middle-aged man."

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.360
You know? He looks
like Peter Griffin

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.730
up there or something like that.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
so you've gone from Calvin

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.420
to Peter Griffin in one makeover.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.720
So the progression continues.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.540
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
so then I started --

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.940
so that drawing is
probably from a year

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.260
or two before the strip
finally got up and running.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.200
And the top one is his
dad and not Nate, right?

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.710
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
well, you know, like I said.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.820
He sees and experiences
things in ways.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.260 position:56%
You know, so his dad has may be like
a tiny potbelly, a slight potbelly,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.560
but Nate imagines him as being
this enormous, you know, like --

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oompa
Loompa type --

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.170
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Right, right.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.550
And even the spikiness evolved,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.700
where Nate now has those
polished sort of --

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:04.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, he still
bawled on the sides, and inevitably,

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.590
I go into school visits, and almost
always asked about Nate's hair.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.020
Like what's up with it?

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.140
You know? I've been asked why
does Nate have dreadlocks?

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.800
I've been asked why is
he bawled on the sides?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:26.170 position:56%
I've been asked, you know, were you
imitating other partially bald comic

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.040
strip characters, like
Charlie Brown?

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I was going
to say Charlie Brown, Sparky,

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.830
just why is your child
almost completely bald?

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.450
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Exactly,
exactly, and I don't quite know why

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.110 position:56%
but that's just the way -- I wanted,

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.870
after they had told me he looks
too much like a middle-aged man.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.460
I said, well, I've got to
make him younger, and spiky,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.800
sort of wild hair seemed
like the way to go.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
and any cartoonist,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.470
random acts of baldness
is always amusing.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.770
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So
you again -- yeah.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.370
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Right.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.730 position:56%
I just, you know, so just to
contrast, you know, the last drawing

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.740
and this one were probably
separated by over 20,

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.230
maybe 20 or 20-some years.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.600
So one thing I talk to kids
about all the time is, you know,

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.410
you're never too old to improve.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.730
I mean, I could not draw all
that well when I started.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.030
You know, even when
I got syndicated,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.500
in my first several years
that the strip was out there,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.100
I look at those strips now,
I really, I kind of cringe.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.600
I don't like the way they look.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.800
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: But I can draw
well enough now that, you know,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.740
I can make the strip look
the way I want it to look.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
yeah, enough control.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.460
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You know, and
speaking of launching the strip,

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:41.140
I know that you launched it about
the same time as Dilbert, and --

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.440
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
he was a little before me.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: A little
before, but Scott Adams talked

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.860
about he was his strip originally
to be very much a more home-based.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.290
Have Dilbert be 80% in the
home and 20% workplace,

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.690
until his readers said, no,
here's where the heat is.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.030
Here's where you're funny is.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.800
You didn't -- you had a
different orientation originally

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.100
for your strip.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.400
Can you talk about that?

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.700
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, so I
thought it was going to do a strip.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.460
First of all, there were a lot of
comic strip families at the time,

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.220
sort of conventional family
units, a couple of parents,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.400
a couple of kids, you
know like Foxtrot.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.130
For Better or for Worse,
Calvin and Hobbes, you know?

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.470
So I said well, I've got to
be different, so I said, well,

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:31.220
Nate will have like a
single-parent home with a dad.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.330
And so I thought, well, I can
probably write a lot of good gags

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:40.120
about this single dad sort of
like a hapless guy, overwhelmed.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.800
You know, maybe he'll
try to date people

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.070
and you'll have these two
sort of rambunctious kids.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.950
So I thought it was going to
do sort of a domestic strip.

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.550
And then I realized
in pretty short order

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.340
that I wasn't all that
interested in that.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.430
That I was interested in school.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.100
Like school gags, teachers,
you know,

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.400
the stuff that happens in school.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.700
Schools are hilarious.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.480
You know?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.780
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's
where the funny is.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.080
That's where the funny is.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.430
So you launched stepping
out in 120 and then 135.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:10.950
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
Yeah, at the time,

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.710
it was the most successful launch
they had had in a long, long time,

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.130
and then it completely
went down in flames.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Can you
talk about how that -- that --

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.950
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yep, I can.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:26.730
So there was a -- so comic
strips are sold by a sales staff,

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.720
and they are divided into
regions of the country.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sometimes
they're offered bonuses, right?

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.630
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Sometimes
they are offered bonuses,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:39.500
and so United Media really wanted
to make a splash with Big Nate.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.630
And so they offered a
bonus for the sales staff

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.370
to see how many papers
you can sell Nate into,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:53.250 position:56%
and so the West Coast sales rep
sold Nate into a lot of papers, yes,

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:58.200 position:56%
but also fabricated a lot of things,
so that he could collect his bonus.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So you have
your hope building like --

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.170
I know when this same
syndicate launched me,

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.810
you would get like this rep.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.110
They just sold in LA.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.570
And you get these reports back.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.190
So you must have been like,
wow, I'm going like hotcakes.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.490
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:13.090
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And back
then, it all happened by mail.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:18.670
So I'm getting these sales receipts
saying you've just been sold

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.970
into the Chicago Tribune.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.810
You've just been sold into
the LA Times or whatever,

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.160
and I was absolutely elated.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.110
You know, I thought
my ship has come in.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.710
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
And then suddenly,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.490
and this was all even before the
strip started showing up in papers,

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.960
and then I started
getting other envelopes.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.580
And they were slips that
were a different color,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.300
and they were cancellations.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:46.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So the sales rep
who had done this, he actually died,

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:52.760
literally within days of the strip
debuting, and like all the sales

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.130
that he had made up, obviously,
went away, and a lot of the sales

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.430
that were legitimate went away,

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.420
because he wasn't there
to follow them up.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:00.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure, wow.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So I lost, in the
first year I was syndicated I lost,

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.440
I think, over half my papers.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh,
oh, that's brutal.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:11.420
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And my editor
had told me like you might lose 10

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.090
or 15% of the papers that
you get, but that's normal.

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:15.390
That's fine.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Not 50%.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:17.990
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Not 50.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.290
Not 50. So, but it survived.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:23.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did you go to the
funeral of that West Coast salesman?

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:24.850
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: I
sent a big bouquet.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.800
Okay, wow, so here we have --

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.240
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, that's
the first Big Nate daily ever.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It's
looking polished already.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.090
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Not to me.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:46.210
I mean, I look at it, and I
mean, visually, in some ways,

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.770
you can tell he's the
same character,

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.310
but he looks very different.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.690
You know, he's lankier.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.990
He's skinnier.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.290
He's taller.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I was going to
say he had more of the Bigfoot style

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.430
of cartooning with
the long legs and --

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.730
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, huge feet.

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah, so --

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.330
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
so that was the first one,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.920 position:56%
and this is another strip from the
very first week, when I, you know --

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.590
this is sort of indicative
of the sort

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.950
of gag I thought I might do a
lot of, with like his family,

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.030
these family conversations.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And you're still
even visually working out the size

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.490
of the balloons and the characters.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.480
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yep,
I'm working it all out.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.300
I mean, I knew that I always wanted
to do just the four-panel strip.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.000
I love the rhythm of four panels.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.990
So I've never done a daily
that was not four panels.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.840
I've never liked changed to three.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.250
I just like it.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.010
I like four.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.410
But you know, can we go back to
that last one just for a second.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.710
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Can you go back?

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.010
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So
humbling moment here.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:50.250
So just to show, to show
like that I -- oh, yeah.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.550
I like that gag too.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.750
But if we can't get --
if we can't get back

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.340
to the last one, that's fine.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.820
But Nate has this older
sister, Ellen,

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:04.710
and so I was showing this
early strip to someone,

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.720 position:56%
and he looked at Ellen, and he said,

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.650
"Who' is the kid in
the coonskin cap?"

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.180
And I said that's her hair.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.400
And you know, I could
not draw well enough.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.700
I've always had trouble with hair.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.650
Hair is hard to draw, and
that was how poorly I drew.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.450
I drew so poorly that someone
would look at this drawing of Ellen

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.690
and mistake her hair
curve for a coonskin cap.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.920
So I had a long, long way to go.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.570
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
this is Nate and his --

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.480
and Gina, the girl
that sits behind him.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.780
His tormentor.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: His
tormentor, sure.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.740
And more babes.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.550
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: This is the
only Big Nate book in existence

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.050
for like the first 18 or
19 years of my career.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.650
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: I had one book.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.040
It didn't sell at all, and
the strip was not, you know,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.710
it was sort of moderately
successful, but not really.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:59.390
And like every cartoonist I've
ever met, I thought, my God.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.830
If only I could find a way
to get my strip in front

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.490
of more people, especially kids.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
also, it's incredibly tough.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.400
It's one thing for four, five, six
years to figure I'm going to stay

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.040
in the same client
list and all that.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.340
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Right.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Now for 18 years,
you know, how do you maintain?

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.390
Because you have to
be very inner directed

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.760
about I'm just true
to what I'm creating.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, well, there
are bills to be paid, you know?

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:31.150
So you have no choice, but I
would oscillate back and forth.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:36.180
At times, I would really feel sorry
for myself and think, you know,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:42.650
I know that this is better than,
you know, like it should be

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.600
in more papers, and then
on the other hand, I think,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.900
what my complaining about?

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.860 position:56%
I'm making a living as a cartoonist.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.880
My childhood dream.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.000
You know? And as a kid I used
to think, I would be happy

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.730
if I could get a strip in
my parents' hometown paper.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.600
That would be good enough for me.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.650
So why am I complaining about
not being in enough papers?

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:05.510
And I'd go back and
forth between those two.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No, but the
joy to get to do it for a living,

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:13.430
I would draw coonskin caps for the
rest of my life if that would --

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.550
so this leads to, how many
people here know Jeff Kinney,

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.900 position:56%
the creator of Diary of a Wimpy Kid?

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:25.640
Not personally but -- so
there's a lesson, a moralness,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.420
which if you create anything
and you get fan mail,

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.600
always answer your fan mail.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.320
So can you talk about a young
Jeff Kinney reaching out to you?

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.800
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
Yeah, what the time,

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.570
he was a very young Jeff Kinney.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.990
I think he was 19 or 20.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: He was here at the
University of Maryland, I believe.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.060
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yep, and
he was doing a comic strip

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.360
for The Diamondback.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.950
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
And he sent letters

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.340
to several syndicated
cartoonists, or their advice,

00:21:53.340 --> 00:22:00.130 position:56%
and this was not his first letter to
me, but his second, and he wrote me,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.150
and I wrote him back, and
we sort of became pen pals.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah,

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:10.750
it looks like your mom
dated it, by the way.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And we maintained
this letter writing correspondence

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.940
for a couple of years.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.390
Basically, until he graduated
from college, and that he went

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.590
on with his life, and
we sort of lost touch,

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:31.030
but he always was incredibly
gracious, you know, in thanking me

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.790
for whatever sort of --
because he would ask advice

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:35.090
about trying to break in.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:39.030
At the time, you know, he wanted
to be a syndicated cartoonist.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That
was still the dream.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.070
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,
that was the dream.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Very much so.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:44.970
Yeah.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.270
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And there he is.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: There's Jeff.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:48.870
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
A happy-looking guy.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: A
very happy looking guy.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:55.350
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And so
years pass, and I am looking

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.610
at the Boston Globe, a newspaper
that I still subscribe to,

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.730
and I saw little thing down --
you know, a little advertisement

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:07.250
that said, "Diary of a
Wimpy Kid," and you know,

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:11.330
about an author signing and
reading at a bookstore in Boston.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.670
And I saw the artwork
before I saw the name.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.530
I said, that looks
like Jeff's stuff.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.870
And then I saw his
name, Jeff Kinney.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.600
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And
I said, he wrote a book.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.310
This is tremendous.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.280
And at the time, this was
before the Wimpy Kid --

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.760
this was his first book, and it
was just starting to get traction.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.290
So I tracked him down, I said,
Jeff, you know, congratulations.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:42.050
We got back in touch, and he,
long story short, he helped me.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:47.130
He said he had all those
years remained a big Nate fan.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.300
And he said you should
have a book deal.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.900
Wow.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.200
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And he was
growing his at this point

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.800 position:56%
to a half billion dollar enterprise.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.120
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
He was in the process

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:02.190
of becoming the 500-pound
gorilla of children's publishing.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.160
So that's a good guy
to have on your side.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So answer that
fan mail, because you never know.

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.250
Wait 18 years.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.730
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
So I got my book deal

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.140
to start writing children's
chapter books.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.430
These books, really,
because of Jeff Kinney.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
and he really helped kind

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.360
of readers rediscover and
reinvigorate that entire,

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.300
what I would call the
hybrid novel, right?

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.550
Where you have the
prose and the pictures.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:36.090
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Right, you
know, he says that he was writing

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.970
that first Wimpy kid
book for adults,

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.410
to look back on their childhood
in sort of a nostalgic way.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.240
He didn't even realize,
at first, he was writing

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.650
like the perfect kids' book.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.250
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And of
course, that lined notebook paper,

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.850
that's a motif that I had used
in the early days of Big Nate.

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I
was going to say --

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.450
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So, of course,
when I got back in touch with him,

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.870
I said you'll hear from my lawyers.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.470
[ Laughing ]

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.490
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And so he said,
you'll hear from my accountants.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
you worked it out.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:08.790
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: But no, I
mean, he and another author

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.860
and cartoonist, who is
here today, Dave Pilkey.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Sure,
Captain Underpants.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:19.420
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: You know, both
those guys have really, I mean,

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.670 position:56%
really, before those guys, if you
went into a school library and asked

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:28.200
for a book that had comics in it,
the librarian would say sorry.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.700
You know, it's going
to be old Peanuts.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.000
It's not going to be --

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: If that.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:34.600
If that.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.900
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: If that, yeah.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So because you
drew lined paper all those years

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.410
earlier, and he --

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:40.710
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Exactly, yeah.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And he creates
this, and so suddenly, now,

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.800
you have your own publishing
franchise.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.100
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: I do, yeah.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:53.000
So I did eight of these novels,
which are different for me

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.260
from the strip, because
I write the strip

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.320
for everybody, for
readers of all ages.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:59.620
So I had to sort of learn.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.360
I write the books for kids.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.970
You know, ages basically
7 to 12 or so.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.800
And so it's a different kind
of writing, but I ended up --

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.410 position:56%
I didn't know if I'd like it or not.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.920
But I really liked it.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.530
So I did eight of them, and
I thought eight is good.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Eight is good.

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.130
Eight is enough, as it were.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.430
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.030
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So this is,

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.330
I don't know if anyone
hasn't seen the books.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.630
This is what they look like inside.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:30.130
So I think sometimes I'm a little
mystified sometimes when I go

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.430
into bookstores, and I see some

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.630
of the books I see are
advertised as graphic novels.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.380
They're really not graphic novels.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.680
I don't do graphic novels.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
these are hybrid.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.280
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: These are --

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.950
but they're not illustrated
books either.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.660
So that's why I like the
name hybrid for them,

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.630
because they combine
the text and the comics.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, it did
you find yourself playing --

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.160
you know, each creator who work --
does these hybrids seems to play

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.450 position:56%
with text and picture and how their
own balance, and also, some of them,

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.750
I know, aim at like 6th
grade boys and girls.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.750
They're trying to figure out
what is their sweet spot.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.390
Did you kind of play with your
own balance levels, if you will?

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:16.990
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: I just think,
like I call myself a rhythm writer.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:21.710
So when I write, I just hear
the dialogue in my head.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:26.960 position:56%
I hear what the kids are saying,
and just the rhythm has to be right.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:35.130 position:56%
And it just suggests to me like
well, this I can just write in text.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.910
But this line, it's got to be
a speech bubble or you've got

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.760
to have a visual to
go along with this.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.330
So I can't really do find
it any better than that,

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.100
but I think a good rule of thumb

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.560
with kids is, you know,
show not tell.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.660
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: And they love
-- it's like, if you're going to --

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.070
what's funnier for a kid?

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:02.320
Reading a description of
someone getting hit in the face

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.810
with a pie, or seeing it happen?

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well, you opened

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.210
with pratfalls and
FOOMs and all that.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.590
So you came back to it.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.890
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, and so what
about Sandy and the Surfriders?

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.440
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Well, I picked
this, because one of the joys

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.120
of writing these chapter
books for me was

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:25.250
that I could be more ambitious
with the artwork, and you know,

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.000
more than I could with the strip.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.170
And so I could never do a drawing
like this in the comic strip,

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:36.590
but in a book, I could, and this
is also the reason the books took a

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:40.390
year to do, because these
drawings take a long time,

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.690
and I don't draw all that fast.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
but -- and let's just see.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.820
We're running out in there.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.120
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah,

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.840
and so those are compilations
of the comic strip.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.450
That's a sketchbook page.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
I love how that looks.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.040
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Those
are my tools of the trade.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.080
I'm very low-tech.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.480
I don't do anything digitally.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.340
Just paper.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
Sparky's same tools, right?

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.190
You haven't changed.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:09.660
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: That's my
favorite review of all time.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.640
Was that from -- that's
not from your editor?

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.570
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: That is from
the son of a Harper Collins editor.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.460
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Who read the
first Big Nate chapter book,

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.760
and that was his review.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.180
"Big Nate is going to
blow your pants off."

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:28.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow, wow, that
could have gone on the cover.

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:29.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, we used it.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
and then you get your own.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.840
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Well,
this is a creepy plush toy.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:39.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So you never
know how people's Big Nate fandom is

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:43.250 position:56%
going to manifest, and I found this,

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.490
and I've had nightmares
about it ever since.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I am now.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.940
He's alive.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.620
He's frightening.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.920
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: I
think it's the feet.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, oh
yeah, it always comes back,

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:59.810
and in the Netherlands where
it's [Dutch spoken] right?

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.110
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce:
Yeah, [Dutch spoken].

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I am Grute.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.120
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: So a
lot of different languages.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, yeah, and you
have the whole team here speaking

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.520
at Dave Pilkey and you and
Jeff Kinney and Stephan Pastis.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.790
So you guys are all killing it on
the bookshelves and the bookstores.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.780
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: Yeah, that's
from a fundraiser we did,

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:21.890
and what an honor and a privilege
to hang out with those guys.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:25.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And none of them
really draws a full head of hair.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.470
&gt;&gt; Lincoln Peirce: I know.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.770
I know.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:29.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I mean
he doesn't even try,

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.810
Dave Pilkey, with Captain
Underpants.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:36.070
So yeah, there's a
common thread there.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.770
Well, this is, you
know, congratulations,

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.570
because you are just a
tremendous storyteller.

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:46.390
Your characters come alive, not in
a creepy way like that plush toy,

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.510
but please give a big
hand to Lincoln Peirce.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.230
