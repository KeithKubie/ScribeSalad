Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Interesting. Um, what else should we be concerned with? We should be concerned with anything that North Korea's doing. Oh, absolutely. I have, um, spent a lot of time in North Korea. That's why I brought it up. Yeah. So I've, um, I advised the North Korea, actually North Korean governor on the establishment of a special economic zones, which I certainly believe if North Korea could have economic growth and integrate into the rest of the world, that would be great. And so I, I, um, when, so you want all this was in 2015 but I've been there twice. Um, cross the border from China and zigzag the country by land, visited 10 or 12 different sites. So spent almost two weeks by Lance. I've really incredible. I mean, North Korea, um, one, it's the most organized place I've ever seen. I mean, there's not a anywhere there's like on the side of the road, the, the stones are all raked.

Speaker 1:          00:54          There's not a stick. Every little line is drawn. It's like total control. There were very, in the, in the agricultural areas there were very few machines and very few farm animals. So I saw people pulling plows, like you know, usually have the animal in front of the plow and the person behind here, there were like two people in front of the plow and one person behind the people where the, the uh, the animals and we would go and visit these, the just, cause they didn't, they, a lot of the animals got eaten when they had their famine. And so we visited these different sites for these special economic zones and they would say like what they had done and what they were thinking about doing. And I would say like, how do you, do you know anything about the market? Like do, what are you going to sell here?

Speaker 1:          01:37          And they said, well we know about clearing land and building a fence. And then we left, we went to, to Pyongyang and I spoke to about 400 economic planners and I said, look, I know you have these plans that do these special economic zones. It's totally going to fail the way it's going to work. You have to connect to the market economy, you have to empower your workers, you need information flow. How else are you going to learn and adapt? So North Korea, it's a really dangerous place and now it's even more dangerous because, um, president Trump threw it was this kind of nonsensical hail Mary in these, these meetings with Kim Jong Un, there was no, never any indication that the North Koreans were planning on giving up their nuclear weapons. They never said they would. It's the last thing they would do because their goal is survival. And so there was this kind of head fake, which was like a PR stunt to be able to say, all right, we're having these, these meetings.

Speaker 1:          02:31          And of course the North Koreans weren't ever going to give up their nuclear weapons there. They're still not. So now things are ramping up. So North Korea in the last couple of days has started firing missiles again at the United States today and see us military seized a North Korean ship. So we're going back to this very dangerous place. And so I think we really need to do a much better job. We need much more considered. North Korea has, it's really, and these guys are really smart. I mean, I, the, I, they are various people say, well, these guys are poor. They must not be, I mean, like imagine like we're playing cards with them. We've got the whole deck. They don't have anything, have one card. And yet they're there. They're in the game. They're holding us to a, to a stalemate. And it's really worrying. And why did you go over there and like, w what, what were you thinking?

Speaker 1:          03:23          So I thought a lot about it because I have a background in human rights. Um, I was a human rights officer for the United Nations in Cambodia. I'm the child of a refugee. I have this very strong belief in human rights and that in supporting people in North Korea, they have about 120,000 people in the most brutal, brutal, horrific prison camps. And so when I was asked to be part of this six person delegation, advising them on the special, on the establishment of special economic zones, one instinct was screw them. I don't want to be part of this at all, but I also felt that if North Korea could have some kind of integrated economic development that would at least connect them to the world, that would create some kind of leverage and that would, uh, that would help, uh, help people. So I decided to go, um, and I'm glad that I, that I did, but this is, these are really hard issue people and, and it's very unfortunate that in, in president Trump's negotiations with the North Koreans, human rights was never once mentioned.

Speaker 1:          04:31          And I think that that's coming back to values. Like we have to be clear about who we are and what we stand for and be consistent in fighting for it. Do you think that Trump didn't bring that up because he wanted to be able to effectively communicate with them and not put them on their heels? Maybe. Um, but I feel like has had they done, I mean, I think that if he thought that there was a real chance of progress, but the hard thing was he didn't know much about the North Koreans. He has people and we have brilliant people working in the United States government and all of those people, all of the US intelligence agencies were telling president Trump that the North Koreans have absolutely no intention of giving up their nuclear weapons. Right. And so maybe he did think that he would charm Kim Jong gone, or he would say, hey, we're going to give you economic development or, or whatever.

Speaker 1:          05:19          But I think for most people who were observers of north who had watched it for, I thought that was not, uh, so we gave away a lot. So we didn't mention human rights. We suspended our military exercises. We gave them the legitimacy of a presidential meeting, which they'd been wanting for 30 years, and we didn't get anything back. So it had we gotten something back then you could say, well, that was a risk for taking maybe. Mm. Yeah. I haven't heard described that way, but I'm agreeing with what you're saying. What do you think he could have done differently though? I don't think the meeting should have happened with no is no, no, no conditions. There were no police. So if he had said, I'm open to meet with the North Koreans, which is something the North Koreans have always wanted, we could have met with the North Koreans anytime I immediately for the last 30 years, but in order to do it, they need to do this, this and this.

Speaker 1:          06:11          And if they do it, we'll meet like that would have been a legitimate thing. But what he said is somebody, the the, the North Korean, I'm inside the, the South Korean national security advisors peeked into his office and he, and he goes, hey, they wanted me to go. And it was like sure that, that seems like an interesting thing to do. And I think that with this diplomacy you kind of have to get something. And so we gave away so much upfront and the North Koreans weren't, didn't have an incentive to do anything in return was his perspective that it would be better to be in communication and be friends with this guy who's that was that what he was thinking would be, but we have real interests in the sense that we, we have large military forces in Seoul. We have a lot at stake. We have our closest ally, Japan who has had citizens abducted.

Speaker 1:          06:56          And so I think that was what he thought is like, let's be friendly. And then with the force of personal chemistry, um, everything will, will unlock. But I think that was always extremely unlikely. What do you think is going to happen to that country? I think eventually, and I've written this, I think eventually this regime will, will collapse under its own weight, but it's really held out a long time because you think of the collapse of the Soviet Union, they had enough, Soviet Union had enough bullets to survive. If they had said, you know, we're just going to shoot everybody at the Berlin Wall and every dissenter, they would still be, the North Korea has essentially murdered millions of people. So with famine and execution and, and, and, and prison camps. So I think they're going to stay for a while, but eventually, um, there will be leaders in North Korea who will come to the conclusion that it's safer to oppose the Kim family than to wait for the Kim family to come and get you.

Speaker 1:          07:53          And that tends to happen in these kinds of totalitarian systems where there's so little trust. There's so little loyalty. Jesus. Yeah. What is there, what other conditions like technologically, like what, what is their infrastructural on? So the general infrastructure is absolutely terrible. I mean, they have roads in the big cities that are actually quite nice roads because there's no cars. And so, um, but their infrastructure is, is terrible. I mean, all of their, their, um, power supply, they have brownouts blackouts all the time at their manufacturing is all being decimated. So it's terrible. But they have really focused their energy on building these nuclear weapons. Because they think that these nuclear weapons give them leverage to do things and to extract concessions and to get, uh, to get a bits. It's terrible infrastructure. So do they don't have an internet, right, but they have something similar but it only allows them access to a few state run websites.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Well average person doesn't have access to the Internet. So the way it works is it's all about loyalty. So you need three or so generations of loyalty to the Kim family to even set foot in Pyongyang, the capitol. So really? Yes. So it's not like you can kind of move around or whatever. It's like just to be in the capitol, like you have to have your loyalty proven and so average person out in the country, they don't have access to much of anything. They have a little bit more now than they did in the past. And then for this relatively small number of elites who are in largely in Pyongyang and in the other cities, which are like, there's a ring of defense around these cities and just to, to enter, you have to have all of these checks. Some of them have access to limited internet.

Speaker 1:          09:39          Um, but it's, it's, it's tightly controlled and it's not like you're kind of going on Google and look going wherever you want. Right. And they probably would get in trouble if they googled the wrong thing. Yes. And trouble. It's not just you trouble, like if you try, if, if my brother or my uncle does something that gets me in trouble with the regime, the whole extended family is out. And that means you either you go to prison camps or you're kicked out of Pyongyang. I mean, at this it's all about collective punish and people are terrified. And by that ruthless punishment structure that they've set up, that's how they've kept control of the country. And everybody's forced to rat on each other, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're, they're, they're actually the compelled to tell on each other for one thing that you did. If you don't, then what if you don't, then you are complicit because they, yes.

Speaker 1:          10:30          So that's, and that's, they're these horrible stories. I've met a lot of these, um, uh, of these people who are in the prison camps. Like, I have a, a friend of mine, I mean she was this 13 year old girl and her father, um, was a, like a low level North Korean official and then he was accused of something. And so this family that was privileged all of a sudden was, was out and just, just these horrible things in prison and rape and this little, I mean, now she's in the United States and incredibly positive and it's amazing how resilient she is. But this is like a real hell. It's a real, it's an issue. And I think that for us as Americans, as humans, we're less human when there are people who are suffering like this. Yeah, I agree. Now, um, you were traveling all over North Korea, but what were they having you do while you were so we would do is we would go from one of these special economic zones to the other.

Speaker 1:          11:23          And in each one it was kind of the same story. You'd get there, there'd be like a big field. The farmers had been kicked off, there was a fence around it. And then the group of, of the local officials would come and they'd have like a big chart and they have a plan. Like here's where we're going to build this building and here's, and I would always ask the same question like what are you going to do here? Why do you think you're going to be competitive? How do you know what the market prices are? How are your workers going to be empowered so they can change things? And many in the old days it used to be you just kind of have these automaton workers. Now workers are actually making big decisions and fixing things and they didn't have an answer to any of those questions.

Speaker 1:          12:03          And that's what happens when you have these totalitarian top down systems is that like if, if you, being creative is actually really dangerous. So if somebody says do x, you just do X. Wow. Yeah, no, it's, it's really incredible and it's, it's so sad because I spent a lot of time in South Korea and this is the most dynamic place. There's like I often I go to soul just to see what technology is going to show up here a few years in the future. I mean it's Seoul is like the future and then just 35 miles from soul is the demilitarized zone. Then the other side it's, it's incredible. And the real problem would be once they finally did get free of that community or the of that, uh, that mean you can call them whenever you want them dictator and that he and his family, what would they, what tools would they have?

Speaker 1:          12:57          Like how prepared would they be to be a Tom? Well it's really the good thing, the benefit that they have if there is, so here's my thought of what a scenario a scenario might look like. And I think eventually probably there'll be some kind of coup attempt against the campaign. Let's just say it succeeds. But that would probably result in another military dictatorship with another group. Well we don't know cause then I think immediately I think the Chinese would invade. Really? Yeah. Cause people think of the curve when people think of the Korean War from the early 1950s, they didn't go to the Korean War. It must've been the Americans fighting against the Koreans. But the Korean War, the two sides, where is America and the South Koreans fighting against the North Koreans and the Chinese, the Chinese did the most of the, uh, of the, uh, of the fighting. And so China and North Korea is the only country in the world that has a treaty alliance now with China, kind of like we have with Japan and with, and with South Korea.

Speaker 1:          13:52          And so China, their biggest fear is having a reunified Korean peninsula, al allied to the United States. So I think if there was a coup, the Chinese would immediately move in militarily. Then immediately there would be this call to have some kind of UN body. Um, and there would be a call for a UN authority. And then I think it would be agreed that the Chinese would stay and they just would put on blue helmets, um, like as a, as a UN force. And then we'd have to negotiate what happens next. And I think what the Chinese would do would be say, well, we'll leave when the Americans leave, is that, I think that would be what will likely happen. But eventually I think we're going to see a Korean reunification. And the good news of these reunified countries like eastern West Germany, is there's a whole system of law that is just, you just North Korea will be swallowed into South Korea. And then you have law, you have an infrastructure, and it'll take, you know, one or two generations. But I think that will eventually happen, and I'm hoping it can happen without nuclear war. Terrible, terrible bloodshed. But it's that it's going to be a big challenge. God Damn. Yeah. That sounds insurmountable. Yeah. Just hearing you talk about that all about North Korea getting absorbed by South Korea, I'm like, oh my God. Yeah. Luck.
