&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz:
Hi, good afternoon.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.080
Welcome to the African and
Middle Eastern Reading Room.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.750
On behalf of the
Geography and Map Division

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.600
and the Hebraic Section,
let me thank you

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.200
for coming to today's program.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.660
My name is Sharon Horowitz.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.580
I'm a reference librarian
in the Hebraic section.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.970
The Hebraic section began, or
considers itself to have begun

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.030
in 1912 with the receipt

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.280
of 10,000 Hebrew
books and pamphlets.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.230
Whose purchase was
made possible by a gift

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.920
from New York philanthropist
Jacob Schiff.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.960
From those humble beginnings,
our collections have grown

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.130
to about 250,000 items.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.000
In Hebrew, Yiddish,
Ladino, Judeo-Persian,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.440
and other Hebraic
script languages.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.980
The Hebraic section also
includes an important collection

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.690
of books in Geez, Amharic,
and Tigrinya, the languages

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.360
of Ethiopia, past and present.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.000
Our section's holdings
are particularly strong

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.690
in the subject areas of
Bible, Rabbinics, Liturgy,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.440
Hebrew Language and Literature,
Responsa, and Jewish History.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.700
Two of our missions
in this division are

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.060
to publicize our collection

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.200
and to bring people
into the Library.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.150
One way we accomplish this
is by holding lectures

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.300
and having programs such as the
one we are hosting here today.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.180
And now, a word about
our speaker.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.260
Professor Marcin
Wodzinski is a Professor

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.640
of Jewish History
and Literature.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.480
And the Head of the
Department of Jewish Studies

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.970
at the University
of Wroc?aw, Poland.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.430
The scope of his
academic interests range

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.790
from the social history of
Jews in the 19th Century.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.420
To the history of
the Jews of Silesia.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.970
Jewish material culture,
and especially the history

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.940
of Hasidism and Haskalah.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.290
His publications include more
than 100 articles in English,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.640
Polish, Hebrew, French,
and Czech.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.720
He has written an co-authored
and edited many books.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.920
And we are very honored to
have him speaking to us today

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.440
about his newest book.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.420
The Historical Atlas
of Hasidism.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.690
Professor Wodzinski's
interest in Jewish history

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.600
and culture began with
Jewish cemeteries.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.670
He learned Hebrew so that
he could read the Jewish

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.610
and Hebrew inscriptions
on tombstones.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.740
And he became fascinated by the
custom of Hasidic pilgrimages

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.660
to the graves of Hasidic rebbes.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.220
His interest is not in the
writing of the great leaders.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.610
But namely about the rank
and file of average Hasidim.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.390
And how they understood the
teachings of their leaders.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.750
Two items of business
before we begin.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.290
Professor Wodzinski's
book is available

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.800
for sale after the program.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.620
And he has graciously agreed
to sign for anyone who'd like.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.550
And also Michael
Klein of the Geography

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.440
and Map Division has prepared
a small display of interesting

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.490
and relevant maps related
to today's program.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.790
And they're on display

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.120
in our division's
conference room behind me.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.130
So please join us there
after the lecture.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.040
This event is being videotaped
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.340
There'll be a formal question

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.910
and answer period
after the lecture.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.570
At which the audience
is encouraged

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.330
to ask questions
and offer comments.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.050
But please be advised that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.980
and later broadcast
as part of this event.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.980
By participating in the
question and answer period,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.380
you are consenting to the
Library's possible reproduction

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.960
and transmission
of your remarks.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.510
And now, please join me in
welcoming Professor Wodzinski.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:56.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.340
&gt;&gt; Marcin Wodzinski:
Thank you very much.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.640
Thank you for inviting me here.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.940
Thank you for coming.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.240
I'm very happy to be here.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.160
Before I begin, let me
start with two comments.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.910
First of all, I was
very happy to.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.770
I was very happy to hear
about those 10,000 books

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.070
with which it, it began.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.790
Because my departmental
library has 10,000 books now.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.130
So maybe one day we will
be as great as this place.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.200
And second of all, I am
not sure you've noticed.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.010
But I'll be speaking about
geography of Hasidism straight

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.110
under the name of
Moses Mendelssohn.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.850
I'm not sure that, that
[inaudible] will stand it.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.250
But let's hope it won't
fall on our heads.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.810
[Laughter] And now, I believe
that all we here believe

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.270
in the importance of Hasidism.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.250
That is gathers us
here for the reason

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.390
that we recognize the
importance of the movement.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.060
And this might be for many
different importances.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.750
For some this is because
of the ideology issue.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.750
Or identity issue or
the [inaudible] issue.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.720
For some other it might
be anti-Hasidic sentiments

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.000
or some others might be
so-called threat of Hasidism.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.170
To contemporary Jewish
life as some say.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.860
So many reasons, but Hasidism is
indeed recognized today as one

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.840
of the most important
Jewish phenomena worldwide.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.430
And it actually captured
international attention far more

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.140
than any other Jewish
phenomenon.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.340
To give three examples.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.060
In Orlando, Florida, in
Disney World, there is, ex--

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.690
exhibition about
nations of the world.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.200
Israelis are not represented
by soldiers in uniform

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.620
or [inaudible] working
in kibbutz.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.160
They're represented
by Hasidic couple.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.760
The Hasidim who make
a small minority

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.040
of Israeli population today
are taken to be representative.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.120
To be embodiment of
what it is to be Israeli

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.960
or Jewish more generally.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.150
The saying in circles
in Moscow, there is a,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.460
there is a performance,
Nations of the World.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.060
Different animals
dressing in different garb.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.090
Two monkeys in Hasidic
dress also representing,

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.830
representing what is Jewishness.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.330
But maybe most spectacular is
case from Poland from Lublin,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.440
the town of well-known
Hasidic leader [inaudible],

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.080
the Seer of Lublin.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.840
When several years ago,
City of Lublin was looking

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.350
for a visual representation
of its 700 years of existence.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.050
That want to have kind
of cis-- visual icon.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.070
They make a competition.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.720
And the project that
won is entitled,

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.020
"The Eye of the Tzaddik ."

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.930
And this is important.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.630
This is the Tzaddik Horowitz,
the Seer of the, of the Lublin

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.230
who apparently, according to
tradition, could see from end

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.530
of the world to another.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.850
But he is taken to
be representative

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.030
of not of Jewish Lublin.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.330
Of all the periods.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.630
He is taken to be representative
of Lublin as such.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.970
And today, you have the
Eye of Horowitz of Lublin

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.290
on every [inaudible],
on every bath,

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.240
on every city announcement,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.270
everywhere you have
[inaudible] everything around.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.370
And mind you, this is
in the city of Lublin

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.340
which for all medieval and
early modern period was the town

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.640
of [inaudible].

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.420
That did not allow Jews
to live within its walls.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.430
And now not just a Jew, the
Hasidic Jew is the repre--

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.070
is the symbol of this town.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.660
I think this, this properly
captures importance of Hasidism

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.760
for Jewish and even more
so non-Jewish world today.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.280
As something is taken to be
representation of Jewishness

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.070
or at least traditional
Jewishness.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:46.260
And at the same time, as
I come to study Hasidism,

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.100
I to my surprise realized.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.410
That much of what
we believe we know

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.990
about Hasidism is
informed by stereotypes.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.490
Hasidic, anti-Hasidic,

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.290
and non-Hasidic ambivalent
stereotypes.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:07.110
But these are clichés
that blind both popular

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.930
and academic research
into Hasidism.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.240
From understanding
of what really shapes

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.810
and real phenomenon of Hasidism.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.320
Two images that I brought to
your attention on the left.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.920
This is well-known portrait
of the founder of Hasidism,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.280
Baal Shem Tov which is
not the Baal Shem Tov.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.440
This is a portrait, this
is well-known story.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.160
This is a portrait of
Baal Shem of London,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.130
not Baal Shem Tov from Poland.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.600
But this image circulates
worldwide as the image

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.900
of the founder, right?

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.220
This is, well, this is at
least a stereotype that many

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.520
of us know is not true.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.800
Second of that you put, that I,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.380
that I put in there
on the right side.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.990
This is what Hasidism really is.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.510
And for many people,
this image of something

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.690
like in Masonic Lodge, maybe.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.580
A sectarian group meeting
somewhere in hiding.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.650
To do their secretive customs.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.070
Is a dominant image of Hasidism.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.560
Which emerges actually
from late 18--

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.380
and early 19th Century,
anti-Hasidic debates.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.190
And of accusing Hasidism
of being a sect.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.280
This sectarian terminology so
strongly sticks to Hasidism

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.820
that it blinds people

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.680
from understanding
Hasidism is not a sect.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.690
And also if we say a sect
is sociological terms.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.360
It could be kind of neutral way

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.590
of describing the
structure of the movement.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.950
But obviously-- [phone ringing].

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.250
It's not mine.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:40.550
If, if, if I may say, you
know when Messiah comes

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.890
or comes back for somes.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.700
It will, the first thing he will
say is, "Turn off your mobiles."

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:50.350
[Laughter] And okay, now, now
coming back to now to Hasidism.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.710
The term of sectarian
or sect contains much

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.090
of Christian debate around this
sect, and it's not neutral.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.950
It's not descriptive.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:06.610
It's the label denigrating the
phenomenon which is insinuating.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.490
That categories that
do not belong

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.680
to the [inaudible]
really secretiveness,

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.240
closed-mindedness,
subjugation to the leaders.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.470
And all other things that
we imagine about Hasidism.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.730
By hearing the term
of sect of Hasidim.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.240
Freeing from this category I
think is critical to understand

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.010
that Hasidism was something
far closer to confraternity

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.010
or hevrah, brotherhood.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.720
And there were many
other brotherhoods

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.440
in Jewish communities in 18--
, 19-- , early 20 Century.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.690
Than to a sectarian structure.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.650
If we think about
Hasidism this way,

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.180
then immediately we
understand that the boundary.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.100
Social boundary between
being Hasid

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.100
and non-Hasid was much lower.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.570
And they don't function the
way we very often imagine.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.700
We have hundreds of
articles who have tons

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.860
of books describing
world of Eastern Europe

00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:02.750
in binary oppositional
terms of Hasidim and others.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.410
And I'm claiming these
categories are not true.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.010
Coming from these stereotypes,

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.730
the atlas that I'm discussing
today is focusing more

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:19.700
on spatial stereotypes
that many of us share.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.750
It comes from certain concept
of Judaism that is popular.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.710
And most widely, thanks
to an ex-Hasidic figure

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.570
of Abraham Joshua Heschel.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.070
Who is famously claiming that
Judaism is religion of time

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.540
and not religion of space.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.030
All the examples he was
giving for this came actually

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.860
from Hasidic tradition.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.360
And he was applying the
[inaudible] even more

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.880
than anything else as such
a phenomenon that is rooted

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.020
in time and not in space.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.760
Half a meter above the ground,
as you saw in previous slide.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.560
And actually this concept
got circulation especially

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.650
after the Holocaust
for obvious reasons.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.110
When centers of Jewish life.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.530
Centers of studying of Hasidism
moved from Eastern Europe

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.040
to Palestine and
Israel later on.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.990
To United States and Canada.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.280
And places very far from
actual physical locations

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.960
of where Hasidism
once developed.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.650
And it was very easy
for scholars of Hasidism

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.050
to ignore where [inaudible] is.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.670
Because we could not find
[inaudible] on any map

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.810
because no such a place
exists on any maps.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.240
It's Gora Kalwaria.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.000
Right? And it's very
easy to ignore difference

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.440
between Ukrainian Bratslav
of [inaudible] of Bratslav.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.210
And the German of Breslau,
[foreign language] for example.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.770
Because for some Brelaus

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.010
and Bratslav is the
same, essentially.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.790
And actually have
written article

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.880
that confused those two places.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.780
So I say it's critical to get

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.330
to understanding those
kinds of essentials.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.320
And this is one of few relative
advantages of being marginal

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.040
for myself being from Eastern
Europe and studying Hasidism is

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.570
that I'm closer to
those spatial, physical,

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.480
and social essentials
of getting to Hasidism.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.000
What I would like
to present to you.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.390
Depending on how much time I
will have will be two or three

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.890
of those stereotypes that
I think are very important.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.130
And, and too predominant.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.770
First of them you
see on the slide.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.020
A so-called Hasidic
conquest of Eastern Europe.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.170
The Hasidim march,
marching in their thousands

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.510
to conquer town-by-town and
turn it into Hasidic stronghold.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.550
Where do we know it from?

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.990
Of course all we know is that
Eastern Europe was Hasidic when?

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.930
How much? To what, what extent?

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.250
Well everybody eventually
refers to page six in book

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.900
by Shimon Dubnow, titled
[inaudible] which is saying

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.140
by 1800, all of Eastern
Europe, with exception

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.120
of [inaudible] was Hasidic.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.780
Okay. So my question is

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.180
where did you take
it from, Mr. Dubnow?

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.450
And then Dubnow give references

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.760
to [inaudible] political
literature saying

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.880
in late 18-- , early 19 century.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.380
"Beware! Hasidim like a pest.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.790
They are spreading over.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.350
Be careful not to allow
them to come to your town."

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.520
Okay, but are we really
believing in, in hyperbole

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.450
to capture reality or to
influence reality, rather?

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.040
Obviously that function
of political text

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.080
by the [inaudible] was different
than to give proper description

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.370
of demographic trend
of Hasidism.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.660
So my question is how can we
come to mapping the phenomenon

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.590
of this trend of Hasidism?

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.860
The idea would be to
have all the Hasidim

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.670
from late 18th century to
the Holocaust where they live

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:43.970
and how many they were.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.020
And to make this up, but not
such a map can ever exist

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.890
because there are no membership
lists for Hasidimists, you know.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.660
Instead, if we have any maps
of Hasidism, all they start

00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.050
with mapping important
[inaudible].

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.890
Several map of this kind exist.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.950
My problem is with
both categories.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.600
One with what it covers
and what is important.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.980
First of all, if
you map on one sheet

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.300
of map all the important
[inaudible] then you have

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.680
[inaudible] active
in mid-18th century.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.830
And [inaudible] active
in 1930s on the same map.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:30.930
This is as if mapping
American life of the Civil War

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.840
and today on the same map.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.810
It wouldn't give reality.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.580
This is blurring development.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.780
It's blurring the fact
that in mid-18th century,

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.080
Hasidism was nascent.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.690
And in the mid-19th century,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.650
it was huge first
in Eastern Europe.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:50.670
So instead of mapping
[inaudible] all in one map.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.750
I suggested divide
it into five periods

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.850
and do it slice by slice.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.740
And second suggestion.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.270
If I would be satisfied
with category of [inaudible]

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.150
and this you can
obviously understand.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.680
Who's important?

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.180
How we evaluate?

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.920
Is, is [inaudible] important?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.380
He wrote important
book that many people

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.710
in 20th century study.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.010
Was he important then?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.770
Back in the 19th century?

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.560
What we make importance
of [inaudible].

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.920
Was important for
people around him?

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.340
He was maybe minor figure.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.630
He was important Hasidic writer.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.010
But it's very difficult
to make any sense,

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.630
especially for cartography,
of a category of importance.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.210
So my simple response is it's
not important [inaudible]

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.750
of all of them.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.840
It's ambitious because
obviously we don't know all

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.140
of the [inaudible].

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.410
But fortunately, Hasidism's a
culture of memory, very much so.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.490
And commemor-- remembering

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.440
and commemorating Hasidic
leaders is important aspect

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.780
of Hasidic religious life.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:56.850
For this reason, Hasidic
communal memory preserves huge

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.150
numbers of those.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.400
After going through three
volumes of Hasidic encyclopedia

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.950
which was actually biographies

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:06.620
of several hundreds
of tzaddikim.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.640
We meaning [inaudible]
and myself

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.350
who made this set of maps.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:14.670
We came to number of
1,787 tzaddikim active

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.100
in Eastern Europe from
the [foreign language]

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.660
up to the Holocaust.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.090
And we divided those tzaddikim

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.700
into where they lived
exactly, in which places.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.620
And the periods they live.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.020
And out of this comes five maps.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:30.300
This is chapter 2-1
in the atlas.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.490
That you will see in a minute.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.720
That give totally different
image than the Hasidic conquest

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.820
of Eastern Europe by 1800.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.270
First map is 1740 to 1772.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.270
And what you see on
this map is essentially

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.310
that you don't see much.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:51.900
Few dots. The dot
is the place of life

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.090
of a tzaddik, of Hasidic leader.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.570
The bigger dot, the
bigger number of tzaddikim.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.810
Here we have one or two
or three tzaddikim leading

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.110
in a place, right?

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.450
And all of them in
area of Podolia.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.950
I, I have to say
here, do we have a way

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.000
to show it on the screen?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.770
Yes? Podolia and Volhynia.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:17.690
Very few of them in
[inaudible] to become Galicia.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.570
Southern Belarus,
Central Poland.

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.340
There are very few dots.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.060
Very few Hasidic
leaders at that time.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:29.870
If we move to the next
period, 1772 to 1815.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:34.130
Which according to
Dubnow, all this area

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.280
of Eastern Europe
was Hasidic already.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.050
We have visibly higher
number of Hasidic leaders.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:44.820
But we have also huge areas
not covered by the dots at all.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.860
So we first of all see that
instead of Podolia here.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:55.590
It is more Volhynia in this area
that is becoming more Hasidic.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:01.470
And there's very significant
move northward and westward

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.920
of Hasidic leadership because
the main principle area

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.290
for Hasidic leadership today,
that period, is Galicia.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.080
Here. And southern
parts of central Poland.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.750
But look at northern
part of central Poland.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.050
Look on Belarus.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.350
Look on Lithuania.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.980
There is none.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.670
So this is obviously
not the high point

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:25.560
of Hasidic conquest
of Eastern Europe.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.390
And this is 1815, right?

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.360
Fifteen laters that
Dubnow would put his point.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.080
This is 1815 to 1867.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.360
And I say this is a
remarkable change.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.480
Somebody compared to a rush.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.300
But I think it was a
hostile approach to Hasidism.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:49.570
It's obviously showing huge
advancement of the numbers

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:53.300
and also territorial expansion
of Hasidic leadership.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.990
The assumption behind
this [inaudible] I need

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.260
to mention here is kind of
trivial, it seems to me.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.960
That the number of
leaders roughly corresponds

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.550
to the number of followers.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.950
And that the places
of the residence

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.220
of leaders roughly
correspond to the places

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.820
of residence of their followers.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.520
It's not always the case.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.230
There are many exceptions that
I, we can go into listing.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.780
But the general rule
for macro image

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.760
that I'm presenting
now is very correct.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.930
So what we have here is
farther shift to the west.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.180
Farther strengthening of Galicia

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.310
and southern part
of central Poland.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.190
And first Hasidic leaders
appearing in territory

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.920
of Hungary and Romanian
territories.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.890
So we for the first time
in mid-19th century.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:46.300
Hasidic leadership crosses the
border of former [inaudible]

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.910
to go southward of
this territory.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.500
Alright? So this is,
so this is happening.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:56.690
This is possibly, if we compare
number of leaders to the number

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.560
of Jews living in
those territories,

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.670
mid-19th century is the peak

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.080
of Hasidic infiltration
of Eastern Europe.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.250
The peak of their influence.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:10.650
In some areas, like in Galicia,
it is obviously higher than 50%

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.750
of Jews in Galicia
being Hasidic.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.440
With some areas they are
nearly totally Hasidic

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.980
like central part of Galicia.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.530
And some others that
are significantly less.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.800
So this is, so this is
a case of, of Galicia,

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.810
mid to late 19th century
Galicia as the peak.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.680
Not 18-- , 1800, right?

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.380
And yet another map:
1867 to 18-- to 1914.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.770
You see essentially the
same pattern as before.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.620
But simply far bigger numbers.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.270
Those numbers correspond.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.420
They're bigger, but they
correspond to the huge increase

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.670
of number of Jews living
in these territories.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.410
Because this is the time of very
dramatic demographical increase.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.410
So relative numbers are
not higher than before.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.180
Though obviously we see
a strengthening of the,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.480
of the Hasidic leadership.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.480
And we see also very
nicely territories

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.630
where Hasidic leadership
appears.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.740
And where there are
no Hasidic leaders,

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.550
i.e. there are no Hasidim there.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.510
And final map may
be most surprising.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:18.200
Is the interval.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:24.040
And what we see here is most
powerful Galician settlement

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.050
that you have still.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.490
Which is this appearance
of Hasidic leadership

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.290
from eastern territories.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.160
Here. very few Hasidic
leaders here.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.370
And this is obviously an
outcome of the pogroms

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.870
of the First World War.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:50.370
But even more so of Soviet
anti-religious policy

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:54.520
that is actually combatting
all forms of religious life.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.490
And especially as
visible as [inaudible].

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.090
Being Hasid was very
strong expression

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.540
of religious identity.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:03.840
Not only their [inaudible]
but also in dress.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.140
In outside look.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:09.490
So the Hasidic leadership was
the first to, to be persecuted.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:14.380
And second phenomenon that
you, that you see in this map.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:19.220
Is amazing concentration
in metropolis.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.680
Something that we
had not before.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.250
Here it is worse.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.320
So [inaudible], Vienne,

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.610
[inaudible] and other
big cities.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.510
The phenomenon did
not exist before.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.230
And this, there are several,

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:36.090
several factors leading
Hasidism to what it is there.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.910
First of them is
the First World War.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.230
Today people tend
to forget about it,

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:43.310
especially that the Holocaust
overshadows importance

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.610
of the First World War.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:45.910
But if you look on this picture,

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.610
this is not the Warsaw
ghetto, right?

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.910
Though it looks so.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:53.810
This is the city of the town of
[inaudible] on Russo-Galicio,

00:23:53.810 --> 00:24:00.360
on the Russo-Austrian
border in eastern Galicia.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.010
As, as [inaudible] was
describing [inaudible].

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:04.270
This was a very prosperous
town leading

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:07.430
from this border location.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.660
Having 700 homes.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:15.890
In 1914, right after the
war begin, 23 remained.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.640
The city was simply pulled down.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.280
One of few buildings standing
there was a famous Hasidic

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.740
synagogue of the [inaudible].

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.180
Of the famous [inaudible].

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:31.820
Who escaped to Vienna as many
dozens other Hasidic leaders

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.980
escaping and abandoning.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.720
And many of them
abandoning Galicia,

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.910
abandoning territories of war.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:41.500
Many of them did not return
to Galicia after the war

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.450
because in [inaudible] there
was no life after the war.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.400
Also because the
city still exists

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.470
but it was all burned down.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.500
[Inaudible] returned
to his place in 1924.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.870
And actually does a
very conscious attempt

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.540
at rebuilding nonexisting town.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.710
And this is widespread
phenomenon.

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:03.340
Many of those who did
not escape to Vienna,

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.910
they escaped to other
large towns.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.860
Because living in small
towns was very dangerous.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.580
Because the first
population to be exposed

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.760
to atrocities of the war.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.370
To extractions to, to
looting were people living

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.670
in small communities.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:22.570
Because they were the easiest
victim for armies, for looters.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:25.060
For whoever would
pass the place.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.170
So a lot of Hasidic leadership
is moving to big cities.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.450
And remains there after the war.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.060
You have the map
of Hasidic leaders.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.610
It's around 80 Hasidic leaders

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.080
and their movement
during First World War.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.670
And what you see here is
essentially that overnight,

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:49.650
Vienna is becoming the
epitome of [inaudible].

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.700
You have like, like 40 Hasidic
leaders suddenly moving from all

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.730
over eastern Galicia and
Volhynia and coming to Vienna.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.130
And you have, and you have
every second Galician Jew

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.670
at that time is escaping
to Vienna.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.970
I [inaudible] imagine.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:07.970
So this is huge mass of, of,
of refugees, refugees of war.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.690
Settling there and turning
Vienna into the center, right?

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:15.350
The same to a smaller scale
is happening in Warsaw.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.150
Though this is not
outside of the Warsaw.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.780
This is actually the big
metropoly into which tzaddikim

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.480
from small places escape.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.110
The same you have
later on in Kiev.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.680
And this is something that is,
that has tremendous importance.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.110
Not only for physical structure.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:37.270
In a sense where a Hasid is
traveling to his Hasidic leader.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.970
It has tremendous
importance also

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.920
for spiritual life of Hasidism.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:48.150
Because the fact that up
to the First World War,

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.050
tzaddikim were living in small
towns was not accidental.

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.490
There was obvious choice.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.830
Several of the tzaddikim
did live in bigger towns

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.130
like [inaudible] but it
was always commented.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:00.790
It was something exceptional

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.670
that there must have
been a reason to this.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.550
And it was given
in Hasidic stories

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.210
that the [inaudible] was leading
the Warsaw for certain reason.

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.210
And he left Warsaw because it
was impossible for the Hasidic

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.610
to live in sort of big city.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.490
Now it changes.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.620
Why tzaddikim were
living in small towns?

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.850
Because a small town was a place

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.860
at which Hasidic court
could establish its ritual

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.670
of being separated
from normal life.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.430
You had to go on one or two

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.480
or three days', three,
not the three.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.660
The pilgrimage to
get there, right?

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.350
You had to wait at the gates
of the court to get accepted.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.600
You had to wait for
the visit to the rebbe

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.400
and the visits were very
often at all this time

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.030
of night, two AM, four AM.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.780
To make it into something
special.

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.090
This is not part of
your daily routine.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:55.740
This is something special,
this is something sacred.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.870
That is how Hasidic
courts functioned.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:06.130
And now try to imagine you,
your rebbe, [inaudible] here.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.930
You meet him on the stroll
of the city of Warsaw.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.850
He's just marching somewhere.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.500
This distance between the leader

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.720
and the follower is
disappearing suddenly.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.630
The bubble breaks.

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.560
And you can imagine
you have three rebbes

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.020
in the same tenement
house as you do.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.540
So what you do, you
start hopping.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.250
There is a phenomenon that
today is the sociology

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.550
of religion called

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.390
that [inaudible] Hasidism
religion a la carte.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.850
And I say Hasidism
a la carte emerges

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:45.930
as a huge phenomenon during
the First World War and after.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.980
We have memory memoirs
testifying to the fact

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.820
that Hasidim are not so much
Hasidim of the rebbe anymore.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.720
They are Hasidim in
more general sense.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.590
They come to one rebbe once,

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.690
to another rebbe for
another occasion.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.010
This one is nicely singing
so we go to sing with him.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.950
The other is giving
better sermons.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.490
So we go to listen
to his sermon.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.850
The other one is a miracle
maker, so we go to him

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.950
for a miracle if we need a
miracle at this occasion, right?

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.400
So this changes entirely
the structure

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.760
of spiritual interaction
between leader and follower.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.890
And this is what I believe
you can read from those maps.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.980
And then with the information
that the maps provide,

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.430
you get back to narrative
sources

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.800
which give you plenty
of this information.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.030
The rebbe on the slide is
[foreign language] one of the,

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:38.100
actually the last Hasidic leader
to leave Soviet Union in '64

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.460
when he was, he was
freed from exile.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:45.530
And so this is, so this
is a huge phenomenon

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:49.970
that is changing Hasidism
and more importantly,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.180
I say that what we know
as Hasidism today is

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.030
to a big extent, an
outcome of this change.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.310
Of things that happened
during First World War.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.270
What we have as metropolitan
Hasidic leadership happens

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.710
exactly then.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.890
What we see as the development
of modern [foreign language],

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.480
it happens exactly
there as a change

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.960
in ideologies of Hasidism.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.770
It's happening exactly there.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:18.760
The interwar period
creates structures

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.280
of contemporary Hasidism.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.640
Obviously the Holocaust ends
Hasidism in Eastern Europe

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.740
and makes this new reappearance
in Palestine and North America,

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.210
Israel and North America.

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.960
So this is obviously
another turning point.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.260
But if we think

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.850
about institutional way
how Hasidism functions.

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.940
Most of the changes happened
before the Holocaust.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.120
They are not the
outcome of the Holocaust.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.610
And I think this is very
important to understand

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.690
where contemporary
Hasidism comes from.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.880
Another concept that I would

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.800
like to ask is how Hasidic
leadership functions.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.240
And this is again
rooted in a stereotype

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.560
of you know this
heavenly leader.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.920
Somewhere above the
heads doing things.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.370
But we know very little actually

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.080
about the interaction
of the two.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.400
Even if he was the
celestial leader.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.330
Being you know that,
that, that, that channel

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.620
between the heavenly
bounty and us here.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:25.620
He is bringing the blessing
of the God, of, of God to us.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.690
It's obviously the
actual relations

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.860
that I wanted to study.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.770
And this I believe can be
approached only if we realize

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.150
that in that golden period of
Hasidism, from late 18th century

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.100
up to the Holocaust,
the vast majority

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.810
of the Hasidim did
live at the court.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.930
And very often they did not
live close to the court.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:49.140
They had to travel to him.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.010
The vast majority of their
religious life was happening not

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:54.310
at the court.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.750
Not with the rebbe,
with the tzaddik.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.860
It was happening
in their relation

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.770
within their communities,
within their shtiebel.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:04.550
In their prayer houses.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:09.620
And the prayer house seems
to me so far totally ignored

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.510
as a prime site of
the development

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.190
of Hasidic religious life.

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.490
How did it look like?

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.750
What were the ceremonies?

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.560
What were some of structures?

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.490
What was the experience
of being Hasidic there?

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:23.360
Not at the court.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.300
And the map, chapter five speaks
about prayer houses, shtiebel.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.930
This is, this is
beautiful picture.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.190
I'm not sure you
can see it clearly.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:35.820
Because this picture
was exposed twice.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.880
One, there is a space, and
then you have figures here

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.060
who look like ghosts there.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.950
I feel it's very telling because
this is a picture shortly before

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.250
the Holocaust.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:51.670
So those people are disappearing
from this shtiebel very soon.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.560
This is [inaudible] in Volhynia.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:58.640
Now what I managed to do, and
this is I believe a good example

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.110
of why in my humble opinion,
atlas is the best response

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.480
to the questions I ask.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.810
Is to map it through
not qualitative.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.410
But not sort of [inaudible]
but quantitative approach.

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:16.770
Maps are a marvelous
research tool today

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.100
because with the advent
of digital humanities,

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.470
they allow us to do things that
were not available to us before.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.670
We can process amount of data

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.990
that our minds would
not make sense of.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:34.780
So for this map, I managed to
gather in variety of sources.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.090
Information on nearly
3000 Hasidic shtiebel

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:41.510
in Eastern Europe
between 1900 and 1939.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.810
It was quite a work.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:46.190
I would say 12-years' project
to get to have all of them.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.860
But once I get them,

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.110
with traditional tools,
I would get nowhere.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.810
Because I could not understand
what was the pattern behind it.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.540
By putting this into
databases and processing it

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.120
with so-called GIS, geographical
information system tools.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:05.880
We can come to seeing the map
as the endpoint of the research.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.430
But as a start point.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:12.800
I did a series of maps that show
me different patterns emerging

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.100
from this data.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.810
By different questions I can ask

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:20.720
by combination of
[inaudible] keys.

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.730
And from this, I start my
analysis how Hasidic life can

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.030
be understood.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.590
Thanks to getting into this
information about their shtiebel

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:30.890
and how it's structured.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:35.090
So first information that comes
from here that you see on those.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.810
Is how Hasidic leader--

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.930
how Hasidic hierarchies
intra-Hasidic hierarchies

00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:41.230
looked like.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.550
In pre-Holocaust Eastern Europe.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:45.710
Which groups dominated
in which territories,

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.790
and which were smaller.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:52.410
If you, if you take for example
central Poland, this territory,

00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:57.640
you know that 22% of all
shtiebel were Gerrer.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.940
Ger was the dominant group.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.510
It was followed by 12% of
Alexander, followed by--

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:07.430
[ Foreign Language ]

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.730
Which is not Polish court.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.260
And on and on.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.960
Once you get this data, you
immediately understand what is

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.520
about the conflict
between Ger and Alexander.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.710
We have a lot of
narrative sources about it.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.140
But we know very
little how it emerges.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.940
It's not, it's nothing
personal, I say.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.300
It's simply structural.

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.110
These are two dominant
groups competing

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.250
for dominance in territory.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:32.750
And this is replicated
in Galicia.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.410
In Galicia, you have what?

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:38.410
You have Belz and then you have
[foreign language] followed

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.630
by [foreign language],
Bobov and others.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.440
So you have another well-known
case of [foreign language]

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.850
as the conflict for leadership.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:51.640
You understand the structures
within Hasidic world,

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.680
explaining to you how
the structures look.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.490
But this can go much farther.

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.320
I will not show you many
maps of this chapter

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.200
because we have no
time for this.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.930
But this is one of them.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:08.040
By dividing Eastern
Europe into squares of 35

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.520
by 35 kilometers each.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.770
Which roughly gives
the, the, the, the,

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.540
the footage of an average
district in Europe.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:22.970
I counted all the shtiebel
in each of those quarters.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:25.300
I did not count it myself
with a pen, you know that,

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.450
that the software did it to me.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:31.030
But it was, it was
possible to count for each

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:34.560
of those squares what
is the dominant group.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.220
And what emerges out of
this is very clear map

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.240
of which Hasidic groups
dominate which areas.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.760
It's not kind of
general central Poland.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:49.530
You can very clearly see
that Ger is dominating center

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.410
and eastern part
of central Poland.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.230
But it's not dominating
all of the western out,

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:57.290
outreach because this is
a territory for Alexander.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:01.520
You beautifully understand that
the dominant Galician group

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.900
of Belz is not dominant
in all of Galicia.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.760
This is a, the green here.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.570
It's dominant only in
central part of Galicia.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.790
And if you move west, you
have [inaudible] Bobov.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:19.360
If you, if you move east, you
have [inaudible] an offshoot

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.860
of [inaudible] dominated there.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.830
So you get into much
deeper knowledge.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.500
With this you can even get

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.010
to understanding the
spiritual relation

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.480
between tzaddik and followers.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:35.350
Because once I calculated, I
cannot talk about it, sorry.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:39.490
Once I calculated relation
between the size of group

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:43.430
and distance between the
court and the shtiebel,

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:47.320
then you realize there is
very consistent correlation

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.620
between those two.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:52.380
And you can establish
kind of typology of course

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:55.200
by their distances
and size of the group.

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.450
And it's not only physical.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.860
This is about the
type of leadership.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:05.650
Because very naturally for the
big Hasidic group, say Ger.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.730
Which has been mentioned
already.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.570
If Ger was in [inaudible]
of Poland,

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.820
apparently having
100,000 followers

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:15.880
which is obviously
inflated number.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.330
But obviously tens of
thousands of followers.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:23.610
And then average distance
between the court and the,

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:27.670
and the shtiebel was
something like 150 kilometers.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:31.410
It's very ob-- very obvious
that the vast majority

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.560
of Ger Hasidim never
saw their leader.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.850
If they came to the
court once a year,

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.590
or maybe not even once a year.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:42.540
They were together with ten
or 20,000 other followers.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.530
And they could not get
close to the rebbe.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:48.730
It was more like the
soccer match than,

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:51.310
than a religious
experience of being close

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.370
to your intimate guide.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.630
Because well, if you're wealthy.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.850
If you were important,
if you were learned,

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.630
you obviously get
close to the leader.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.530
But for average rank
and file Hasid,

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.180
and I'm interested in them.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.480
It was very far.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.310
Then you understand
that those courts had

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:13.420
to develop alternative forms
of religious affiliation.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.620
On the other hand, you
have courts like Bobov

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.840
which in absolute numbers is a
small court in the [inaudible].

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.050
It's less than one percent
of the shtiebel belonging

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.790
to Belz, to, to Bobov.

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:27.440
Less than one percent.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.490
Even in Galicia, it's
less than four percent

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.520
of the shtiebel that are Bobov.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.600
But if you go into the
westernmost part of Galicia

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.430
into [inaudible] then you
have 16% of them being Bobov,

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.730
and this is the dominant group.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.690
Because all others are smaller.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:47.630
There are areas, districts
in westernmost part

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:52.840
of Galicia where, where
Bobov is more than 50%.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.140
What does this say?

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.820
Bobov is less successful
than Belz?

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.770
No, it established
different relation

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.660
between the leader
and followers.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.480
For Bobov rebbe and Bobov
Hasidim, it is more important

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.830
to be in a group of big
cohesiveness to be close.

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.580
To be recognized at the court.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.380
To be able to travel there.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.940
That's different type of,
of religious [inaudible].

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.940
Different charismatic
leadership.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.380
Distant charismatic leadership.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.050
And close charismatic leadership
that different groups display.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.740
And this is again,
this is confirmed

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.040
in our [inaudible] sources.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.670
If you go to Pintchiv
for example,

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:33.260
you read that the Pintchiv
was very proud of knowing all

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.210
of his Hasidim by name.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.510
He knew all of them.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.830
He knew all their problems, the
[inaudible] were coming to him.

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:43.560
They were close to him,
and he was close to them.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.360
And they appreciated.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.540
But this was very small
group at the same time.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.150
Should we say Pintchiv was
less successful than Bobov?

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.670
I say no. This is
simply different model

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.320
of religious leadership.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.690
And this you get again
from maps and from numbers.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:01.340
And of which I believe
for many is surprising.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:07.000
Okay, so coming to the
final section that I would

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.380
like to speak for a little.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.480
We had still ten minutes, right?

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.870
This is the picture taken
of the [inaudible] rebbe at,

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:20.280
at Auschwitz, just before
he goes to the gas chamber.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.280
And the obviously turning
point in my history

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.520
in what I present
is the Holocaust.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.960
And I'm mapping the way to
death of many Hasidic leaders.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.870
It's 80 Hasidic leaders that
I mapped on this map to show

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:39.680
where Eastern European
Hasidism dies.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.350
And it is nothing surprising.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:44.800
You see that the major
place for death of Hasidic--

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.900
of tzaddikim came from
Hungary is Auschwitz.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.720
You see that mostly for Hasidim

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.300
from central Poland is Warsaw
ghetto and then Treblinka.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.080
You see the places that,
that, that we know.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.830
But I think it's very
important to map it.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:03.110
Not only to know
it, but to prove it.

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.410
How it looks.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.430
So and is very important to me,

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:12.460
this is very important
chart to, to show death.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.200
But also to show resurrection.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.070
Because after chapter seven,
there's chapter eight.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:24.040
And we have it beginning
with this picture

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.240
of young Hasidic boys
in [foreign language].

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.400
Boys, not girls because girls
don't go out so easily, right?

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.670
Which is another topic
which appears in atlas.

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.300
The gender issue.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.990
But my question, my
most essential question

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.750
that I ask not these boys.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.240
But I ask in chapter
eight, in chapter leading

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.620
with contemporary post-war.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.910
And Contemporary
Hasidism is again, as,

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.210
as you could realize so far.

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.070
I like simple question
and simple answers.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:57.680
So the simplest question to
ask that I heard many times.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.910
And possibly some of you
asked this question already.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.280
Is how many there are.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.410
How many Hasidim
there are today?

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:07.520
And I would say this was
to my biggest surprise

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.470
that sociologists say
no, it's too difficult

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:12.170
to answer this question.

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:15.160
It's always too difficult to
answer any question, obviously.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.080
It doesn't mean we
should not try to do it.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.180
And obviously there are good
studies trying to, to, to, to,

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.480
to answer this question.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.710
There is beautiful article
that is based on census polls

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.050
and combining this with
different information.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:35.340
It is trying to do it for United
States and there are other ways

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.620
that people are trying
to use school records.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.110
Political data on voting to kind

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:43.740
of extrapolate the
rough number of Hasidim.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.150
There are researched into
the [inaudible] of Hasidism

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.430
for individual locations.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.540
Like Williamsburg, often
gives you groups like Belz.

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.590
But we don't have
an overall picture.

00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:56.440
And I think this overall
picture is very important.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.140
For anybody interested
in Hasidism.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:03.040
And especially for those who
preach about Hasidic conquest

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.850
of contemporary Jewry.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:08.000
And because after all, we
need to know if it's true.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.670
And how far it is true,
or how far it is not.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.280
So after some investigation.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.150
I realized there are
indeed even today,

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.390
there are not Hasidic
membership lists.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.690
This would be best, right?

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.230
To have the, you
know one unified list

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.530
of all the Hasidim worldwide.

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:25.830
And to map them.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.130
Unfortunately, not.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:31.080
But there are very close
substitutes to this.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:35.100
Every big and [inaudible]
number of small, mid-size,

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.670
and small Hasidic groups.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.590
Every couple of years
issues a telephone directory

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:41.550
for this specific group.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:48.650
And these books function very
often like membership lists.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:54.080
They are with few exceptions,
they are very reliable

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.980
because obviously each group
wants to include everybody.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.690
It's important to
be in the book.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:02.600
If you are not in the book,
it might cause troubles.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.100
You might be not
[inaudible] and one of us.

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.410
And it is also important
that those groups want,

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.980
want to prove their
demographical size

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.420
because it's important
factor, right?

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:20.840
If you have mayor of New
York coming to you as a rebbe

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.610
to beg for your votes.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.320
You say, "See telephone
book of my group.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.080
It's, it is big.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.870
I can give you those votes,

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:34.090
and you give me relative
value for this," right?

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:36.730
So this size is important
for the group.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:41.290
On the other hand, there
is very clear protection

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:42.980
from inflating these numbers.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:44.280
And actually there were,

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.030
there was several years ago
this interesting debate.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.220
Within Hasidic [inaudible]
about one [inaudible]

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.990
against other [inaudible]
stealing claims.

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:53.520
Because they wanted
to show bigger.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.900
And the other one was protecting
them for the same reasons

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:00.200
that the groups want
to keep it appropriate.

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.110
They don't want the
others to, to come victor

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.660
on the basis of fake
data, right?

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.570
So those data are very reliable.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:11.030
I, I confronted those numbers
with a number of those.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:16.880
And I, I came into possession of
44 either telephone directories

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.330
or substitutes for
telephone directories.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.160
Which small groups,
there's no need

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.460
to issue telephone directory.

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.970
They have just Excel
sheet they are sending

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:28.190
to all the folk within them.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.600
So that was essentially
the easiest.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.040
Because somebody could, from the
group would just send it to me.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.070
With telephone books, I had
to find a Hasidic friend

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:39.440
or a friend who has a Hasidic
friend who would be ready.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.430
To give it to me and to trust

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:46.880
that I will not misuse this
book for, for some reasons.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.430
Some groups have those books.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.250
Some groups are too
small to have it.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:55.240
If you have all your fellow
Hasidim in your smartphone,

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.030
there's no need to
have a telephone book

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:58.600
for it, obviously.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.050
But still, I get to 44 of those.

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:02.470
Forty-four, if we know the,

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:07.100
roughly speaking 130
Hasidic groups today.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.830
This is minority.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:14.380
But if we realize this is 44
of 100 that covers all biggest

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:18.300
and mid-size groups, that
I did not miss any group.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.820
That is larger than
the 1000 families.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.020
Then the number of 44
comes to more than 90%

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:28.270
of Hasidic population worldwide.

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:30.170
And I managed to
process this data.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:34.260
This data are very good
because they give city,

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:35.870
telephone number, of course.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.860
Address and a zip code for
every Hasidic household.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.330
And it's possible to have
every Hasidic household pinned

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.760
to the map for exact
location of this.

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.040
And what comes out of
this is, this is the map.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.490
This is the list.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.050
There are maps.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.420
Most generally, the
number that comes

00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:00.810
out of this is 129,000
Hasidic families worldwide.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.930
If we accept sociology's
claiming

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:09.180
that every Hasidic household
today is 5.5 members.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:15.810
It comes to a number of between
seven, too low or too high?

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:17.110
[Inaudible response]
No, it is because I,

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.410
I'm afraid you are thinking

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:19.710
about ultimate size
of the family.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:25.100
And not the average size: 5.5
for a family includes families

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.480
that have all their
children out already.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.780
Staying alone.

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.800
Or families who don't
have children yet.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.390
Or families who just
start having children.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:36.870
And families who at this moment
have all ten children at home.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:41.590
If you take into average 5.5 is
a very reasonable estimation.

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.160
And it is proved
by counting of many

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.200
of those in small locations.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.800
It's, it's not been done
on all Hasidic families,

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.680
but it's confirmed by a
representative samples.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:49:00.170
So it comes to as I say 129
families, and between 700,

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.400
[inaudible] Hasidim worldwide.

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.730
Which in comparison
to the number

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.810
of [inaudible] Jewish
population comes

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.620
to the number of five percent.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.640
The relative number
is five percent

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.730
of Jews worldwide
at Hasidim today.

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:17.820
Okay, and now I come to
now fifty-plus percent

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.730
in Galicia in late 19th century.

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:23.740
And now tell me whether five
percent is a lot of not.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.750
I believe that, the, the, the,

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:28.730
the rumors about
Hasidic conquest

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:33.770
of world Jewry today
far premature.

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:36.500
It's, it's obviously
not a dominance.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:41.140
And even more so if we
realize what's the nature

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:44.440
of the Hasidic settlement, the
structure of Hasidic settlement.

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.340
And if we realize that the
vast majority of Hasidism live

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.640
in close neighborhoods.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.230
I mean, where dense
neighborhoods

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.530
of their population.

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:56.830
In so-called enclaves.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.800
The term is not proper, but
like cities like [inaudible]

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.510
or Williamsburg or Borough Park.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:06.170
Then we need to realize
even more so that

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:11.580
with those five percent
Hasidic presence is very strong

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.880
at some places.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.740
But it's highly localized.

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.330
Outside of those
places, it's tiny.

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.590
It's almost nonexistent.

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:24.330
Those numbers when spread
into individual countries come

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.610
to United States
having around 42%.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:30.160
Israel having around
48% of Hasidim.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.200
And in both of those countries,

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.410
the Hasidim constitute
five percent.

00:50:35.410 --> 00:50:38.710
The size of the square is the
size of the Hasidic community.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:41.720
The color is the ratio,
is the percentage, right?

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.390
So yellow is five percent.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:47.360
Deep yellow for United
Kingdom is ten percent.

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:52.320
Now many green small squares
which is small community

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.350
and very small percentage.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:58.990
The only color that
sticks out is the red.

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:02.040
For 33% of population
being Hasidic.

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:06.280
And this is the, this is the
country in which you don't hear

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.280
about Hasidic conquest.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.870
And this is Belgium.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:12.640
Which is an outcome
of two factors.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.360
On the one hand, there's huge
Hasidic settlement in Antwerp,

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:19.240
and on the other hand,
Belgium is a country

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:22.560
of very weak Hasidic
populations, 29,000 of,

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.570
of them only, altogether, right?

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:29.310
So this, this 10,000
oh Hasidim in,

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:36.270
in Antwerp make huge
proportion of, of Belgian Jews .

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:40.090
This numbers, because
as I was saying we know

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:41.920
which street they live.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.530
Which zip code each family has.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.530
And which rebbes they frequent.

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:48.850
It can go into much
deeper divisions.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:52.200
So what we have here is the
next map is what are the

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.260
biggest settlements?

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:58.120
The biggest bubbles being
Williamsburg, Borough Park

00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.420
on this side of the pond.

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.410
This is also [inaudible]
Crown Heights.

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:07.560
New Square, Spring Valley,
Lakewood, and other--

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:16.280
Miami, Los Angeles, and
Montreal, of course.

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:17.650
How could I miss it?

00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:18.950
[Inaudible]

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:23.510
On the other side,
this is Jerusalem-- .

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:31.270
[ Foreign Language ]

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:32.570
This is what you get..

00:52:32.570 --> 00:52:34.860
But what you get also
with the pie charts is

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:38.460
that you can divide how it
splits into individual groups.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.820
And you can understand
dynamics of different groups.

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.510
You can compare it to
ideology of those groups.

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:47.030
And then you understand
why Satmar which is two

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.760
of three Hasidim in [inaudible].

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:53.290
And you go to Israel, and you
have very few Satmar Hasidim,

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:54.590
right?

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.890
And you see how they
are distributed.

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:58.460
And then you go into [inaudible]
and you go into [inaudible]

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.310
and you have no Satmar
Hasidim at all.

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:02.700
And you understand
it is connected

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.880
to the location of this place.

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:08.050
Behind or not behind
the green line

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.450
in occupied territories, right?

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:11.000
So it goes into division.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.720
And allows us internal
hierarchies

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.860
of Hasidic politics there.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.550
And you can come into numbers

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:22.140
with New York City having
26% of world Hasidim.

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:23.440
Jerusalem next.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.430
Then Borough Park being part
of this New York City, right?

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:31.610
Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
[inaudible] and on, right?

00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:33.770
Antwerp, you have almost 1800.

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:36.070
Montreal, 2000.

00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.380
Coming back into this map.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:45.220
This can be also divided
into individual groups.

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:49.620
That we know possibly to
surprise of some of you.

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:53.680
That [inaudible] is still
the dominant group today.

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.880
And i, I, I know the reason

00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.680
for assuming [inaudible]
is dominant,

00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.090
because they have the
biggest [inaudible].

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:00.900
They have the best visibility.

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.290
But it doesn't mean they
are the most numerous.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:07.010
Of course you can claim
that Satmar is divided

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:09.970
into [inaudible]
so it's not 26,000.

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:11.950
You can divide them by 13,000.

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:13.370
So it is still below [inaudible]

00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:15.800
but then you can say
[inaudible] is also divided

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.200
into [inaudible]
and [inaudible].

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.370
Well, we won't go
into the division.

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:20.670
Ger is not divided.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:22.030
It's 12,000, right?

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:23.420
And Belz and all others.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.840
So, so the, the maps
are presented.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:28.190
They're, all maps and,
and the end tables.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:31.370
And it can go, it can
also present, yeah.

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:32.750
I'm finishing right now.

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:36.860
It's, it can also present how
much individual groups are

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.390
divided into locations.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:40.760
And how they compare
between themselves.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.860
And whenever I have telephone
directories for then and now,

00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.550
as sociologists like to say.

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:50.140
I have the map of Bobov
20 years ago and today.

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.280
And we can see how their
settlement is changing.

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.830
What is dynamic of those groups?

00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:58.000
Over period of time?

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.180
And we can see where
[inaudible] are living.

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.160
So if you want to know where
to go for the [inaudible],

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.820
you get to chapter
eight for point four.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:08.560
And you open it, and then you
can do Hasidic a la carte.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.540
You can hop between
Hasidic Williamsburg, right?

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.880
Because you have
their locations.

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:19.050
And you can see how
[inaudible] is distributed.

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:22.750
And how it differs
between 1999 where the,

00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.850
where [inaudible] houses
and where they are today.

00:55:24.850 --> 00:55:27.090
And what is that,
what are the numbers.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:28.400
And you can go even farther.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.180
You can go also into culture
geography of Hasidism.

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:33.740
How do we know that this
[inaudible] Galician?

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.140

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:39.040
for defining [inaudible]
Hasidim as Galician?

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:40.970
And on and on.

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:44.970
And how Jewish settlement was
divided-- no time to talk about.

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:46.630

ask me challenging questions.

speak to the mic?

&gt;&gt; Marcin Wodzinski: Okay,
I will repeat the question.

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:07.280
&gt;&gt; So that it's on

can't hear you, sorry.

[ Inaudible ]

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.730
The question is about
possible correlation

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:42.890
between economical factor and
the move of Hasidic leadership.

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:46.230
From Russian territories,
Podolia and Volhynia westward

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:48.250
to Galicia and central Poland.

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.560
I don't think is such a factor.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:55.690
Galicia at the time is the
poorest area of Austrian empire.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:58.500
And the, proverbially poor area.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.830
So this is not for
economic reasons.

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:02.280
And even more so, I want to,

00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:06.000
to point to possible
misinterpretation

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.300
in your question.

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.600
Because you speak
about the move.

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.790
And I was speaking about
the movement itself.

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.730
But it's not people moving.

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:15.150
This is centers moving.

00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:17.430
They disappear here
and appear there.

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:20.420
So it's not actual
people moving the place.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:24.920
Leaders in Galicia die
and in Podolia die.

00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.440
And there have no new leaders
appearing in their place.

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.330
While many more new
leaders appear

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:32.420
in Galicia, in central Poland.

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:36.130
So the movement is not of
actual people with their feet.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:41.090
It is more movement of the
movement of Hasidism, right?

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.390
Yes, please.

00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:46.170

in how many got out,

&gt;&gt; I mean how come
there's any left?

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:57.090

deliberately came

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:00.800

little villages.

and then finally with -- .

that so many people--

how did they get out?

repeat to the microphone is.

How did it happen that any
Hasidim survived the Holocaust?

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.380
And this is very good question.

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:24.420
Because it's very few
of them that they did.

00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.850
Hasidim, we know very
little actually what was,

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:28.160
what was happening to Hasidims.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.830
We had great research

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:32.960
about Hasidic thought
and the Holocaust.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.120
And the leading scholar of
this issue sits with us here.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:41.950
But I say together with this,
we know amazingly little

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:45.740
about actual faith of the
Hasidim during this time.

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.130
And this is something
that is more general.

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:49.430
Not only for Hasidism.

00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:55.120
This is more general
scene of historiography.

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.460
That is tending to
abandon religious groups

00:58:58.460 --> 00:58:59.760
and religious life.

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.550
And to ignore it,
especially for modern times.

00:59:01.550 --> 00:59:04.510
I think we know too little about
what was happening to them.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:06.080
We know, we can assume.

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.710
And we, we have some
anecdotal materials confirming

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:11.570
that as you were indicating.

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:13.710
Hasidim were very
often the first victim

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:17.090
of the Nazi oppressors because
they were the most visible.

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:20.310
If somebody was a Jewish doctor.

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:24.540
Dress, dressed in European
dress, speaking Polish

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.980
of Czech or whatever, Russian.

00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:29.880
Living life of their
neighbors, it was very difficult

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.400
for German army to
recognize he's Jewish.

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.390
Maybe polish or Ukrainian or,

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:37.410
or Lithuanian neighbors
would help Germans eventually

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:38.710
with this.

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:40.520
But in the first stage,
it was not obvious.

00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:43.660
The first Jew to be
approached and ridiculed

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:46.890
and massacred or killed.

00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:50.130
Were obviously Hasidim because
they differed by the outfit.

00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:53.040
By the, by the, by they,
how they looked like.

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.610
So this very clear.

00:59:54.610 --> 00:59:56.130
Also, if you go farther.

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:57.580
You obviously understand

00:59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.460
that for this well-educated
Jewish physician,

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:02.490
it was much easier to hide.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:05.890
Because he had two
things to offer.

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:08.220
He looked like a gentile.

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.410
He know the language,
he knew the language.

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:15.210
He had Polish friends also
for whom he was a doctor.

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:18.590
And he had also something
to offer.

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.840
It was a good to have a
doctor in hiding, right?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.590
Just in case.

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:26.470
And we have actually
testimonies of Hasid.

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:27.770
What could he offer?

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:30.150
A prayer. He knew no Polish.

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:33.670
He could not, even if he wanted
to pretend to be non-Jew.

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.350
He had no ways to do it.

01:00:35.350 --> 01:00:37.630
Even he if he cut his
beard, changed the dress.

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:41.200
He would look Jewish because he
had no other ways of behavior.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.100
He did not know nothing of
how it was to be [inaudible].

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:48.400
Because he spent far more of
his life within Hasidic world.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.350
Than those incorporated people.

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:57.200
So obviously, very clearly
we have [inaudible] leading

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.230
to decimation of the Hasidim
during Second World War.

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:02.720
very few of them survived.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.020
I have two maps.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.320
I show one of them only.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.930
That place of death
of the tzaddikim.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:08.620
Which is showing 80 of them.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.140
And there's another map
that I wrote of, to,

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.940
to survival of several
tzaddikim.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:16.590
And on this map, I
mapped ten of them only.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.080
And this I did on purpose,

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.420
to show this proportion
between those two.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.330
But still, some of the
Hasidic leaders and some

01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:25.770
of the Hasidim survived.

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:27.820
Some of them survived in camps.

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.300
Some of them survived
in Soviet Union.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.400
Some of them found themself

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.510
in the Russian zone
when the war started.

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:38.730
And then because of
anti-religious policy

01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.130
of Soviet Union, they
were expelled to Siberia.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.680
And they were lucky to
be expelled to Siberia.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.790
Because many of them
survived there.

01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:47.310
In harsh conditions,
but they did.

01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:49.450
And eventually they made it out.

01:01:49.450 --> 01:01:52.560
There is beautiful
picture of Hasidic Jews

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.930
in [inaudible] in atlas there.

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:57.330
That's a surprising place
for them, but it happens.

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:00.030
So this is how they,
how they survived.

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:04.080
Those numbers were extremely
low after the Holocaust.

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.130
And there was quite a,
a common understanding

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:12.110
that Hasidic world
doesn't exist anymore.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:16.900
It's mostly thanks to
demographical factors.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.490
The fact that Hasidic families
are by nature more numerous.

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:21.790
They have more children.

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:24.900
Than non-Hasidic
Jewish families.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.520
And the very conscious,

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.720
long-lasting educational
culture, spiritual guidance

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.960
from Hasidic leadership,
by those few who survived.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.010
That they managed to
build communities.

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:42.770
And they provided safe haven to
those few Hasidim who survived.

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:46.630
And the first of them
would be Bobov rebbe.

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.510
Who [inaudible] the Bobov rebbe
died during the Holocaust,

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:54.170
but his son survived
quite miraculously.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:55.850
You wanted to ask a question?

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.510
And then, and then I-- .

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:12.330
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:13.630
Thank you.

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:15.670
The question was if out
of Hasidism a la carte,

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:17.160
a new Hasidic movement?

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.680
Or semi-Hasidic movement
emerged?

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.630
No, the nature of Hasidism
a la carte is the lowering

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:24.490
of affiliation.

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.630
So not creating the movement.

01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:30.270
Of course Hasidism a la
carte had huge influence

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:34.310
on creating neo-Hasidism
which is not a movement.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:37.790
But it is a cultural phenomenon
very important from beginning

01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:39.090
of the 20th century

01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:41.120
and especially important
after the Holocaust.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.420
Where many people

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:50.190
of non-religious communities
affiliate with some concept

01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:53.020
or behaviors of Hasidic world.

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.780
And take it as inspiration.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.570
And put it into new context.

01:03:56.570 --> 01:04:01.590
Some Hasidic groups today are
also strongly inspired by this.

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:06.950
And [inaudible] being the most
visible expansion, ex-, ex-,

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.250
example of this development.

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:12.960
Which is taking forms of
kind of New Age religion

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.070
in some sections of Breslow.

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:16.590
So this is, so this
is phenomenal.

01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:21.620
But I wouldn't speak about a
new movement that comes directly

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.070
from this Hasidism a la carte.

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:28.360
But I would say about
creation of the huge spectrum

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:31.160
of positions between
staunch Hasidic

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.100
and non-Hasidic identities.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:37.360
Of people who are Hasidish,
semi-Hasidish, counter-Hasidim,

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.810
sometimes-Hasidim, ex-Hasidim.

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.660
But still respecting Hasidism.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.330
And all those positions.

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:45.880
And as I just heard to--
today in the morning.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:48.270
This group is growing today.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:56.250
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:59.510
Early 1900s, you say, right?

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:05.520
[ Inaudible ]

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.180
There were many, well
Hasidim were under-represented

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:12.400
in immigrations from
late 19th century.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.440
Because for many
Hasidic leaders,

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.740
United States was not the golden
[inaudible], the golden state.

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.100
It was a [inaudible],
the [inaudible].

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:23.950
Non-kosher country.

01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:26.010
And this was for the
reason that United States

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:27.310
or America in general.

01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:29.900
Was understood as secular place.

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.070
The place where you are supposed

01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:35.250
to lose your traditional
Jewish identity.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:36.960
Which was indeed the case.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.230
Still many people from Hasidim

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:42.480
and of Hasidic origin
were coming

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.890
and were establishing their
Hasidic prayer houses.

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:49.080
And in Lower East Side,
this is the map for 1918.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.650
There was a number of those.

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:54.840
It is still, they are
under-represented.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:58.220
And it's very clear
that if you go deeper

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:01.060
into those Hasidic shtiebel,
there are how you say?

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.360
Ex-Hasidic.

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.980
They keep [inaudible]
they keep Hasidic prayer,

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.450
prayer tradition.

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:10.450
They keep tradition of
being from localities.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:14.250
And having association
to a specific rebbe.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:17.570
But they are not
behaving Hasidic anymore.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:21.850
At the same time, they very
nicely-- I'll give you the,

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:25.110
the [inaudible] after
[inaudible] okay?

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:29.090
It's, on this map, you see
Hasidic shtiebel divided

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:33.000
in Lower East Side into those
who are in the eastern part.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.800
And they are Hungarian
and Galician.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.040
And those who are in the western
part, they are Polocian Russian.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.060
So even on this side
of the pond,

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.630
they keep their distinctions.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.770
Their [inaudible]
distinctions from the Old World.

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:49.510

it's covered in the atlas.

is possible to map outreach

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.270
of Hasidic groups today or
after the war, more generally?

01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:30.260

sources for this, unfortunately.

to phone books again.

listing all [inaudible] houses.

In 1999 and 2016.

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.750
And the deep blue is
the size of the number

01:07:57.750 --> 01:08:00.010
of Hasidic houses
in given countries.

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:06.000

light-blue is 2016.

were no places before 1999.

01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:41.040
I think that but also to an
extent, Kazakhstan, India,

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.250
[inaudible] it's
very strongly proved

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:49.240
that [inaudible] is strong
wherever Jews are weak.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.570
As a community.

01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:56.120
[Inaudible] is developing on
the peripheries of Jewish world.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.990
They are conquering territories
where Hasidic, where,

01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:01.560
where Jewish communities
are weak.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.080
And this is actually something
that is exactly opposite

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.020
to the dominant Hasidic trend.

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:10.010
Because Hasidim today
[inaudible]

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:15.480
by all mean avoid places where,
which have weak Jewish presence.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.780
For obvious reasons.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:20.150
To be [inaudible] you need
a really good orthodox

01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:21.890
[inaudible] infrastructure.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:24.170
You need to have a butcher,
synagogue, [inaudible]

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:27.460
and you need to have this
butcher and that butcher.

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.750
You know, it goes
very, very deep into,

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.120
into establishing
structures for this reason.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.490
The vast majority of
Hasidim live in metropolis.

01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:37.590
In huge centers where you
have all this infrastructure.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.240
And [inaudible] is
exactly the opposite.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.210
And I think it is
fascinating about [inaudible].

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:45.510
Again, what you can read
from telephone books.

01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:57.090
[ Inaudible ]

01:09:57.090 --> 01:09:59.400
No, no. You have
individual households,

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.430
one, two, three, four.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:05.550
Each of them has, you have
the first name, last name.

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:08.930
Place of the telephone
number, zip code.

01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:10.730
Street, city.

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:14.630
And I had to read all of those.

01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:18.170
By the name of the city and
to put it into the registry

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:19.510
under the name of the city.

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:22.950
And then to sum it up and
then I could have numbers.

01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:27.020
Two thousand families
living in Montreal.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.320
So that's how it goes.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.970
There's no shortcut,
unfortunately.

01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:32.850
There's no way to
do it, you know.

01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:34.780
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:36.450
Unfortunately, no.

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:39.590
Well, when it was an Excel file,
I could arrange it by the place,

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:42.100
and then to do the just sum up.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.720
But for all other books.

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.600
And actually those books
are not arranged by place.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:52.060
But [inaudible] I had
to read line by line.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:56.970
Satmar book is that size,
600 pages or something.

01:10:56.970 --> 01:10:59.980
And I had to read
it line by line.

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:01.660
Fascinating read.

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.040
[Laughter]

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.340
I think that's right.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.640
This right?

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.940
Thank you very much.
