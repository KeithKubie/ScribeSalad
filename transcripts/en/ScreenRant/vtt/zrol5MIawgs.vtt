00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.020
You read it all the time in magazines and
online, but it is true when they say actors

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.180
are just like us.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.879
They order coffee, they go on walks, visit
the dentist and most importantly, they love

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.760
Disney movies as much as we do!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.270
Or maybe even more.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.410
These actors may play serious Hollywood roles,
but their hearts are filled with pure Disney

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.410
magic.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.270
Check out these 10 actors who love Disney
movies more than you do!

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.270
Chris Evans
Who would have guessed that the man who plays

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.270
Captain America in the MCU is also a major
Disney fan?

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.270
Well, the secret was revealed when the cast
of “Captain America: Civil War” stopped

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.270
by “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to promote the
film.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.270
The cast was asked to guess what Disney movie
Evans had memorized all the songs lyrics to.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.270
While the correct answer was “The Little
Mermaid,” Evan’s love of Disney didn’t

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.270
stop with just that one film.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.270
He admitted that there were at least 5 other
Disney movies that would have fit as the correct

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.270
answer.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.940
Tom Hiddleston
Another MCU vet, Tom Hiddleston, is known

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.510
for his epic roles in “Thor” and “The
Avengers.”

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.350
But the Hollywood superstar has revealed he
is also quite the Disney fanatic.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.109
At the D23 expo in 2013, Hiddleston joined
costar Christina Hendricks to talk about their

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:48.329
film “The Pirate Fairy.”

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.570
However, fans wanted Hiddleston to prove his
Disney knowledge with a solo of “The Jungle

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.070
Book” song “Bare Necessities.”

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.880
And, without any hesitation, the 32-year-old
English actor busted out into song as the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.140
crowd cheered him on.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.870
He later revealed he once sang that song at
an audition and has always been a huge Disney

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.390
fan.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.330
Julie Andrews
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.250
actress famous for portraying Mary Poppins
in the 1964 film has a fondness for Disney.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.860
Well, to be more accurate, the actress has
a soft spot for the Disney songbook.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.350
In fact, she has an entire album dedicated
to her favorite Disney tracks.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.790
The album includes songs like: “Part of
Your World” from “The Little Mermaid,”

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.700
The Bare Necessities” from “The Jungle
Book” and “A Whole New World” from “Aladdin.”

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.761
Lana Parrilla
It’s not too hard to believe that the Evil

00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:42.770
Queen from ABC’s fairytale drama is a Disney
fan.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.830
However, it is a surprise who she relates
to the most.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.770
Lana Parrilla revealed she adored Ariel as
a child, but found as she got older Ursula

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.770
was more fascinating to watch.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.200
She even mentions that the evil sea witch
had some help in developing the character

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.470
of the Evil Queen in “Once Upon a Time.”

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.130
Jennifer Morrison
Another “OUAT” actor, Jennifer Morrison

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.170
has also admitted that she too is a big Disney
fan.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.480
In an interview with Hypable, Morrison reveals
her favorite characters are Cinderella and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.480
Alice.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.790
She explains the latter by saying, “I was
a very misunderstood kid.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.569
I was a little slow to develop socially.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.459
I did well academically but my social skills
kicked in later in life.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.140
I was an outsider, so I identified with her
sense of being an outsider.”

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.530
Kristen Bell
Kristen Bell, who voiced a character in one

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.409
of Disney’s biggest films, is fittingly
a big Disney fan.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.900
Before landing the role of Anna in “Frozen,”
Bell told Huffington Post, “It had always

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.450
been on my bucket list to be in a Disney musical.”

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.280
She also revealed that her favorite Disney
classic lies between “The Little Mermaid”

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:58.310
and “Aladdin” as one of them is always
on a loop in her house at all times.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.540
Idina Menzel
The other star of “Frozen,”, Idina Menzel,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.920
has revealed that she has a lot of Disney
movies in her favorite list.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.730
But only one holds a special place in her
heart.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.189
In an interview with Digital Spy, Menzel,
who plays the Ice Queen in “Frozen,” revealed

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.400
“Lady and the Tramp” was her all time
favorite Disney film.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.549
It holds a special place for her because it
was the first movie her grandfather ever took

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.379
her to see.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.870
Josh Hutcherson
“The Hunger Games” heartthrob Josh Hutcherson

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.019
is absolutely in love with the Disney film
“The Lion King.”

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.569
After naming the movie as one of his top favorites
in more than one list, he gave a bit more

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.569
detail.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.780
The 24-year-old actor revealed “The Lion
King” was a staple of his childhood.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.709
And he even admitted he went to watch it in
theaters again when it re-released in 2012.

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.150
Hutcherson said, for him, the movie held so
many morals that had been part of his life

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.150
since he was younger.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.790
While it’s great he can carry life lessons
from the film, we can’t help but picture

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.260
a young Hutcherson singing “I Can’t Wait
To Be King” at the top of his lungs.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.180
Terrence Howard
It’s hard to believe that Terrence Howard

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.230
holds a Disney classic like “Mary Poppins”
as one of his all-time favorite films, but

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.650
he indeed does.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.279
According to Howard, the film has so many
wonderful jewels of knowledge.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:11.720
He also found some life lessons in the film,
like how to be successful in life and learning

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.030
that a person’s greatest success is to be
happy.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.380
It’s incredible that this film can still
show him aspects about life.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:26.350
But we just want to watch this movie with
him and have a sing-along.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.360
Jeremy Renner
When Jeremy Renner isn’t busy starring as

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.910
the superhero archer Hawkeye in “The Avengers”
films, he is probably thinking about his favorite

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.720
Disney movie—“The Jungle Book.”

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.030
When asked who his favorite “Jungle Book”
character was, Renner said: “OOOH!

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.820
You can't have a favorite character in the
Jungle Book, they're all amazing! Shere Khan

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.060
is amazing - Baloo is probably the closest
- I think Khan has the best voice, but Baloo

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.500
is the best character.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:05:21.630
Classic Disney film.”

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.330
