00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.710
First, the kill test.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.380
Doug.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.540
[music playing]

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.330
Welcome to our
kilij kill test.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.960
[laughs]

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.040
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.620
I will take your kilij
and deliver killing

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.210
blows this large side of beef.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.960
Let's see how deadly
your weapons are.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.920
Connor, you're up first.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.250
You ready?

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.080
I don't know.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.750
Let's do it anyways.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.210
Let's do this.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.750
I'm excited to see
Doug attack this carcass.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.540
My only real concern is how
Doug feels about the handle.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.920
Because if it's not comfortable,
then it's not a good blade.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.750
[rock music playing]

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.170
Nice.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170
[exhales]

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.330
Connor, your blade is sharp.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.790
This lacerates deep
into that meat carcass.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.420
One issue I had a little
bit was with the handle.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.420
On the first impact,
I felt it rotate

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.790
so I had to adjust with it.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.920
But this, sir, will kill.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.210
Thank you, sir.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.620
Brian, you're up next.
You ready?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.380
Absolutely.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.080
Let's go.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.620
Let's do this.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.380
[rock music playing]

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.960
Nice.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.000
Sweet.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.580
Yeah.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.460
First, off the bat,
that's a sharp blade.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.080
It's so curved over here with
the bounce being forward allows

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.500
for a slicing action that
digs in and continues to cut

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.080
as I'm drawing the blade.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.830
The handle feels good in the
hand to where I can index

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.330
and tell where it is
cutting all the time.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.420
It will kill.
- Nice.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.120
Thanks.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.120
Thank you.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.620
Next up, the strength test.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.790
J [inaudible]?

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.290
OK.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.250
This is going to be fun.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.290
Here we go.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.670
Tons of fun.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.170
As you see, we've got
some nice, sturdy oak

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.830
barrels over here.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.330
So what I'm going to do is take
your finely crafted weapons

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.170
and bash them repeatedly
into these barrels.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.170
Now, what the blades do to the
barrel doesn't really matter.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.000
What matters is what the
barrel does to your blade.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.710
Connor, you're up.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.880
You ready?

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.880
Uh, sure, let's--
let's do this.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.830
[sighs]

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.380
[rock music playing]

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.790
[shouting]

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.710
Oh.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.960
Connor, we've got a
couple of problems here.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.920
Your blade torqued
out to one side.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.250
[exhales]

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.750
The other concern I
have is your handle.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.420
My hand is numb.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.750
There was so much shock
coming through here.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.750
And your handle tapers
from front to back.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.750
So any time I'm
swinging, my pinkie

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.420
is slamming into the back end.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.750
Yes, sir.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.170
Brian, how you feeling?
You ready?

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.210
Oh, great.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.250
I feel great.
- Oh, great?

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.920
- Let's do it.
- All right.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.580
Let's go for it.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.670
All right.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.210
The sarcasm is overwhelming.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.040
After watching J
beat on Connor's blade,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.250
if I walk away from
this unscathed,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.040
it's going to be a miracle.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.210
[rock music playing]

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.710
[shouting]

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.710
Oh.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.710
All right, Brian, got a little
bit of a wavy highway here.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.540
A little bit.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.790
Striking here, the whole blade
just kind of twisted around.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.620
You're not going to be stabbing
straight with this thing

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.250
anymore.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.250
But on the plus side, your
edge is still razor sharp.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.750
Thank you.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.290
Bladesmiths, you've both
done some amazing work.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.290
But the judges'
deliberation is complete.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.750
And they've chosen our next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.040
And that champion is--

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.620
Connor, congratulations.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.330
You are our new "Forged
in Fire" champion.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.750
Brian, your blade
didn't make the cut.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.460
Now, Brian, I love
what you built for us.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.960
But your blade took so much
damage during the strength test

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.580
that it wasn't able to perform
as well in the sharpness test.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.000
And that's why we're
sending you home.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.750
Understood.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.750
Thank you.
