[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.620
MEGAN SMITH: Hello, and welcome
to Women Techmakers.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.600
This is a series that we
created for the Google

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.280
Developer Live channel to
highlight the extraordinary

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.510
women in our industry who are
making some of the amazing

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.770
products that we
all use today.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.040
We are lucky to have Kim
Polese here with us.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.705
And so just quickly, at Google,
I'm a vice president

00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:00.970
at Google X. I've been here for
almost 10 years, worked on

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.740
lots of different things, led
new business development, did

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.530
lots of acquisitions, like
Google Earth and Maps and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.580
Picasa, and love working
in technology.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.400
PAVNI DIWANJI: And I'm
Pavni Diwanji.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.120
I'm one of the engineering
directors on Google+.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.920
And I'm really happy to be here
interviewing Kim, who I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.600
worked with a long,
long time ago.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.140
KIM POLESE: Exactly, yes.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.780
MEGAN SMITH: Welcome, Kim.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.090
KIM POLESE: Thank you.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.420
MEGAN SMITH: That's really--

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.350
we're going to get into what
amazing things you're doing.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.770
But that's really an amazing,
fun moment.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.530
Because Kim, you're
the founding

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.970
product manager for Java.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.380
KIM POLESE: Right.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.110
MEGAN SMITH: That's amazing.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.700
And you were in the Java team.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.010
PAVNI DIWANJI: I was one
of the engineers

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.790
for the Java team.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.720
MEGAN SMITH: You guys have
to tell us about that.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.350
Like how did you--

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.380
tell us more.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.160
KIM POLESE: Well, first
of all, it's so

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.005
great to see Pavni.

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:47.390
PAVNI DIWANJI: I know.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.990
KIM POLESE: It's actually
been 15 years or so,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.060
so here we are reunited.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.470
It was an amazing, extraordinary
experience to be

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.140
on the Java team.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.130
It was a very intense
experience.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.800
We had some near-death
experiences along the way to

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.030
getting Java out to the world.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.410
But it was incredibly,
incredibly rewarding, because

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.729
of the people on that team,
the most extraordinary

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.930
engineers, developers,
technologists that I've ever

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.790
worked with.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.450
PAVNI DIWANJI: Kim, you have to
tell us the story of how it

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.940
was all born and how
Oak became Java.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.310
KIM POLESE: Yes, it was-- it's
actually an amazing story.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.010
A small team of some of Sun's
best software engineers wanted

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.350
to build a software system of
the future, for the future,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.280
for a network world which
didn't yet exist.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.900
And Steve Jobs was actually
trying to recruit them away to

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.600
come to Next to do that.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.000
And basically Scott McNealy,
Bill Joy, and a handful of

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.470
Sun's executives, founders, said
stay, build it here, and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.830
actually spun off a separate
company called First Person to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.490
create this software environment
for this network

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.310
world that didn't yet exist.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.520
I came on as the product
manager at this point.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.810
So there was a technology,
but not yet a way to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.770
bring out to the world.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.560
And we made multiple attempts
at doing that.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.710
PAVNI DIWANJI: There were
several misfires.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.960
KIM POLESE: Exactly.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.430
The Newton, which was the
state-of-the-art when it came

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.790
to mobile devices, Apple's
first attempt at the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.070
smartphone or smart device.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.150
There was the set-top
box market.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.520
This was the early interactive
TV trials.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.770
Set-top boxes were actually
SGI boxes that cost about

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.870
$20,000 apiece.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.010
So none of this was ready
for prime time.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.180
And we were really struggling,
trying to figure out how to

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.310
get this incredible,
extraordinary software out to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.540
the world and make
it ubiquitous,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.330
which was the goal.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.100
It was ubiquity or go home.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.840
And right at this critical
moment when it looked like we

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.460
were really failing at this,
Mosaic came along.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.400
And so we realized, we could
create the world's first

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.080
interactive browser and actually
bring interactivity

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.910
and applications applets into
browsers versus just text,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.370
static text.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.290
And so that really opened the
floodgates to getting

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.400
developers to use
this technology.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.750
We renamed it Java from Oak.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.110
And then everything changed
in one day--

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.570
March 23, 1995.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.130
PAVNI DIWANJI: How did
you convince--

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.390
I know you were one of the key
people who convinced that we

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.850
should put out Java free and
not bother to have any

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.180
constraints on it.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.100
Because this is--

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.899
I think developers would like
to hear what prompted that

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:19.300
decision, what drove
that decision.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.690
MEGAN SMITH: Because
that's a very--

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.470
PAVNI DIWANJI: That
was a key moment.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.900
MEGAN SMITH: And it
was when things

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.920
like that didn't happen.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.260
KIM POLESE: Yes.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.470
That's true.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.070
MEGAN SMITH: That's a very
normal thing now.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.790
People like free, and then
there's some freemium.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.480
There's some other way
that money comes.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.600
But that's a really
extraordinary decision.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.684
KIM POLESE: Right.

00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:35.490
Giving it away free, publishing
the full spec,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.470
everything open.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.630
The fact that Bill Joy was
involved and was really part

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.630
of this from the beginning
was critical.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.680
Because Bill really understood
the importance--

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.710
obviously with his background in
bringing UNIX to the world,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.380
the importance of open systems
and open software.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.310
So he, along with the
core members of the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.700
team, went to Scott.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.700
And it really didn't take a lot
of convincing just to get

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.920
them to say yes, because
they understood.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.020
Sun came from that background.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.630
The network is the computer,
open systems, UNIX.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.190
So it was philosophically
aligned with Sun's roots.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.680
But again, I just really give
a lot of credit to Scott

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.020
McNealy, Bill Joy, Andy
Bechtolsheim, the core

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.980
founders of Sun, who shepherded
this project along

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.720
even when things looked bleak,
and then took a risk and let

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.030
us give it away to the world.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.480
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think this
might be a good lead to talk

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.450
to you little bit about your
journey and what prompted--

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.530
I was amazed when I learned
that here you are.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.250
Java's really successful.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.370
You are at the top
of the hill.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.400
Then you decided to kind
of throw it all

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.980
away and do a start-up.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.897
MEGAN SMITH: So she's ready
for her next thing.

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:59.180
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yeah, I'm like,
what kind of thought process

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.090
you went through?

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.160
What was your journey
like in terms of

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.170
entering the Marimba world?

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.750
KIM POLESE: It was actually
a very exciting moment.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.480
It was sort of the birth of
the internet as we know it

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.520
today, the commercial
internet.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.020
Netscape--

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.300
Mosaic Communications, it was
called at the time-- had just

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.230
been founded.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.000
And we had just released Java.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.750
And I started talking with a
few of my colleagues on the

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.130
Java team, specifically Arthur
van Hoff, Sami Shaio, and

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.890
Jonathan Payne, three of the
most extraordinary software

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.540
engineers on the planet.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.460
And we started thinking about
what we could bring to the

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.030
internet now.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.320
How could we take Java to the
next level and actually enable

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.800
businesses to build
enterprise-class applications

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.820
on this platform?

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.810
So more than just applets
and browsers.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.390
And we realized we could build
a whole software system to

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.370
enable applications
to be remotely

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.120
distributed, updated, managed.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.100
And that was really radical
stuff to go outside the

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.100
firewall and do that in a
disconnected use environment.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.310
This was all very new.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.700
So we got excited about
basically taking Java to the

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.660
next level.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.260
It was also the fact that I
would have the opportunity to

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.470
work with these three
engineers who--

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:06.960
when you get the chance
to work with

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.580
extraordinary people.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.940
And then on top of that, to
found and build a company.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.720
I wanted to learn.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.090
I wanted to learn
how to do that.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.420
I wanted to just sort
of go out there.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.800
And even if we crashed and
burned, we would learn a lot.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.450
And I realized I couldn't learn
that anywhere else other

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.320
than just doing it.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.350
So it was kind of the
combination of all those

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.490
things happening that made it
a no-brainer ultimately.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.240
It was hard to leave Sun,
because I loved Sun.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.930
I worked at Sun for
seven years.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.470
I was so excited about Java
becoming now a key direction

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.850
for Sun and really shaping
a lot of the

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.940
strategy going forward.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.430
But this was such a unique
opportunity.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.700
And these three co-founders
were extraordinary.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.580
MEGAN SMITH: It's an
interesting thing.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.930
Sometimes people talk about,
when's the time to leave, per

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.370
se, and transition
to new things.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.640
And I think one the best things
is when you're pulled.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.220
KIM POLESE: That's true.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.180
MEGAN SMITH: Not
feeling pushed.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.580
Like maybe if you're in a bad
environment, you need to go.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.220
But it's really like being drawn
with your passion into

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.410
the next thing.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.550
Eric Schmidt always says life
is who you travel with.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.690
So your point about the
colleagues that you had loved

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.440
working with that were so
extraordinary and being able

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.270
to go forward with them into
the next adventure--

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.580
KIM POLESE: So true.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.440
MEGAN SMITH: --which was
actually building on the

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.370
adventure before, is
a great thing.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.400
KIM POLESE: Exactly, yeah.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.730
I find that it's really--

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.290
I think Eric's quote
is right on.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.810
It's about who you
travel with.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.530
MEGAN SMITH: So Marimba is right
in the middle of the

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:32.750
beginning of the web.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.020
KIM POLESE: Right.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.530
MEGAN SMITH: So I don't know.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.090
I was running Planet Out at
that time, so it was an

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.230
extraordinary time.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.740
Everybody knew each other, and
it was this whole thing with

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.260
going crazy.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.020
Maybe it was the echo chamber,
maybe not, but it was--

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.465
people were on fire with it,
really passionate about what

00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:49.560
was happening.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.450
Early--

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.090
what year was Marimba?

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.180
KIM POLESE: January 1996
we founded the company.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.220
MEGAN SMITH: Because in '96 and
'97, even into '98, people

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.080
were building and things
were starting, but it

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.460
still wasn't broad.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.370
Like '99 is the Prince song.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:06.340
It was this crazy year.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.920
KIM POLESE: It reached
its peak of madness.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.930
MEGAN SMITH: I actually know
somebody who took a photograph

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.650
of every person she
met that year.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.910
And it's like got to be the
story of all these crazy

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.800
companies that existed and
parties, and there was so much

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.200
money because the
VCs were in big.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:18.480
KIM POLESE: Exactly.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.180
We went from being this
backwater of geeks here in the

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.310
Valley to suddenly being
the new Hollywood.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.550
MEGAN SMITH: Right.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.640
KIM POLESE: It was weird.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.290
MEGAN SMITH: And then we sort
of went off a cliff.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.190
PAVNI DIWANJI: Marimba, I
remember, it was the darling

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:38.000
of the press in that two-,
three-year period.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.070
KIM POLESE: Yeah, there
weren't a lot of

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.030
start-ups at the time.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.290
And here we were, four people
coming out of the Java team.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.970
Woman CEO, so that was another
element to it.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.870
So yeah, the few companies that
were out there got a lot

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.320
of attention, and we did, too.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.690
PAVNI DIWANJI: Tell us a little
bit about your personal

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.590
journey, like jumping
off this--

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.640
being on the product management
train to then

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.380
taking on CEO and taking the
company from nothing to a

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:06.570
public company.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.160
KIM POLESE: Yes.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.540
Actually, being a product
manager was a fabulous

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.730
background to becoming
a founder and CEO.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.650
Because as a product manager,
you have the total scope of

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.480
responsibility for taking this
lump of technology and making

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.900
it a success in the market.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.300
MEGAN SMITH: At Google, we
almost think of it as mini

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:22.870
CEO, so it's funny
you said that.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.750
KIM POLESE: That's exactly
right, exactly right.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.790
So my time at Sun was the
foundation for learning on the

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.020
job to become a CEO.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.720
And Sun was kind of
a sink-or-swim

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.850
environment, as you know.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.210
PAVNI DIWANJI: Yes, I do.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.480
KIM POLESE: You had to figure
stuff out on your own.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.540
And that's what you have
to do as a CEO.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:45.340
So the other part of this was,
it was important to me to have

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.140
the support of my co-founders
in being the CEO, and know

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.620
that I was the right CEO for
that point in the company, and

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.730
that I could mature along
as the company grew.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:02.110
And so I always sort of kept in
mind how I was maturing as

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.210
the company grew as well.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.360
Am I still the right CEO
for the company?

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.870
And I think that's an
important thing any

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.750
founder should do.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.050
MEGAN SMITH: That's a
really interesting--

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.370
so I was talking with my friend

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.400
Mary Lou Jepsen recently.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.660
And when we were actually-- this
was when we were all-- we

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.680
go to this great thing called
Silicon Valley Goes to the UK,

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.610
which Kim and I go to, where
we're talking to

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.150
entrepreneurs.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.075
And Mary Lou drew this
triangle, this--

00:11:24.075 --> 00:11:25.330
it's going to be
hard on camera.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.840
I don't know if you guys can see
it-- but a small triangle

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.160
that said--

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.210
I think it was maybe the CEO
of Adobe who told her this.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.860
When we're in--

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.690
she actually drew it up here.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:38.120
She said when you're in a
start-up, you start small.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.580
And then you imagine that it's
going to grow like this.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.200
And so the people who start
the company are somehow in

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.490
charge of everybody forever.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.320
But she just said that's
not what happens.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.740
What happens is the start-up
people are

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.060
the start-up people.

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.680
And actually, if you think of it
more like-- this is kind of

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.240
a messy drawing.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.720
But here's the triangle here.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.960
This is the starting
group, and then the

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.690
company grows out.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:08.040
And some of the team is
qualified or wants to go up

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.020
like an Amazon.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.650
Jeff Bezos stays in the CEO, or
Larry and Sergey go up, and

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:12.230
different people.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.360
And some people don't.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.290
And some people actually love
the beginning, and they go to

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.060
the next thing.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.570
It's sort of very interesting.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.160
So as you were saying, here
you felt like, OK, I'm

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.670
qualified to get to
the beginning.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.700
But then, am I learning enough
to keep staying in this

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.720
leadership state and
keep doing that?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.340
And having also the trust
of your team is to

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.420
learn as you guys go.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:30.820
KIM POLESE: Exactly.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.805
And what I also realized along
the way is, well, most CEOs

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:36.520
have to do it.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.620
Everyone has to be a first-time
CEO, right?

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.290
So everyone is figuring it out,
really, as they go along.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.650
And that confidence thing
was a really important

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.490
breakthrough for me, realizing
wow, I can do this.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.080
Everyone else is figuring
it out as they go, too.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.020
So Jeff Bezos and Bill
Gates and everybody.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.120
PAVNI DIWANJI: It would be great
if you talk a little bit

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.380
about the challenging or
the do-or-die moments

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.180
through this journey.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.800
I'm sure there are
a bunch of them.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.750
MEGAN SMITH: Like in the very
early days, you have some

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.080
funding, but you've got
to make payroll,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:08.970
those kinds of things.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.460
But also getting out there and
getting public, and some of

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.320
the challenges with that.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.930
And then you guys eventually
were acquired, and some of

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.050
those faces, and then grew.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.460
It continued to grow within.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:19.880
KIM POLESE: Right.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.270
MEGAN SMITH: And that stuff.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.610
KIM POLESE: So early days, we
actually were getting a lot of

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.570
immediate offers for funding,
for venture funding.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.200
We were getting calls from VCs
because we were so high

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.560
profile coming out
of the Java team.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.630
And it was sort of all this

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.050
excitement about these start-ups.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.550
We didn't want to take
funding, actually.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.470
We wanted to build a product and
get some users, and then

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.720
once we had something we felt
confident we could take to

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.230
market, then go out and start
to talk to investors.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.900
And that turned out to be a
really good thing, for a

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.690
variety of reasons.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.000
For focus--

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.510
basically for nine months, the
four of us were in this little

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.590
tiny space that we rented.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.080
And my three co-founders
were cranking away.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.550
And I was building the business
plan and figuring out

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.570
how to take this technology and
make it into a product.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.300
And those nine months were so
valuable because We built a

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.680
really strong product that today
is still the foundation

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.120
of this product line at BMC,
which was the acquirer.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.840
My three co-founders
built an amazing

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.260
product during that time.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.720
And as we know, the smaller
the team, oftentimes, the

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.830
better the code and
the product.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.280
And we also were able to focus
on getting user feedback.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.380
So we did that.

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.650
And then, once we went out and
got funding, of course, we

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.240
built value.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.550
So we were able to retain more
equity in the company as the

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.130
four co-founders.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.060
So then we were able
to go out and talk

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.520
to the venture community.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.180
And Kleiner Perkins funded
the company.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.620
We were part of the Java
fund, and we had great

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.540
investors in them.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.070
So we had a wonderful
launching.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.660
And then we were into
the madness of the

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.190
whole internet craze.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:51.290
And one thing that I found
challenging was realizing that

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.950
what the outside world perceives
you do or are is not

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.870
necessarily true.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.580
In other words, you can't
control, oftentimes,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.440
perception.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.340
Because here we were, this
enterprise software company,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.260
and the outside world
wanted us to be a

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.660
dot-com consumer company.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.320
MEGAN SMITH: That's the stuff
that's on the cover of--

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:10.980
KIM POLESE: Exactly.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.100
That's the sexy stuff.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.640
So there was this thing
called push.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.000
There was a company called
PointCast, which was doing

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.490
something pretty revolutionary,
which was

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.300
sending, basically, broadcasts
of content, like sports

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.520
scores, weather, that kind of
thing, to your screensaver.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.640
And this was on all the
screensavers of all the CEOs

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.400
all over the Valley.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.810
And everyone was trying
to figure out

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:31.940
what this thing was.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:34.780
Well, we kind of got lumped
into, oh, you must be a push

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.450
company, but we were
very different.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:42.110
We were selling to Fortune
1,000, Fortune 500 companies

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.610
who wanted to deploy
enterprise-class applications

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.790
across the internet.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.730
So that became really
challenging.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.170
And I finally realized
at a certain point, I

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.410
can't control this.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.140
All we can do is
really execute.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.300
We've built a great product.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.040
We have a great team.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.600
We just have to build and
scale this thing.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.180
And eventually, people will
realize what we do.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.670
And that took longer than I
thought, that realizing part.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.570
The building part didn't
actually take

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.710
longer than I thought.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.040
It happened a lot faster because
there was so much

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.700
demand from business for this
software to run an internet

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.200
set of applications.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.210
PAVNI DIWANJI: Did you have
challenges when you tried to

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.630
take what Marimba had produced
and tried to sell it in this

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.830
traditional enterprise?

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.080
How did they look at
you as a woman CEO

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.580
coming in from the Valley?

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.930
KIM POLESE: I'd never
thought about that.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:32.620
You know how it is?

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.530
You just don't think about the
fact that you're a woman.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:37.380
You're just doing your job.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:41.260
One thing that actually worked
very well is, I hired the West

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.330
Coast Regional Sales
Manager for Tivoli.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.830
Tivoli was an IBM company that
basically was the last century

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.970
version, or last-generation of
systems management software.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.060
We were next-generation systems
management software.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.100
So he knew how to sell against
our competitors, who were the

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.180
incumbents.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.900
And so that allowed us to
get off the ground.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.210
We went from $0 to $10 million
in the first year and kept

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.869
doubling revenue
year over year.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:09.109
So we ended up burning very
little cash, ultimately using

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.900
very little of money we raised,
because we were

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.230
already successful out of the
gate, because there was a

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.910
market that we could
sell into as the

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.560
next-generation software.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.660
So it actually worked
very well.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.720
It's just the outside world
perceived that we were this

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.460
consumer company.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.369
And then there was this whole
myth that developed around,

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:28.000
well, they were a consumer
company, but

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.890
they failed at that.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.790
So then they had to totally
regroup and start all over

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.740
again, which was fine.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.850
It doesn't matter what the world
thinks as long as you

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.120
know that you're building
something of quality, and

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.430
people are getting
value out of it.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.050
And our customers were.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.320
MEGAN SMITH: So a bunch of
different directions.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:53.890
So maybe we should jump into, at
that same time, you started

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.040
to get very active--

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.860
or the Valley--

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.420
you're sort of tracked
as the internet came.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.700
Here in Silicon Valley, we
started to engage with

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.200
Washington.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.640
KIM POLESE: Yes.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.340
MEGAN SMITH: We started to
understand that technology

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.710
policy was really important.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.320
And a lot of it wasn't
being informed by

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.480
the industry creators.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.870
And you were one of the
champions of doing that.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.840
So can you talk a little bit
about those days at the time,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.330
and what were the few
issues that really

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.350
kind of woke us up.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.310
KIM POLESE: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.660
Yeah, I got a call from John
Doerr in '96, early '96.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.630
Do you want to go
to Washington to

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.620
meet with Al Gore?

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.570
And this was right at the
beginning of the Valley's

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.790
engagement, as you
were saying, in

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.070
the political process.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:39.250
What really tipped it off,
sort of instigated that

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.210
engagement in the mid '90s was
securities litigation.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.920
There was a lot of basically
frivolous lawsuit

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.600
filings going on.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.110
Basically every company in
the Valley was being

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.340
hit by these lawsuits.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.970
And so we realized, we have
to be at the table.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.640
If you're not at the table,
you're on the menu, and that's

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.100
basically what was happening.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.300
And so there was a much broader
set of issues beyond

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.380
securities litigation.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.690
So that included getting
broadband network deployed,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:12.000
figuring out encryption, policy
around encryption,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.310
ultimately later privacy.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:20.430
And it's not always fun engaging
in the sort of

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.260
down-and-dirty political process
of negotiating and--

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.110
PAVNI DIWANJI: But
it's necessary.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.340
KIM POLESE: --and

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.710
compromising, but it's necessary.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.300
And it's actually really
interesting stuff when you get

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.390
to the policy side because you
can craft policies that really

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.040
drive growth, economic growth.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.630
And policymakers--

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.970
senators, members of Congress--
have 1,000

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.960
different issues they're dealing
with, and they don't

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.190
always know stuff you
assume they know.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.590
So you have to be there having
that conversation.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.190
And it just takes continual
presence and engagement.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.130
And I actually have
grown to love it.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.410
MEGAN SMITH: And you've
done a fair amount.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.110
So you guys went out and you
met with Gore, with Vice

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.470
President Gore at the time.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.120
And then was TechNet
existing yet?

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.570
Or was--

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.050
KIM POLESE: It was really
at the founding

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.850
moment in the 90s.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.930
John Chambers, John Doerr,
small group,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.550
got it off the ground.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.210
MEGAN SMITH: And they're
still going strong.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.050
KIM POLESE: Very much, yeah.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.570
MEGAN SMITH: And are you still
involved with them?

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.710
KIM POLESE: Yes, yes.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:19.370
I'm on the executive council.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.980
And it's a unique organization
in that it's direct CEO

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.890
engagement, a lot of policy
organizations, or advocacy

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.920
organizations, or government
affairs folks who are critical

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.340
as part of the process,
but not CEOs.

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.690
And this organization is very
much the CEOs engaged in the

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.810
conversation at the table.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.370
MEGAN SMITH: Very cool.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.000
I think we have a screenshot
of TechNet.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.640
Yes, no, maybe?

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.760
We could kind of show quickly
just so people see it.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.610
But--

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.170
KIM POLESE: This whole SOPA,
PIPA, for example--

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.075
MEGAN SMITH: Was one of the
most recent issues.

00:20:51.075 --> 00:20:53.980
But I think it's so important
to not only have the

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.520
conversation, but also have an
organization like TechNet

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.270
where we can be a resource
to policymakers--

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.505
KIM POLESE: Right, exactly.

00:21:01.505 --> 00:21:02.790
MEGAN SMITH: --and available
to them.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.740
KIM POLESE: And bipartisan,
nonpartisan.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.040
The point is to move the
conversation along and figure

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.300
out solutions rather than
getting stuck in these

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.000
polarized political
dog fights.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.470
MEGAN SMITH: Right.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.490
Thanks for your work there.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:19.330
KIM POLESE: Happy to serve.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.025
MEGAN SMITH: We need you.

00:21:21.025 --> 00:21:22.750
PAVNI DIWANJI: Do you want
to-- maybe we can talk a

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:27.760
little bit more on Marimba and
how you kind of maneuvered the

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.770
public waters and how the
company got acquired.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.705
I think a lot of entrepreneurs
in the audience or who are

00:21:34.705 --> 00:21:36.340
viewing would like to
know, like, when do

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.800
you make the decision?

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.280
Do you keep going, or do you
just say, that's it, the price

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.470
is right, or the
time is right?

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.200
MEGAN SMITH: And also an
interesting thing, having

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.200
worked on lots of acquisitions
at Google, it's our incredible

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.170
engineers like Pavni and others
have invented a lot of

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:54.590
stuff here.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.880
But actually, probably, if you
look at our portfolio of

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.460
products, I don't know if it's
half, but a very large number

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.940
of them were made by people
who invented them here,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.310
including Larry and Sergey in
the beginning with search, and

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:08.830
then a lot of stuff through
incredible acquisitions where

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.120
teams came in and then
built from there.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.880
And it was really great
to hear that

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.010
BMC is going forward.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:16.560
So they're sort of like--

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.390
the point of we're building this
thing, but is it actually

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:22.930
better leverage at some point
to jump in with someone else

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.220
and then build even bigger?

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.400
I think in some ways the Keyhole
team always talks

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.500
about that with Google Earth,
like, what we were able to

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.270
achieve together was something
that neither of us would have

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.560
been able to do apart.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.050
KIM POLESE: Right, right.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:40.620
It's always a difficult decision
about whether and

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.230
when to sell.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.260
For us, we were from the
beginning a successful

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.210
enterprise software company.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.480
We were able to get to
profitability, actually,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.910
shortly after we went public,
which was quite

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:52.870
unusual at the time.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:53.736
MEGAN SMITH: Which was
certainly incredibly

00:22:53.736 --> 00:22:56.260
revolutionary at the time People
would say, we're a

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.170
pre-revenue company.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.830
And you're like, well, what's
your revenue plan?

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.150
They're like, well,
I don't know.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:00.970
We'll figure it out later.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.620
KIM POLESE: We were going around
$50 million in revenue

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.020
at the time.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.210
MEGAN SMITH: Wow.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:08.430
KIM POLESE: And basically
the bubble burst.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:12.140
And there was this very weird
period, which, now I've lived

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.410
through a couple--

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:14.460
several cycles.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.450
But at this time, it was
basically a lot of Sandhill

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.140
Road, frankly.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.200
Conventional wisdom was saying
enterprise software is dead.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.350
Search is dead.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.570
Advertising is dead.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.400
It was-- everyone went mad.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.630
MEGAN SMITH: I used to joke that
they were saying this is

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:32.830
dead, but they were
doing it on email.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.500
MEGAN SMITH: The internet's
dead.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.680
We're all clicking,
surfing around.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.485
It was that we were sort of way
out ahead of ourselves in

00:23:42.485 --> 00:23:43.100
a lot of ways.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.620
But actually, what's so
interesting, having been in

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.270
those moments, is they play
out at some point.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.580
Maybe in a different form, but
many of the ideas happen.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:53.610
KIM POLESE: Exactly.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.350
So the entrepreneurs and the
founders and the developers,

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.800
of course, weren't paying
attention to all those

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.410
pronouncements.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.650
They were just getting down to
the work of building software

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.570
and continuing to build
the company, which is

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.310
what we were doing.

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:09.560
So we had a lot of customers who
were really depending on

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.000
the software for a lot of their
foundational internet

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.370
business apps.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.130
We didn't really miss a beat.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.200
What happened was the world
around us went crazy, and our

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.810
stock price plummeted.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.270
And at one point, the stock was
worth less than the cash

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.920
we had in the bank.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.010
We had $60 million in the bank,
and the stock was worth

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:30.360
like $42 million.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.420
And we had no debt.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.620
So that was how crazy
things had gone.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.960
But basically, we
hung in there.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.820
And that's a lesson that I've
learned again and again, is

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.320
persistence, not giving up, even
when everyone around you

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.640
saying, you're crazy,
give it up.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.410
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think it's
a necessary gene for

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:45.780
entrepreneurs.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.860
KIM POLESE: Absolutely.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.140
PAVNI DIWANJI: Or else
you do not survive.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:48.650
KIM POLESE: Yes.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.850
MEGAN SMITH: Encourage.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.620
You now, somebody announces
something that's exactly what

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.090
you're doing.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.210
You're like, oh no, but then
time plays out, and you go

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.660
into competition.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.070
It's like, it's fine.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.790
KIM POLESE: Things work out.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.010
MEGAN SMITH: Staying
at the table.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.230
KIM POLESE: Yeah, as long as
you know you're building

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.160
something of value that
the world needs,

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.300
just keep doing it.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.360
So that's what we kept doing.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.945
And so eventually, the
market recovered.

00:25:06.945 --> 00:25:08.490
Our stock price recovered.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.620
We had started a relationship
already with BMC, a

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:11.930
partnership.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:16.020
It turned out that they were
really a very good fit for us

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.070
in terms of distribution
channel, a way to get a lot

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.410
more volume in the market.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.640
So the acquisition turned
out very well,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.590
I think, for everybody.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.900
And in fact, the core team--

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.760
there was a core team that
remained, in fact.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.910
Several employees are still at
BMC, as far as I know, one of

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.350
whom became the CTO of BMC.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.630
So it ended up being a
great acquisition,

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:37.240
I think, for them.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.130
MEGAN SMITH: In both
directions.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.280
KIM POLESE: In both
directions.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.800
MEGAN SMITH: That's good.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.890
PAVNI DIWANJI: So after that,
I'm sure you had a choice,

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:48.200
like, having taken a company
from nothing to a successful

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:48.850
public company.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.120
So what made you plunge
into the start-up

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.580
world all over again?

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.860
You wanted to do it
all over again?

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.760
KIM POLESE: I guess I'm
officially a serial

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.250
entrepreneur.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:59.020
I confess.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.940
I just love founding and
building companies.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.990
I love being on a mission
with smart people out

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.880
to change the world.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.700
I mean, I think there's just
nothing more exhilarating

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.910
professionally or in
life in general.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.650
And so this was SpikeSource.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:13.860
It was the next company I did.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.130
This was an open source company
that was focused

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:20.390
basically on helping businesses
and people use open

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:22.060
source software much
more easily.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.470
So we were automating the
management of open source

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.140
stacks, application stacks.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.950
And the open source business
was an interesting one as a

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.030
market, a challenging one, and
particularly during the

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.990
economic times, ultimately,
that we all lived through.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.690
But the company that we built
was very powerful.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.380
And ultimately now, we're seeing
all around us, this

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.910
automation of open source
software and stack management.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.050
We were a cloud company, of
course, before people were

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.340
talking about cloud
and all of that.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.910
And this has been kind of a
persistent theme for me.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.850
I started my career, actually,
in artificial intelligence and

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.590
expert systems software back
when that was hot.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.600
And then it sort of went
through its cycles.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.200
And now, of course, AI
is everywhere, but no

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.450
one calls it AI.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.370
We get excited about things.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:11.460
We get ahead of ourselves.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.930
But we, as entrepreneurs and
founders, keep building.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.060
And eventually, the
world needs it.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.850
And so that's what happened
with SpikeSource.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.830
I just love that process.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.130
PAVNI DIWANJI: A lot of the
audience today is going to be

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:26.700
developers primarily.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.930
So maybe you can spend a little
bit of time on your

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.380
learnings around open source
software and developer

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:36.430
community, like your tenure
at SpikeSource.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.170
KIM POLESE: Yes.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:42.310
Well, one of the things that I
just find so rewarding and

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.760
exciting is the fact that open
source has really unleashed

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.290
this army of software
developers globally.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.780
And back when I was growing up
in the software world at Sun,

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.500
working for Eric Schmidt,
actually, who was running a

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.220
software product division at
that time, software systems

00:27:58.220 --> 00:27:58.890
were closed.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.410
And it was very difficult to
get access to software.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.350
It was expensive.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:07.090
And everything changed when
the internet came along.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:12.120
We've seen such an incredible
explosion of creativity.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.220
The developers were the ones
that really made Java

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:14.800
successful.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.060
They built the applets.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.470
There wasn't any kind of
marketing campaign.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.170
There was no marketing
campaign.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.030
It was the developers
who did it.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.630
And it's the developers who
are changing the world.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.940
And open source is really
enabling that.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:31.080
So I'm thrilled, as a software
geek from way back, to see

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.280
what's happened.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.310
MEGAN SMITH: It's
sort of the--

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.860
like Wikipedia, the creativity
kind of opens up.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:37.490
KIM POLESE: Yeah.

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:39.960
MEGAN SMITH: I was lucky to
work with General Magic

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.520
really, really early on.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.680
And Andy Rubin was there,
who's the Android lead.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.850
And we were working
on, whatever,

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.000
these little devices.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.780
But they were this big.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.850
One time the Motorola CEO
sent us an actual

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.020
brick in the mail.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:58.910
MEGAN SMITH: But we were even
before open source.

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.430
So we thought that we needed an
alliance, very much in an

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.190
'80s model, the way that Apple
or Microsoft and developer

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.470
communities--

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:06.865
but it was much more
controlled.

00:29:06.865 --> 00:29:07.550
KIM POLESE: Very much so.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.260
MEGAN SMITH: And then Andy, of
course, went on to do Danger

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:11.920
and Sidekick.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.530
And I think in that case,
he also faced--

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.330
these are getting smaller.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:18.610
And Sidekick was awesome.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:23.100
But still, the closed nature of
the way that the carriers

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.350
were treating the app
store equivalent.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.150
Like it was in their version
in their way.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.380
You had to talk to them.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.270
They would bless it.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.020
Maybe they would brand it.

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.720
Much tighter controlled network
side, so even the

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.170
devices were trying
to open up.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:40.200
And so in some ways, I think
Android is his-- it's their

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.230
time to watch the movie, and
to act in the movie, and to

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.865
drive that and sort of--

00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:46.260
KIM POLESE: It's cool.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.530
MEGAN SMITH: It's cool to see
how open source in all forms

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:53.120
and what he learned and what you
learned came full circle

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.630
to really allow for the surface
area of the world's

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.295
creativity to act in concert--

00:29:58.295 --> 00:29:59.380
KIM POLESE: Exactly.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:01.380
MEGAN SMITH: --with
open standards.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.960
It's an amazing innovation.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.080
In a lot of ways, I think the
21st century is very much

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.670
about openness.

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:07.650
KIM POLESE: Absolutely.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:08.670
MEGAN SMITH: And it's
interesting with your

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:12.690
government work in that as we
see government transparency

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.630
come forward, or even
lightweight things in the

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.230
early '90s where open source
comes, so does truth and

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:22.250
reconciliation in South Africa
as South Africa transitions,

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.510
and this idea of openness
and more.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.790
KIM POLESE: Right.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.000
MEGAN SMITH: It's an
extraordinary thing.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.610
KIM POLESE: It is.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:33.240
It's changing the world in
amazingly profound ways.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:38.020
And what's great is being able
to participate in that, both

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.170
in big companies and
also start-ups.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.540
Software developers are
changing the world.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.870
That's basically the
bottom line.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.560
MEGAN SMITH: And those
who team up.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:49.980
Let's talk about ClearStreet,
because that's a real change

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.670
idea, which is incredibly
exciting.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:31:00.040
And I think maybe borne out of
the ideas of Occupy Wall

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:04.650
Street and unfairness and
how do we help people--

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.920
say more about what you're
thinking with that.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.090
KIM POLESE: So I think everyone
knows, there's a huge

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.080
problem with debt.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.470
And in fact, something like 43%
of American households are

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.650
90 days away from being
in poverty,

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.060
from going off a cliff.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.610
People just don't
have savings.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:23.950
And now the credit card debt
is a trillion, a massive,

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.890
massive problem people
are facing.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.340
And the solutions today--

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:33.680
payday lenders, just the kind
of options that exist are

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.230
really bad.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.470
So we started looking at
the power of social.

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:40.990
How could we use the power of
people helping each other both

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.960
on the savings side and also on
the buying everyday items

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:48.350
side to build assets and
to get out of debt?

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.860
And we started looking at
something called rotational

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.550
credit, which has existed
for centuries.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.160
It's very prevalent all over
the world, particularly in

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.410
immigrant communities or in
under-banked communities,

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.860
where people don't have access
to traditional banks.

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.670
And small groups of people
agreeing to get together, say,

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.620
once a week or once
a month save a

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.680
certain amount of money.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.970
And then once a week, if they're
doing it on a weekly

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.620
basis, one person goes home with
all of the contributions

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.450
from that week.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:15.800
And so it's a way of getting
access to lump sums of cash.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.230
And the social contract that
exists between people, kind of

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:23.050
Weight Watchers style, when
people know they've got some

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.660
pressure from their friends
to follow through on their

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.080
commitment, they do.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.820
MEGAN SMITH: Professor Eunice
did some of that with

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.200
microloans around each person
getting a loan and having

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.290
support from each other, and a
little pressure, a little peer

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.360
pressure to help you
get through that.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:35.760
KIM POLESE: Yeah.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.360
So its that kind of
foundational idea.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.200
And we're taking that.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.640
We're putting basically a social
and mobile later on

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:43.250
that, so it's easy to start
your own savings circle.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.700
And then we're accelerating it
with merchant-funded rewards

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.940
earned from everyday spending.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.490
So it's kind of this idea of
loyalty, building merchant

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.680
loyalty and earning rewards
savings, which go directly

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.930
into your savings circle.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:56.540
Earn $1 off that item.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.300
That $1 goes in your savings
circle rather than

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.070
disappearing in your pocket.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.240
MEGAN SMITH: Is this--
is that--

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.190
KIM POLESE: So that's
the basic idea.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:10.270
And it's based on stuff that's
been proven to work, this idea

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.760
of saving circle or
rotational credit.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.890
Matched savings--

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.770
so we're basically taking the
merchant reward and creating,

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:18.840
essentially, a form of
matched savings.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:25.660
So that kind of acceleration of
one's own savings habits.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.810
And then prize link savings is
another thing that's been

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:28.420
proven to work.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.090
People, if they know that
there's an incentive, like to

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:37.150
win an iPad or something like
that, they will adopt good

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:40.050
behavior or better behavior, for
example, take a financial

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:45.750
literacy quiz, or adhere to a
savings goal or what have you,

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.270
based on an incentive like
a prize, winning a prize.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:50.790
So we're taking these kind of
concepts around behavioral

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.320
economics that have actually
been proven to work in

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.450
practice and putting technology
around it and

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.620
creating a solution.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.650
The focus is on helping people
get faster access to cash so

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.300
they can pay off debts and then
build long-term savings.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.460
And there's a whole movement
across this country right now

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.219
around asset building.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.710
And there's also a whole new
generation of entrepreneurs

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.929
who are building new kind of
financial services companies

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:17.800
that are about making profits
and creating a success

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.130
financially and also ensuring
that people get ahead

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:26.150
financially instead of getting
further and further in debt.

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:29.710
MEGAN SMITH: Using our tools to
help make a difference in

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:32.290
this area, because it's
hitting everyone.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.540
KIM POLESE: Right.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.600
PAVNI DIWANJI: And maybe you
can talk a little bit about

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.630
what's next for ClearStreet.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.360
Are you planning to do
internationally, go

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:42.489
international?

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.960
Are you just going to
be focused locally?

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.530
KIM POLESE: So we're starting
some small pilots locally

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.580
here, but ultimately, this is
something that works globally.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:55.900
And it's a solution that's
ubiquitously used today in an

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.190
analog world.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:01.390
And so our goal is ultimately
to have this be a global

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.910
solution and product service.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.980
MEGAN SMITH: They're
giving us a signal.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.560
We've got a little
bit more time.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.700
I wanted to know about your
dancing a little bit.

00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.610
You're an amazing dancer.

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:14.490
Say a little bit.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:16.130
PAVNI DIWANJI: I think a better
way to ask the question

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.080
is, how do you balance--

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.220
KIM POLESE: I grew up dancing.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.600
I grew up here in
the Bay Area.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.170
I discovered ballet
when I was 14.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.400
I just never stopped dancing.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.440
And it's always kept me sane.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.430
What's great about dance, any
form of dance, is that it

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.770
takes total focus.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:42.120
You can't just zone out and run
on a stationary or cycle a

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.980
stationary bike.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.700
You have to actually be
memorizing choreography.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.950
You have to be thinking about
every movement of your body,

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.730
and position the arms,
and so forth.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.390
And it's also incredibly
physically demanding.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.190
It kicks your butt.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.930
And so that's been
this wonderful--

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.280
really literally-- balance in my
life, and a counterpoint to

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.630
a very intense professional
life.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:11.380
And for me, what I've realized
is that everyone needs

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.140
something that they're
passionate about outside of

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.550
what you do every day,
especially if you're in a very

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.590
intense work environment.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:22.080
And dance has been
that for me.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:25.680
MEGAN SMITH: It's interesting,
just because getting--

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.150
doing exercise--

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.700
and most of the tech
companies have

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.150
workout places, et cetera.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.250
But to think about that a little
bit differently, as you

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.120
have, which is take something
that you've been passionate

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.040
about as a young person and are
exceptionally great at,

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:44.120
because I know your dancing,
and to keep that going as a

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.055
parallel track for the classic
like, let me go run on the

00:36:47.055 --> 00:36:48.110
treadmill, which is also good.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.060
But it's a really different
way of approaching it.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:50.735
KIM POLESE: Yes.

00:36:50.735 --> 00:36:53.165
MEGAN SMITH: I just thought it
was a very interesting thing.

00:36:53.165 --> 00:36:54.680
PAVNI DIWANJI: I have
one question in the

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.990
same train of thought.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:58.260
What advice do you have for
young women out there?

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.440
I saw your Forbes rebuttal
and loved it--

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.240
bashing through the
stereotypes--

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.880
and you standing up while
everyone was watching.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.340
So what advice would you give to
our young women developers

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:16.330
who are either entering tech
or have just entered tech?

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:17.836
KIM POLESE: Go for it.

00:37:17.836 --> 00:37:19.670
You're better than you
think you are.

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:25.630
And the opportunities
are just infinite--

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.360
the opportunity to found a
company, to build a company,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:32.090
to lead a project, to
change the world.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:36.040
And we need more women
technologists and women in

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.580
general, women leaders
doing that.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.020
MEGAN SMITH: Kim and I were
just in England for the

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.110
Silicon Valley Comes
to the UK.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.990
And we were at Bletchley Park,
which is-- and we have these

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.510
books, which is the amazing
place where they cracked the

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:52.510
Enigma codes during
World War II.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.920
And what was so interesting to
learn about this extraordinary

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.160
place and the work that was
done-- and really the founding

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.110
of the modern computer
industry was there.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.840
Alan Turing was there--

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.110
was that it was half women
and half men, and such an

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.730
amazingly diverse group.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.500
KIM POLESE: Exactly.

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.410
MEGAN SMITH: And so
we were lucky to

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.860
meet some of the veterans.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:12.015
And they were totally
passionate, women and men in

00:38:12.015 --> 00:38:12.590
their nineties.

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.330
KIM POLESE: Yes.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:15.340
MEGAN SMITH: Awesome.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.020
KIM POLESE: So inspirational.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.940
MEGAN SMITH: And I think
sometimes people don't realize

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.460
the kinds of teams we're in.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.540
They think somebody's coding
all alone or something.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.660
But it's really--

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:25.980
the tech industry is amazing.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:29.520
We hope that more people, young
men and young women,

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.620
will join us.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.520
KIM POLESE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.430
In fact, you're right.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:37.720
I think people don't realize how
social it is, the process

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.000
of creating and building
technology.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.830
It's very much about teams and
interactions of teams.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:47.210
And the importance of diversity
in really bringing

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:51.160
all different views and
approaches is so critical and

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:51.920
often overlooked.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.400
And it's actually one of things
I love about Google is

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.870
that you guys have really
prioritized

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.440
that from the beginning.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.480
And Bletchley Park is definitely
worth a visit if

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.620
you're ever in the UK.

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.660
MEGAN SMITH: 45 minutes of
train ride from London.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.660
Last question--

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.790
heroes.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:08.840
KIM POLESE: Heroes.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.220
I would have to say my mom.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.530
I had an amazing mom.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.370
She grew up in a farm
in Denmark.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:17.460
World War II, the Nazis occupied
the farm, and kind of

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.610
a very interesting beginning.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.610
And she just decided to leave
the farm, go travel the world,

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:22.200
never went back.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.780
She was the only one of
her family not to.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.770
She had this attitude of--

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:33.330
she was so positive and very
realistic about life, but also

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:39.610
that perspective of never
give up-- persistence.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:40.480
Keep at it.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.690
And she did against various
obstacles along the way, and

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:47.360
she never lost her positive
attitude.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.630
And she was also incredibly
social person, very generous.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:53.652
Anyway, I'd have to see
my mom, hands down.

00:39:53.652 --> 00:39:55.220
MEGAN SMITH: Awesome.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.640
Thanks, Kim, for being here.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.020
KIM POLESE: My pleasure.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.560
MEGAN SMITH: Thanks to everybody
who joined us.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.040
And congrats on ClearStreet.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.450
I think it's really
significant in

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:05.310
your amazing history.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:06.360
Thanks for sharing with us.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:06.990
KIM POLESE: Thank you.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.420
It's really an honor
to be here.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:08.970
Thank you both.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:09.964
PAVNI DIWANJI: It's
great to catch up.

00:40:09.964 --> 00:40:10.461
MEGAN SMITH: Yeah.

00:40:10.461 --> 00:40:11.970
KIM POLESE: Exactly.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:12.920
MEGAN SMITH: Reunite, reunite.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.170
That's awesome.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:48.467
