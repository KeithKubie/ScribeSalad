Okay. Chapter One.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:05.705
Hmm.

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:08.074
Not quite right.

the book, bozo?

Diane's version is great.

"The only longstanding
relationship in BoJack's life

is with his agent,
Princess Carolyn.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:34.467 line:0%
Her loyalty must come
from a deep-rooted faith
that she's talented enough

That guy who killed
all those teachers

He just got married in jail.

And when this book comes out,
you could be that guy.

Oh, don't you get it?
This is my last chance
to make people love me again.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.187
If this goes out,
everybody's gonna see
the real me.

Now, I spend a lot of time
with the real me.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to go take a shower

Ah, Copperplate,
a font for the truly modern man.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:17.877
Ha. No.

 to provide those comforts.</i>
