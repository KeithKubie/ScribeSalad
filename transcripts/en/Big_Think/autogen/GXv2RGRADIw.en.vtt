order to transform the energy sector

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:41.049
order to transform the energy sector
 

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:44.110
order to transform the energy sector
energy sector is responsible more than

energy sector is responsible more than
 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.049
energy sector is responsible more than
two-thirds of the emissions which lead

two-thirds of the emissions which lead

to a climate change so if if if we want

to find the solution to climate change

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489
to find the solution to climate change
 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.479
to find the solution to climate change
this should go through transforming the

this should go through transforming the
 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.270
this should go through transforming the
energy sector and in order to transform

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280
energy sector and in order to transform
 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.939
energy sector and in order to transform
the energy sector we needed a strong

clear signal from Copenhagen and for me

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430
clear signal from Copenhagen and for me
 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.200
clear signal from Copenhagen and for me
this has been that there was a global

agreement for major countries of the
world to limit their emissions in the

world to limit their emissions in the
 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.999
world to limit their emissions in the
year 2020 and this would have given a

year 2020 and this would have given a
 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.039
year 2020 and this would have given a
strong signal to energy sector to make

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049
strong signal to energy sector to make
 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.109
