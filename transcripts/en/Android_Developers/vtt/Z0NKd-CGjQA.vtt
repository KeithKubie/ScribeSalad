ANKUR KOTWAL: Good day.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.950
My name is Ankur Kotwal.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.960
RICH HYNDMAN: And I'm
Rich Hyndman.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.730
Welcome to "This Week in Android
Development" for

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.470
Monday, 2nd of September,
2013.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.200
ANKUR KOTWAL: Something's been
irritating us for a while.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.580
And with Reto away this week,
we're going to fix a bunch of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.800
his spelling mistakes.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.340
RICH HYNDMAN: Try as we may to
remove Reto altogether, he

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.540
continues to haunt us.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.650
Last week, Reto showed us how to
analyze transfer profiles.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.410
ANKUR KOTWAL: I have no idea
what that means, but I guess

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.400
we should watch the DevByte.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.090
RICH HYNDMAN: Right?

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.650
Daniel tried to hold his
fragments together and help

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.990
you do so as well.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.850
ANKUR KOTWAL: And in this week's
episodes of DevBytes--

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.210
RICH HYNDMAN: No, wait,
wait, wait.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.570
Who's that?

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.610
ANKUR KOTWAL: Oh, that
dashing person?

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.600
That's Chris Broadfoot.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.240
I don't know who the
other guy is.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.210
RICH HYNDMAN: Nice
T-shirt, anyway.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.330
They're going to be kicking
off a DevByte series on

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.220
building better maps apps.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.780
ANKUR KOTWAL: And Reto is going
to be showing us some

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.230
more cool Android cartoons with
little to no relevance to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.730
actual coding.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.170
RICH HYNDMAN: Daniel's going
to show us how to perform

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.110
cardflip animations from
inside a doughnut.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.640
ANKUR KOTWAL: And Game On is
back again for another episode

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.630
to show us how to integrate
controllers with

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.930
your Android games.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.060
How did they get away with
it without them so far?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.260
RICH HYNDMAN: It's not
that hard, is it?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.730
And Shazam.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.010
Shazam's been updated with
tablet-optimized layouts and a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.245
great app icon animation.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:13.750
So check that out.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.230
ANKUR KOTWAL: Excellent.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.810
So that's all for "This Week
in Android Development." Be

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.850
sure to check out this week's
DevBytes as well.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.570
And remember, it's our party,
we can do what we want.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450
RICH HYNDMAN: It's our party,
we can say what we want.
