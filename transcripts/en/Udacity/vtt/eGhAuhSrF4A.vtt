00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:03.246
Let's take a ride on the train of physics.

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:05.253
Now this is a very special train.

00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:07.335
It moves along the tracks at a perfectly

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:09.910
constant speed, we call it V and unlike every

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.461
train you've ever ridden this train doesn't

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:14.878
bump, it doesn't sway from side to side,

00:00:14.878 --> 00:00:17.407
it goes perfectly straight.

00:00:17.407 --> 00:00:18.946
Now let's say you want to do an experiment

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:20.617
on the train, to figure out what the difference

00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:22.890
is between motion at a constant speed and being

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.290
at rest. One experiment you might want to do

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.224
with the help of your mohawked friend

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:29.057
is to drop an apple. While the train is moving

00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:31.111
at constant speed just see what trajectory

00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.166
the apple takes as it falls. My question is

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.288
from your point of view, so here you are

00:00:36.288 --> 00:00:38.139
watching this experiment on this train

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:40.159
as it goes rocketing down the tracks.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.958
when you watch your friend drop this apple

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.372
which of these trajectories best describes

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:47.055
remember from your point of view not from some

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:49.528
external observers standing on the tracks,

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:51.190
what trajectory the apple will take,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.020
this one, this one or this one.
