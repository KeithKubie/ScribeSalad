00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.660
Of all the dwarf planets in all the asteroid
belts, Ceres might be one of the more mysterious,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.270
a status that seems to persist no matter what
we learn about it.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.960
Hey guys!

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.250
Amy bringing out some space today on DNews!

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.679
Ceres, the planet turned asteroid turned dwarf
planet has quickly become everyone’s favourite

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.730
little body thanks to NASA’s Dawn mission
and some bright spots the spacecraft has spotted

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.919
that continue to baffle scientists.

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.869
A couple of months ago when Dawn was still
about 29,000 miles (46,000 kilometers) away

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.850
from Ceres, the images returned from the spacecraft
revealed two bright spots on the dwarf planet’s

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.850
surface.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.711
There was a lot of speculation about what
the spots might be ranging from evidence of

00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.790
volcanic activity to ice deposits, but they
were ultimately too small to resolve.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.250
The mystery remained intact as Dawn approached
for a closer look.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.270
A new explanation surfaced after more images
were processed showing the spots continued

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.179
to glow well after that region of the planet
had turned away from the Sun and was bathed

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:54.300
in shadow.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.480
The evidence then pointed to ice plumes, jets
of ice shooting out of the planet’s subsurface

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.370
glowing high above the surface in the reflected
sunlight.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.250
Then on March 6, Dawn went into orbit around
Ceres and got its first up close look at the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.070
spots scientists expected would be windows
into the dwarf planet’s chemical and physical

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.070
composition.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.820
Instead, the mystery only deepened.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.700
The two spots are actually just two of a dozen
or so identified areas on the dwarf planet’s

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.670
surface characterized by extreme brightness,
and they all behave differently.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.840
Using Dawn’s thermal camera, mission scientists
found that Spot 1 is colder than its immediate

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.840
surroundings.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.060
Its companion spot, Spot 5, on the other hand,
is warmer than the surrounding area.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.310
Which means they’re unlikely to be the same
thing.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.659
Current theories range from the spots being
a sign of ice to something called “hydrated

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.380
minerals,” which is water that isn’t quite
ice but that has been absorbed by minerals.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.780
But ice is pretty unlikely; Ceres is just
close enough to the Sun that ice wouldn’t

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.689
really be stable on its small surface.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.520
And it’s not the only mystery surrounding
Ceres.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.210
Dawn previously visited Vesta, another major
body in the asteroid belt.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.760
Drawing a comparison with a like object, Ceres
has far fewer craters than scientists studying

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.850
it think it should have.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.700
As Dawn makes more observations of the little
dwarf planet, we’re sure to unpack the ongoing

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.600
mystery of the bright spots and learn about
its composition and temperature.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.760
But in the meantime, Ceres’ status as an
embryonic planet that never fully formed will

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.319
remain likely until evidence says otherwise.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:24.180
Are you guys excited to see what Dawn learns
about Ceres in the coming months?
