00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:11.541
- Hi, I'm Mark Epstein.

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:12.842
I'm a School Programs Educator

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:14.365
here at the Museum of Modern Art

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:15.462
and today, I'm gonna talk about

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:17.677
Richard Serra's piece, To Lift.

00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:19.465
When I bring students to this object,

00:00:19.465 --> 00:00:21.009
what I like to do first is have them

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.593
walk around the piece

00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:24.097
and if you walk around the piece,

00:00:24.097 --> 00:00:25.418
you really can start to notice

00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:28.611
these amazing indentations in the surface

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.225
and we don't know exactly what
the history of this piece is,

00:00:31.225 --> 00:00:32.890
but it looks like things have happened.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.007
There's little nicks in
the surface over there.

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.266
What I have students do,
after they walk around,

00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.701
is they do a sketch of the
piece for a couple of minutes

00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:41.001
and then they also think about,

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.826
if they could title the piece,
what the title would be.

00:00:43.826 --> 00:00:45.923
And we talk about the titles
that they have come up with

00:00:45.923 --> 00:00:48.420
and they're, they run the gamut from

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:52.398
sort of really dark, somebody
called it Satan's cave one day

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:56.150
to somebody called it
Edible Scarf the other day.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.476
And we talk about the titles and we try

00:00:57.476 --> 00:00:59.373
and group the titles and
see if there's anything

00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:00.775
in common about them.

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:02.076
And then what we do is we,

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:03.803
just do some observation.

00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:05.936
So, we talk about what
the piece is made out of.

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:08.524
We try and guess by looking
at the surface down there

00:01:09.047 --> 00:01:11.462
and we come to the fact that it's flexible

00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:13.412
and then I go into some information about

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:15.892
what Richard Serra was
actually trying to do,

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:18.382
about the process that he
used to make the piece.

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:21.048
I think students are surprised to see

00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:22.860
an object that's made out of a really

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.871
inexpensive, every day material.

00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:26.905
Kids say often that it
reminds them of the,

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:28.549
the material you put under carpeting

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.235
so the carpeting stays in place.

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.711
And I think that they
really relate to this idea

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:35.640
that Richard Serra took
this every day material

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.980
and then he's in his studio

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.290
and he's just sort of
seeing what he can do to it.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.739
And I think there's a playfulness

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:41.919
that kids really relate to

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:43.951
that they don't expect to necessarily find

00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:45.820
in modern and contemporary art.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.093
I'm really drawn to this
object as an artist because

00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:50.288
you can really see the gesture in it.

00:01:50.288 --> 00:01:52.708
You can imagine Richard
Serra in the studio

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:53.864
lifting the piece.

00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:55.876
And I'm also really intrigued by the idea

00:01:55.876 --> 00:01:57.538
that the gesture is repeated

00:01:57.538 --> 00:01:59.878
by an installer or a team of installers

00:01:59.878 --> 00:02:01.665
every time the piece is installed.

00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:05.119
For students, makes them
think about the possibilities

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.758
of art work and think that art work is

00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:08.715
not just created with brushes and paint.

00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:09.914
It's not just created with,

00:02:09.914 --> 00:02:11.702
ya know, welding and steel.

00:02:11.702 --> 00:02:14.871
It can be created from
anything around them

00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:16.233
and hopefully it gives
them a different view

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:17.614
when they're walking down the street,

00:02:17.614 --> 00:02:19.586
looking at things in piles that like,

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:21.375
hey this is a possibility
for an art material

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:22.941
and I love that.
