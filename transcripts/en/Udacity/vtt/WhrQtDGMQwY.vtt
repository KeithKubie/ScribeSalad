00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.080
The question that I'm going to pose to you

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.370
is, why you think the structure of the operating

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.850
system is important, and I'm giving you several

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.290
choices and you can choose as many of these

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.390
choices as you'd think is appropriate in terms

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.180
of your own perspective on why you think the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.120
structure of the operating system is important. The first

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.340
one is protection, second one is performance, third one

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.490
is flexibility, the fourth one is scalability and the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.300
fifth one is agility, and the final one is responsiveness.
