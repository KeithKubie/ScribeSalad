00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.620
A fan-favorite movie or TV character begins
with perfect casting: but perfect isn't always

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.809
obvious from the start. Sometimes, directors
or actors find out too late that a role or

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.390
performance just isn't going to cut it - leaving
studios scrambling to find replacements. They

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.220
may be hard to believe, but here are 10 Actors
Who Got Fired or Replaced During Production.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.240
Ryan Gosling
These days it's hard to imagine Ryan Gosling

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.040
being replaced from any movie, but when he
showed up on set for this novel adaptation

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.550
weighing in at 210 pounds, director Peter
Jackson was shocked. Gosling figured that

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.590
gaining 60 pounds was right for the role,
but Jackson... didn't. Mark Wahlberg was brought

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.969
in, and Gosling headed back to the gym.
Rebecca Gayheart

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.399
Few TV shows airing for less than one season
are as loved as Joss Whedon's space western,

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.352
and the same goes for the cast. But before
Morena Baccarin ("More-A-nuh BACK-errin")

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:56.660
landed the role of Inara Serra, the part was
filled by actress Rebecca Gayheart. But when

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.890
shooting began, Whedon knew the chemistry
was wrong, and made sure to shoot the other

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.170
characters around her for the pilot. Inara
is alone in most of her intro shots, because

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.430
the footage from the previous shoot was used
for the other actors.&nbsp;

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.520
Samantha Morton
Spike Jonze posed a powerful question: could

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.380
you fall in love with an operating system
if it had the voice of Scarlett Johansson?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.871
But that wasn't always the plan. Actress Samantha
Morton actually voiced the A.I. character

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:23.090
for the entire shoot opposite Joaquin Phoenix.
But when it came time to record the final

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.230
voice, Jonze felt something was off. Johansson
was brought in, and a Best Picture nomination

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.550
wasn't far behind.
Sean Young

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.740
In hindsight, it's hard to think of a better
pair than Michael Keaton's Batman and Kim

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.600
Basinger's Vicki Vale in Tim Burton's Batman,
but the actress only won the role after Sean

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.671
Young had to drop out - literally. While practicing
for a horse riding scene with Keaton, she

00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:46.250
fell off and broke her leg. The producers
panicked, but Basinger came sweeping in, and

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.090
no one ever looked back.
Josh Helman

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.520
When it was still First Class director Matthew
Vaughn in charge of the time travel X-Men

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.600
tale, it was going to be a young&nbsp;Juggernaut&nbsp;who
broke Magneto out of prison - with actor Josh

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.450
Helman cast in the role. But once Bryan Singer
took the reins with an eye for a super-speed

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.590
Quicksilver, the part was scrapped. Luckily,
he found a role for Helman as a young Colonel

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.280
Stryker, the human archnemesis of Charles
Xavier's young students.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.810
Scott Glenn
It's hard to imagine anyone else in the role

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.829
of Clay Morrow than Ron Perlman, but when
the pilot of Sons of Anarchy began filming,

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.890
it was another grey, grizzled actor in the
role of the club's leader: Scott Glenn. The

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.849
entire episode was filmed with Glenn, before
Perlman was brought in to reshoot everything.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.629
But look close at the gang running from the
explosion in the pilot, and you'll spot Glenn,

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.180
not Perlman, leading the pack.
Amy Purdy

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.750
Who could forget Gazelle, the Kingsman henchwoman
with razor-sharp prosthetic blades for legs?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.430
But did you know the original plan was to
actually have double amputee Paralympian Amy

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.459
Purdy play the part? She went as far as wirework
rehearsals, but when the movie got delayed

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.579
and jeopardized Purdy's Olympic training,
she had to pass it up.

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.019
Lou Ferrigno
Ridley Scott's epic paid tribute to plenty

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.590
of classic sword-and-sandals gladiator films,
but it almost included one massive cameo.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.459
Lou Ferrigno, a veteran of the genre in his
early film career before playing the Incredible

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.870
Hulk was set to play the massive gladiator
Tigris of Gaul, in the tiger-filled arena

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.680
sequence. But during production, Danish bodybuilder
Sven-Ole Thorsen campaigned for the part,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.420
and won it. Leaving us to forever wonder:
who would win in a fight? The Hulk, or Superman's

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.819
dad?
Eminem

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.390
When the producers of Southpaw decided it
was time for a different kind of boxing movie,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.760
they knew just how to make it: by casting
rapper Eminem, in a "spiritual sequel" to

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.360
his critic-stunning role in the semi-autobiographical
8 Mile (Universal). Knowing the rapper's history,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.810
he was pitched the idea of a down-and-out
boxer fighting for his daughter, and Eminem

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.420
signed on, kicking the project into high gear.
The creator of Sons of Anarchy wrote the script,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.389
former amateur boxer Antoine Fuqua signed
on to direct, and his meeting with Eminem

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.599
went perfectly. But just before he was to
stat his training, the rapper decided another

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.680
album had to come first. Jake Gyllenhaal was
brought in instead, and after gaining the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.719
muscle needed, cameras rolled.
Christian Bale

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.010
Just because you've been replaced on a film,
doesn't mean you won't still get the part.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.629
When Director Mary Herron looked to adapt
the novel "American Psycho," she knew Christian

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.769
Bale was the man for the role - but the studio
had doubts. No one was more surprised than

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.860
Bale when Leonardo DiCaprio was announced
to have signed on, pushing both its star and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.800
director out. But the duo stayed determined,
with Bale even telling Ewan McGregor not to

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.500
accept the studio's offer, until they finally
returned to their original picks.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.609
Those are just a few of the cases where a
role turned out completely different than

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.540
it might have originally, but there's plenty
more to choose from. Let us know your own
