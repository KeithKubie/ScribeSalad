00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.100
The goals of Valient load balancing in the VL Two network are to spread

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.230
traffic evenly across the servers, and to ensure that traffic load

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.680
is balanced independently of the destinations of the traffic flows.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.570
Field two achieves this by inserting an indirection level. Into the switching

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.800
hierarchy. When a switch at the access

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.430
layer wants to send traffic to a destination, it first selects a switch

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.940
at the indirection level to send the traffic at random. This intermediate switch

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.940
then forwards the traffic to the

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.180
ultimate destination Depending on the destination MAC

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.300
address, of the traffic. Subsequent flows might

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.270
pick different, indirection, points for the traffic,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.290
at random. This notion of picking a random indirection point, to balance traffic

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.420
more evenly, across a topology, actually comes

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.300
from multi-processor architectures. And has been rediscovered

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.600
in the context of data centers. So, in this lesson we have explored how valiant

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.010
load balancing can be used on a slightly modified topology. To achieve

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.230
better load balance than in traditional fat tree networks,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.990
without an interaction layer, and valiant load balancing. In the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.920
next lesson we'll look at how a custom random topology

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.880
can make some of these traffic engineering problems even easier.
