00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.030
Okay, so now we have registered an app engine

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.220
project and we are almost ready to do some

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.920
coding. But just before we do that, let's talk

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.410
about supporting different devices for a while. One big challenge

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.960
when designing service-side applications today is that there are

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.140
so many different devices from so many different vendors

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.330
that you need to support. Different browsers, smartphone, tablet's

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.700
and computer. All having different API's that should be used.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.990
Initially, we will be using the browser for our course project. But later we

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.060
will be able to support a mobile phone without rewriting a single line of code.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.895
Having to consider this when you design your

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:41.960
server-side application is a lot of work. So how

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.130
can we solve this problem? Well, the Google Cloud

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.380
platform has solved this problem for you with a

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.530
product called Cloud Endpoints. When you use Cloud Endpoints

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.980
you can create one single API for your server

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.230
application called a Cloud Endpoint API. Cloud Endpoints can

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.360
then generate a client side API for many different

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.440
devices from many different vendors. This is great of

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.880
course because it allows you to focus on just

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.190
server side application and Cloud Endpoints will make sure

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.670
that it supports many different devices. You will learn a

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.590
lot more about Cloud Endpoints since we will use

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.640
it when we build out the course project. Enough

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.390
said, we have now created an app engine project

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.100
using the developer's console and looked at the benefits of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.380
Cloud Endpoints. It's time for you to

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.220
get a development environment up and running.
