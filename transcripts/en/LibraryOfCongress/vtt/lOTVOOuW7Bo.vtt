00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.730
&gt;&gt; Susan Reyburn: Okay
are we ready to roll?

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.650
All right.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.330
Hello and thank you
all for coming.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.760
I'm Susan Reyburn, Curator
of Baseball Americana,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.960
an exhibition currently running
here in the Jefferson Building

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.860
and continuing through
July of 2019.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.320
If you haven't had
a chance to check it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.670
out yet, I hope you will soon.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.450
Perhaps even this afternoon

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.280
after you've gotten your new
Tinker to Evers to Chance book,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.650
had it signed by the
author and it's available

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.950
for purchase behind you
in the entryway there.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.560
So today as we close
out our 3-part series

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.770
on new baseball publications
and prepare

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.640
to watch the Los Angeles Dodgers
win their third World Series,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.070
win their first World
Series in 30 years,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.450
the library is delighted
to have with us David Rapp,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.740
author of Tinker to Evers
to Chance: The Chicago Cubs

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.940
and the Dawn of Modern America.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.340
David spent more than 20 years

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.540
at Congressional
Quarterly serving as editor

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.040
and senior vice president.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.110
He's a former board member of
the National Press Foundation

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.410
and he mastered his craft

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.130
as a hard-boiled newspaper
beat reporter in Memphis,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.260
Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.290
As the book's title
suggests, there's more here

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.650
than the makings of a story
double play trio made immortal

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.240
in 1910 through the
poetic musings

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.450
of New York newspaper
columnist Franklin Pierce Adams.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.420
In addition to seeing what
made the threesome tick

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.010
and the dynamics of the Cubs
early 20th Century dynasty,

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.920
the book illumines for us the
City of Chicago in the years

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.020
after it grabbed the
world's attention as host

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.190
of the World Columbian
Exposition.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.800
This is a fascinating read
whether you are a baseball fan

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.360
who likes history on the
side or a history buff

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.380
who likes a large
helping of baseball.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.880
After the talk there will
be time for questions.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.510
So ladies and gentlemen,
David Rapp.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.160
[ Applause ]

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.130
&gt;&gt; David Rapp: Thank you.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.380
I've lost the, let's
try this again here.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.450
That'll work.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.870
These are the saddest
of possible words,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.270
Tinker to Evers to Chance.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.900
A trio of bear cubs
and freer than birds,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.980
Tinker and Evers and Chance.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.070
Ruthlessly pricking our gonfalon
bubble making a giant hit

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.690
into a double.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.490
Words that are heavy
with nothing but trouble.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.810
Tinker to Evers to Chance.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.370
So that's the way most of us
know about these three guys is

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.760
through this poem that Susan
mentioned written in 1910

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.470
by a newspaper columnist in
New York, who actually is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.060
from Chicago and was
a lifelong Cubs fan.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.450
And that's also obviously
the top,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.760
the reason I wrote
the book was to find

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.310
out a little bit
more about them.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.860
As Susan said, I'm a journalist
by training and profession.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.760
I'm not, I'm going to
have to back off here.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.740
I worked at Congressional Corley

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.600
and Roll Call [phonetic]
for 30 years.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.320
I started out as a sports
writer for my hometown newspaper

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.540
in Evansville, Indiana, and
went on and have been trying

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.840
to cover sports ever since.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.250
I got sidetracked into
politics for about 40 years

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.730
and I tell you this
is a lot more fun,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.510
but I've also been
a Chicago Cubs fan

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.960
since I was 10 years old.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.700
My dad got his PhD in
University of Wisconsin

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.240
over the course of 13 summers.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.010
So I took the family up
there every year and we lived

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.640
across the hall the
first year from a lawyer,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.090
law student from Chicago,
who brainwashed me right then

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.700
and told me I needed
to be rooting

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.910
for Ernie Banks not Mickey
Mantle or any of the things

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.650
that all the other kids were.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.570
Little did I realize that
my passion and loyalty

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.210
of the Cubs would never
be requited through most

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.760
of my lifetime until
just 2 years ago,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.700
but that's what got me into
this topic to begin with.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.490
These 3 guys, Joe Tinker, Johnny
Evers or Evers as they say it

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.520
up in Troy, New York, where
he's from, and Frank Chance

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.970
where the shortstop,
second baseman

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.190
and first baseman player/manager
of the Chicago Cubs from 1903

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.140
to 1912 was there
period of time.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.090
They're immortalized by Frank
Adams, Franklin P. Adams,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.460
who was a member of
the, a charter member

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.760
of the Algonquin Roundtable,
which included people

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.980
like Robert Benchley
and Dorothy Parker,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.180
but at the time 1910 he was
just a, wrote a humor column

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.200
for the New York Evening
Standard and included a lot

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.020
of poetry and things like
that including his own,

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.320
and the story goes that he had
finished up his column one day

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.140
and was on his way up to catch
a ballgame in the Polo Grounds

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.860
where the American League
Highlanders were playing.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.160
And he got a call from the
composing room just as he was

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.530
about to leave saying his
column was 8 lines short.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.910
So he had to come up with
8 lines and there was

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.110
on his desk a newspaper from
about the game the day before

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.010
in Chicago between the Cubs
and the Giants and deep down,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.510
the Cubs had won the
game 4 to 2 with the help

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.910
of a rally killing play
in the 7th inning and deep

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.590
down the box score he saw
it said double play Tinker

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.690
to Evers to Chance.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.730
And so that led to this little
piece of doggerel he produced,

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.640
which turned out to be probably
the second most famous poem

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.680
about baseball after Casey
and the Bat, Casey at the Bat.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.690
And caused a sensation, a
viral media sensation of 1910.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.430
The newspapers would reprint
it all over the country

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.050
and then sports editors would
write their own versions of it

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.750
from there and then he'd
reprint those and it went

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.270
on all summer long, but
became quite a sensation.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.180
A couple things about it you
may know it as baseball lexicon.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.270
This is actually a scan
of the original version

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.950
from the Evening
Standard in 1910.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.250
A librarian friend of mine,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.930
Jack Bales down at Mary
Washington University,

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.400
found for us.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.980
Adams renamed it
Baseball Lexicon shortly

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.380
after it came out.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.680
And then I'm sure
you're wondering

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.710
about this phrase,
our gonfalon bubble.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.030
Anybody know what a gonfalon is?

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.970
It's a, a banner,
medieval Italian banner

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:19.340
or pennant especially one with
streamers hung from a cross bar

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.780
as you're going into battle.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.480
And so if you look at that
ruthlessly pricking our gonfalon

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.490
bubble means our pennant
fever essentially.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.780
So these are the 3 guys, Tinker,
Evers and Chance and I want

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.560
to talk a little bit about them

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.930
but also what I think is
a marvelous way of looking

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.130
at baseball at the time
and how baseball became our

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.090
national pastime.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.460
For most of the time up until
they played it was the phrase

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.880
used most often for baseball
was the national game

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.810
and that was a product of
its history and it's kind

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.090
of way it evolved
from different games.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.010
It was a Massachusetts
game, a New York game

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.330
and was pretty much
during the Civil War

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.110
that the rules coalesced
around one game.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.880
So somebody from Troy, New York,
like Johnny Evers or Kansas City

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.360
like Joe Tinker or Fresno,
California, like Frank Chance,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.860
could all play the same
game if one showed up

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.620
and they'd be playing the same
game 9 innings, 9 men to a side,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.880
4 balls, 3 strikes, you know,
all the rules we know today

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.680
but what happened in
this first [inaudible]

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.760
of the 20th Century was
that baseball transformed

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.060
into something completely
different

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.080
and that's what I'll talk
a little bit about today.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.680
So first of all let
me talk a little bit

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.180
about Joe Tinker,
the short stop.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.870
As I said, he's from
Kansas City.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.730
Actually he was born
in Muscotah, Kansas,

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.780
Atchison County, just west of
Kansas City, to an unwed mother.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.830
He was actually one
of a, a pair of twins

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.030
but his twin sister died

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.020
or who knows what
happened very early on.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.430
He didn't have any
memory of her.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.580
It was some talk that he
had an Italian father.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.330
You can kind of tell from
his looks he has that kind

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.670
of swarthy Mediterranean
good looking,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.460
he's actually the most
popular player of the 3.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.000
He was a real crowd pleaser in
his day and he ended up going

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.140
on into vaudeville as
a vaudevillian actor

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.400
in uniform during
his playing days.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.290
So he made a lot of
money in the winters,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.070
in the off season [inaudible].

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.240
Anyway his mother moved

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.380
to Kansas City was essentially
shunned out of Muscotah,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.540
moved to Kansas City when he
was 3 or 4 years old and hooked

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.990
up with an itinerant butcher and
short-order cook named Tinker.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.560
And they lived in Kansas
City through this childhood.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.470
Johnny Evers or Evers as I
said Evers himself said it's

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.770
pronounced Evers in Troy

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.070
but everyone else
pronounces it Evers.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.650
So you can do it either way
as far as he was concerned.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.210
Specifically he's
from south Troy,

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:04.050
which was the Irish/American
enclave of Troy

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:09.300
and his nickname
was the human crab.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.700
For one reason because he
played second base side to side

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.500
like a crab moving
sideways but also

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.060
because as one reporter
says he's just a jangled

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.200
up bundle of nerves.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.400
Always barking at the umpire,
constantly haranguing anybody

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.080
on the other team or the umpire.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.590
Frank Chance, who played next
to him at first base, once said,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.460
told Tinker he says I wish
I played in the outfield

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.970
so I wouldn't have to listen
to Evers all day long.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.510
But he also had an
amazing baseball IQ

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.540
and became famous for it.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.120
He went to bed with the
rule book every night

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:52.200
and so he was a spindly little
kid, you know, he was 5 feet 5,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.080
120 pounds or something
when he started playing.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.690
Very different from Frank
Chance who was a big,

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.710
one of the biggest players of
his day at 6 feet, 190 pounds.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.640
Again, he's from
Fresno, California.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.230
He was an amateur boxer.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.470
When he was growing
up, he played football,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.090
he was a mountaineer,
anything he could do in terms

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:16.260
of proving his physical
prowess he was willing to do.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.600
His nickname out in
California was Husk for tough

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.810
as a corn husk, but Chicago
sports writers eventually would

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.330
refer to him as the
perilous leader

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.590
because he was a man
totally in charge.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:36.580
So what we've got here is
kind of a map of America

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.290
in these 3 guys from
Troy in Upstate New York

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.220
to Kansas City to Fresno.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.430
As you can see, this is a
demographic map from 1890.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:50.580
The country kind of ends around
Kansas City and then picks

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.830
up again on the West
Coast at that time.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.720
So America was essentially
a composite

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.530
of very distinct
regional cultures and each

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:03.900
of these men reflected that
especially when they came

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:08.530
to Chicago together in 1903.

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.770
Evers was a product of a
classic Irish stem family.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.360
This is a family photo.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.850
He's the young boy in the middle
in the back row he was about 14.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.100
His father was an iron monger.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.620
His grandfather was an
immigrant came across in 1840s

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.550
as a penniless immigrant
from Ireland.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:34.570
John Evers, Sr got a job
at the iron works in Troy.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.470
Troy was probably the biggest
iron center of the country

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.190
in the middle of
the 19th Century.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.980
And eventually got hooked

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.620
up with the Democratic
political machine.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.330
Became quite a successful
political operative.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.670
His father was actually the,
became president and chairman

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.110
of the school board
even though he sent all

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.110
of his kids to parochial
schools.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:13:01.890
Kansas City at the time was a
boom town on the west thanks

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.800
to railroads and the stockyards

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.450
that they had and
things like that.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.270
In fact, it was such a boom town
it was considered too crowded

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.570
for its own good.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.950
Families wouldn't move there
because there was just no space

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.880
to run around and
we'll talk a little bit

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.180
about that in a minute too.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.540
And then Frank Chance
each of his parents came

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.320
across to California on the
Oregon Trail as children.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.270
The young boy there in the
middle is about the age

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:36.980
of William Chance
when he came across

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.600
and as this shows they
came across on foot.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.250
It was 2000 miles.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.720
Those wagons weren't for people.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.680
The wagons was for their stuff.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.740
And it was an obviously arduous
ordeal through mountains,

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:59.620
desert and snow storms
in the upper mountains.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.290
Dennis Chance, Frank's
grandfather, was part of a party

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.300
that came over in one of the
first 1846 and they were just

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.050
about a week or two
ahead of the Donner Party

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.900
as they crossed the
Sierra Nevadas.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:19.570
So, it was, it was essentially
the defining moment of that,

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.640
not just that family but
that state and the culture

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.570
that was developing
out in California

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.070
through the second
half of the century.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:34.050
So baseball as I said was
still a formative sport.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.470
There was many different
games and rules.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.280
The Civil War helped
foster this national game.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.680
This is a picture of a prisoner
of war camp in North Carolina

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.020
where union soldiers
were playing baseball.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.680
Then they all came
back home after the war

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:56.380
and started developing the game
pretty much as we know it today.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.250
the 1880s is when professional
baseball really took off.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.330
The National League
was founded in 1876.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:08.810
The 1880s were a free-wheeling,

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.420
fun for fun sake kind
of time for baseball.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.690
It was personified by this
guy Mike King Kelly who played

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.110
for the Chicago White Stockings
and then eventually for Boston.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:23.450
It was free spirited,
lots of showmanship,

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.380
lots of gamesmanship,
but it was all in fun

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:31.100
and everybody sort
of took it that way.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.450
This is a classic
painting that hung on a lot

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.450
of barroom walls called
Slide, Kelly, Slide.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.970
He was the Babe Ruth of his day.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.990
In fact, some people said he
was more popular in his day

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.480
than Babe Ruth was in his.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.110
Hard for us to believe
but this was a witness

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.580
who saw both men play.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.170
In the meantime,
baseball was kind

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.810
of developing also
regional interests.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:02.060
This is a picture of
the old Troy Haymakers.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:08.190
Troy was just a baseball mad
town and all the Evers, brothers

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.340
and uncles and cousins everybody
played baseball in Troy.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:18.730
And Kansas City as I said was
very crowded, overcrowded place,

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:24.150
but the city fathers realized
that and remarkably started one

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.160
of the first of the City
Beautiful Movements that came

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.020
across the United States
and hired a protege

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.720
of Frederick Long Olmsted to
come and design a whole system

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.380
of parks and boulevards that
still exist in the city today.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.650
So this is where Joe Tinker
grew up playing baseball was

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.950
in these kind of parks.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.660
There was also a center for an
organization called the Society

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.960
of Christian Endeavor.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.810
It was a youth Christian
organization, ecumenical.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.700
It was developed to
try to get boys back

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.390
into the church frankly and
one of the things that emerged

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:01.020
out of that was because kind
of Victorian protestant society

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.400
of the 19th Century
discouraged child's play

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.480
and emphasized hard work
and applying yourself.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:14.320
The YMCA and the Christian
Endeavor groups started

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.150
promoting something they
called muscular Christianity,

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.110
which was encouraging people
to get out and exercise

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:24.000
and develop their bodies
as well as their spirit.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.040
And so this became kind of the
cultural turning point for a lot

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.970
of young boys in particular
and Kansas City was one

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.730
of the places that
was happening.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.290
And then California in the
1880s was obviously still very

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.590
rural place.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.960
There was barely a Los
Angeles at the time.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.930
The center of activity was San
Francisco and the Bay Area,

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:51.430
but every town was, had its own
baseball, amateur baseball team.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:57.180
And they started developing
a routine what they called

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.480
Sunday baseball.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.780
They'd take one day off a week

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.420
and 2 towns would challenge
each other and play baseball.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:10.670
So baseball was really much more
of an amateur sport until 1900s

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.030
when the Pacific Coast League
really got off the ground.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:17.210
Professional baseball never
really did before then.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.980
Frank Chance was one of the
early kids who got involved.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.760
This is a picture of the
Fresno Expositors named

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.830
after the newspaper
that sponsored them.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.610
Frank is the 12-year old lying

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.050
on the bottom left
on the floor there.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:40.010
He was the youngest player on
the team and they would, again,

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.360
they would go around challenging
kids from other leagues

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.090
but the newspaper bought
them these fancy uniforms.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:51.500
So, these are the 3 young
men as the century turned

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.810
from 1890s to the 2000s.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.410
Each bringing with them
kind of their own reason

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.810
for getting involved
in baseball,

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.670
which was not necessarily
what young men were supposed

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.490
to do at the time.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:11.060
For Tinker I think it
was very much a desire

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.670
for middle class acceptance,
acceptability rising

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.320
from the kind of lower rungs of
the social order he grew up in.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.460
He saw baseball as a way to
get that kind of acceptance.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.790
Johnny Evers it was,
there was an expression

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.780
in south Troy called south
Troy against the world.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.960
And there was a strong
Irish/Catholic sense

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.070
of grievance against the
Anglo-Saxon overlords

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.340
from England as well as
in the United States.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.640
This was, again, the period

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.080
where the No Irish Need Apply
signs were hung on shop walls.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.810
So baseball, the Irish were
incredible baseball players.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.730
In fact, they almost
took over the game.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:20:00.940
In the 1890s, there was 4 or
5 Irish players on every team

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:04.270
at the time and I go into the
book a little bit why I think

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.020
that is, but part of it
is because they realized

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:15.890
that was one way they could beat
the protestant Anglos they were

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.190
up against.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.890
For Chance I think it
was for him a question

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:24.010
of proving himself
worthy of his parents

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.740
and grandparent's legacy.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:29.590
There wasn't a way
to cross the country

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.620
like the Oregon Trail was
but sports in particular

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.920
and baseball ultimately
became a way for him

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.800
and baseball competition to
prove himself on the field.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.100
There was only one problem

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.350
at the time the 1890s
professional baseball had turned

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.290
really sour.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.050
It was no longer
fun and carefree.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.450
In fact, it was dirty
and mean and vicious.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.480
One woman writer would
later call it the rough

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.010
and tumble game played by
9 rowdies for the benefit

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.750
of a crowd of hoodlums.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.770
And not surprisingly
not too many women

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.310
and children would show
up for these things.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:14.510
In fact, even the kids
games these were cartoons

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:21.210
from several papers printed
called The Usual Windup,

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:25.180
which is how baseball games
would end up at the time.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:29.360
So there was essentially 3
reasons baseball was turning

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.390
sour in the 1890s,
professional baseball.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.150
I don't know if you've heard
of these words, hoodlumism,

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:39.120
which is essentially the idea of
dirty baseball anyway, cheating,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.910
anything you could do to get a
competitive edge whether it's

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:47.490
spiking your opponent
to, the trick was to,

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.990
because there was
only one umpire.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.290
If an umpire was
looking the other way,

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:55.580
you could round a base and miss
third base by 10 or 20 feet

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.960
as you were heading home.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.260
Anything you could
do to get away,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.940
but it was also very
foul mouthed,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.010
which is what billingskate
[phonetic] means.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:11.560
That's essentially cursing,
swearing, vulgarity.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.820
It got so bad that the National
League had to issue an edict

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.130
against this kind of language
and they printed a memo,

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.600
which I can't read to
you in mixed company,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.540
but I put it in the book.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:30.800
And just put memo saying these
are the words you cannot say

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.100
on the field.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.570
And by penalty of suspension
from the game for life.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.500
Of course no one
would suspend anybody

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.500
for life for a curse word.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.350
So it was honored in the breach.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.790
So anyway that was [inaudible].

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.970
And then there was this
called syndicate baseball,

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.890
which the National League
would try to monopoly

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.800
in the 1890s essentially adopted
the practice of the owners

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.870
of encouraging each other
to buy minority stakes

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.010
in the other's franchises.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.170
And so toward the end of
the season if one team

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.470
that you were part

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.770
of was winning the
other team was losing,

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.850
you'd trade the good players
on the losing team immediately

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.430
to the better team and give
yourself a competitive edge.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.870
Sports writer saw through that.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.170
They're the ones who came

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:17.210
up with this term
syndicate baseball,

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.230
but some of the fans
I mean attendance

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:24.180
in National League games was
really plummeting particularly

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.180
compared to other sports that
were emerging in the gay 90s.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.870
Bicycling, big, huge craze
for bicycling in the 1890s

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.640
and bicycle competitions.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.550
Another thing called
pedestrianism.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:37.860
I don't know if anybody
has heard of that,

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.830
but these are walking races
sometimes very absurd walking

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.120
races like weeks long
or things like that,

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.450
but people would show up,
hundreds and thousands

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.910
of people would show
up for these things.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:56.180
So baseball had a problem and
it was personified by this guy,

00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.910
John Mugsy McGraw, who
was the third baseman

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.210
for the Baltimore Orioles.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.560
He was the one famous for
grabbing the runner's belt

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.530
as he rounded third
base and keeping him

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.280
from running into home.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.140
In fact, McGraw is,
then he became manager

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:18.660
of the New York Giants
in the 1900s.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:24.460
And his name McGrawism became
synonymous with dirty baseball

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.580
and that's what the sports
writers used to call it.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:36.960
Fortunately, there was a
visionary out in the Midwest

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.570
by the name of Ban Johnson,
Byron Bancroft Johnson.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.310
He was the president
of the Western League,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.790
a minor league at the time.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:48.670
He saw an opportunity and so he
renamed his league the American

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:53.710
League, moved the headquarters
to Chicago, set up franchises

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.710
in Boston and Philadelphia
and New York right

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.090
up against the National
League teams,

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.800
which had been prohibited
before then with the agreement

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.520
that had operated between
the major and minor leagues.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.820
And promoted what he
called clean baseball

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.860
that people could not be
afraid to bring their wives

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.750
and children to the game, where
the umpires had the rule of law

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.860
and he would back them up.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:25.820
There would be none of the
cheating, cursing and dirty play

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.800
that characterized
the National League.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.140
And lo and behold the American
League teams started outdrawing

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.440
National League teams

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.020
or outdrawing National
League teams.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.870
The White Sox, which had
set up in the Southside

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.630
of Chicago was outdrawing
the Colts as they were called

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:46.310
in the National League.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:52.910
So, essentially Johnson declared
war on the National League

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.110
and the National League
sued for peace and they came

00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:01.200
up with what's called the
National Agreement of 1903

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.180
or the two leagues agreed
to abide by the same rules

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.650
of recruiting and payments
and things like that

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:12.220
and then the NL itself had
to respond with its own kind

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.040
of discipline, interdiscipline,
and fortunately

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.010
in Chicago they found a guy
named Frank Sealey [phonetic]

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.680
who had been the manager,
very successful manager

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:26.020
of the Boston Bean
Eaters in the early 1890s

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:31.830
and had brought Sealey in
to manage the Colts in 1902

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:36.560
and he's very cerebral,
soft spoken leader.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.280
He never played baseball
himself unlike McGraw,

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:43.550
but he did manage very
successful teams in the Midwest,

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:49.670
and he also had a secret weapon,
which is his wife, May Sealey.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.510
This is a feature story
from the Chicago Tribune

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:57.000
where they featured
her as the wife

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.930
of Chicago's manager
is a real baseball fan.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.830
She was an Irish
immigrant herself,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.820
came over when she was 18.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.320
Very free spirited as I
said rabid baseball fan,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.620
she was a horsewoman
in her own right.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.230
She's also I discovered what
I think is the first female

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:17.840
sports writer.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.330
She went out with the Colts

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.990
to California during spring
training in 1903 and got hired

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:30.040
by a couple of newspapers in
Chicago to send back dispatches

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.340
of how the team is doing.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:36.300
These were unsigned, but you
could definitely tell just

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.730
from the tone and kind of sunny
disposition she was not the

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.440
grizzled sports writers
of the day.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:49.410
She was sending back signs of
hope for Colts fans to Chicago.

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:53.920
So together the Sealey's
kind of spearheaded a revival

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.300
of baseball in Chicago
from 1903 through 1905.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.610
The Colts started
gradually going up,

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.990
moving up the standings.

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:06.620
In 1905, it looked like
they might even get close

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:11.450
to winning the pennant but then
Sealey's own health problems

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.620
caught up to him and
he became very ill

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.690
and was ultimately diagnosed
as tuberculosis and he had

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.630
to leave the team
and the city and go

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:25.790
out to Denver to
try to get better.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.440
And so they turned the
team over to Frank Chance

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.430
as player/manager on an interim
basis that year and then he took

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:37.590
over in 1906 and 1906
was the big turning point

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:40.050
in Chicago baseball
for two reasons.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:46.920
One, the Colts now
being called the Cubs,

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.820
which is the term
France Chance preferred.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:55.310
Went on to win 116
games that season.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:00.030
The Boston Red Sox this year
won 108, which is as much

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.330
as anybody has won
in a long time.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.350
One hundred and sixteen
is still a record.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.580
The Seattle Mariners tied
it in 2001 in 162 games.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.310
This was in 153 I think the
Cubs played that year or 152.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.630
So they were a juggernaut,
but across town

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.170
down to Southside
the White Sox known

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.130
as the hitless wonders back then

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.140
because they had an anemic
offense actually won the pennant

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.340
on the last day of the season.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.820
And so the two Chicago
teams were going

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.600
to meet in the World Series.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.110
First across town
World Series 1906.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:37.370
During that year,
Chance had gone out

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.270
and decided they needed
a new third basemen,

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.430
which has become one of
the great trivia questions

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:47.980
in baseball who was the fourth
member of the Cubs infield

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.470
and there are two
right answers to this.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.040
One is I don't know.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.370
If anybody knows why
that is the right answer?

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.980
That's Abbott and Costello's
third baseman is I don't know.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.200
[Laughter] The other is
Harry Steinfeld was his name.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.310
He's a young man from Ft.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:13.200
Worth, Texas, where he was
a bicyclist in the 1890s.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.860
He also was, got hooked up with
a black-faced minstrel group

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.890
that toured Texas, which is
almost like a circus back then

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.170
but he would play baseball
during his off hours

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.370
and was discovered
doing that and signed

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.040
to a minor league contract
and ended up in Detroit.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.650
Chance had known about him
and decided he wanted him

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:37.420
and so they got him in 1906
and he turned out to be,

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:43.230
this is Steinfeld on the left,
the best hitter on the team

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.320
and then the Cubs also had
one of the great pitchers

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.890
of all time Mordecai Peter
Centennial Brown was his name

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.480
from Nyesville, Indiana.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:59.820
He had a nickname also 3 Finger
because as a boy when he was

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.590
about 5 years old he was
in a farming accident

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:07.130
and his hand got mauled by a
kind of chopper and so he only,

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:10.190
this is what his
pitching hand looked like.

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:14.090
It enabled him to
throw the most bizarre

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:17.750
and unhittable curve ball
you could ever image.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.910
[Laughter] So he and Christian
Matheson were probably the two

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.190
greatest pitchers of their era.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.560
Mordecai is in the
Hall of Fame now.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.290
As I said, Chance
became manager.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.380
Here's a picture of
him with Hugh Jennings

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.260
of the Detroit Tigers.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.620
As I said, Chance was
a monster in the field.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:42.150
He probably was the one player
who everyone rallied around.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.420
He was kind of like a
platoon sergeant in the war.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.760
Everyone was willing to
go into battle with him

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.040
because he led by example.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.860
Anyway something
happened in Chicago

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:59.220
that summer nearly everyone in
Chicago is crazy about baseball

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.280
and this is a picture of
the Westside grand stands

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.820
where the Cubs played.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:10.130
Instead of getting a few
hundred or a few thousand fans

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.370
out for an afternoon game,
they were now drawing tens

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.830
of thousands to the
games particularly

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.420
when the World Series
came around.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.390
In fact, the Tribune
ran a tongue

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.420
and cheek column here called
the only man in Chicago

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.350
who doesn't know the
Cubs and Sox are fighting

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.730
for a world's championship.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.570
[Laughter] He's a
butcher with 3 daughters.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:38.530
[Laughter] So what happened is
also part of baseball history.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:44.820
Any Sox fans, White Sox
fans in the audience?

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.050
[Laughter] You don't
know them, right?

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:53.010
Cubs as I said had 116 wins that
season, the Sox had 93 or 94

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.310
or something like that.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:55.610
They kind of snuck in

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.210
and everyone assumed the
Cubs were just going to roll

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:01.310
over the Sox in the World
Series except for one man,

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.050
Hugh Fullerton was the sports
writer for the Chicago Tribune

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.820
who sat down and he was kind

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.610
of the first sabermetric
writer in his day.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:14.480
He sort of lined up all the
pros and cons, field conditions,

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:21.810
the weather, the attributes of
each team and wrote a column

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.880
that predicted that the
Sox would win the pennant,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:29.010
the World Series, in 6 games.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.930
Well, would have predicted

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.700
that except his editor
wouldn't print the column.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.680
He was afraid everyone in town
would think they were crazy.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.620
And what happened?

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.280
Well, the Sox won the
series in 6 games.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.630
The Tribune editor
finally ate crow

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.000
and ran the column a week
later after the fact,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.130
but Hugh Fullerton was,
became later known as the man

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.500
who sniffed out the
1919 Black Sox scandal.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.470
He was played by Studs
Terkel in the movie Eight Men

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.160
Out if you've seen that one.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.830
He didn't look anything
like Studs Terkel.

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:06.250
I didn't bring a picture with me

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:10.090
but he was very urbane
intellectual.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.520
As I said, one of the first
sabermetric sports writers

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.130
became one of the great
magazine writers of his day.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:21.330
But anyway baseball
was back here and back

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:25.780
to such an extent this is
a picture from the Tribune

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:31.740
of the corner of Dearborn and
Madison Streets in Chicago

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.650
and all these people are looking

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.950
up at the Chicago Tribune
Building that afternoon.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:41.040
I don't have, they don't
have a picture of what was

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.340
on the Tribune Building
that day,

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.150
but this is what it was here
in Washington the same thing.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:50.370
It was an electric
scoreboard in which they would

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:55.530
by telegraph they would
feed every pitch and play

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:56.890
to operators of the scoreboard

00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:58.570
and they would use
electric lightbulbs

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.770
to signify the runners
who were on base,

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.490
the count and every play.

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.070
So basically you're following
the game in realtime play

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:11.110
by play from downtown
Chicago to across the country.

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:15.540
These electric scoreboards
became a real thing in this part

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.830
of the century before
radio came along in 1920s.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:23.040
It wasn't until the 1920s
that the radio took that away.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.340
So baseball was I said back.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.720
It was even invading
popular culture.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.490
Back in those days Tin Pan
Alley produced sheet music

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.640
because every home had a piano.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:39.030
Again, no radio, no phonographs,
people played their own music

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:43.170
so it was a big market for
songs, sing-a-long songs

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:46.930
and tunes and things like that.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:50.690
Baseball was never a topic
of those tunes until now.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.590
This was one of the first.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:57.690
Cubs on Parade, which was
described as a 2-step march,

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:02.050
but this, I love this picture
and that's Frank Chance

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.440
and the Cub's owner Charles
Murphy in the photograph.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.460
So that was 1907 right after
the Cubs won their first

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.840
World Series.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:17.230
In 1908, a guy named Jack
Norworth was looking around

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.730
and realized baseball
might be a good topic.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:24.100
He was not a baseball fan
himself, but he wanted

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.250
to write his, a tune
about baseball and he came

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.350
up with the lyrics
and signed up a buddy

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.950
of his named Albert Bontilsand
[phonetic] to do the music.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:34.250
This is the verse.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:35.960
So all these tunes, you
know, before you got

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.880
to the course they would
have a verse that was kind

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.660
of half sung, half spoken.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.070
Katie Casey was baseball mad.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.030
Had the fever and had it bad.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:48.890
Just to root for the hometown
crew every sou, Katie blew.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.460
On a Saturday her young
beau called to see if she'd

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:56.390
like to go to see a show,
but Miss Kate said no.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:37:00.480
I'll tell you what you can do.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.360
Take me out to the ball game.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.820
So that was the hit piece of
music, sheet music in 1908

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.350
and spawned a whole raft of
imitators and things like that.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:17.330
Dozens of baseball songs started
coming about, which tells you

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.560
that this is no longer
just a game for cranks

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.920
as they called fans
back in the day

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.670
and bugs, but women, children.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:32.180
In fact, lady's day became
a big thing back then.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:38.010
At the same time that a
craze swept through fashion,

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:42.100
American fashion based on
operetta that had opened

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:45.170
in London the year
before and now is coming

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.790
to New York called
the Merry Widow.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:55.350
And this was the
star of the show.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:59.630
I got her name wrong down here,
but this hat became a craze

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.720
when the show moved to
New York to the extent

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.840
that every woman middle
class and upper class women

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.740
in the country wanted
one of these hats

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.680
and they were very elaborate.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:12.120
This is actually a
modest one by comparison.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.640
Some would have fruit, stuffed
birds and things like that.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.560
The brims would be, well,
these women started showing

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.230
up to baseball games
and caused quite a stir

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.410
for anybody sitting behind
them trying to watch the game.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.700
One sports writer says you can
tell a real lady is the one

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.400
who takes off her
hat at the game.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.630
[Laughter] But the Cubs
were now kings of the world.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.230
They had won the World
Series in 1907 and 1908.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.470
Adopted the Cubs
as their nickname.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.930
This is their mascot
at the time.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:49.420
Not all was sweetness
and light, of course.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.780
In fact, these 2 guys, Joe
Tinker and Johnny Evers,

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.900
maintained a feud that they had
started a couple of years before

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:03.600
and refused to talk to
each other on field or off.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.180
You can kind of tell.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.700
They don't really look like they

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.480
like each other here
even though they were,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:14.790
they could wordlessly they were
the best keystone combination

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:17.940
in baseball at the time.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:20.220
They had a feud that
lasted now just

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.880
through their playing
days but even long after.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.860
But baseball was like I
said affecting the culture.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.780
Feature stories were showing
up not just in sports magazines

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.380
but in the magazines of
today, which was the Internet

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.180
of the day because everyone
had their own magazine.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:43.020
Players started turning up as
product spokesmen for things

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.230
like socks and underwear
and other things

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.600
like that not just tobacco.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:54.040
As I said, Tinker was recruited
to perform in Vaudeville.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.270
In 1909 just after winning
election of the presidency,

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:00.710
William Howard Taft took
a tour across the country,

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:03.440
a 13,000-mile tour by train.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.470
Stopped in Chicago for
a few days and insisted

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:08.790
on taking in a baseball game.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.480
In fact, they rescheduled
the game

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.690
for the day he was
available and he showed

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:20.490
up at Westside Grounds, this
is a close up of that picture,

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:24.130
and just held court all day long
and a couple of things happened.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.340
When they showed up, it was
a band kind of roving band

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.740
of musicians they immediately
started playing the Star

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.360
Spangled Banner when
he showed up,

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.200
which was not the National
Anthem at the time.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.620
It was just a popular march

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.490
and the whole crowd stood
up at the same time.

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.080
And then later on during the
game he decided he wanted

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.380
to stretch his legs.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.300
Obviously he's a big
man about 300 pounds

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.870
and it was the middle
of the 7th inning.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:52.620
He stood up and everyone in
the field stood up with him.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:59.690
It was the first instance I can
find of the 7th inning stretch.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:05.100
The thing about this the
Cubs I wanted to show this

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.160
because this shows their
record for the 10 years

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.740
that the 3 players, Tinker,
Evers and Chance played together

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:16.010
in the infield almost unheard of
that 3 players would be together

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:21.810
for 10 years, but each of
these ones highlighted here

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:30.140
on the right the win totals 116
wins in 1 year, 223 in 2 years,

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:35.230
530 in 5 years, 980 in 10
years, it's still a record.

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:39.720
No one, not the Yankees of Babe
Ruth and Lou Gehrig or Mantle

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.310
and Marris or Jeter and other.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:49.700
Not the big red machine,
the Cincinnati Reds,

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.260
no team in baseball
history has surpassed any

00:41:53.260 --> 00:42:02.530
of these win totals, which makes
you realize one reason they're

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:04.480
in the Hall of Fame all 3.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.500
They were elected
in 1946 together

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.190
by a veteran's committee.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:11.170
Still controversial
in some cases.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:15.850
A lot of people question if
they have the individual player

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.300
statistics that merit Hall
of Fame consideration.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:21.040
I argue 2 things.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.600
One, I'm not the
only one who argues

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.900
that the win totals
justifies their existence

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.630
because they were definitely
the leaders of the team,

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.570
but what they did for
baseball, what this team did

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.950
for baseball at the time.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:39.650
In fact, a word used most often
to describe the Chicago Cubs

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:44.430
of this era and this is the
Chicago Cubs I'm talking about,

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:49.030
the word most used to describe
the cubs was invincible.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:57.490
So these 3 young boys,
again, spent the first decade

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:02.040
of the 20th Century
essentially remaking baseball

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:07.990
and they did it through
a work ethic of teamwork,

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.960
relentless pursuit
of excellence.

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.790
Here's a famous picture
by George Conlin,

00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:16.790
he's here in the
Library of Congress.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.580
Obviously these guys did
not want to be pulled

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:22.230
into the dugout and have their
picture taken at the time.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.720
They were in the middle of their
practice, but those are the ones

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.890
that turned into these
incredible baseball cards

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.510
which we were able to use
for the cover of the book.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:38.360
But, again, I think by the time
they left the scene baseball

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.060
really was the national
pastime and would continue to be

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:45.380
and grow in many different ways
throughout the year, but they,

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.920
one of the things I
wanted to do was to kind

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.090
of reclaim the origin
story of the Chicago Cubs

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.470
because they didn't
quite fit the narrative

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.880
of the past 100 years, but I
think they deserve to be now so.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.180
Thank you very much.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.980
I'll be happy to
answer any questions.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.860
Anybody have any
questions or comments?

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.660
Sir?

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:20.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.720
What was the reasons
they didn't win?

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:31.190
Well, strangely the White
Sox started hitting.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.750
They didn't expect that.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:37.810
The White Sox had a very good
pitching core a couple of Hall

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:40.840
of Famers, and the weather was,

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.410
it was a lousy weather
situation.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:45.530
So there's one reason.

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:50.910
If you go through each game and,
well, White Sox won, Cubs won,

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.270
White Sox won, Cubs won
and the White Sox won too.

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:58.500
It was a strange kind of
sequence that no one expected

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.040
to happen, but that's what
happens in 7-game series

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.460
as every baseball fan knows.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:07.860
Sometimes the best teams
don't actually come out.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.060
&gt;&gt; So what's the story
about the feud between?

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:13.860
&gt;&gt; David Rapp: The feud
between, I think it was over,

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.650
I think I pieced it together.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.880
So, I think it goes back to,
well, I think it goes back

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:24.570
to when Evers first showed
up in 1902 he was brought

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:29.190
down from Troy in September of
1902 in an all-night train ride

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.800
and fitted out with a uniform

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.740
that was 10 sizes
too big for him.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.250
Went out and had a, it
was a double header,

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:39.660
Labor Day double header,
and had a terrible outing,

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.320
but because he was
the rookie the rest

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.560
of the team was hazing him.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:48.180
So they made him, they
used to take these omnibus,

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.660
horse-drawn omnibus to the park.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.460
They would dress in the hotel,
take an omnibus to the park

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.780
and when he came out
to get on the bus,

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.700
they said there's no room on
the bus you have to sit on top.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.190
So he had to sit on
top out to the park

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:03.250
and he had a terrible day and
he had to sit back on the top

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.290
on the way back and
he knew all the guys

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:06.950
down below were making
fun of him.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:08.690
Well, one of those
guys was the one

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.840
who was the rookie before
showed up, Joe Tinker.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.320
And so by a couple years
later most of the other people

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.780
on that team had been reshuffled
and Sealey had brought

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.570
in all kinds of other people,
but Tinker was still there

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:25.590
and then in 1905 the Cubs were
on their way to Cincinnati

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:29.110
by train and stopped
off in Bedford, Indiana,

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:32.260
for an exhibition game with
the local minor league team

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:35.550
because one of their
pitchers was from Bedford.

00:46:35.550 --> 00:46:37.210
And the town pulled
out all the stops

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:41.460
and actually had 5 handsome
cabs for all the players,

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.850
to take all the players to
the ball park and the last,

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.580
both Tinker and Evers were
kind of late getting dressed

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:53.230
and Evers came down first and
saw the last cab there hopped on

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:57.280
and said take me to the
ball park and left Tinker

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.440
to walk the mile on the hot
dusty road to the ball park.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.410
So they were warming
up before the game

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.260
and Tinker took the ball and
about the distance from me

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.360
to you threw it as hard as he
could at Evers and Evers used

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.890
to show his hand how mangled
it was because of that.

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:20.160
Within a few seconds they
were on the ground brawling.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.980
Well, the pitcher, I forgot his
name, for Bedford, turns around

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:28.610
and sees his teammates and runs
over and tries to break them up

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.030
and they kind of pull
him down into the melee.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:36.410
So the 3000 fans and the fans
see their local hometown hero

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:44.430
getting beat up and they
all rushed to the scene.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.000
[Laughter] Order is
restored after all of this,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.470
they play the game as
if nothing had happened,

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:52.130
the fight gets mentioned
in the newspapers all

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.020
over the country,
but not the reason.

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.370
It was Hugh Fullerton
again a year later

00:47:56.370 --> 00:48:01.830
who described this cab incident
as the cause which started it,

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:06.180
but and I think that actually
goes back because the Irish,

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:10.620
you know, have long memories,
you know, never forgive,

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:13.900
never forget, and it
was almost 3 years

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.840
that Evers was finally able
to get his revenge on Tinker

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.490
with that cab incident, but
they basically had said, look,

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:24.090
you know, we can't play
together if we're going to talk

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:28.500
to each other so we just
won't talk to each other.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:32.030
Oddly Tinker said they were
the first to defend the other

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:34.390
in any fight against another
player on another team.

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:36.740
It says we're Cubs first,
individuals second, you know,

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.040
they had the team
ethic [inaudible].

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:44.020
And, in fact, it was Chance who
probably kept them, you know,

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.210
because when Chance was hurt
at the end of the 1912 season

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:53.970
and had to leave the team, they
named Evers interim manager,

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:57.320
which was the last thing Tinker
wanted and there were a couple

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.280
of fights in the dugout
that players had to break

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.950
up the 2 guys and Tinker
finally left and jumped leagues

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.160
to the new Federal League
to get away from Evers.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.510
They reconciled back in the
1930s, but it was a long time.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:16.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:23.170
Okay, so Chance was the first
one who had to leave in 1912.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.250
He had brain surgery.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.430
Another thing about
him being touch

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:31.210
as a corn husk he never
dodged a bullet or a baseball

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:32.890
and it was actually this side.

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:35.710
He got hit in the head a
lot of times to the extent

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:39.590
that he lost his hearing
and so he had left.

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:45.390
He actually came back a year or
so later and managed the Yankees

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.330
or the Highlanders they
were called at the time.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:50.720
It was before Babe
Ruth joined the team

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.140
so they were a lousy team
and they didn't do much.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.570
He ended up in, back
in California

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.800
and helped really get the
Pacific Coast League going

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:06.380
as vice president and management
of the teams and he died young.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.990
He was in his 50
years old or something

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:11.730
like that when he died.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.750
Tinker as I said jumped leagues
to the new Federal League,

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:18.480
which the Chicago
Whales [phonetic] played

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.620
in a new park called Weeghman
Park on the Northside,

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.800
which Weeghman as the owner
of the league of the Whales,

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.100
the league only lasted a year

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:31.370
but Weeghman then bought
the Cubs and moved them

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:35.160
up to Weeghman Park and then
he eventually sold the park

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:37.820
and the team to Wrigley,
William Wrigley

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.380
and it's been Wrigley
Field ever since.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:45.300
And so he played rough
and Tinker jumped

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:50.560
around for a few years, managed
some, never successfully,

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.170
and he ended up in Florida

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.500
as a real estate speculator
during the Florida real estate

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.590
boom and won and lost and won

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:02.400
and lost a fortune a
couple of times there.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:08.580
Johnny Evers had an
interesting kind of second act.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:14.370
He got sold to the
Boston Braves in 1914

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.540
and was given a $40,000 salary.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.760
The highest paid player
in baseball at the time.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.820
The Boston Braves were
in last place in August.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.270
Evers was the captain of the
team and they're now known

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.750
as the Miracle Braves
because they ended

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.310
up winning the pennant and
the World Series that year.

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:31.920
Definitely behind Johnny.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.570
He ended up going
back and managed

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.720
for the Cubs a bit,
for the White Sox.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.780
He jumped around and ended up
living out his days in Troy,

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.480
New York, as owner
of a shoe store.

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.350
That's his things.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.510
Sir?

00:51:47.510 --> 00:52:00.210
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:01.510
No, never.

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:03.730
Yeah. They're not known as
a double play combination.

00:52:03.730 --> 00:52:07.420
That's the odd thing,
but one reason is

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.530
because very few
runners got to first

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:11.830
against their pitching core.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:15.600
They didn't have that many
opportunities for double plays,

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.620
but yeah that one

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:22.060
that [inaudible] is one
Franklin Adams picked up on

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.510
and made a thing, yeah.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:29.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.110
Frank Chance is the best
player of the 3 definitely.

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:35.160
Johnny Evers I think was,
again, showing what he did

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.710
in Boston I think proved it

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:41.400
that he was probably the best
on-field captain any team could

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:46.600
have, but Tinker, Tinker
was probably the hardest one

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.330
to justify based
on his statistics.

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:51.490
Although I do want to point

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:53.840
out that Christian
Matheson [phonetic],

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.980
again the best pitcher
of his day along

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:59.870
with three-fingered
Brown, on the first page

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:04.080
of his autobiography, first
page said I could never get Joe

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.380
Tinker out.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.090
He had to get that out
of the way right away.

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:10.290
Tinker hit like 400
against Christian Matheson.

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:13.040
He was one of the
clutch hitters especially

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:19.510
in that 1907-1908 seasons
they won the World Series.

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:24.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.170
So, yeah. So the, I didn't get
into that so I'm glad you asked.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:33.210
So the Cubs had won the pennant
in 1906, dethroning the Giants

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:38.460
who had been the world champions
from 1905 and McGraw's Giants,

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.330
they lost the World Series,
in 1907 they came back

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:44.470
with a vengeance and won the
pennant and the World Series

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:47.500
against the Detroit
Tigers in 4 games.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.320
I think one was a
rain out so 5 games,

00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:55.570
but and then 1908 there was
a pennant race of all time

00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:57.900
and it was actually a
great book about just

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.430
that one season called Crazy
08 if anybody is interested,

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:03.840
but it's the Giants, the
Cubs and the Pirates,

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.320
Honus Wagner's Pirates, were
in a pennant race until,

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:11.030
the 3 of them until literally
the last day of the season.

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:13.230
There was one game in
particular it's famous

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:17.060
for what's been known as one of
the great baseball [inaudible]

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:19.730
of all time Merkle's Boner.

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:25.450
A young kid named Fred Merkle
was on first base in the bottom

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:30.820
of the ninth inning with a
runner on third base as well

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.170
and the Giants hit a single
up the middle, clean single

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:39.020
into center field that scored
the run from third base

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.410
to win the game and 2
weeks before the end

00:54:41.410 --> 00:54:44.320
of the season everyone thought
would be propel the Giants

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.710
to the pennant.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:49.160
But Johnny Evers who had been
studying the rule book as I said

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:54.250
at night in bed had tried,
the habit was at the time

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:55.550
if something like that
happened the runner

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:58.100
at first base wouldn't go
to second, touch second,

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.670
he would just run to the
dugout or in that case

00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:03.200
into the outfield club house
and that's what Merkle did.

00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.760
It was a big game,
thousands of fans,

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.980
he sees the winning run score
and the fans start pouring

00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:12.000
onto the field, his Giants
teammates are running

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.770
out of the dugout toward
the right field club house

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:19.090
to get away from the fans
so Merkle just turned

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:20.660
around halfway between
first and second

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.910
and hightailed it with them.

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:27.520
Johnny Evers saw this, called
for the ball from center field,

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:32.320
the ball comes flying in misses
him completely and hits Tinker

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.200
in the back and falls into
the middle of the infield.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.680
Well, the fans are streaming
on him and the first base coach

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:45.050
of the Giants, Joe McGinnity
was one of the great pitchers

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:48.200
but this day was coaching first
base sees all this happening

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:51.790
and kind of sizes up what Evers
is up to and runs on the field

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:57.140
and grabs the ball and tries
to throw it into the stands,

00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:59.730
but Joe Tinker has got
a bear hug around him

00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.000
so he can't throw it
very far and it lands

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.900
over by the Cubs dugout
where there's also a bag

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.650
of balls and things like that.

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:13.170
Everyone races to that
ball, a fan picks it up

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:16.870
and holds it aloft and one of
the Cubs pitchers says give me

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:18.480
that ball and he said no.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.260
So he just bopped him over
the head and the ball dropped

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:25.330
and he grabbed it and threw it
back to Evers who was standing

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:30.810
on second base at this time and
there was actually 2 umpires

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:34.340
for this game not
necessarily a usual thing,

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:39.790
but one of them had been, Hank
O'Day was the home plate umpire,

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.330
had seen the same play,

00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.880
Evers pulled the same play 2
weeks before in Pittsburgh.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.400
Oh, he didn't see it.

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:50.860
That was what Hank O'Day claimed
he didn't see the ball being

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:55.330
tagged before the runner got
there so he disallowed it

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:59.930
but the Cubs put up such a stink
about it and protested the game

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:02.670
that Evers, O'Day finally said,
well, you're probably right.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:05.050
If it happens again,
I'd call him out.

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:08.070
So, 2 weeks later in New
York it happened again

00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:11.600
but here's the thing New
York fans have complained

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.440
about this forever because
it was the custom not

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:19.030
to touch second base, it's a
technicality, it's a force out,

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:20.780
the run doesn't score.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:24.490
Well, O'Day admitted
and I found a piece,

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:26.390
an interview he gave
to the Tribune.

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:29.250
He hardly ever talked
about this thing,

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:34.370
but he actually managed the Cubs
in 1914 I think it was a year

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:38.750
after Evers and he's still
living in Evers' shadow

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:41.730
and never liked him as you
can imagine no umpire would

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:43.080
like Johnny Evers.

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:47.290
So he was giving and
he was basically trying

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:50.570
to downplay Evers' role in
the Merkle's Boner play.

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:54.170
It wasn't Evers he says
it was Sully Hoffman

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:56.160
out in center field who
recognized what was happening

00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.800
and threw the ball in,
but then he said, well,

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.700
and besides it didn't matter.

00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:05.200
He says I called it interference
because McKinney ran

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.100
onto the field before
the play was over

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:11.810
and that's what he ruled and,
therefore, the play was dead,

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:14.030
And it was the bottom of
the 9th and it was darkness

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:16.840
so they called the game
because of darkness.

00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:20.420
And any Cubs fans, older
Cub's fans like me remember

00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:23.050
if you call a game because
of darkness in Chicago,

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:25.550
the Cubs didn't have
lights until 1988,

00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:27.850
you have to replay
the entire game.

00:58:27.850 --> 00:58:30.080
You don't just pick it
up where it left off.

00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.500
So the National League
finally ruled

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.050
that the game was suspended
because of darkness is a tie

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:38.270
and would be replayed at the
end of the season if necessary

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:42.930
and it was necessary just like
these last, this last week

00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:47.330
and the Cubs won that game
pretty easily although there

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:48.630
was, they figured it was

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:52.400
in the [inaudible] Grounds
250,000 people showed up for

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:57.250
that game both in the park, on
the roof of the stadium but also

00:58:57.250 --> 00:59:01.510
on Cogan's Bluff overlooking
the stadium it was one

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:05.090
of the biggest gatherings of
humanity in history up until

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:10.680
that point, but that's what
decided the 1908 season was

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.620
that one play.

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:19.510
I think one more question?

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:26.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:28.830
I can't, I should know that but
I can't, but none of them were

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:31.880
over 300 for instance.

00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:35.470
I would say I think Chance ended
up, well, I did look this up.

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:40.050
If you look at Chance's numbers
from the 5 years they won

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:43.690
in 1906, his on-base percentage

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:45.510
which is what everyone
looks at today, right?

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:49.530
So it's hits, walks
and hit by pitches.

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:54.050
Frank Chance was hit 90
times during those 5 years.

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.930
[Laughter] Which pushes his
on-base average up to 480

00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:00.230
or something like that.

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:05.460
So that was him but the
other 2 were more like 260,

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:09.490
280 hitters essentially
in that range, yeah.

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:11.510
One more.

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:23.360
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.760
It was a sports writer.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:28.370
So back in those days team
didn't necessarily own

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:29.910
their nicknames.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:32.950
It was not like today where
they're brand trademarks.

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:36.300
The sports writers gave
them nicknames and there's

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.980
so many newspapers that
each paper used to come

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.660
up with its own nickname for the
team just to distinguish itself.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.420
So, the White Stockings,

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.030
which is what the original
National League franchise was

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:51.290
called, kind of lost
that moniker

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:55.430
when they were rebuilding
under Cap Ansen in the 1890s

01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:58.480
and reporters started calling
them the Colts, Ansen's Colts

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.660
because they were all young
kids he had gathered together,

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.530
but then when Ansen left he
was kind of the patriarch

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.450
of Chicago baseball
and he played

01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:10.000
until he was 48 years old one
paper started calling them

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.360
the Orphans.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.820
And then they started writing
some other minor league teams

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:20.640
and one paper called
them the Remnants.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.290
But Sealey came in and he liked
Colts so he encouraged that,

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:32.480
but 1906 one paper called
them the Giant Killers.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.750
That was the nickname
the whole season long,

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:40.560
but again when Sealey
started bringing in a bunch

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.500
of young kids, this is what he
was he was a great talent scout,

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.570
including kids like Evers and
Tinker 20 years old at the time,

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:52.250
one sports writer from the Daily
News said it looked like a bunch

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:57.160
of cubbies on the field and
that was essentially the start

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.400
of that craze and then Chance
made it known that he liked it

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.750
and then Murphy, Charles
Murphy I didn't get

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:07.690
into the new owner was a big
promoter type and he's the one

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:11.520
that came up with the mascot of
the bear and things like that.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.510
So and then I think the end of
the story is the football team,

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:19.270
NFL football team, which emerged
in the 30s and 40s, wanted to,

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:21.130
and they played in
Wrigley Field,

01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:25.290
couldn't use the word Cubs,
but they latched on to Bears.

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:27.790
I think that's the story.

01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:29.790
I'll be happy to stick around
and answer any other questions,

01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:33.580
but I think we have to, and
then I'll be happy to sign books

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.940
that are for sale right
out here in the lobby

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.510

you all very much for coming.
