1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.140
[inaudible].

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.300
<v 1>All right,
so let's shift to the environment.
If you listen to the news,</v>

3
00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:10.880
it's getting hotter or everybody's freaking out about everything.

4
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.010
We don't have clean water.
All of these things

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.760
<v 0>calm me down.
Well,</v>

6
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.040
I don't want to get into a debate on the internal debate over over the signs of,

7
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.280
of global warming.
I'll leave it to the specialist.
Um,

8
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.130
certainly I do acknowledge that there is a consensus that the world is warming.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.980
Uh,
whether it is warming at a,
uh,

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.910
at a too high a rate or a lukewarming rate and where it's heading.

11
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.410
Uh,
obviously prediction of the future is that,
that's the most difficult thing.

12
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.970
I'm going to leave that to,
to a specialist center sign.

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.840
<v 1>Yeah.
Just very quickly on that though,</v>

14
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:45.120
is it possible that in some of the places that it's warming,

15
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.160
it's actually good that,
that

16
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.750
<v 0>it's warming?
Well,
a,
suddenly there's this,
uh,</v>

17
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.570
there's one scientist from Holland called a professor tall,

18
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.810
has a calculated,
uh,
the,

19
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.820
the likely costs and benefits of global warming until 2080 or so.

20
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.190
And he thought that,
uh,
um,
because of the growing,
uh,

21
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.320
because of the longer growing season we'll be able to actually bring in,
uh,
more,

22
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.270
uh,
more,
more food,
grow,
grow more food.
We also thought that,
uh,

23
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.440
there's also some evidence that the world is greening as a result of more co two

24
00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:24.480
in the atmosphere.
But I do acknowledge I want to make it very,

25
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.700
<v 1>yeah.
Any hate mail to you or to me,</v>

26
00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:32.090
I want to go into get hate mail either way,
but acknowledge way.
I want to yeah.

27
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.620
Acknowledge

28
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.390
<v 0>that.
Uh,
uh,
there are serious concerns.
Um,
uh,</v>

29
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.130
and,
and I'm,
I'm basically a guy who is a techno optimist.

30
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.090
I want to look for solutions to these problems,

31
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.280
uh,

32
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.030
rather than what I don't want to do is to start economic development.

33
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.440
I don't want to stop economic development in developing countries because it's

34
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:58.920
extremely important that,
that people who are very,

35
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.440
very poor should not be very,
very poor.

36
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.830
It's very important that if a woman in Angola or in Zambia has a premature

37
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:10.320
birth,
she should be able to have an access to a,
uh,

38
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.090
to an incubator that is a run on a,
on a,

39
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.500
uh,
on an electricity grid that is not going to collapse,

40
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.570
for example,
okay.
That,
uh,
that people care can air condition their homes,

41
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.610
let's say in Africa or they can,
they can keep themselves warm in a,

42
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:31.770
in Argentina basically,
that,
that is my,

43
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.910
my goal not to stop economic development,
um,

44
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.200
those particularly of true of,
um,
of,
of poor countries.

45
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.510
Uh,
but I also think that,
uh,
it applies to rich countries.
Um,

46
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.090
if,
if we can make life more comfortable for people.
I,
I,
I see,
no,

47
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.060
uh,
I think it would be very difficult,

48
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.140
especially within the democratic context context to stop that.

49
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.290
Now look at what's in,
uh,
in macrons Paris.
We've seen

50
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.470
riots.
Yeah.
That country has and hasn't seen since the 1960s.
Why is that?

51
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.950
That's because the environmental concerns of the French elite Macron included,

52
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.370
are bumping against,
uh,
the,
uh,

53
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.450
living standards and limitations on the living standards of ordinary French men

54
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:26.590
and women.
If you increase the price of electricity,

55
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.120
uh,
dramatically in order to make people cut down on electricity,

56
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.360
it's also going to reduce their,
their,
both their comfort,

57
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:35.530
but also their standard of living.

58
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:39.850
If you're going to put additional taxes on this,
that,
and the other cars,
uh,

59
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.490
gasoline,
what have you,
uh,
uh,

60
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:46.000
eventually people are going to get upset and are going to start voting for some

61
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.290
very unpleasant people.

62
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.430
And this is something that we see happening throughout Europe.
Now.

63
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:56.230
There are many different reasons why people vote for,
um,
uh,
for unpleasant,

64
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.480
uh,
of political parties.
But,
uh,

65
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.740
a fundamental feeling that that standards of living in Europe,

66
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.090
arts stagnating and that they are being taxed to a point where they actually

67
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.670
have to go out and protest in the streets,
burn,
uh,

68
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.970
hundreds of cars and basically vandalized the arc de Triomphe of themselves.

69
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.110
So these things are happening.

70
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:24.790
So what I want to do is to sort of navigate a middle course between,

71
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.430
uh,
between concerns over the environment,
uh,
and uh,
and,
uh,

72
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.030
and continued economic development and continued prosperity.

73
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:38.740
And I think that the answer could potentially be found in techno optimism,

74
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.700
as I would call it.

75
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.650
So I would consider a fracking to be a good example of techno optimism.
Okay.

76
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.370
Uh,

77
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.370
burning of one unit of natural gas produces half as much co two emissions as

78
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.270
burning of coal.

79
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.440
So I think it would make a lot of sense to burn more natural gas than coal.

80
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.783
But

81
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.790
our friends on the environmental side hate that because it's still fossil fuels.

82
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.620
Okay.
So let's forget about fossil fuels.
Let's have nuclear energy.

83
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.600
Okay.
Last time anybody has died from a nuclear accident,
it was in Chernobyl,

84
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.860
um,
because the communist leadership,
uh,

85
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.750
cut corners when it came to the safety and,
uh,
there was a breakdown of,
of,

86
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.690
um,
chain of command and whatever.
And there wasn't this,

87
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.910
this accident where a,
where dozens of people died,
but since then,

88
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.000
not a single person has died as a result of nuclear accidents,

89
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.350
including in Fukushima,
which is the most recent one.
Um,

90
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.470
so nuclear energy is a perfect example of producing a lot of energy,

91
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.000
uh,
without any CEO.

92
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:55.960
Two emissions are our friends are in the environmentalist movement,
please.
No,

93
00:05:55.961 --> 00:06:00.500
they are not.
Let's take another example.
Um,
uh,

94
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:05.501
say a photo Lizer let's say that we can genetically engineer crops to need less

95
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:10.130
fertilizer and less pesticides.

96
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.720
Why do we want a less fertilizer,
endless pesticides?

97
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.890
Because when those flow into rivers and then into oceans,

98
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.190
that can have a negative consequence for wildlife.

99
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.380
So ideally we would like to use less fertilizer,
less pesticide.

100
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.760
So imagine that through Gmos,
uh,
through genetic engineering,

101
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.420
we could produce crops that,
uh,
that,

102
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.930
that don't require pesticides and fertilizer.

103
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.530
Are Our friends in the environmental,
I'll be happy.
No,
they hate that.

104
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:47.531
They hate those three letters until the time that we offer as techno optimists,

105
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.950
we offer a gradual move in the right direction,

106
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.980
which cumulatively could have a massive impact on quality of life,

107
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.520
on,
uh,
environmental protection and so forth.
Um,

108
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.260
you know,
the,
the answer is always no.
So what,

109
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:09.380
so it's interesting because when,
when you started talking about this,

110
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.590
there's this immediate hesitancy because I think everyone,

111
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.370
if you talk about climate at all,
people think you're going to get slammed.

112
00:07:16.371 --> 00:07:20.330
And I can tell you the most hate that I ever got on the show is when I had Alex

113
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.960
Epstein who wrote a book called the moral case for fossil fuels in there.
Uh,

114
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.260
he wasn't denying climate science.
He was,
you're saying that fossil fuels,

115
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:28.190
in his estimation,

116
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.630
are still the best way to advance human prosperity going forward.

117
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.960
So it's interesting you,

118
00:07:33.961 --> 00:07:36.590
you immediately said you didn't want to go too far down that road because it

119
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:40.250
just opens up the heat and all that.
But,
but the,
in essence,

120
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:45.200
what you're saying is that we're having to fight the environmentalist's on what

121
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:49.640
you would prescribe as the best ways to move the environment forward.

122
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.260
That that's pretty fascinating.
So how do you get through to these people then?
I,

123
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.090
well,
I don't know,
I'm trying,

124
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.900
what are the things I'm trying to explain to a lot of my friends is that

125
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:03.650
actually prosperity and economic development can be a friend of the environment.

126
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.520
That's because of this concept of environmental Kuznets curve.

127
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.470
Now that's just a fancy way of saying that when people grow old richer,

128
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:17.120
they are willing to spend more money on clean environment and protection of

129
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.260
animals.
How do I know that?
Because in,

130
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.330
well it's not just stats which show it,
but also look at the real life examples.

131
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.820
When the economy collapsed in Zimbabwe,

132
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:34.300
the first thing that people did in order to survive was to start slaughtering

133
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.450
animals in the wild,
shooting zebras for meat,

134
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.960
shooting elephants for tusks.
Um,
and,

135
00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:47.961
and the environment took a huge knock in Venezuela when the economy collapsed.

136
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.120
Both socialist countries by the way.
But you never mind.

137
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.650
In Venezuela when the economy collapsed,
uh,

138
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.580
people started slaughtering animals in the zoo.

139
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.900
The only way you can survive if it's a choice between the life of an antelope

140
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.320
and the survival of your child,
you know exactly what to do.

141
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.670
And so economic development,
making people richer,

142
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.360
it's actually,
um,
uh,

143
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.940
a very good way of accomplishing this environmental co causing,

144
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:22.650
it's kind of when people grow rich,
they start caring about the air they breathe,

145
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.390
they start caring about a welfare of animals and so on and so forth because

146
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:31.500
those are from the perspective of the survival of the human being,

147
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.940
luxury goods.

148
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.330
And we are already seeing some very interesting things happening around the

149
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:41.180
world.
For example,
the forest coverage of,
uh,
of,

150
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.570
of,

151
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:46.570
of the Oris is still declining by about 0.08% per year,

152
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.540
but it is declining primarily if not exclusively in poor countries and

153
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:57.600
especially in Africa and also Latin America.

154
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.520
But it is increasing in a rich countries.

155
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.440
Uh,
I,
for a station is taking place that are more for us to being grown.

156
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.060
And in China,

157
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.800
we are seeing huge amount of our forests station because the country is now

158
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.070
richer than what did you used to be.
So through economic development,

159
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:21.300
we can do that through our economy development.
We can also,
um,
uh,

160
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:25.800
we can also start protecting more of our marine life,
um,

161
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.510
by creating exclusion zones,
uh,
against fishing and so forth.

162
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.080
How can we do that?
Why is that connected to economic development?
Well,

163
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.930
because if you,
for example,
you can,
uh,

164
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.910
well not only do you have more technological,
um,
uh,

165
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.860
ways of monitoring who is breaking the rules,
uh,

166
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.930
but also you can still get access to the food you want through aquaculture.

167
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.480
Okay.
So,
uh,

168
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.890
countries which are richer are able to,
uh,

169
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.330
are able to get their food from a,

170
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.260
from aquaculture rather than from,
uh,
from ordinary,
uh,
shore fishing.

171
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.850
So when,
when it comes to these solutions,
which by the way,
I mean,

172
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:09.451
what you just said there,

173
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:13.020
it's pretty mind blowing that in much of the world it's getting greener.

174
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.610
You know,
I mean,
that's,
people just don't think about that.
We just sorted,

175
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.950
just don't accept that.
That's real.
Most of this,

176
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:24.660
do you see that we have to have a sort of public and private partnership on how

177
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:27.870
we move forward on these things?
Should most of this come from governments?

178
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:32.100
Should it come from private corporations?
Should it come from individual people?

179
00:11:32.101 --> 00:11:36.160
I mean,
that seems to be what a lot of the debate is also about.
Well,
uh,

180
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.370
I think that the research that the um,
uh,
evidence,
uh,

181
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.660
for the efficacy of a government spending when it comes to science,

182
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.520
um,
when it comes to scientific research for example,

183
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.770
is not all that persuasive.

184
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.880
I don't think that governments are particularly good at spending money on

185
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:03.580
scientific research.
Um,

186
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.610
meaning that the researcher shoddy or just that they throw money at things and

187
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:10.000
then just nothing comes of it.
Um,
yeah,
that,
that,
that would be,

188
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:14.500
that will be part of the reason.
Um,
I am a believer in,
uh,

189
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:19.030
in,
uh,
in,
uh,
private companies are doing their own research,

190
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.830
um,
driven by the profit motive.
For example,

191
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.993
um,

192
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.060
energy inputs into production of anything from a can of coke,

193
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:34.690
two bottle of water.
Uh,
our costs money.

194
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.140
A companies actually do have a,

195
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:43.350
an incentive at profit incentive to try to limit the amount of resources they

196
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:49.600
use in order to produce any type of good.
Um,

197
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.750
in the 1970s,
uh,

198
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.090
between 1970s and today,

199
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.600
the number of cans of coke that you could get from a pound of aluminum has

200
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:03.040
actually increased by something like 40%.

201
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.590
That's because companies don't want to spend money.

202
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:10.060
They don't have to spend on electricity,
uh,
on,
uh,

203
00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.540
spending money on natural resources and oil and raw materials and wood heavy.

204
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.960
And so what we are actually seeing is that,
uh,

205
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.550
the number of dark dollars,
um,
uh,
per,

206
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.290
um,
um,
what the,

207
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:27.970
the amount of the amount of energy,
uh,

208
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:32.560
we need in order to produce a dollar of output is actually declining.

209
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.430
And that that's happening naturally through the process of profit maximization

210
00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:38.650
on the parts of,
of corporations.

211
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.700
Now that doesn't mean that there is absolutely no need for any kind of

212
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:46.300
regulations.
We don't want corporations to be,

213
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:51.600
to be dumping toxic materials in our pristine rivers and what have you.

214
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.900
But,
uh,
uh,
but what I am saying is that,
uh,
is that uh,

215
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.890
corporations in search for profit,
um,

216
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.490
are actually very good at coming up with innovative solutions to environmental

217
00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:04.180
problems.
Yeah.

218
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.480
It's part of the problem here also that different countries that are at

219
00:14:07.481 --> 00:14:12.010
different stages of their evolution of their economies and everything else need

220
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.260
different things,
need wildly different things.

221
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:17.500
What's happening in China now with growth is very different than what's

222
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:22.501
happening in the United States or India or any of these countries that now half,

223
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.340
half to that are often putting out more co two and emissions and things like

224
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:29.470
that.
They're going through their industrial revolutions.

225
00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:33.600
We already did it so that we have an unequal playing field when it comes to some

226
00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:37.960
of them.
Yes.
Um,
so that is a well known,
uh,

227
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.930
notion within the economic development that uh,

228
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.460
as a country starts on a pass through industrialization,

229
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:50.080
it's them actually environment increases.
But once again,
it reaches that,
uh,

230
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.690
that inflection point and then it starts to decrease as people become rich

231
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:58.430
enough to start to appreciate,
um,
nice environment.
Um,

232
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:03.550
90% of the plastics that are entering our oceans come from eight reverse.

233
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.290
They're all in the developing world,
in Africa and in Asia.
Uh,

234
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.320
the contribution of western advanced economies to plastic pollution of the

235
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:18.380
oceans is negligible,
um,

236
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:23.650
precisely because we are able to spend more money and effort and thought on how

237
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:25.484
not to do it.

238
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.780
<v 1>What would you say to the people that would say,
uh,
our time is up here,</v>

239
00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:33.500
or the evolution of humanity is that we've got to go to the stars,

240
00:15:33.501 --> 00:15:35.390
that eventually we'll have to get off this,

241
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.510
this mortal coil and do it again somewhere else.

242
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.920
<v 0>Well,
first of all,</v>

243
00:15:40.921 --> 00:15:45.921
it is very important to remember that a pessimism about humanity's future,

244
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.090
uh,
has been with us since the,
since the dawn of writing,

245
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:54.390
um,
um,
from,

246
00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:59.360
from antiquity and ancient poems and epics,
you know,
the,

247
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:00.810
the,
after all the flood,

248
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.370
what is it about the flight is about closing the world's population that,
that,

249
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.080
uh,
that went,
uh,
ra,
um,

250
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.190
the Cato,
the elder,
uh,

251
00:16:14.191 --> 00:16:19.191
writing second century BC thoughts that Rome was finished because,

252
00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:24.500
um,
you know,
uh,
the,
the,
the young were corrupted and,
uh,

253
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.710
um,

254
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:30.710
women had loose morals and men wear to a feminine to fight wars.

255
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.180
And this is when Rome was just a small town in the,
you know,

256
00:16:36.181 --> 00:16:39.030
with fewer,
with a few provinces in Italy,

257
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.040
Rome continue to expand for the next three to 400 years.
Um,

258
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.270
but he,
he was just very early.
He was just very early.
But,
but you can see,

259
00:16:48.271 --> 00:16:52.440
every generation thinks that,
that,
that we are,
especially as we grow older,

260
00:16:52.441 --> 00:16:56.880
we think that,
uh,
the world is entering a period of decline.
Whereas in fact,

261
00:16:56.881 --> 00:17:01.530
what do we do?
We are projecting our own physical decline,
uh,
onto the world.

262
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.750
But so far those,
uh,

263
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.010
those warnings about the imminent collapse of humanity of all it has been proven

264
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.120
wrong as,
um,
uh,
Thomas Babington Nikolay,
uh,

265
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.130
in 19th century British politician and the writer has written that on what basis

266
00:17:17.131 --> 00:17:22.131
is it without having seen all this progress that we have made behind us.

267
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.880
We see nothing but misery in front of us.
I'm paraphrasing,

268
00:17:26.881 --> 00:17:29.880
but that's the essence of what he said and I think he's absolutely right.

269
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.420
<v 1>Yeah.
So we've,
we've done this diseases,
we're eradicating,</v>

270
00:17:33.421 --> 00:17:37.410
we're doing a lot of good on the environment or at least have,
have some options.

271
00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:40.680
Now we do have options.
Yes.
Yeah.
Uh,
what else,

272
00:17:40.681 --> 00:17:42.900
what else should we be hitting on to give people some,

273
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.300
some positivity to think about?

274
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.880
<v 0>Well,
I think,
um,
my pet peeve is a,
that I think that,</v>

275
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:55.520
uh,
people don't read enough history,
aren't enough versed in,
uh,

276
00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.850
in,
in history how life really used to be like,
uh,
before.

277
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.133
Um,

278
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.390
and I wish that people would spend more time thinking about what they are doing

279
00:18:06.391 --> 00:18:09.520
on their base daily basis.
And asking themselves,
uh,

280
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.560
would I be able to do this in the past?
Um,

281
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.740
I just had a crown have put in or a root canal operation with anesthetic.

282
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:24.330
And it was,
it was not something and there wasn't a particularly pleasant.
Um,
but,

283
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.700
but yeah,

284
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.920
<v 1>but it was better than it would have been a hundred years ago.</v>

285
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:31.630
A hundred or 200 years ago.
You would have it,
you know,
um,
uh,

286
00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.350
somebody would have to pull it out of your,
out of your mouth.
Um,

287
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.120
<v 0>and,
um,
um,
so,
so,
so that's one thing.
Uh,</v>

288
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.130
I think that people,
uh,

289
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.200
and I think that if people understand history better and how life truly was

290
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.760
quite horrific until very recent times,
again,
we have 300,000 years old,

291
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.410
but at the time of abundance,
it's roughly 200 years old,

292
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:01.310
250 years old.
Maybe there will be more grateful and,
um,
uh,

293
00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.380
for the things that we have and hopefully they will be more appreciative and

294
00:19:05.381 --> 00:19:10.381
more supporting of the institutions which underpin a modernity,

295
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.820
liberal democracy with all of its warts,

296
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.190
with all of its imperfections.
Uh,

297
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.450
it is still functioning better than a Putin's Russia or,

298
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.290
or Erdogan's Turkey.
A free market.

299
00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:30.130
Capitalism does have its problems.
Yes.
Um,

300
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.030
we shouldn't socialize costs of banking for example,

301
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.380
and prioritized and privatized gains from Wall Street banking.

302
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.610
Um,
but again,
it is the best.

303
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.470
It is the best creative wealth known to humankind.

304
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.400
And so throwing it out because there are imperfections on the margins that we

305
00:19:51.401 --> 00:19:56.260
should be working on to,
to,
to improve would be a great mistake.
Um,

306
00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.060
so yes,
appreciation of the past,
gratitude for the present,

307
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.130
hopefulness for the future.
Um,
those are the steps in,

308
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.390
I think,
in the right direction

309
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.970
<v 1>that my friend is an a plus ending to an interview and for more on Marion and</v>

310
00:20:12.971 --> 00:20:16.220
the incredible work that think progress is doing.
