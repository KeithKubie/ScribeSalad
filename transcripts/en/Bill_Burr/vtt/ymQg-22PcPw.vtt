00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.660
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:08.661
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for April 2nd,

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.950
2018 what's going on?
How

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.080
welcome to April everybody.
Oh,
you didn't think you'd make it did Jeff?

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.710
Oh the God damn snow just kept falling out of the fucking sky and all these

6
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:26.280
fucking liberal concept talking about global warming.
Oh yeah.

7
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.620
Oh fucking cool.
You off of my fucking toes.
You cunt.
Um,

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.480
global warming.
I love on people who fucking,

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.490
when it snows in the winter,
people just go to global warming.

10
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.490
Um,
I don't know,
Bill.
Don't try to be a scientist.
Okay.

11
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.880
You've tried to be a lot of things on this podcast and failed miserably.

12
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:55.200
Why would you pick such as smart vocation to start off with?
Well,
you know,

13
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.400
cause I'm an arrogant ass.
Um,
oh.

14
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:04.080
Did I sleep well last night?
You know,
I,

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.723
uh,

16
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.653
<v 0>okay.</v>

17
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.120
<v 1>Um,
I,
you know,
I got my big,
big birthday coming up my 50th birthday.</v>

18
00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:15.121
So my deal was there's a certain weight I wanted to get down to and a one of

19
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:19.210
those gene companies,
you know,

20
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.990
that advertise on my podcast.
I can't remember the fucking name of them.

21
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.600
It's one of those people,
you know,
we were two broke college kids,

22
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:28.180
so we started a fucking Jean factory kits.
Like,

23
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:32.170
well how the fuck did you do that?
Thought you were broke.

24
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.960
You know,
you're trying to be all down to earth.
And next thing you know,

25
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.980
you gotta you gotta fucking company.
What are you telling me?

26
00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:42.790
You just sold them yourself.
Yeah,
we'll make you a pair of pants.

27
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:47.380
That'll be about a,
I don't know what we got to learn how to,
so first,
uh,

28
00:01:47.381 --> 00:01:48.510
well cause we're Bronx sir.

29
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.640
We can't afford any sewing machines and people that know how to operate them.

30
00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:55.700
Okay.
Apology accepted.

31
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.770
And I'm sorry too for yelling,
but you know,
if you want jeans from us,

32
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.910
it's just going to take a moment.

33
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.390
So stand up on this thing so I can measure your inseam.

34
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.520
So anyways,

35
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.520
they sent me a pair of jeans that were a 30 to 32 when I had,

36
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.960
you know,
I was 34,
32.
Uh,
and now I'm 33,
32.

37
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.440
So my,
my goal is to get back to that.

38
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.640
I think that's the size that I had in high school slash when I started,
um,

39
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.450
started doing comedy.
So I'll see if I can,
I don't know.

40
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:35.710
I don't know if I wanted to do that.
Cause you know,

41
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:40.130
this one of those things where like if you're,
uh,
if you're,

42
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.960
you're high school weight when you're my age but you never really went up,

43
00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:45.310
I don't think you look that bad.

44
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:48.670
But like if you get down to a high school weight and you are actually like an

45
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:52.030
adult males weight,
uh,
you kind of look like you're dying.

46
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.150
Um,
but we'll see.
Uh,
I am back on little health kick here.

47
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.690
Um,
I told you last Monday,
you know,
I did the go Idm,
I'm EGM.

48
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.970
And um,
I had a shot of Jameson before the show,

49
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.140
you know,
sort of a tradition,
you know,
drink a little shot of fucking courage.

50
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.750
And then after the show I went out,

51
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:22.360
I was just going to have one beer and was going to go home,
but I showed up in,

52
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.060
somebody already bought me another Jameson.
So I had that.
Then I had a beer.

53
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:29.270
But you know,
the shot in the beer was stretched way out between the first year.

54
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.970
The whole show went by like three hours.
Um,

55
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.150
and I had a couple of waters after the first shot,

56
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:40.080
so it was really just a shot of Jameson in the beer.
And the next day I woke up.

57
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.160
And,
um,
aside from the fact that I stayed out till one in the morning,

58
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:48.660
my lovely daughter gets up at like,
oh,
six,
six 30,
I just woke up and I just,

59
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:53.220
I wasn't worth a shit until like fucking two in the afternoon.

60
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.940
And,
um,
I was just like,
I,
I can't,
I,

61
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.930
I can't do this.
I just can't fucking do this.

62
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:04.050
So I didn't drink

63
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.740
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,

64
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.310
and then Friday I performed at arguably my favorite theater in the country.

65
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.470
Um,
the Brady theater in Tulsa,
Oklahoma.

66
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.920
And I cannot expect fucking place and the people that show up there and the way

67
00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:30.570
the laugh sound in that room and the sound and the look of that fucking place,

68
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.770
it's,
it's unreal in the amount of people too,
who've never been there.

69
00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:38.220
When I told him I was going to Tulsa,
Oklahoma,
they will like Tulsa,
Jesus,

70
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.160
you know,
thinking that it was going to be like tumbleweeds and stuff.

71
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:46.161
It's a really fucking hipster replace like the food scene alone

72
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.040
is crazy and you know when the food is really good then you're going to have the

73
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.780
record store,
which I like the record store.
I don't necessarily like,
you know,

74
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.780
the Douche is that go in there,
you know,
I,
you know,
I'm a Douche.
Stupid.

75
00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:02.790
Like I was actually riffing about that on stage with people.
Like,
dude,
it's sad,

76
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:07.150
so much better.
It's like I can't hear the difference.
I can't hear that.

77
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:11.540
Didn't really know the CD was,
it was a lie man.
Everything got compressed into,

78
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.650
they just get into the whole fucking sound thing.
And I'm just,

79
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.850
I just like records because they reminded me when I was a kid,
you know,

80
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.710
and you feel like you kind of got more for your money.
Well,
you know,

81
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.480
you open it up and there was all these pictures on the inside sleeve and all

82
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.940
that shit.
Um,
I don't know.

83
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.300
As opposed to now you just downloaded off off like iTunes and it's just floating

84
00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:37.970
in the air man.
Um,

85
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.760
so anyways,
I uh,
so gifts getting off stage that night and was like,

86
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:46.100
I'm not going to drink.
And I just felt like,
uh,

87
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.730
you know the habit of me doing that being like,
come on man,

88
00:05:49.731 --> 00:05:54.620
just have fucking one.
Cause I was flying after the show.

89
00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.340
It was like that show and Tulsa every fucking reason why I ever wanted to be a

90
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:05.090
comedian.
It was so much fucking fun.
I was barely doing my act.

91
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.490
I forget what I did.
Oh,
I know why I,
I connected,
I flew to Dallas,

92
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.450
connected there and then went up to Tulsa.
And um,

93
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.180
the second I got on the plane and you like,

94
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.290
they was just like three of four really big people,
you know,

95
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.180
not just fat but just big ass fucking people.
So I was just riffing on that.

96
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:30.230
One of them.
Two people was so big and fat,
they had to use wheelchairs.

97
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:33.170
So I was just referred on the fact,
you know,

98
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.940
are you really helping them out if you're wheeling them around like a fucking

99
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:40.880
toddler and you know it's like,

100
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.700
I'm not trying to like bring back segregation here,

101
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:47.750
but I really think wheelchairs to just be for people who can't fucking whose

102
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.500
legs don't work.
It's like your legs work,

103
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.960
you asshole lay off the cookies.

104
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

105
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.990
<v 1>I actually said because see it guys so fat that even if he has a full head of</v>

106
00:07:00.991 --> 00:07:03.720
hair you can still see most of his scalp.
You know,

107
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.230
cause even that it's just even as head is getting like fat,

108
00:07:07.231 --> 00:07:08.910
it's like stretching out.
It was unbelievable.

109
00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:11.560
This guy sat in the chair in front of me and the fucking chair,

110
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.760
it was like coming down and it was one of those things like an action movie.

111
00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:17.610
Like it's just going to fucking stop or am I going to get crushed to death?

112
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.660
And it stopped about two inches from the bridge of my nose.

113
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.310
I think I audibly exhaled like you know,
cause it's like
Ah,

114
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.090
I mean you,
that guy tried to get up.
It'd be like my daughter,

115
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.010
she still can't do like a sit up,
you know what I mean?

116
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:38.780
She just doesn't have the strength.
That is hilarious.

117
00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:42.590
She gets like three inches up and she's making this face and she stared at you

118
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:45.260
and then I just start laughing and then she laughs,
which you know,

119
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.180
makes her fall back down again.

120
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.213
<v 0>MMM.</v>

121
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.530
<v 1>So anyways,</v>

122
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.150
she said Dada now all the time and she was in the crib this morning and I'm

123
00:07:56.151 --> 00:08:00.710
always the one that goes out and I get her and then,
uh,
you know,

124
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.670
pick her up and I've,
I've figured out,
because she gives the best hugs,

125
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.780
but she's also,
you know,
a toddler now,
so she just wants to look at everything.

126
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:10.730
So when she says she only does it for half a second,

127
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.510
so the way to tricker into giving you a nice minute long hug it,

128
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.250
you've got to sing to her and she loves sea itsy bitsy spider right now.

129
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:21.800
Like that,
that's her fucking jam.
Right.

130
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.660
So I just come out there and she's like,
hi,
hi.

131
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.170
Hi.
Hi.
You know,
showing off the word that she knows how to say.

132
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:34.040
And then I just pick her up and she gives me the quick hug and then immediately

133
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.290
is pointing over to the changing table cause you know,

134
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.680
she wants to get that over with so she could then go in and watch a little

135
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:42.890
cartoons,
you know,
and drink a bottle of milk.
Right.

136
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.720
But I got it down now I just pick her up and I just go,
oh,

137
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.420
the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.

138
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.560
Dow came though raid and washed the spider out.

139
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.830
And by then she's already later head.
I sing,
it's sweeter than that.

140
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:00.960
I kind of pushed through with you guys,
didn't want to creep you out,

141
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.370
but she fucking uh,
puts her head down on my shoulder.

142
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.510
It just sits there and is content.

143
00:09:08.511 --> 00:09:12.440
I could sing the song like six times in a row and she'll just lay there.

144
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.980
And then when I get sick of that song,
I just sing the abcs and uh,

145
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.150
and then she does this thing,

146
00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:22.570
a few squeezer and you go give me a hug or too little fat hands.

147
00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:27.230
She grabs two handfuls of your shirt.
That's fucking adorable.

148
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.900
Um,
I'm starting to realize why dad's cry at their daughter's wedding.

149
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.780
You know,
I used to think it was some weird shit though.

150
00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:40.050
They would just like thinking like,
ah,
this guy is good.

151
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.400
Even if even if they haven't already bagged,
he's gonna Bang are now tonight.

152
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.710
You Know,
God,
you pluck an asshole.
And I got to pretend like I like,
um,
you know,

153
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.580
thinking like that shit.
It isn't the thinking about the Etsy.

154
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.750
Like I used to sing this kid,
the itsy bitsy spider,
you know,

155
00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.960
where did the fucking decades go?
So anyways,
going back to my,

156
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.460
uh,
you know,
the booze and shit,
like,
um,

157
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:12.310
I dunno.
So then,
uh,
you know that man,
it's like,

158
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.810
that's already going to be the greatest moments in my life are going to be
those.

159
00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:21.811
And I just don't want to be all banged up and extra tired and God forbid grumpy.

160
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.610
So,
um,
I dunno.
So then San Antonio,

161
00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:31.240
I did two shows,
fucking amazing crowds down there.

162
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.820
Um,
and once again,
I just carried over whatever happened in Tulsa.

163
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:38.680
Uh,

164
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.680
I've learned how to do that though as far as like what happens as you know when

165
00:10:43.931 --> 00:10:47.590
you go out and one night you just in the zone and you're not even doing your act

166
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.420
the next night you come on stage,

167
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.590
you're like hoping that you're going to be in the zone again the night before.

168
00:10:53.591 --> 00:10:56.860
You weren't hoping that you are going to be in the zone.
It just happened.

169
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.400
So then you going out there and now you're hoping it's going to be like last

170
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.780
night.
So now you're walking out on stage and you're thinking about last night so

171
00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:09.700
you're not,
you're not like mentally they're not to get all trippy.

172
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.060
So what I do is I try to let go of the last night but do the same fucking thing

173
00:11:18.491 --> 00:11:19.870
that I did in that.

174
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.370
I'll just talk about something that I'd just fucking saw except this time it's

175
00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:29.290
in San Antonio and I just came out and I was bitching about the fact that I

176
00:11:29.291 --> 00:11:34.291
didn't realize that the final fucking fall Pfoa was in San Antonio.

177
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.180
I kind of figured it out when it was 500 bucks a night.

178
00:11:37.181 --> 00:11:41.410
At a Goddamn red roof inn,
but by the fucking airport.
Um,

179
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:44.780
and then it was just like,

180
00:11:44.781 --> 00:11:47.240
this is going to be a real problem with transportation.

181
00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:50.090
I had to hire this company,
you know,

182
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.910
to make sure they could pick me up the airport.
Get Dean,
you,

183
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.920
it was out there with del Rio del rape.
Fucking murdered so hard in Tulsa.

184
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.980
He had a sustained round of applause.

185
00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.530
Like he had to wait before he introduced me.

186
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:04.180
That's how fucking hard this guy's killing.

187
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:06.880
So you've got to go see dean when he's out in the road,

188
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:08.530
actually watched them do like a full set.

189
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:12.490
I know he has an album coming out to uh,
on vinyl I believe,

190
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:15.250
speaking of records.
So,
um,

191
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:17.763
anyways,

192
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:22.240
I went out and just did the same thing and on both shows I just,

193
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.463
you know,

194
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.880
fucked around and rift about some shit and it just got me into this place.

195
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.370
And then it was fun cause I was,
you know,

196
00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.610
both nights I was teasing people about having ar fifteens and telling them how

197
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:41.800
they should go about talking to people on the left about why you have an ar 50.

198
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:47.620
And um,
it just,
it just was a fucking great night.
Um,

199
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.940
both nights.
So what is my point?
So my point is,
I just,
you know,
through,

200
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:54.700
I was watching the Zen diaries of Garry Shandling,

201
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.650
this fucking incredible documentary that Judd Apatow did.

202
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.290
Um,
and it is such the standup comedian experience.

203
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.390
I literally had to take breaks from it.

204
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:13.060
I had to shut it off or I hit pause,
I'll be watching the thing right.

205
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.290
And I would just,

206
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.480
something he would write down because Gary I guess kept all these diaries and

207
00:13:19.481 --> 00:13:22.840
stuff and judges would just like film,

208
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:26.050
like just a line or two that he wrote.

209
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.030
And uh,

210
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.320
it would either be something that I thought or something that I never realized

211
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:34.060
and it's just like,
yeah,
that's it.

212
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.100
Or just an experience that I had and obviously all my experiences are in a way

213
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:42.880
less like whatever experience he had at the tonight show or hosting the Emmy's.

214
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.490
I had plane,
you know,
uncle fuckees in Swampscott,
Massachusetts.

215
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.930
Um,
but I just kept fighting.
I would be watching this show is hilarious.

216
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.540
It'd be watching this show and he would be like in the other room.

217
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.220
And then she just hit me in the other room just going like,
ah,

218
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.510
and
um,

219
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.120
just watching how the way this thing is put together,
I'm a,

220
00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:13.180
I'm not going to ruin it for you,

221
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:18.181
but just seeing how like one like major event when you're a kid with your

222
00:14:18.881 --> 00:14:22.600
developing mind,
be it positive or negative,

223
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:27.630
how it just shapes and informs the rest of your life and the way that it is done

224
00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:32.920
is so fucking masterful in this documentary.
And um,

225
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.360
I don't know,
I just can't say enough things about it.

226
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:41.770
So I was sitting there after having watched it,

227
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.030
or actually I'd watched up to the,
like the first half hour of this,
of part two.

228
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:49.570
I mean,
it's like four and a half hours long.
It's,
and it's fucking amazing.

229
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.970
And I was actually out on the road going,
fuck,

230
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:57.600
I wish I could watch the rest of that right now.
You know,
it's just,
you know,
I,

231
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.390
it's hard to find four and a half hours when you get the,
you know,

232
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.360
you've got a 14 month old to just sit down in a row.

233
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:05.690
So I was out there and I was just thinking about,
you know,

234
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.740
I was mad at myself that I went out after Tulsa and I had a drink.

235
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:11.900
I had one drink and then somebody sent one over to me.

236
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.210
And of course I'm going to drink that cause I didn't want to be rude and you

237
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:17.480
know,
I'm a bit of a booze hound and,
um,

238
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:22.340
I kinda just was sticking to myself.
Like,
uh,

239
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.290
I told myself I wasn't going to drink until fucking June and I already fucked up

240
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.070
on the road.
Not even cause I wanted to just start it like,
you know,

241
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:34.760
I'm flying high and fucking wide awake.
I don't want the night to end,

242
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.360
you know,
um,
to awake to fucking go is still asleep.

243
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.750
I got an 8:00 AM flight,
let me just fucking have one.

244
00:15:41.751 --> 00:15:43.190
And then next thing you know,

245
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:45.770
I'm fucking staying out till like one in the goddamn morning.

246
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.110
I've got to get up at six for the flights.
What am I doing?

247
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.070
I should be out here getting sleep for when I come back,

248
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:55.790
so I gotta be a better dad.
This is stupid.
So,
because I watched,
you know,

249
00:15:55.791 --> 00:15:58.340
at that point,
the first half of the zen diary sing,

250
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.530
I actually had a notebook because I was writing out some of the drum parts for

251
00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:06.020
these songs.
I got to sing with Dell Rake at the sinks,
sorry,

252
00:16:06.021 --> 00:16:10.970
play on Tuesday night out here at the Avalon.
And uh,

253
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.500
I was just like,
why don't you just write down,
you know,

254
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:16.610
these goals?

255
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.220
Because somebody would feed sometimes if you just fucking think them,

256
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.030
they're not real.
And then if you say,
I'm a write 'em down anyways,

257
00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:26.030
how my brain works,
it becomes real.
So I just kind of wrote it down.

258
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.680
The shit that I wanted to do,
you know,
the shape I wanted to be and,

259
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.290
and uh,
yeah,
I just wrote down then I was just for the month of April.

260
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:41.210
I'm just like,
I'm not smoking any fucking cigars.
I'm not drinking any booze.

261
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:46.730
Um,
you know,
not watching any fucking porn.

262
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.090
Do you know,
fucking stupid online porn,

263
00:16:51.091 --> 00:16:53.700
lonely shit you do on the road and that porno,

264
00:16:53.701 --> 00:16:58.650
I swear to God it's going to come out like how bad that is for you,
your brain,

265
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.390
you know what I mean?
Cause I find myself that when I watch porno laughing,

266
00:17:03.391 --> 00:17:04.650
like I'm watching a sitcom,

267
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.630
there's always something that just strikes me as fucking funny.
Um,

268
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.050
yeah,
it's just like,
I shouldn't be laughing while was,
is this weird?
Right.

269
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.830
And then you also think like,
you know,
you go back,

270
00:17:16.831 --> 00:17:18.240
I don't know how many fucking years,

271
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:24.290
like if you went back like a hundred years and you showed somebody like a

272
00:17:24.571 --> 00:17:25.910
laptop,
it'd be like,
you know,

273
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.570
you realize you can watch this and you just put it on to,

274
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.150
I swear to God they would burn you at the stake.
Like you were a fucking,
which

275
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.550
like how fucked up it would be that a human being could sit down anytime they

276
00:17:38.551 --> 00:17:41.820
wanted and just watch endless hours of that shit.
Um,

277
00:17:41.821 --> 00:17:46.260
I bet I did some brain damage something.
It's like you fucking,
it's like you,

278
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.110
I've really feel like,
um,
um,

279
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.040
destroying my soul by watching that shit,
um,

280
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:57.690
on some level.
So I was like,
good to not do that.

281
00:17:57.691 --> 00:18:02.370
I'm going to fucking continue to work out all of these,
just sort of these,
these,

282
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:04.770
these,
I dunno,

283
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.000
health goals and then I got to work on my,
my,
uh,

284
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.620
my anger issues because my daughter doesn't realize I have them yet and it's

285
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:15.540
just inevitable she's going to,

286
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.080
I've been doing this joke on my act out likes a couple of times.

287
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.720
She's seen me start to like,
she,

288
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.210
if she honestly hasn't even met me yet as far as like who I really am,

289
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.990
she's met the side of me that I'm proud of,

290
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.980
but all this shit that I'm ashamed of,
she hasn't really met yet.

291
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.700
She's seen a couple of glimpses,
but I'm always able to joke my way out of it.

292
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.030
Like,
Oh,
Daddy,
oh,
you see the laptop through the weird show?

293
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.510
She's laughing because she doesn't know what those words mean or that,

294
00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:49.410
that behavior is fucked up.
Right.
So I dunno,

295
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.300
that's just shit I have to work on.
So,
uh,
I don't know.

296
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:57.540
I don't think I would have written that down and it would have become real had I

297
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:01.680
not watched that.
Uh,
Zen diaries,
a Gary Shandling,
I'm telling man,

298
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:05.580
you gotta you gotta fucking see that thing and speaking with HBO is killing it

299
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:06.990
this month because they have like a,

300
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.790
they got one on a documentary on like Andre the giant,
Martin Luther King.

301
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.530
Um,
Elvis.
I mean,
they just,
I mean,

302
00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.930
and I think it comes out every Wednesday.

303
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.280
So if you're not watching the NHL rivalry fucking Wednesday,
uh,

304
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.550
or even if you are just taped some of these things,
because you know,
HBO,

305
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:30.030
they always do everything fucking top shelf.
It's going to be amazing.
So anyways,

306
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:35.100
I have some things to,
uh,
have I made you guys laugh once yet?

307
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.130
I've just been fucking being an idiot here talking about this shit.

308
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:42.870
But it's also,
I just feel like I'm doing is fair.
Um,

309
00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.300
all right.
I've got a couple of announcements here.

it's fucking hilarious.
I want won.

324
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:47.720
I did the Brady Theater in Tulsa.
I pull up and,
uh,

325
00:20:47.721 --> 00:20:52.230
there's this one dude standing outside,
you know,

326
00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:57.180
the fucking,
the stage door.
All right.
And,
uh,

327
00:20:57.181 --> 00:20:59.940
I got to sing.
I hate meeting people before the show,
after the show,

328
00:20:59.941 --> 00:21:03.360
I don't give a fuck,
but before the show I can't,
it's just,
it's weird to me.

329
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:08.520
It's like I haven't done my fucking thing that I do.

330
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:14.520
So,
um,
I'm thinking about doing that,
you know,
I don't know.

331
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:17.430
I,
I,
I no problem after,
before it just weirds me out.

332
00:21:17.431 --> 00:21:19.830
So I got it and this guy goes,
he's like,
hey bill,

333
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.020
a big fan of getting mega your gun.

334
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:27.430
I go to sign his fucking shit and all of a sudden I feel like this sticky thing,

335
00:21:28.111 --> 00:21:31.560
like I had like syrup in my hand or something.

336
00:21:31.561 --> 00:21:34.890
I handed back to Penn and I looked down at my fucking hand is just cool,
calm.

337
00:21:34.891 --> 00:21:38.710
I get the ink,
the pen exploded.
Oh fuck.

338
00:21:38.711 --> 00:21:40.030
I look like I don't know what I look like.

339
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.230
So I walk in and it's really like thick.

340
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:46.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

341
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.440
<v 1>Like black or blue ink.</v>

342
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:51.580
I went on the bathroom and I'm like trying to scrub the skin off my fucking hand

343
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.990
and um,
you know,
del,
Ray's laughing at me and shit.
Look at Louis Shit,

344
00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.780
you know my hands are so pasty,
so I got this.

345
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.180
It's like my hands are in black face,
right?

346
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:06.530
So I'm fucking scrubbing this shit off and I was able to get most of it off,

347
00:22:06.531 --> 00:22:09.710
but there's still like,
you know,
you can see the state of it.

348
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.573
<v 2>MMM.</v>

349
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.540
<v 1>I wish I talked about that when I went out on stage.</v>

350
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:18.420
<v 2>MMM.</v>

351
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:18.961
<v 1>But I did.</v>

352
00:22:18.961 --> 00:22:23.640
So I went out and I did the show and as I go to walk off the stage,

353
00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:26.880
who comes walking down to the front of the stage?
Jay Bill,
but blah,
blah,
blah,

354
00:22:26.881 --> 00:22:30.150
blah.
I already met you.
I already signed you shit.

355
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:32.670
And I already got the ink all over my head.
But he's getting married.

356
00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:35.800
So going over Shay,
man.
Thank you.
I go,
you know,

357
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.070
good luck with your marriage and everything.

358
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:39.540
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

359
00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.490
<v 1>So that I fucking walk out,
right?</v>

360
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:42.730
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

361
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.100
<v 1>Just talking to Dana.
I'm like,
Dude,
how fucking unbelievable is that theater?</v>

362
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.870
He's like,
Oh,
you know,
the sound is unbelievable.
Crab a blah blah.
You know,
Dean,

363
00:22:49.871 --> 00:22:54.730
that show was fire,
right?
So we go outside

364
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.380
and we go to lead the places like 10 or 15 people there,
right?

365
00:22:59.381 --> 00:23:02.950
So I'm fucking day guys,
thanks for coming out and talk to people,
you know,

366
00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:07.060
signing shit or whatever and this fucking guy comes up again and he wants me to

367
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:08.830
sign more shit.
I'm thinking in my head,

368
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:11.830
it's just like this look guy coming back from fucking seconds.
I mean,
why did he,

369
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:15.460
you know,
there's other people here.
We already did this and I shook your hand.

370
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.570
So I go to sign something fucking else study has and I feel this sticky thing.

371
00:23:19.571 --> 00:23:23.380
He gave me this say fucking pen again and I was so stupid that I went and I

372
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.320
grabbed the thing and I just looked to you,
you fucking asshole.
I go,

373
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:30.650
you've got an exploded pen here.
And then he just starts laughing

374
00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:36.140
and now I got to shit on my fucking hand,
my hands,
all the exact same,

375
00:23:36.141 --> 00:23:38.160
almost the exact same fingers and all that.

376
00:23:38.161 --> 00:23:41.290
Obviously I'm not ambidextrous switch and one hands.

377
00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.260
I'm just like Indeed's fucking,

378
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.790
and then dean signs on that foam walked back into the fucking car.

379
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.710
We got ink all over our hands.

380
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.390
The drivers laughing his ass off at us because he saw me when I went in and go

381
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.500
their fucking ass.
All that exploded pen.
So as,
this is the thing,

382
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:02.000
as I go to get in the car,
the same dude who I already signed,

383
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:06.650
his shit,
got ink on my hand,
shook his head after the fucking show,
you know,

384
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:09.620
as I'm walking off stage,
shook his hand,
sign more shit,

385
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:13.790
got more fucking exploded,
Aecom my hand,
he then goes,
he goes,
hey pill,

386
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.540
you got a Po address that I can send these six to these pictures.

387
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:21.840
I took on his cell phone.
Just go,
no,
you fucking asshole.

388
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.590
I got a call over my head.
And again,
he just starts laughing.
Then I felt bad.

389
00:24:26.591 --> 00:24:28.060
I go,
good luck with your marriage.

390
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.490
And we get in the cars would drive it away and I just was just riffed about the

391
00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:36.820
poor woman that is going to marry that fucking guy,
you know?

392
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.300
Cause it was something about him.
You couldn't get mad at him.

393
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:44.140
But I really think that debt exploding pen was a fucking omen.

394
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:46.893
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

395
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.910
<v 1>You know that he was just going to be like,
I don't know.</v>

396
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.480
Jesus Christ.
So anyways,
I,
um,

397
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.730
let me read a little bit of advertising then I'll tell you about the San Antonio

398
00:24:58.731 --> 00:25:01.260
going down there with the final four experience going on.

399
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:03.813
<v 0>MMM.</v>

400
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.010
<v 1>Where the hell is it?
What do we got here?
What are we got this week?
Oh,</v>

401
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.273
Indo Chino.

402
00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:15.410
Talk about how a made to measure suit fits compared to a generic off the rack

403
00:25:15.691 --> 00:25:18.960
suit.
Well,
unless you're like a generic off the rack size,

404
00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.460
I imagine your ankles are going to be showing and your balls are going to be

405
00:25:23.461 --> 00:25:25.560
snugged or uh,
you know,

406
00:25:25.561 --> 00:25:27.950
you're going to be looking like you have your big brother's pants on.

407
00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.790
If you're a little shorty.
I mean,
obviously,

408
00:25:30.791 --> 00:25:33.850
do I really need to explain to people that if they actually take your fucking

409
00:25:33.851 --> 00:25:37.060
measurements,
I mean,
if they take your measurements,
it's going to fit

410
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.130
the way it's supposed to fit,
you know,

411
00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:41.990
and all of a sudden a women are going to be looking at you like,
Oh,

412
00:25:41.991 --> 00:25:45.470
who's that guy?
Look at all fucking sharpened his suit.

413
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

414
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.740
<v 1>As opposed to trying to hit the lottery.</v>

415
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

416
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.530
<v 1>It'd be like,
you know,
did the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the,</v>

417
00:25:52.531 --> 00:25:57.370
the fucking person in El Salvador that sell this together,
you know,

418
00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.160
was see the same size as me.

419
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.560

Okay.
Um,

It's the biggest no brainer ever.

449
00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.771
Get your friends over,

sit down and just watch regular people talk shit and go in the ring.

451
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:09.660
It just fucking wail on each other.
It's,
it's the greatest fucking idea.

452
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.690
I don't know.
Every once in awhile I,
I know I keep saying this,
but you know,

453
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.890
I'm so site,

454

455
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:22.410

456
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.330
I don't know how to commentate.
I'm not Joe Rogan.

457
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:29.700
Joe Rogan is borderline of fucking uh,
uh,

458
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:35.370
Moussad agent with his abilities and his understanding of combat.

459
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.990
Me On the other hand,

460
00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.180
[inaudible] just going to sound like I was just some loud shithead.

461
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.380
Sit next to you on your couch.
Okay.
That's what I'm going to do.
Alright.

462
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.650
MVMT movement.
Uh,

463
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.490
here's my problem with sunglasses.
I didn't know I had a problem with sunglasses.

464
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:51.990
Why are you putting words in my mouth?

465
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.180
I got all these cheap pairs that look terrible.
No,
I don't.
I am Nice Fares.

466
00:28:58.930 --> 00:28:59.190
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

467
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:03.420
<v 1>But every time I buy 200 pay,
$200 pair,
I feel like I get ripped off.</v>

468
00:29:03.421 --> 00:29:08.190
That's not what I feel.
Here's my problem with sunglasses,
okay?

469
00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:11.100
If you buy a fucking cheap pair,
they don't do anything.

470
00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.630
You still squinting behind him.

471
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:15.240
Now your face is all mushed up wearing sunglasses.

472
00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:18.750
You look like a fucking asshole and they're digging into the right above your

473
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:22.170
ear on your scalp.
But then if you buy a nice expensive pair,

474
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.720
then you got to sit there and I'm like,
oh my God.
Oh my God,
what if I,

475
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.800
what if I lose it?
What if I sit on in and inevitably that fucking happens.

476
00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:32.940
Okay.
Movement.
That's what I feel about fucking sunglasses.

477
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:34.770
How dare you put words in my mouth

478
00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.970
and I don't feel like I got ripped off.

479
00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.770
If I paid $200 I feel like a fucking asshole when I lose them.
All right,

480
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.060
well our friends at at movement.
Yeah,

481
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:49.220
the watch guys,
they kind of felt the same way.
Oh,
I didn't know that.

482
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.530
They agreed with me so they,
they thought screw it.
I think they thought fuck it.

483
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.400
How about we make quality trendy glasses at a fair price.

484
00:29:57.401 --> 00:29:58.900
These things aren't plastic.

485
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.040
They acetate.

486
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:09.040
You can get them polarized.
Is that a word?
As tape?

487
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:13.590
Ace tape.
I got to add that.
Where I'm going to fuck it.

488
00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:18.030
I ain't gonna say it's a goal of mine today to throw that word in with my wife.

489
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:19.300
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

490
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.190
<v 1>See what the fuck.
What the fuck does that mean?</v>

491
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.150
Did you ever go look up a fucking word on Wikipedia?

492
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.840
What is that writing when you're trying to figure out how to spell it,

493
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.630
it looks like it's in Russian

494
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.850
is it is a salt form by a combination of

495
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:46.210
Seti Siddique acid with an alkaline,

496
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.920
earthy metallic base of fuck this out of.
I don't give,

497
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.590
I don't need to know what it means.
I just know how to say it.
Nobody knows.

498
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.580
Nobody knows what this fucking word means.
You just say it and people like,
wow,

499
00:30:57.581 --> 00:31:02.380
that guy's guy's smart.
Look at,
look at his custom lining on a suit.
All right,

500
00:31:02.381 --> 00:31:06.670
here we go.
Ready?
Everybody is this thing.
Okay.
If your support of this podcast,

501
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:11.671
you have to work this word into your day with somebody who you know very well,

502
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.990
who's going to know that you have no idea what this fucking word means and your

503
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:18.970
goal is to try and fucking play it off.

504
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.130
Like you've always had this in your arsenal,

505
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.850

Here we go.

506
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:27.730

it's the end of the world and that's like some warning in the future.

514
00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.550
You know,

521
00:32:22.331 --> 00:32:23.380

they sent me another sack on where one of them were like referee shorts.

572
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:51.030
I don't know how I felt about those.
It's like,

573
00:35:51.031 --> 00:35:55.950

They can grow more?

577
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.340
Are they planting Lenzing micro mode?

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.510
<v 1>All right.
What else did I want to talk about?
Oh,</v>

645
00:40:05.511 --> 00:40:08.810
another thing with that Garry Shandling think that that documentary really

646
00:40:08.811 --> 00:40:11.030
affected me was,
you know,

647
00:40:11.031 --> 00:40:15.290
one of the things that happens to a lot of comedians is,
uh,

648
00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:19.850
whatever the fuck happened to us that made us become comedians.
Uh,

649
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.520
you just start chasing,
you know,

650
00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:23.910
<v 0>yeah.</v>

651
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.720
<v 1>Selling out clubs and get known and becoming famous and all that,</v>

652
00:40:27.721 --> 00:40:30.510
and thinking that that's going to fucking,
you know,

653
00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:35.120
get rid of your demons and uh,
it doesn't.

654
00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:38.330
And then you put off all the major party your life,

655
00:40:38.331 --> 00:40:42.920
which is finding love and starting a family and all of that shit.

656
00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.840
And,
um,
you know,

657
00:40:45.841 --> 00:40:50.640
the other day I was talking to somebody and they were in their early thirties

658
00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:57.020
and I brought up the Garry Shandling documentary and the person said,

659
00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.180
who's that?
Right.
And then I also mentioned like a,

660
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:06.390
somehow I brought up Robin Williams and I mentioned that he had,
you know,

661
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:07.840
<v 0>yeah.</v>

662
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.010
<v 1>Committed suicide a few years and she didn't even realize he was dead.</v>

663
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.170
And she was just like,
Mrs Doubtfire.
And I was like,
in my head,

664
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.410
I'm just going,
these people are fucking legends.
And it's just like,
you know,

665
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:24.520
every generation has their people,
you know what I mean?
So it's like,

666
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.540
it was like so fucking profound where it's like you're chasing all of that

667
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:33.320
fucking shit.
And you know,
once she,
you know,
once you're past a certain age,

668
00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:38.300
like no one's gonna give a shit anymore anyways.
So it's like you're trying to,

669
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:39.963
I don't know,

670
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.300
it's not like a tangible thing that you can depend on.

671
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:49.730
And I had this big fear when I was going through comedy that I was like,

672
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:51.380
uh,
I was like,
Oh man,

673
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.720
am I going to be the guy that doesn't get married and never has kids?

674
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.200
Because I've seen the other side of that as like,
I don't want to fucking,

675
00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.600
I don't want to end up being that cliche.
And then just being that fucking,

676
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.600
that older fucking comic,
you know?

677
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:08.630
And then you've got your sport coat on to hide your middle and your talking to

678
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.980
you talking at this point you're hitting on women that don't know who your bands

679
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:18.560
are and don't know all,
all,
all your cultural references.

680
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:22.940
They don't even know who these fucking people are and the level of fucking

681
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:26.780
sadness that the,
how lonely that feeling would be.
I used to fucking wake up.

682
00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.400
I didn't literally wake up and I would be laying in bed on the road thinking

683
00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:34.790
about shit like that.
And when I was watching this documentary,
I remember,

684
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:39.230
you know,
thinking,
uh,

685
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.650
as I was watching Gary wrestling with his demons,

686
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.630
I literally said to me at one point,
I was like marrying you and having a kid.

687
00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:49.430
He's the smartest fucking thing I ever did.
Thank God.
I know I did it late,

688
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:53.270
but thank God I fucking did that because if I didn't,
you know,

689
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:58.271
I'd be 70 years old in some fucking Goddamn hotel on the other side of this shit

690
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:00.380
when nobody gave a fuck.

691
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:04.400
And I would just be laying there drinking myself to death,
going Acetate,

692
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:06.703
acetate.

693
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:13.790
That literally makes me scared just saying that
acetate.
Um,

694
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.050
anyways,
so,
uh,
I think what I'm going to do,

695
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:19.550
cause I don't think I'm a diary person,

696
00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:23.510
but I think what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to kind of write down in the

697
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:27.260
beginning of the day,
just
I find it just one day of doing that.

698
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:32.150
It's really vivid and lives now rather than just being this fucking random

699
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:33.800
thought.
Like,
you know,
I need to work on this.

700
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:38.810
Maybe just have a fucking goal each day.
So my kid,
uh,

701
00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:43.830
I can kind of kill off this fucking anger demon that exists in my family tree.

702
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.000
I would love to see my family tree.

703
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:51.140
It's got to look like it'd be this weird combination of like,
oh,

704
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:53.420
that's really nice,
but a little upsetting,

705
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:59.420
you know,
like a tree in a,
the beginning of winter,

706
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:05.750
um,
at a certain time of day,
you know,
you know,

707
00:44:05.751 --> 00:44:08.480
that certain time of day would trees are beautiful,

708
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:11.900
but they start to look a little ominous.
That's probably what it would look like.

709
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:17.330
Um,
a tree that's trying.
All right.
Let's,
uh,
oh,

710
00:44:17.331 --> 00:44:22.331
I didn't tell you guys about my fucking journey back from San Antonio.

711
00:44:22.551 --> 00:44:27.200
So,
uh,
I had a 6:00 AM flight to Tulsa,
Oklahoma.
You know,

712
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.840
I normally I would have flown in the night before,
but I got the kid,
you know,

713
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:34.530
I can't,
can't miss those hours.
So I flew in,
no problem.

714
00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.400
Everything was great.

715
00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:40.170
The next day I had an 8:00 AM flight to San Antonio for whatever fucking reason.

716
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.740
I mean,
it's not that long a flight.
We're in the same time zone.

717
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.340
How come I couldn't get like the 10 o'clock flight,
right?

718
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.450
So we checked into the hotel,
we do the show,
everything's great.

719
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:54.840
And then the next morning I had a 6:00 AM flight and I got off stage at 12 and

720
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:59.800
couldn't get to sleep till like one 32 in the morning.
So,
uh,

721
00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.500
it was just like,
all right,
I'll just sleep on the plane.

722
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.170
So we get up at like four 30 in the fucking morning,

723
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:06.540
quarter to five go down there.

724
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.810
And my big thing is when I only get like two hours sleep,

725
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.250
all I'm trying to do is get on the plane.
And once I get on the fucking plane,

726
00:45:14.251 --> 00:45:16.320
it's like I'm just going to go to sleep,
you know,

727
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:21.120
I forgot my ims and one client always has to have their fucking shade up,

728
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:25.440
you know,
cause they're a morning person and fuck everybody else.
You know,

729
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.420
no consideration for somebody who just fucking stop working at,
you know,
12,
1230.

730
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:32.880
Right.
So we get there

731
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.230
and I'm laughing at dean cause we are like so fucking tired.

732
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.430
It's like you literally like you're hung over or like through.

733
00:45:39.431 --> 00:45:41.790
All I gotta do is get on that plane and he's like,

734
00:45:41.791 --> 00:45:45.780
I know I'm going to go right to sleep and then I'm going to land at seven 30 la

735
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:49.440
time,
right.
By the time I get to my fucking house,
it's gonna be eight 30.

736
00:45:49.441 --> 00:45:51.060
My daughter just got up a half hour early.

737
00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.390
I'm going to get that whole time with her before she does her first nap.

738
00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:59.490
Fucking perfect.
Um,
and all of a sudden they're like,
uh,

739
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.810
the flights now gonna fucking leave at six 15,
you know,

740
00:46:03.811 --> 00:46:05.940
cause they said they had to reset the airplane,

741
00:46:05.941 --> 00:46:09.750
which I don't know what the fuck that means.
Is that some computer shit?

742
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.190
I have no idea.
And then six 15 became six 45 and I was like,
Oh God,

743
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:16.290
don't do this.
Please don't do this.

744
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.640
And then it became seven 45 and then it got fucking canceled.

745
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:25.050
And then because it was the final four,
all the fucking planes was sold out.

746
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.510
And the next one they could get us on was 7:00 PM.

747
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:33.270
And I was like trying to keep my cool,
which of course I didn't.

748
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:35.640
And they said,
sir,
it's okay.

749
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.070
We're going to send everybody on the seven o'clock flight.

750
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:42.690
We're going to send on an excursion today,
paid by Delta.
I'm like,

751
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:47.130
I don't want to go on an excursion.
I want to go to Los Angeles.
And she goes,

752
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.560
they're going to take you to see world.
It's like,
Oh yeah,

753
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.820
they gonna buy me a giant fucking lollipop.
I don't want to fucking,

754
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:58.760
I don't want to watch an incarcerated killer whale doing fucking jumping through

755
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:01.170
hula hoop.
Okay.
I don't want to see that.
What I would like,

756
00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.260
can I go there and watch you set that fucking thing free again?

757
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:07.320
I would see that that would be worth it.
You know,

758
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:11.190
watch a jump over a little boy as it goes out out of the bay into a fucking the

759
00:47:11.191 --> 00:47:14.220
ocean like free willy.
Um,

760
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:20.700
so anyways,
so we say Fuck Delta,
not fucked delta.
Literally fucked Delta,

761
00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:25.100
but fuck this situation delta put us in,
cause I know all the airlines this,

762
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.990
it's just a,
it happens.
Okay.
The fucking planes not working right.

763
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:32.770
And I understand it,
but I'm also frustrated.
So I go down to southwest,

764
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.180
all of this shit is filled up.
Um,
so we're like,

765
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:41.020
what about Dallas?
Can you fly us to Dallas love field and we'll just fly back.

766
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:45.580
Can't do that.
Um,
and then we just said,
what about Austin?

767
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.360
And they go,
okay,
well Austin,
we have a 10:00 AM flight at this point.
It's like,

768
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:52.510
you know,
getting close tonight.
We have an 11 and we have a two 15.

769
00:47:52.511 --> 00:47:54.460
So I'm like all right,

770
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:59.200
put us on the fucking two 15 and you know,
it's an hour and a half drive.

771
00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.810
So Dean goes to get a fucking rental car.

772
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:05.170
And I said fuck this let's just Uber then we don't have to deal with picking up

773
00:48:05.171 --> 00:48:06.640
the rental car,
the shuttle and all that.

774
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.720
So we did fucking ubered I passed out in the fucking car,

775
00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.600
I got out of the car,
I left my fucking head phones in that,

776
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:18.430
this is my third time.
Second Time I've lost those Bose headphones.
Um,

777
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.690
I always keep the charge of though,

778
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.640
if anybody has a set of those silver fucking bows or the black ones and you need

779
00:48:24.641 --> 00:48:29.020
that little charger cord,
uh,
send me your address and I'll mail it to you.

780
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:34.660
Um,
cause I'm going to have three of them is,
I just ordered another fucking pair.

781
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:37.360
So anyways,
uh,

782
00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.290
we get out and we got there so fucking fast cause there was no traffic.

783
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:44.740
We actually got on the 1115 had to connect through fucking Phoenix.

784
00:48:44.741 --> 00:48:49.030
It wasn't that bad and,
uh,
it all worked out.
And,
uh,

785
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:53.020
and because I had written down that Shit,
you know,

786
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:56.230
that I wanted to like maybe talk to somebody about my temper or something like

787
00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:58.030
that.
Um,

788
00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:04.120
I was actually completely aware that I was fucking snapping when I snapped like

789
00:49:04.121 --> 00:49:08.380
that.
That's as far as I've ever been able to get to with my temper.
You know,

790
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.540
the old new,
I would just snap and not think about it.

791
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:13.750
Now I'm actually thinking about it as I do it and have no control over it.

792
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:22.770
So it's even more like tortures now because now like watching myself,
I,

793
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.150
yeah,
you go bill yelling at people that like built,

794
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.980
they're trying to save your life.

795
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:31.660
Do you think they're not flying because they want to go through this giant

796
00:49:31.661 --> 00:49:34.150
fucking headache on some level,

797
00:49:34.151 --> 00:49:37.600
they're probably losing money because one of their planes cannot fly.

798
00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.950
Would you like to get up to a cruising altitude and then plunge back to the

799
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:43.990
fucking earth and never see your family again?

800
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.510
All boohoo you have to wait 12 hours to continue living.
He was selfish,

801
00:49:49.511 --> 00:49:52.030
stupid cunt.
Um,

802
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.110
but I can't hear anything at that point.
I'm in the fucking acetate mode.
Um,

803
00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:00.640
or I'm killing that joke.
Uh,
by the way,

804
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.080
I am so back into def Leppard now.
It's ridiculous.

805
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:09.790
I downloaded pyromania and uh,
what was it?
High and dry,
the one before that.

806
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:15.280
And uh,
I'm so into them.
I'm actually looking at lefthanded flying V's,

807
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.280
you know,
like maybe this is the guitar.
I'll know how to fucking,

808
00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.980
I'll actually stick with,
um,

809
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.410
cause I was just watching their lineup,
but they,
what's that guy's name?

810
00:50:24.411 --> 00:50:26.860
Pete Willis is the guy that they had on the,
on the high and dry.

811
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:31.310
And then they had,
um,
what's his face filled in for him?
Uh,

812
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.330
I always forget his fucking name and it's literally the same name as somebody

813
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:39.950
else.
Famous.
It's Phil Collen,
not Phil Collins.

814
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.390
He came in and filled in for,
um,
but like that,
that album,

815
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.540
uh,
pyromania when that came out,

816
00:50:47.541 --> 00:50:52.160
that's just one of those albums that came out during this awesome time in your

817
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:54.410
life.
Um,

818
00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.440
first time he had crushes on fucking chicks in your graded shit in that fucking

819
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.410
album came out.
You know,
and I did the,

820
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:07.010
and this is what I would do rather than thinking,
what can I say to this chicken,

821
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:09.980
my fucking class that I like this lady,

822
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:12.410
I would actually just,

823
00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:16.430
I would just go home instead and I would listen to Pyromania fantasizing that I

824
00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:20.300
was in the band playing the guitar and singing in front of the school.

825
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:21.880
And even in the fantasies,

826
00:51:21.881 --> 00:51:24.470
she would just see me do it and I would still never talk to her.

827
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:31.160
I'm a fucking mess.
Um,
and that's what leads you then.
It's just like,
well,

828
00:51:31.161 --> 00:51:34.490
I can't say it.
I can't play guitar.
I get so go up there and tell shit jokes,

829
00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:37.790
I guess,
think they tell I became a comedian.
All right.
Rough and rowdy.

830
00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:39.530
Charlotte April 13th.

831
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.860
Billy's going to wear a fucking silly suit and he's going to fucking make some

832
00:51:42.861 --> 00:51:47.390
jokes.
You got to watch it.
Paper view.
Uh,
all right.
F One dear.

833
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:49.730
Silly Billy.
Greetings from Monaco,

834
00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:55.090
all the sovereign state on the French Riviera originally from Portugal.

835
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:59.180
I'm a very big f one fan since I was four years old.
Well,

836
00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:00.740
it seems like you saw the heyday of it,

837
00:52:00.741 --> 00:52:04.400
the second golden age of it with Michael Schumacher.
Uh,

838
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:08.810
my grandfather says I wouldn't take my eyes off the cars even if a storm took

839
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:09.920
the roof off the house.

840
00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:14.840
It's a beautiful and graceful sport despite how loud it can be.

841
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:19.130
I first saw you from Chappelle and then saw you on an interview on the Internet

842
00:52:19.131 --> 00:52:23.900
from Montreal and my brother showed me because he's a huge fan of yours.

843
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:26.060
I now am too.
Oh,
that's great.
Thank you.

844
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:29.840
I think this is a very important time in f one the sport is going to continue to

845
00:52:29.841 --> 00:52:33.980
move into the mainstream because the stars in the sports and the storylines of

846
00:52:33.981 --> 00:52:38.900
competition are starting to match the popular culture of today.
Oh,
that's very,

847
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.920
uh,
uh,
what's the word
I'll,

848
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:47.900
I can think of is acetate.
That's a very astute analization.
Is that the word?

849
00:52:47.901 --> 00:52:50.510
I don't know.
It can be very Shakespearian.

850
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.480
I appreciate you talking about the drivers with respect.

851
00:52:53.481 --> 00:52:57.590
Even if you're not a fan of everything they do is incredible.

852
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:01.780
How talented these men are in.
Some women are able to navigate with it.

853
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:05.300
Some women are able to navigate with precision and it's hilarious.

854
00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:11.740
Um,
little chauvinism there.
I would like very much to see you at more racism,

855
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:16.070
perhaps talking to drivers and Cruz.
Thank you.
And bless your family.
Yo,

856
00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:18.650
you and me both.
Oh look who's here.

857
00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:23.000
A lovely Nia and my lovely daughter.

858
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:27.600
You know what she has the cutest onto this year is on these gray sweatpants and

859
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.630
pants with this matching Hoodie,
that short sleeve.

860
00:53:30.631 --> 00:53:35.160
It looks like you've got a little Belicheck.
Hi,
how are you?

861
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.990
How was your breakfast?

862
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.890
You rant and rave and screaming,

863
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:46.230
yelling your podcast for damn near 15 years.
And you know,

864
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:47.250
I never say anything.

865
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:51.060
And then I'm having breakfast with our lovely daughter and we're laughing and

866
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:52.530
we're joking and we're singing songs.

867
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:57.531
And you have the nerve to come in and tell us to keep it down a cup of cheese.

868
00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:02.370
I know.
No,
I'm just,
uh,
yeah,

869
00:54:02.371 --> 00:54:06.870
but this is also putting a roof over our head.
What's up buddy?

870
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.430
How you doing?
We can have fun today.
Huh?

871
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:16.770
The itsy bitsy spider went up.
The Wad is about

872
00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:28.420
dried up all the raid and itsy bitsy spider went up the style and again,

873
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:34.660
Yay.
Aww,

874
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:38.410
look at that smile.
All right.
You want to read some of these with me now?

875
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.020
Okay,
what do we got here?
Um,
oh yeah,

876
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:44.930
I absolutely would love to talk to the drug.

877
00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:47.880
This guy is saying he's from Portugal,
he now lives in Monaco.

878
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:52.020
How much is this guy crushing it and this is listen to what he says about female

879
00:54:52.021 --> 00:54:54.300
drivers near let's do this.

880
00:54:54.301 --> 00:54:58.890
He says it's incredible how talented these men are and some women are able to

881
00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:02.610
navigate with precision.
Oh thanks.
Thanks for that.

882
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:06.270
Some women are what?
What?
Where is it going with this?

883
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.630
He was just saying that he would love to see me talking to more drivers and

884
00:55:09.631 --> 00:55:14.070
being in more,
more racist.
Oh,
well I know you would like that.

885
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.293
I would love that.

886
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.490
And I think if I could navigate with precision down to the pit area and if you

887
00:55:20.491 --> 00:55:23.610
don't trip and fall because you're a woman,
right?

888
00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:29.700
Yeah.
I'm a chauvinist pig and I attract these people.

889
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:33.450
They need a pot chauvinist needs podcast too.
All right,
let's,

890
00:55:33.451 --> 00:55:38.220
let's talk about 45.
She like records,
right?
Huh?
Hey Sweetie,

891
00:55:38.221 --> 00:55:42.120
you want to talk about 40 fives,
Huh?

892
00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.473
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

893
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:46.910
<v 1>You're going to tell us his story.</v>

894
00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.980
What's so crazy right now is she totally has obviously has all these thoughts

895
00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:53.270
and she knows what she's saying,

896
00:55:53.271 --> 00:55:58.010
but she doesn't understand that we don't talk her jibberish so she'll just be

897
00:55:58.011 --> 00:56:01.280
sitting there making all these hand movements like she's making these profound

898
00:56:01.281 --> 00:56:02.114
points that she's going,

899
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:07.150
I shake shack he retired and she's still making was he's still into that noise

900
00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:09.710
that she can't check crap that she was doing.

901
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:17.600
Okay.
Can you say baby?
He say baby.

902
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.660
Huh?
Nah,
go.
She said it.

903
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.210
I say you liked that frog and I break by date due to Michigan.
All right.

904
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:33.940
45,
eight Billy burger hole.
A long time fan of the podcast.
Well,

905
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:38.020
thank you.
I travel a lot in your Massachusetts vibes.
Always remind me of home,

906
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:43.630
uh,
recently.
Don't touch that.
Don't touch that.
Don't touch that.
Um,
recently.

907
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.720
Um,
it's so funny.

908
00:56:46.721 --> 00:56:49.480
They always go for like the thing that's going to hurt them the most is all this

909
00:56:49.481 --> 00:56:53.500
stuff here,
shoes,
chairs and all that goes right for the hot tea.
Uh,

910
00:56:53.501 --> 00:56:57.910
recently my fiance and I surrendered our weekend nights to playing card games

911
00:56:57.911 --> 00:57:02.350
alongside tasty beers at home.
I should just playing 45.

912
00:57:02.351 --> 00:57:05.890
That sounds like fun.
We would just say in how we hate those.

913
00:57:05.891 --> 00:57:09.970
Like you go to those parties with other adults and they have game night,

914
00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.290
so he's fucking cards against humanity and all of that stuff.

915
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:18.400
I don't want to do that.
Um,
but we've got to get to bring back cards,
right?

916
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.740
That's a game night.
If you play cards,
you have a,
it's a cool,

917
00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:29.020
it's only playing mad libs.
I like cards against humanity though.

918
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:33.320
I feel like if you get kind of high or a little bit drunk,
Adolf Hitler's date

919
00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:36.323
to pits,

920
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:43.560
the jokes in cards against humanity are as bad as when you fly southwest.

921
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:46.600
I hate to make fun of them cause I love that airline.

922
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:49.090
But listening to those people do comedy.
I just can't,

923
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:52.990
I get angry at the people encouraging them through.
This guy was sitting,

924
00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:57.760
they were going down the uh,
you know,
we're going down the runway,

925
00:57:57.761 --> 00:58:01.620
like we'll go on the tarmac or whatever and he's doing the Darth Vader voice or

926
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:04.490
everybody put on your feet and people like,
Ooh,

927
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.800
no,
it just annoys me that that person doesn't get heckled.

928
00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:14.380
Cause it's just like if I,
if I did a joke like that,

929
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:19.950
people will be throwing their chair at me and this guy's getting laughs because

930
00:58:20.381 --> 00:58:23.870
I feel like maybe people feel obligated because it's the,

931
00:58:23.871 --> 00:58:27.640
the flight crew and you want to be on their good side.
It's exactly what it is,

932
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:31.580
that it's the awkward silence and people are just in,
in,

933
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:36.580
in the silence of the joke bombing people then laugh because they feel

934
00:58:36.581 --> 00:58:40.720
uncomfortable because this is overall nervousness that what we're about to do

935
00:58:40.721 --> 00:58:45.580
could kill us.
So then the level of comedy that they have to do,

936
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:47.890
you know what I mean?
When you're scared,
you'll laugh at anything.

937
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:51.490
You just walk in like,
uh,
the rain's really coming down,
isn't it?

938
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.160
It's like you didn't say anything funny there.

939
00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:03.490
Wow.
That was close.
Nervous laughter.
There we go.
Uh,

940
00:59:03.491 --> 00:59:08.450
I suggest playing 45,
which I know.
Nia.
You kidding me?
No,

941
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:12.880
that'd be cool.
We got it.
We got,
we got to get a cool stereo man.

942
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:18.610
Yeah.
You know what?
We should have our own kind of like night,
you know,

943
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:22.760
and music and you and me.
Why don't we do that?
Yeah.
Sing some songs.

944
00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:27.380
Oh,
hug and kiss a little bit with a little ones down.

945
00:59:27.381 --> 00:59:29.990
Why don't we do this instead of sitting there going like,
what?

946
00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.350
Over the head a little bit.
Yeah.
I like it.

947
00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:38.130
Yeah.
Sort of sit in their cars again.
Here.
We as old,

948
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:44.360
I think southwest writes those punch lines on those stupid cards.

949
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:47.301
I just don't like that.

950
00:59:47.301 --> 00:59:52.120
You don't write the punchline and then you get credit for it.
I'm sorry.
Yeah,

951
00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:56.900
I'm too,
I'm too into the John too far deep into the joke.
Gay Man.
Yeah,
right.

952
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:59.900
I don't know.
Anyways,
we could hardly find any rule.
Okay.

953
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.510
I suggest playing 45 which I can,

954
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:06.020
which I had always played growing up on the north shore,

955
01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:10.340
uh,
in trying to find the rules online.

956
01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:15.320
I was surprised to learn that it's pretty endemic to Massachusetts.
What rules?

957
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:17.210
What are we talking about?
Oh,

958
01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:20.510
we thought he met at 45 as an records fives.

959
01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.240
It's obviously some kind of game that we don't know about.

960
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:25.630
We thought you were talking about,
oh,

961
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:30.310
they don't know about 45 like you don't know what acetate means?
I guess so.
Yeah.

962
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.970
We can hardly front.
Can you do me a favor?

963
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Can you say acetate three times in a row with a pause and just no life in your

964
01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:41.690
voice between each one?
Just pause.
Just say acetate three times in a row.
Okay.

965
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:45.500
Acetate.
Acetate.
Slower

966
01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:51.860
acetate.
Longer.
Pause.
That was pretty good.
Okay.

967
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:55.790
We'll definitely call you back for the audition.
So what was his thing?

968
01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:58.220
We can hardly find the rules anywhere.
In any case,

969
01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:01.490
just curious whether you ever played this game growing up or had any other

970
01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:04.160
traditions you found to be a Massachusetts thing once you left.

971
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:08.780
Thanks and hope you can come to Vermont or Montreal sometime soon.
Okay.

972
01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:11.690
Yes and yes.
Oh,
I'm so old.
I thought stand by records.

973
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.070
That's what I thought it was for.

974
01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.480
Somebody gave me some records and Tulsa and then they don't,

975
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.740
one of them was a 45.
Um,
so many.
I have to get the adapter.

976
01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.950
Watch it.
Watch it.
Watch it.
No,
you just,
when you're just,

977
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:27.440
you just want to spill that don't ya?
Alright.

978
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:31.310
40 45 game.

979
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:35.200
<v 2>Yeah.
Speaking of game,
hold on a sec.
Yeah.</v>

980
01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.050
<v 1>45 [inaudible] 45 it's a card game.
Yeah,</v>

981
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.170
<v 2>that's what I figured.
All right.</v>

982
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:49.290
<v 1>Why is my Internet's so slow?
All right.</v>

983
01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.740
The Ace of heart is always the best third box.

984
01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.220
I was played with a regular deck of cards.

985
01:01:53.221 --> 01:01:57.180
This isn't like old may do you guys remember?
Old Maid,
you know,

986
01:01:57.181 --> 01:02:00.630
and then the classic that I never played granny fucking water.

987
01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.500
There's another case,
there's another card game.
Nia did.

988
01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:07.230
Everybody in the Midwest knows about,
uh,

989
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:11.960
euchre and that game would Joe Barton,

990
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:15.090
Nick and j law had talked about euchre.
They were like freaking out.

991
01:02:15.091 --> 01:02:19.050
They were going like entire families had stopped talking to each other on

992
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.030
because of that game.
That game is evil.
That's like a Pittsburgh,
Cleveland,

993
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:27.960
Detroit,
that type of area.
I think people play Euchre uh,

994
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:31.440
the ace of hearts is always the third best.
Trump.
Yeah.
We,
this is good.

995
01:02:31.441 --> 01:02:34.170
This is good.
Clean Fun here.
The deal.

996
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.020
Robbing the Trump object of the game.

997
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:40.050
The goal is to accumulate the most chips by winning tricks.

998
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.250
How to keep score irregularities.
You're going to do this.
This is,

999
01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:45.780
this is a game night bill.

1000
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:48.450
So I don't know why you're talking about you're so against the game night.

1001
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.290
This is what cause I don't like,
you know what?
I don't like the modern games.

1002
01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.350
I'll play cards.
My grandmother was a,
was zone.
Amazing.

1003
01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:59.040
And my aunt against humanity.
You have a plate flinch.
No.

1004
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:03.300
Flinches another one.
Uh,
I,
we get what you're going to get all these card games.

1005
01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:08.130
Have you ever played spades as a black people play?
Uh,
oh,
look at me.

1006
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.520
Do you ever play hearts?
That's what white people play.

1007
01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:13.043
<v 0>No.</v>

1008
01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:22.680
<v 1>All right.
Oh,
we gotta we gotta get some cards,
man.
We gotta get some cars.</v>

1009
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:26.730
We explore each other's like heritage through card games.
Yeah.

1010
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:29.980
You teach me spades.
I gotta remember how to play harder part.

1011
01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:31.900
You don't know how to play spades.
I've maybe played it.

1012
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:35.790
I knew black people play dominoes.
Well,
no,

1013
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.820
we're not talking about dominoes.
So talking about a card game,

1014
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.430
I know we're not talking about Domino's.
Why could you just give me that?

1015
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:44.190
That I actually knew something that that was like the Chappelle show sketch.

1016
01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:47.220
I know black people with Domino's is,
come on.

1017
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:52.860
I just said,
okay.
Jesus.
Okay.
Sorry.
She's so protective.

1018
01:03:52.861 --> 01:03:57.570
She's so protective of her culture.
You know that Nia,
you market this little,

1019
01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:02.440
oh,
you kissing the baby.
Oh Hey.
Yeah.

1020
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.810
Why are you so protective?
Huh?
Do you want to start an argument with,
you know,

1021
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.440
why are you so protective of your culture?
Why don't you let me,

1022
01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:12.120
you've never taught me how to taught me how to do let you in.

1023
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.650
I was going to say,
you never taught me how to do the,
uh,

1024
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:20.650
do you know Nia could do the whole Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation Dance?
No.

1025
01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.780
Miss you much Osu man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the thing.

1026
01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:29.370
She'll just bust that out out of fuck.
Sorry.
Out of nowhere.

1027
01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.820
And she could really do it.
You know what I mean?
It's still like me.

1028
01:04:32.821 --> 01:04:36.570
I could do like the peewee Herman did ed debt a debt that I think I'm all

1029
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:41.280
impressed.
Oh,
they have all impressive,
right?
China's surveillance.

1030
01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.330
Oh,
Nia.
You know,
people are gonna ask you to fucking Instagram that.

1031
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:50.370
I know it's not going to happen.
No.
Okay,
I'm back.

1032
01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:54.800
Sorry.
The,
uh,
the batteries just died in this thing.
Um,
all right.
We are,

1033
01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.390
I think I'm well over an hour here at this point.
I have to be,

1034
01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.670
I don't really know where I'm at at this point.
All right.

1035
01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:05.700
Jane is surveillance man.
All right.
If,
if,

1036
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:08.400
uh,
you want me to just do the rest of this because it seems like she's getting

1037
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:11.160
ready to,
uh,
run around here.

1038
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.390
So I just don't know if that's going to be annoying to people to hear going on.

1039
01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:19.630
[inaudible] I'm sitting here talking about all this stuff durable to them as it

1040
01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:24.280
is.
Yeah.
That's the one thing you got to remember.
Your kid is adorable to you

1041
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.430
everywhere.
Everybody thinks the kids are adorable.

1042
01:05:27.431 --> 01:05:31.300
Then after awhile it's just like,
okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Um,

1043
01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:35.530
China's surveillance,
dear bill,
Bunker Hill.
I love it.

1044
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.860
I'm a software engineer.
Makes sure she doesn't shut her hands in the door there.

1045
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.030
Um,
oh down like a ton of bricks.

1046
01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:49.780
It is amazing that they always fall in there,
but
yeah.

1047
01:05:49.781 --> 01:05:50.614
All right buddy.

1048
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:53.323
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1049
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:58.730
<v 1>Alright,
Cutie Pie.
I'll see you in a few minutes.
Bye Bye.</v>

1050
01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:04.880
Kiss.
Oh,
all right,
I'll see you.

1051
01:06:04.881 --> 01:06:07.010
Lovely ladies out there.
All right.

1052
01:06:07.011 --> 01:06:12.011
I'm a software engineer and system integration specialists at a prominent firm

1053
01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:13.940
in a major city.

1054
01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.500
I won't state my political affiliation because I know you hate that move as much

1055
01:06:18.501 --> 01:06:20.000
as I do.
Good.
Let's get into it.

1056
01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:24.200
I'm terrified that my children will have little to no privacy in their adult

1057
01:06:24.201 --> 01:06:26.240
lives being intact.

1058
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:30.890
I'm becoming aware of the capabilities and advances in surveillance systems and

1059
01:06:30.891 --> 01:06:33.140
as an ordinary human being with the Internet,

1060
01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.560
I've maintained and understanding that our government under both parties have

1061
01:06:36.561 --> 01:06:40.820
been constantly expanding their surveillance reach and continue to lie to us

1062
01:06:40.821 --> 01:06:43.760
about what information is being stored.
Yeah,
it's ridiculous.

1063
01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:48.140
And all the major fucking news organizations don't say anything about it.

1064
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:53.150
They don't do anything to protect us.
They just sit there fucking making money.

1065
01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:56.130
Uh,
China isn't very different.
Uh,

1066
01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.880
it's definitely more aggressive and more intrusive.

1067
01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:01.640
The biggest is what Snowden was trying to warn us about.

1068
01:07:01.641 --> 01:07:06.620
We all left that guy twist and on the vine and everybody was afraid because they

1069
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:10.610
wrapped what this guy was doing into trying to beat Isis.
So then it's like,
well,

1070
01:07:10.611 --> 01:07:13.700
I can't say anything because then I don't support the troops and then I'm going

1071
01:07:13.701 --> 01:07:17.300
to get the Dixie chicks fucking treatment.
Um,
that's,
that's all.

1072
01:07:17.301 --> 01:07:19.070
That's all they're fucking doing right now.

1073
01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.850
It's just destroying people individually.
Um,

1074
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.430
snowed is a fucking hero as far as I'm concerned.

1075
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:30.360
God Damn fucking loony Texas.
It's like,
how much more do they need to know about?

1076
01:07:30.361 --> 01:07:33.330
You just sit down at the airport,
you go through fucking security.

1077
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:36.510
Then it's like you don't understand in that.
Now go now,
go through Tsa.

1078
01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:39.540
You got to answer all this shit and get fucking fingerprinted and now,

1079
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:41.580
now that line's clogged up,
so now the next one,

1080
01:07:41.581 --> 01:07:44.700
people are fucking stick in that goddamn retinas in there.

1081
01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:46.943
<v 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

1082
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:50.620
<v 1>All right.
Drop your pants and spread your butt.</v>

1083
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:51.730
Cheeks is going to be the next one.

1084
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:54.790
Don't get through the line fucking quicker and people would do it because it'll

1085
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:56.230
be more convenient.
All right.

1086
01:07:56.231 --> 01:08:00.760
The biggest difference is that they have the decency to not try and hide it or

1087
01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:03.550
maybe you think it's better to be lied to?
I Dunno.
Well,

1088
01:08:03.551 --> 01:08:07.210
I think it's because China could just fucking,
you know,
I don't,

1089
01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:11.370
as far as I know in mainland China at the level of rights that you have versus

1090
01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.270
what you have over here.

1091
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:17.270
I think over here you have to lie because they don't have the right to do what

1092
01:08:17.271 --> 01:08:18.710
they're doing.
Probably,
I dunno,

1093
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:23.740
this article lays out the way in which our government surveillance is going to

1094
01:08:23.991 --> 01:08:27.020
be able to access everything in a Chinese citizens life,

1095
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.250
both at work and at home,
um,

1096
01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:32.630
in which government on our government,

1097
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:36.980
one of the most important in advancements being made is not just the collection

1098
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:38.600
of data,
but the sorting

1099
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:44.510
or of data and the ability to sift through billions of communications for

1100
01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:45.710
specific content.

1101
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.920
This is why the FBI and CIA have had information on terrorist activity,

1102
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:55.660
but it had no way to access it if through all the bullshit.
Yeah.

1103
01:08:55.661 --> 01:08:58.720
So the thing is,
so what people would say was,
well,
as least as little,

1104
01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:02.660
as long as I'm not out there trash in a,
you know,
saying I'm a Moose slum,

1105
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:07.340
I won't have a problem,
uh,
back to my kids,
Mo I,
because this is the thing.

1106
01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:12.460
They're going to use that to then access all this other shit as they always do,

1107
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:17.000
as they always do.
Um,
back to my kids.

1108
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.740
Most government technology eventually makes it,
makes its ways to the public.

1109
01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.570
When my children are in their adult life,

1110
01:09:23.571 --> 01:09:28.010
all of their previous years will be stored somewhere to create a case against

1111
01:09:28.011 --> 01:09:32.000
them based on the person that they were and not who they've become.

1112
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:34.730
Jesus Christ.
That last statement,

1113
01:09:34.731 --> 01:09:37.730
there might be most intelligent thing anybody's ever sent in.
Um,

1114
01:09:37.731 --> 01:09:40.970
I will send you guys,
um,
this,

1115
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.740
this link to this story and read it and it just be informed and know that you're

1116
01:09:45.741 --> 01:09:47.240
going to be all right.
All right.

1117
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:50.300
Cause I don't want to send all this doom stay shit that's gonna make you go into

1118
01:09:50.301 --> 01:09:52.220
a depression.
But you also do need to know.

1119
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:57.470
It would be nice if people knew what was going on and uh,
I think like,
uh,

1120
01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:58.850
this is a time where people,

1121
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.680
I just feel like everybody wants to start speaking up like what are we doing?

1122
01:10:03.681 --> 01:10:07.460
And not in an anti USA fucking way,
but you know,

1123
01:10:07.461 --> 01:10:10.460
at some point somebody has to kind of step up here.
You know,

1124
01:10:10.461 --> 01:10:13.460
I think we kind of need to look at the finances of how much is fucking

1125
01:10:13.461 --> 01:10:17.660
non-ending war is costing us.
And,
uh,

1126
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.910
at some point we're going to have to pay all of that back.

1127
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:25.310
$700 billion a fucking year.
I mean,
I would really be,

1128
01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:30.311
would really be a sad thing if 3,500 fucking jerk offs that train on a jungle

1129
01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:34.310
gym where to bankrupt this great nation.
They mean some point we do have to,

1130
01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:38.930
there has to be a way to discuss that without somebody yelling at you saying you

1131
01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:43.400
don't support the troops just to,
you know,
cause maybe they have it worked out.

1132
01:10:43.401 --> 01:10:45.980
Maybe there was a solution.
It would be nice as a citizen

1133
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:52.400
who's paying ungodly taxes,
who would like to see them go to some shit over here,

1134
01:10:52.401 --> 01:10:54.770
like pup making public schools good again.
You know,

1135
01:10:56.630 --> 01:11:01.130
maybe get some people off the streets that need some help.
You know,

1136
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.560
all these shutter island people fucking walking around.

1137
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:05.450
They used to have facilities that they could go to.

1138
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.830
You combine that with the fact that they can now go in and buy a bazooka and not

1139
01:11:09.831 --> 01:11:11.480
have to wait longer than three fucking minutes.

1140
01:11:11.481 --> 01:11:13.310
And all of a sudden you starting to have some problems.

1141
01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.590
You fucking call me mother fucker.
Don't bring that up.

1142
01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:23.250
Why did I blame the south for that?
You know,
that's not true.

1143
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:26.760
I should sound like I got to get a good,
good,
good corporation.
Impression,

1144
01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:32.170
you're clearly against the United States of America.
Uh,

1145
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:36.690
wife believes in ghosts.
Oh Jesus.
Dare Billy Burger basket.

1146
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:40.920
Um,
I love my wife dearly in a most topics we are in agreement,

1147
01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:44.880
but recently something has come between us.
She believes in ghosts and I do not,

1148
01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.420
uh,
dude fucking let it go.
Who gives a shit?
Okay.

1149
01:11:48.421 --> 01:11:50.020
As long as she's not trying to talk to them,

1150
01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:53.280
if it's in acting like Whoopi Goldberg and saying that they're entering her
body,

1151
01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.410
but even then,
if she does that,

1152
01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:59.070
to just dedicate one of your rooms to that and just have her fucking make money

1153
01:11:59.071 --> 01:12:03.930
off of other dopes that believe what she's doing is real
anyways.

1154
01:12:03.931 --> 01:12:06.990
I'm not so bothered by her belief shirts a bit.
Kooky,

1155
01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:10.890
but she's free to do it and so it's not hurting anyone.
All right.
There you go.

1156
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:14.310
The problem is,
is that she's offended that I don't believe in ghosts as well.

1157
01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.000
Oh Gee,
look at that.
I gave you a lecture and you are already fucking,

1158
01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:21.570
you were already where I was telling you to go.
It's like,
okay,

1159
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:26.510
you believe in ghosts.
Good for you.
But I don't fine.
Oh,

1160
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:30.340
cross.
Is there anything worse than cold tea?
Sorry,
I just started coughing.

1161
01:12:30.341 --> 01:12:32.740
I had to take a little swig there.
Um,

1162
01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:33.650
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1163
01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:35.510
<v 1>I stopped believing in ghosts around the same time.</v>

1164
01:12:35.511 --> 01:12:38.300
I stopped believing in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny back when I was a kid.

1165
01:12:38.301 --> 01:12:41.000
So when a full grown adult tells me they see spirits,

1166
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:44.090
I can't help but wonder if there's something wrong with them mentally.

1167
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.280
She is afraid to go to the restroom at a certain restaurant in our town because

1168
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:53.180
this a story about it being haunted.
She says the last time she went in there,

1169
01:12:53.181 --> 01:12:54.800
she felt in Erie chill,

1170
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.850
but it's a draftee bathroom in a 90 year old bill building for Christ's sake.

1171
01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.860
She also has this old photographs she took through a window and an abandoned

1172
01:13:03.861 --> 01:13:08.540
mental hospital that she claimed shows a ghost face.
When I look at it,

1173
01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:12.140
I only saw blurry bullshit.
I tried to be nice about it,

1174
01:13:12.141 --> 01:13:16.100
but I think she felt like I was calling her stupid or crazy when I didn't see
it,

1175
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:20.180
when I didn't see it too.
I didn't want to lie about it.
Besides,

1176
01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.670
she would know if I was lying.
Anyways.

1177
01:13:22.671 --> 01:13:25.160
I don't know how to approach this topic without upsetting her.

1178
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:29.820
Do you have any advice for me?
Yours truly.
Um,

1179
01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:34.130
this guy left his fucking name and I don't know if this is a reference to

1180
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:38.120
somebody,
a movie.
Let me see.

1181
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:45.300
Yes,
this has gotta be somebody's,
uh,
this thing has to be a movie joke.

1182
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.560
Oh,
doctor Peter Venkman.
Oh,
okay.

1183
01:13:51.561 --> 01:13:56.060
This is Bill Murray's character and Ghostbusters.
Okay.
Hilarious.
All right.
Um,

1184
01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.230
I don't know how to approach this topic without upsetting her.

1185
01:14:00.231 --> 01:14:04.460
Do you have any advice for me?
Yours truly Dr Peter Venkman.
Uh,

1186
01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:06.050
yet don't bring up the topic.

1187
01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.220
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1188
01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.040
<v 1>Don't bring up the topic and uh,</v>

1189
01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:18.250
you know,
so I would just,
I would just be like,
look,

1190
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.780
I get it.
You believe in ghosts and I don't,
uh,
don't say it like that.

1191
01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:25.360
Just be like,
I respect the fact that you believe in ghosts

1192
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.860
and um,
I don't,

1193
01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:34.750
and if the tables were turned and there was something that I believed in and you

1194
01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:39.520
didn't,
I would respect the fact that you didn't.
And uh,

1195
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:44.140
rather than,
you know,
getting upset with you.
Okay,
you see ghosts,

1196
01:14:44.141 --> 01:14:47.080
evidently you are born with the power that I was not giving.

1197
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:51.370
So you should feel thankful for that,
that you're able to see these things.

1198
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.940
I am a mere mortal.
Oh,
don't say that.
Cause then that's passive aggressive.

1199
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:59.920
I'm the worst.
Something along those lines.
And just say,
listen,

1200
01:14:59.921 --> 01:15:02.890
I love everything about you and we get along great.
But I,

1201
01:15:02.891 --> 01:15:05.470
I just feel like there's this tension about this that,

1202
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:10.510
that you're trying to force me to feel something that I don't feel and I don't

1203
01:15:10.511 --> 01:15:12.460
think that that's what you do to somebody you love.

1204
01:15:12.610 --> 01:15:14.560
And I wouldn't do that to you.
Okay.

1205
01:15:14.561 --> 01:15:17.740
So come on over here and if there's not it goes between us.

1206
01:15:17.741 --> 01:15:22.720
Could you give me a hug
some along those lines?

1207
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.630
All right,
last one here.
My sister's friend.
Oh boy.
Hey Buddy.
Hi Bill.
You can't,

1208
01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.580
I'm an 18 year olds from England and I need some advice.
All right.
You pasty,

1209
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:35.500
crooked teeth dose around two months ago.

1210
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:39.850
One of my sister's childhood friends came to visit her for a weekend.

1211
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.650
They'd been friends since they were three and she moved five hours away when she

1212
01:15:44.651 --> 01:15:47.410
was 12 so they barely see each other anymore.

1213
01:15:47.411 --> 01:15:51.400
They were playing to go out on Saturday with a group of friends say,

1214
01:15:51.610 --> 01:15:55.780
and I was planning on staying home alone when my sister went to pick up a few of

1215
01:15:55.781 --> 01:15:57.400
her friends to meet at our house.

1216
01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:02.200
Me and her friends flirted a bit,
but nothing major.

1217
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:06.960
We exchange snapchats,
et cetera.
I love how that's flirting now.
Long time.

1218
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.200
Long story short,

1219
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:14.070
my sister's friend pretended to be ill and came home early so we could hook up.

1220
01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:20.470
Dude,
you are fucking crushing it.
You assist is bringing them home to,
you know,

1221
01:16:20.471 --> 01:16:24.340
you have to go out.
Good for you.

1222
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:29.640
The only thing was my sister was genuinely ill and also came home early around

1223
01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:34.780
30 minutes after her friend and she caught us in bed together.
Well,

1224
01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:37.330
what the fuck is she doing walking into your bedroom?

1225
01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:43.510
My sister got insanely angry and stormed out by,
you should have said,
hey,

1226
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:44.980
don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

1227
01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:50.800
And it just lit a cigarette.
Oh my God.

1228
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:52.450
I think this is fucking funny.

1229
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.510
This is fucking hilarious there.

1230
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:59.500
Do you realize how hard you're crushing it?
You're fucking at home.

1231
01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:01.030
You're not even trying to get late.

1232
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.840
She just says her friends come over for the bullshit.
Okay ladies,

1233
01:17:04.841 --> 01:17:06.790
you ready to go out and in that moment,

1234
01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:10.880
whatever the fuck you did made one of them pretend to be sick and come back and

1235
01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:13.940
hook up with you.
Dude,
you're a fucking hero.

1236
01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:16.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1237
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:20.150
<v 1>There's no reason to get,
oh,
I don't care how mad you sister gets.
Just,</v>

1238
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:25.070
I would just just keep smiling and just be like,
Hey,
am I can't help it,
man.
I,

1239
01:17:25.230 --> 01:17:28.970
you know,
the ladies loved me,
sweetheart,
sweetheart.

1240
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:32.930
I wasn't trying to hook up.
I was at home.

1241
01:17:32.970 --> 01:17:37.670
I was innocent.
I can't help it.
If women are attracted to me,

1242
01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:41.300
I would just go totally fucking arrogant.
And the matter she get,

1243
01:17:41.301 --> 01:17:45.560
I would just keep laughing and I would never take it seriously.
Uh,

1244
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:48.970
my sister has suffered with depression and anxiety.
I forget what,
I just,

1245
01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.650
I didn't see that part.

1246
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:55.910
My sister's suffered with depression and I'm so excited for you that I didn't

1247
01:17:55.911 --> 01:17:59.480
even read this next part.
She suffered with depression and anxiety for years.

1248
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:01.400
So whenever something like this happens,

1249
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:06.890
my family almost always sides with her.
Oh,

1250
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.310
that's easy.
Then you just divide and conquer with the,
with your dad.

1251
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:13.920
Just be like,
Dad,
I can't help but I,
I inherited your charisma.
What do,

1252
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:17.600
what do you want from me?
She,
I,
I didn't go out with,

1253
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:22.250
she came home to me,
it fell,
it fell right in my lap.

1254
01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.610
What was I supposed to do?
Dad?
What was I supposed to do?

1255
01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.190
You know?
And he'll,
I don't,

1256
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:31.860
there's no fucking way I get mad at my kid in the morning.
I mean,

1257
01:18:31.861 --> 01:18:36.060
he's mad because you're making her upset,
but he's not mad at what you did.

1258
01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.520
I'm guaranteed your dad's telling his friends at work,

1259
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:42.560
his fucking son of a bitch and you have to leave the fucking house.
They come in,

1260
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:44.240
they come in to him.
Uh,

1261
01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:48.110
in the morning she threatened to never talk to me again for what I did,

1262
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:53.150
but I said something along the lines of,
I feel a connection with her

1263
01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:59.810
or some bullshit like that to calm my sister down.
The thing was I didn't,

1264
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:02.810
but her friend did.
Oh No.

1265
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:08.650
We started dating and after around two weeks I re I realized that I fucking

1266
01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:14.810
hated this girl.
She is genuinely as shit.
Yeah.
This is all good.

1267
01:19:14.811 --> 01:19:17.540
This is all good stuff because you're learning lessons which you're supposed to

1268
01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:22.460
in life,
especially at 18.
Okay.
This whole thing started with the lie.
Okay.

1269
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:26.010
And that you did to protect your sister's feelings.

1270
01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:27.590
So you just got to come clean.

1271
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:31.460
You've got to dump the dummy and just tell her like,
listen,

1272
01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:36.440
I love you so much that I actually started dating somebody that is fucking

1273
01:19:36.441 --> 01:19:40.430
stupid.
All right,
I'm sorry you have that.

1274
01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.190
Then she'll get mad that you'll be like calling her friends stupid.

1275
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.990
Are you saying my friends is stupid?
No,

1276
01:19:44.991 --> 01:19:47.480
I'm saying that friend that is a friend of you is stupid.

1277
01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:53.180
The other ones seem really smart and you know,
tell all of them.

1278
01:19:53.181 --> 01:19:57.950
I wouldn't mind if they fake six and came home and hooked up with
all right.

1279
01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.040
I realized that I fucking hated this girl.
She's generally stupid as shit.

1280
01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:06.041
My original plan was to pretend I was into her for a few months and then when I

1281
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:07.770
go to university,

1282
01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.713
<v 2>mmm.</v>

1283
01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:15.440
<v 1>In a few months I'd break up with her because of the long distance.
Dude,</v>

1284
01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:18.360
don't do that because you might break her heart.
All right.

1285
01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:21.810
But that's some dumb shit you do when you're 18.
Uh,

1286
01:20:21.811 --> 01:20:26.811
that way I'd saved my relationship with my sister and mother and get rid of this

1287
01:20:27.481 --> 01:20:32.340
stupid bitch.
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
Don't talk about women.

1288
01:20:32.341 --> 01:20:35.640
You don't need to talk about him like that.
Okay.
Feel lucky that you know,

1289
01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:38.100
you got a better brain than cheated.
Yeah.
Don't,

1290
01:20:38.101 --> 01:20:40.050
don't play with people's feelings like that.
All right?

1291
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:43.950
Cause I'm telling you right now that if you're any sort of an actual human being

1292
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:48.330
,
uh,
breaking somebody's heart,
the guilt of that never fucking goes away.

1293
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:50.251
Um,
however,

1294
01:20:50.251 --> 01:20:55.050
I recently received news that my first choice university turned me down and my

1295
01:20:55.051 --> 01:20:57.420
second choice was the only one that accepted me.

1296
01:20:57.630 --> 01:21:02.630
The problem is she lives 15 minutes away from my second choice university and

1297
01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:05.070
now I don't know what to do.
You've got to come clean.

1298
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:09.600
I can't go through university hitched to a girl I fucking hate,

1299
01:21:09.601 --> 01:21:12.900
but I can't afford to risk my relationship with my family for obvious reasons.

1300
01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:14.670
Also,

1301
01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:18.120
another girl who I think I generally may have a connection with recently broke

1302
01:21:18.121 --> 01:21:21.660
up with her boyfriend of two years and I'm pretty sure that if I could,

1303
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.540
if I could,
we would be dating right now.
Uh,

1304
01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:29.541
it also doesn't help that this girl is a nine out of 10 looking model and I'm

1305
01:21:29.581 --> 01:21:32.760
probably a six and a half out of 10 at best.
Thanks for you.

1306
01:21:32.761 --> 01:21:36.030
Help you freckled Twat all right.
Through this is what you got to learn.

1307
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:40.590
You're going to learn,
uh,
honesty here.
All right?

1308
01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.770
I'm fucking break up with that woman today.

1309
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:50.620
All right?
And you have to come clean,

1310
01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:51.960
<v 2>okay.</v>

1311
01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:55.320
<v 1>With everybody in your house and you have to say,
you know,</v>

1312
01:21:55.321 --> 01:21:59.220
you have to put your foot down that your parents cannot be choosing.

1313
01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:01.620
I maybe I would have this conversation with your parents.

1314
01:22:01.621 --> 01:22:06.621
They can't be choosing your sister over you straight across the board because of

1315
01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:11.430
your sister's depression and anxiety issues.
Okay.

1316
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.720
I don't know how severe they are.
All right.
If there are chemical,
then yeah,

1317
01:22:15.721 --> 01:22:18.650
that's a major problem.
But you know,
if she just needs to fucking,

1318
01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.633
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1319
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.590
<v 1>You know,
get out of a funk then.
I Dunno.</v>

1320
01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:26.190
I don't know where she is on the whole depression spectrum if that's the proper

1321
01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:29.700
thing.
But like,
you shouldn't have to be suffering like this,
dude,

1322
01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.440
you got to live your own fucking life.
All right?
Just live your life.

1323
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:38.220
Live your life.
When you live your life,
sometimes people are going to get hard.

1324
01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.580
All right?
Fuck that.
Break up with this woman and go ask the other woman out.

1325
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:47.520
That's it.
That's what the fuck you do.

1326
01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:50.010
And if anybody in your family has a problem with it,

1327
01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:52.530
let them vent to you and all that stuff and just say,

1328
01:22:52.531 --> 01:22:57.531
I'm sorry that I am doing what my heart is telling me to do.

1329
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.470
All right.
I am not trying to hurt anybody in this family.

1330
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:06.280
Had I known that hooking up with that girl was gonna,
uh,

1331
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:10.720
cause this level of,
of drama,
I wouldn't have done it.
I regret that I did it.

1332
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.840
I actually felt so bad that I actually fucking dated her for two weeks the whole

1333
01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:18.760
time.
And it was like talking to a fucking chair.

1334
01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.240
Say all this stuff nicely.

1335
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:23.670
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1336
01:23:23.670 --> 01:23:26.120
<v 1>All right.
There's a woman that I like,</v>

1337
01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.870
then I want to pursue and I'm going to do that.
And if that's wrong,

1338
01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:34.160
that God damn it,
I don't want to be right and walk out.

1339
01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:35.610
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1340
01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:35.971
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1341
01:23:35.971 --> 01:23:40.740
And don't let them hold your sister's fucking problems over your goddamn head

1342
01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.930
because that's,
look what it's already doing.

1343
01:23:42.931 --> 01:23:45.360
It's causing you to fucking date people you don't want to date.

1344
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:48.330
So then she's going to be depressed and you're going to be living this life of

1345
01:23:48.331 --> 01:23:52.680
fucking misery because you didn't do what you wanted.
Okay?
Now,
having said that,

1346
01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:55.950
don't call women bitches,
all right?
Don't do that.

1347
01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.340
I'm not saying don't call them out on this shit and stand your ground,

1348
01:23:59.341 --> 01:24:02.900
but they don't.
Don't have a do the name calling thing,
all right?
Because it's,

1349
01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:04.410
it doesn't die.
Get you.

1350
01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:08.460
Not only does it and it makes the other person not hear what your point is,

1351
01:24:08.730 --> 01:24:12.060
then they can bring that up for the rest of your fucking relationship and God

1352
01:24:12.061 --> 01:24:16.200
knows they're going to do it.
All right?
That's the fucking podcast.
Oh,

1353
01:24:16.201 --> 01:24:19.860
fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Bye Bye.
