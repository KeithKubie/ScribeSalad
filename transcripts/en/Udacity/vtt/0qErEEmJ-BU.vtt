00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.500
Kavita has a fern that grows
two inches every 15 days.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.890
She wants to know how long it will
take for her fern to grow 20 inches.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.670
What's the correct way to
set up this proportion?

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.510
Well, we know that her fern
grows two inches every 15 days.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.390
We have to set that equal
to another proportion.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.390
So set up the proportion and
use x to represent the number of

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.310
days that it will take for
Kavita's fern to grow 20 inches.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.650
So in one box you will put an x and
in another box, you'll put a number.
