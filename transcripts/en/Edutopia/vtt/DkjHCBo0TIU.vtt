00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:10.776
&gt;&gt;Emily Pittman: Travel
journals are the textbooks

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:12.296
that our kids create themselves.

00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:14.346
They're a great way for students

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.006
to really take ownership
of their learning.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.326
&gt;&gt;Denver Huffstutler: We
call them travel journals

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:20.406
because it becomes a journey of
all their engaging activities.

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:23.286
&gt;&gt;Emily Pittman: So this is
a blank-slate travel journal

00:00:23.416 --> 00:00:25.846
from the module that
we're currently doing,

00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:26.996
"Follow Me Through Tennessee".

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:28.996
&gt;&gt;Lydia: When they start out
they're all just a blank book.

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:33.536
We get to create a page about
our learning about that subject,

00:00:33.536 --> 00:00:35.456
and it's fun because
you get to tie it in.

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:37.166
You get to keep them at
the end of the session.

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:40.356
&gt;&gt;Emily Pittman: So the table
of contents the kids put

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:43.366
in at the beginning so that
we can hand them the materials

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.136
and say, "Okay, open
up to page nine.

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:48.286
We're gonna be working on our
history of West Tennessee page,"

00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:51.956
and it gives kids the main idea
of what that page will be about.

00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:53.786
&gt;&gt;Here we have our
essential questions.

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.916
&gt;&gt;Those questions are really
the basis of every single one

00:00:57.916 --> 00:00:59.226
of our lessons that we teach.

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:03.656
One of our leaves says, "How
does change occur over time?

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:06.076
How does where you live
affect how you live?"

00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:07.756
&gt;&gt;Denver Huffstutler: If you
look at the travel journals,

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:11.336
everything that's in there, it's
"Here's how I understand how

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:15.116
to answer the essential question
that I was looking to uncover."

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.246
&gt;&gt;Emily Pittman: Well, "I
wonder" questions are done

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:18.786
at the very beginning
of modules.

00:01:18.786 --> 00:01:20.166
We usually give them
a little bit

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.736
of background information
with our hook lesson.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.626
So we posted these four topics
on the board and prompted them,

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:28.036
"We want you to think
of an 'I wonder'."

00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:31.986
Little Lucy, here, wondered
how Tennessee became a state.

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:36.256
It's an easy assessment to know
what we need to cover a lot

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:38.816
or what we don't need
to cover so much.

00:01:38.816 --> 00:01:39.116
&gt;&gt;Denver Huffstutler: --

00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:42.716
only about twenty-five
to twenty-eight lessons

00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:45.106
within a quarter
that we put together.

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:47.496
We not only want
to include things

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:50.976
that the student has learned,
but we also want there

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:54.036
to be reflective times and those
are things that we can assess.

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:55.736
&gt;&gt;Jill Levine: These
travel journals are rich

00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:58.526
with timelines, charts,
diagrams,

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.566
lots of writing,
vocabulary, pictures.

00:02:02.626 --> 00:02:03.946
&gt;&gt;Emily Pittman: We
provide our lesson.

00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:05.896
We then-- usually
we have a prompt

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:08.726
that they respond
to after the lesson.

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:13.606
They do their draft and
put it into written form.

00:02:13.986 --> 00:02:16.066
We talk about ways
that they can revise

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.306
and correct their mistakes.

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:20.936
So then their published pieces
turn into their travel journals.

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:23.456
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Right now I'd
like to see you guys flipping

00:02:23.596 --> 00:02:25.496
through making sure
all pages are complete,

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:30.656
making sure that you have titles
and headings on every page.

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:31.976
In the middle of the table
you'll find your rubric.

00:02:33.096 --> 00:02:35.936
&gt;&gt;Denver Huffstutler: A rubric
is a simple way for students

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:38.446
to judge their own
understanding of content

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:39.686
or completion of an assignment.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:41.996
&gt;&gt;Emily Pittman: The
rubric, it's a reflection

00:02:41.996 --> 00:02:44.976
of the table of contents.

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:47.006
&gt;&gt;Grady: You can grade yourself
in what do you think it is

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:50.046
and the teacher grades
what you got.

00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:53.416
If you got, like, a
check-minus right here,

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:56.836
you know now what
you can work on.

00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:59.516
&gt;&gt;Denver Huffstutler: As
students go into older grades,

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:02.796
the rubric tends to be a little
bit more specific of things

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:03.746
that have to be there.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.496
So it's a great tool
for the student

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:06.716
to redirect their own learning.

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:11.046
&gt;&gt;Emily Pittman: The covers are
usually completed towards the

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:13.466
end of quarter once they
have a full understanding

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:15.596
and we do some kind of main idea

00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:18.886
of that module on
the front cover.

00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:20.736
&gt;&gt;Finn: A travel journal
is very fun to do,

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:26.896
because you really get to
show what you have learned.

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:27.806
&gt;&gt;Hayden: I get to
show all my work

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:29.446
that I've done working
really hard in school

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:31.946
to my parents and to my teacher.

00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:32.966
&gt;&gt;Jill Levine: What's
really special

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:35.496
about travel journals is they
really become prize possessions

00:03:35.496 --> 00:03:36.296
for our students.

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:39.356
If they're here for eight
years and they've created four

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:41.306
of these every year,
they'll have thirty-two,

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:44.406
and so most of our students
will have a shelf at home

00:03:44.476 --> 00:03:46.576
where all their travel
journals are lined up

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:48.866
and parents often say that
that's the bedtime reading.

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:51.256
That's what they most want
to go back to, is they want

00:03:51.256 --> 00:03:52.696
to read those travel journals.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:54.726
When students are engaged,

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:57.196
when they're getting their hands
dirty, when they're creating,

00:03:57.196 --> 00:03:59.206
when they're painting,
when they're thinking

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:01.826
and problem solving, that's
when true learning takes place.
