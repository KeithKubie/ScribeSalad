00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.544
Let's compare the fraction
4/7 to the fraction 5/7.

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:09.960
And what I want you to do right
now is to pause this video

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.890
and think about which
of these fractions

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.552
represents a larger quantity.

00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:16.010
I'm assuming you've
had a go at it,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.330
and the one thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.980
is that they both have the
same bottom number, which

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.330
we call the denominator.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.280
They both have a
denominator of 7.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.330
So one way to think about it is
this is literally 4 sevenths.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.970
This is literally 5 sevenths.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.550
So we could rewrite 4/7
as literally 4 times 1/7.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.970
And we can rewrite 5/7
as literally 5 times 1/7.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.657
It's 5/7.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.880
So now if I have 4
of something versus 5

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.320
of something, which is going
to be a larger quantity?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.200
Well, clearly 5 of this
1/7 is going to be more.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.730
So 4/7 is smaller,
5/7 is larger.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.370
And so what we can do is we
can write a less than symbol.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.640
The way that I remember
less than and greater than,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.260
is that the point, the
small side of the symbol,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.370
always is on the same side
as the smaller number.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.670
So this could be read
as 4/7 is less than 5/7,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.819
or that 4 times 1/7 is
less than 5 times 1/7.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.610
Now, let's do another
scenario, but instead

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.220
of having the same denominator,
let's have the same numerator.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.380
So let's say we
want to compare 3/4

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:45.430
versus-- let's say versus 3/9.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.325
Which of these two fractions
is a larger number?

00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:49.950
And once again, pause
the video and try

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.850
to think about it on your own.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.220
Well, as we mentioned, we don't
have the same denominator here.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.990
We have the same
top number instead.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.120
Here is the same bottom
number, same denominator.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.510
Here we're going to
have the same numerator.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.900
We have the 3 right over there.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.450
And we could view 3/4 as
literally 3 times 1/4.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.660
And we could view 3/9 as
literally 3 times 1/9.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.487
So we have 3/4 and we have 3/9.

00:02:25.487 --> 00:02:27.070
So we really just
have to about what's

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.010
larger, a fourth or a ninth?

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.840
Well, think about if you
start with a whole-- think

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.865
about starting with
a whole like this.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.910
And let me make a
whole right over here,

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.482
so the same sized whole.

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:48.065
A fourth is literally
taking the whole

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:49.366
and dividing it into 4 pieces.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:51.740
While a ninth is taking the
whole and dividing it into 9.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.490
9 equal sections, I could say.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.920
So let's divide this
into 4 equal sections.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.700
So my best attempt to
hand draw equal sections.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.940
So that's 2 equal
sections and then

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.960
that looks pretty close
to 4 equal sections.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.990
So that right over there is 1/4.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.790
And let me draw ninths here.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.120
So let me first split this
into 3 equal sections.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120
So those would be third.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.500
And then split each of
those into 3 equal sections.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.430
So this is my best
attempt at that,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.560
at hand drawing
9 equal sections,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.834
splitting the whole
into 9 equal sections.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.250
So when you see here-- and you
might have already realized

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.074
this-- if you divide something
into 4 equal sections,

00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:36.490
each section is
going to be bigger

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.180
than if you divide it
into 9 equal sections.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.660
A ninth is smaller
than a fourth.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.890
A ninth is smaller than 1/4.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.450
So 3/9 is going to
be smaller than 3/4.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.100
So once again, when you want to
do less than or greater than,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.330
you want to put the point,
the small side of the symbol,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.450
on the same side as
the smaller number.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.490
So it would look like this.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.230
And this is the
greater than symbol,

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.790
because what you have on the
left is the larger number.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.330
3/4 is greater than 3/9.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.520
And if you actually wanted to
represent not just 1/4 and 1/9,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.850
we could actually color it in.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.980
3 times one fourth,
well that's 1, 2, 3.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.550
While 3 times 1/9,
or 3/9, is 1, 2, 3.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.880
And when you look at it
that way, it's pretty clear.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.020
But the important
thing to realize

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.400
is, is that when the
denominator is larger,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.920
you're dividing the
whole into more pieces

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.430
so each piece will be smaller.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.470
So making the denominator larger
makes the fraction smaller.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.009
Making the numerator larger
makes the fraction larger.
