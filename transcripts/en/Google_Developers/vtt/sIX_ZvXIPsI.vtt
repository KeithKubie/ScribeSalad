NITHYA SAMBASIVAN: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.037
My name is Nithya.

00:00:08.037 --> 00:00:09.120
NIBHA JAIN: Hi, I'm Nibha.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.600
And we are both UX
researchers at Google working

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.280
on emerging markets products.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.960
So, today, we thought we'd
come and say hi and tell you

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.240
a little bit about
emerging markets, how

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.070
they are different and unique.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.885
And we'd like to share four
research tools with you that we

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:28.800
have used, tried, and tested
that work in these markets

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.270
with their unique constraints.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.070
And then we'll leave some
time at the end for a Q&amp;A.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.710
If you'd like to tweet
while we're talking

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.900
or you have something
on your mind,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.967
hashtag #EMpathy, empathy.

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:41.550
and, you can--

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.410
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN: But also--

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.510
NIBHA JAIN: You can also talk
to us on Spaces afterwards.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.255
Why do research?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.490
Quick show of hands,
how many of you

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.860
have done research
for your products?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.360
All right.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.740
And how many of you have done
user research for your products

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.070
in emerging markets?

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.570
Awesome!

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.030
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN:
That's awesome.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.530
NIBHA JAIN: OK
there's a few people.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.570
So we don't have to
sell it very hard.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.530
You are not your user.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.140
A lot of times when we move
and develop our products,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.200
we are moving forward
with our assumptions.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.470
We assume that, hey,
everyone must understand

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.790
what airplane mode is.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.880
Everyone must understand
what going offline means.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.200
And those are just
our assumptions.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.740
So don't assume.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.840
Go find out what the
other person thinks.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.130
And that's why you do research.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.120
When you leave your studio,
your office, your workshop,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.860
you go and meet people
in their environment.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.730
You not only learn
about your product,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.940
but you learn about
the way they live,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.652
what are their constraints.

00:01:47.652 --> 00:01:49.610
People might be living
in low light conditions.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.160
People might work night shift.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.700
And all of those
things you learn

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.100
when you leave your
office space and meet them

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.260
in their environment.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.220
And lastly, speaking
as a UX researcher,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.610
it's not just the researchers
job to do the research.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.630
It's a team responsibility.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.440
It doesn't matter if you're a
developer, engineer, designer,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.760
a marketing person.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.250
You need to be in there
getting your hands dirty.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.185
Being there, sitting
next to the person who

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:20.680
is asking the questions,
asking the questions yourself,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.140
and learning about
your product firsthand.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.790
So yeah, just join in.

00:02:28.536 --> 00:02:30.510
Nithya is going to
tell us a little bit

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.570
about doing research
in emerging markets.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.740
And so I'm going to
hand it over to her.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.810
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN: Thanks Nipa.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.150
So emerging markets,
to begin with,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.870
are not a homogeneous unit.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.850
Every region, every subculture,
is different from each other.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.650
But there are some
cross-cutting characteristics

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.820
across countries.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.450
Over a billion
people are expected

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.310
to come online over the
next couple of years.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.350
And a majority of
them are coming

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.180
online in the so-called
emerging markets where over 3/4

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.570
of the world's population
is concentrated.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.020
However, there are some
unique characteristics,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.150
technologically,
infrastructurally, socially,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.810
or culturally, that
characterize emerging markets.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.420
For one, while internet
is on the rise,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.670
it can still be
slow and expensive

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.210
as a proportion of one's income.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.310
This is Faith who
we met in Kenya.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.860
It's a pseudonym.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.274
Faith turns off her
mobile data every night

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:31.190
as she goes to sleep
because she does not want

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.765
to incur accidental charges.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.230
Prepaid subscription
comprises the majority.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.270
Over 95% of subscriptions
in India and South

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.070
Africa are prepaid, quite
unlike the post-pay model, which

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.090
many of us may be used to,
where a monthly balance

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.040
is automatically paid.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.880
Prepaid involves
deliberate thinking around

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.130
what is the right plan for me.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.400
What is the right amount?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.160
Is it 2G, 3G, or 4G?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.430
And this is a family
that we met in Calcutta

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.860
where they share a phone
and have a prepaid data

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.350
pack on the device.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.380
And they go to the local
grocery store down the street

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.130
to top up their
balance every week.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.050
And a majority of the users
that are coming online

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.100
are doing so on a mobile
device and, often, only

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.710
on a mobile phone.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.960
This is Ardita who we met
in Jakarta in Indonesia.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.720
And he works in a shoe factory.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.040
And he owns a China made phone.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.180
And the phone costs about $40.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.530
And a lot of these
phones are sub $100.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.880
They may have small screens.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.500
They may have slots
for multiples SIM

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.010
cards, low internal
memory, and noncompliance.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.690
So often, they require us
to think unconventionally

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.620
about how our apps
perform and work

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.450
in these heterogeneous devices.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.620
So what is different about
doing research, and particularly

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.790
product development,
in emerging markets?

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.060
For one, there maybe time
and distance factors,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.400
with time zones and
coordinating with remote teams

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.720
and travel and jet lag.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.860
Like I mentioned,
internet is on the rise,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.030
but it's still uneven
and still growing.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.650
A lot of the research
methods that are designed

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.050
are designed for
wealthy populations

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.850
or for online populations.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.830
And a lot of these
assumptions break down

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.150
when you go into
certain user context.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.410
There are unique social,
cultural, economic norms

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.450
that characterize
emerging markets, that

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.180
affect affordability and
values around technology

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.834
and aspiration around that.

00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:49.000
And there may be different
environmental conditions,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.730
for example, traffic
characterizes

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.930
what people do in
their downtime,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.310
downloading content
and listening to music

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.480
or watching videos on
the metro or in the cap.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.490
So what this calls for is
different methodological

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.570
responses when doing product
development and research

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.150
in emerging markets.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.850
And so our usual user
experience methods,

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.780
like A/B testing or lab
studies or online video diaries

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.620
may not work because if 15%
percent of the population

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.550
is online in a country, you're
getting a very biased response

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.110
if you're only targeting
those who are online.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.510
And what this calls for is a mix
of analog and digital methods.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.190
And this is what we're going
to talk to you about today,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.210
some methods that have proven
to have success in our product

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.060
development.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.170
NIBHA JAIN: How we do
something differently.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.550
Those are the four tools that
we will talk to you about,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.050
intercepts, scrolls,
immersives, and clickthroughs.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.210
So Nithya mentioned a
lot of great challenges

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.270
that come with
being someone who's

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.220
interested in doing product
development in these markets.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.522
So now you know
about the challenges.

00:06:58.522 --> 00:07:00.730
You need to come up with
methods to test your product

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.470
and develop your product
despite those challenges.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.997
You need something that will
work without connectivity

00:07:05.997 --> 00:07:07.580
because you don't
know if you're going

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.710
to find it when you get there.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.650
You need it to be low cost so
that you can make a lot of them

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.040
and cheaply and deploy them
and have your team use them

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.050
while you're in the field
because you're flying halfway

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.840
across the field, you need
to use your time effectively.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.020
They are in-person.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:29.600
So a lot of times, you
may rely on online surveys

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.370
or [INAUDIBLE], things like
that, where the data can

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.820
be really, really impersonal.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.920
But because your end
user might not even

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.050
be online or know how
to use those tools,

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.270
these are in-person.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.550
And you get more
feedback, richer feedback,

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.240
something that you can verify
was done in a good way.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.010
And they are portable,
so they go along

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.600
with you whenever you might be.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.724
They are resilient.

00:07:55.724 --> 00:07:57.140
When you're in
these markets you'd

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.550
be surprised by the
number of things

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.340
your environment
might throw at you.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.980
You might find
yourself on a boat.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.570
You might find yourself
in a participant's home

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.650
where they have a cat, they have
a dog, they have a pet monkey.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.370
It might happen.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.790
It happens.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.110
And so these methods need
to be resilient and survive

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.990
through all of those
different environments

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.573
that you might or
might not encounter.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.510
As with every other tool,
when you are using these

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.770
through product development.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.680
you need to know when
to use which want.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.419
Some of them, of
course, lend themselves

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:37.890
to any time, anywhere, across
that product development life

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:38.570
cycle.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.419
Others are more
effective when you

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:43.171
use them and you have something
more tangible to show people

00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:45.670
or when you're just trying to
identify what your opportunity

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.550
space might be.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.965
And as we go
through each method,

00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:52.570
we will tell you which one
is a good fit for when.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.800
So with that, Nithya is going
to tell us about intercepts.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.930
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN: Thanks, Nipa.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.400
So intercepts allow us to
conduct spot interviews.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.970
And they maximize
on time and give us

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.580
a lot of learning in a
very short period of time.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.070
So for example, this is our
team in Kampala in Uganda

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.920
where we approached a taxi
stand and spoke to taxi drivers

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.060
about how they were using
mobile devices and applications

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.410
for taxis in their day today.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.680
So intercepts are
spot interviews

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.320
that are conducted in
naturalistic environments,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.500
where people hang out,
relax, play, or work.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.470
And they help us build a strong
foundational understanding

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.590
of different user groups and
the context and their practices.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.460
So when should you
use intercepts?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.860
Use it to gather
several data points

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.560
in a very short period of time.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.960
It's amazing, in a day, how many
different sites and populations

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.866
that you can encounter.

00:09:57.866 --> 00:09:59.740
For example, you could
go to the marketplace.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.990
You could go to the
church or the template

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.690
or to the water pump and have
very different conversations

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.670
with different demographics.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.986
Use it for broad as well
as tactical questions.

00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:12.860
So intercepts can be
used throughout the life

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.750
cycle of the product,
in fact, early on

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.670
to build a strong foundation
of who are our users

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.200
and what their practices
and behaviors and values,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.280
but also for very tactical,
product-specific questions

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.250
where Nipa will walk us through
some of these techniques

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.000
a little later, where
you can take in a product

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.450
prototype, or UI, and
get specific feedback

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.660
on the features.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.290
And use it to gather
an understanding

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.140
of different demographics in
various naturalistic contexts

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.900
outside of the lab, which
is where people are.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.020
Why should you use it?

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.810
It helps us understand how
people think and use technology

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.670
outside a lab.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.770
Often, a lab is a good place
to get very tactical feedback.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.610
But it is an
artificial environment

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:05.570
where someone comes into an
office or a conference room,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.190
within four walls.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.020
So intercepts help
us get out of the lab

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.120
and go around the
city or the country.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.580
And you cut down on recruitment
and logistical costs.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.430
You have to plan a set of
research questions and a script

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.500
and be deliberate about
which groups and sites

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.827
you want to go to.

00:11:23.827 --> 00:11:24.660
But that's about it.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.655
There isn't really
any cost involved

00:11:26.655 --> 00:11:29.260
in recruiting a
particular type of users

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.550
or bringing them to the office.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.030
So how do we go about
doing intercepts?

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.310
And each of you has a handout.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.420
Some of you may have
the intercepts handout.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.850
So if you don't, please
share it with your neighbor.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.340
So the steps involved are,
as always with any research

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.770
technique, identify your goals
and come up with your questions

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.630
and then identify the
locations that you

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.897
want to visit that are
relevant to your product users.

00:11:56.897 --> 00:11:58.355
And you can do this
in coordination

00:11:58.355 --> 00:12:00.980
with your local team.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.870
And once you are at a particular
site or with a user group,

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.570
establish rapport.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.020
So you have a very short period
of time to gain their trust

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.610
and build a relationship with
your-- with the community.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.160
Always seek permission
before you begin.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.190
I'll talk about informed
consent in a second.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.240
But disclose who you are.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.110
Always seek permission
to record audio or video.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:30.530
This can be hypersensitive
in some user groups.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.970
So do seek permission.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.020
Plan for onlookers.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.210
You may start a conversation
with one person,

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.030
and soon, in a public
space, you may end up

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.460
with 10 other people
who are onlookers

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.870
who join the conversation.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.090
So account for that.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.620
And if you want to have
a private conversation,

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.600
account for that.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.400
And take notes.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.830
Some places and groups
that you can go to.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.400
Remember the field
is all around you.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.920
And so any-- a taxi ride can be
a good place for an intercept,

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.340
for example.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.260
Gender balance.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.690
Often, there are more men than
women in the public sphere,

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.230
so you may have to seek
out female heavy spaces.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.800
And that may mean going
to the marketplace

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.470
or getting a haircut.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.440
Sample on the go because this
is dynamic in the research

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:19.950
approach.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.890
You don't know who
you're going to get.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.920
So consider-- try to
balance age, gender, income

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.490
groups so you don't
end up talking

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.270
to only one type of a person.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.980
So what's informed consent?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:36.690
This is the starting point
for any research interview.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.840
Disclose who you are,
where you come from,

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.540
what you're representing,
what is the conversation going

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.610
to be about, what are
the risks and benefits

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.860
of the conversation,
and what are you going

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.210
to do with the idea, how
you're going to collect

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.150
the information and store it.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:57.280
For intercepts, often, cash
is not the right response

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.190
to thank somebody.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:02.190
And that's why contextual
gifts are more helpful.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.914
For example, when we conduct
interviews with shopkeepers,

00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:06.580
We end up buying stuff
from their shops.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.660
We end up with a lot
of bananas and fruit.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.160
Consider what's
economically appropriate.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.480
Giving a gift card
for Amazon may not

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.540
be the right thing to do
for a low income resident.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.540
But the most important
thing, in any research,

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.130
is to stay genuine, show that
you care about their response,

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.720
listen, and that really
helps your participant

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.040
want to share more.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.120
Mind the gap.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.170
There is a definite gap,
often, between the researcher

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.140
and the participant.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:44.490
So try to understand local
norms, local attires, phrases,

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.680
if any, and try
to bridge the gap.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.160
This may mean
sitting on the floor,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.350
being aware of your
surroundings and responding.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.020
Local language is important.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.720
So even if a community is
able to express in English,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.400
their local language may be
what they're comfortable with,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.340
so find interpreters.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.910
And go light in the field.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.070
Notebooks are-- and
going analog is often

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.370
the best way to take notes
because it's transparent.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.360
Your participant can see
what you're capturing.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.870
And it reduces the barrier
between you and the participant

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.180
by not having the technology
that you're typing notes into.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.310
And it's also safe.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.750
So in summary, that
was a lot of points.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.610
Some steps for
conducting intercepts

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.390
are know your questions,
identify locations,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.530
and, once you're in a location,
start by building trust

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.050
and consent, get
consent and permission,

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.130
and be aware of
the surroundings.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.620
Respond-- if you get a
large group of people,

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.070
plan accordingly and
move accordingly.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.984
Nipa will talk to us
about scrolls now.

00:15:48.984 --> 00:15:49.900
NIBHA JAIN: All Right.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.740
So Nithya mentioned, in her
last slide, going light.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:57.660
And this is perfect
because scrolls are

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.480
exactly what they sound like.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.550
They are made of paper.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.300
And they are a lot of
paper stuck together

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.610
with tape to form one
giant roll of paper.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.920
It's a user journey.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.310
It's a story that you want
your user to tell you.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:11.639
It's your project's journey.

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:13.180
But you want to hear
it from the user

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.970
and how they're interpreting
it and how they think

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.520
they will progress through it.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.190
When should you use it?

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.850
When you are in the early
stages of development.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.370
You know what your
problem space if.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:30.400
You want to understand what's
the best way to solve for it.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.940
You create an entire portfolio
of different concepts.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:40.320
Maybe a person can listen
to songs by going online.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.450
Maybe they can listen
to it by downloading it.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.530
Maybe they can listen to it by
sharing it with their friends.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.990
Maybe it's a collective app.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.012
So there are many different ways
of solving the same problem.

00:16:50.012 --> 00:16:51.720
And you want to go in
with your concepts.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.570
And this is a great tool
to do that because you

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.254
can get-- it's low fidelity.

00:16:57.254 --> 00:16:58.170
It's so cheap to make.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.452
You can get a lot of
feedback in the same session.

00:17:01.452 --> 00:17:02.910
It's also really
great for when you

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.200
want to capture passage of time
because it's a linear scroll.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.160
If you want to say, imagine
that you are going on a bus

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.910
when this happened,
just put a bus there.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:15.915
Or imagine, overnight, this
thing happens on your phone,

00:17:15.915 --> 00:17:17.290
and so you just
put a moon there.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.520
Or you went to sleep,
and the next morning you

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.519
saw something like that.

00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:23.130
It's really easy to convey
those points of detail

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.210
through pictures.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.096
So step 1, always
start with, what

00:17:28.096 --> 00:17:29.220
are the goals of the study?

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.790
What are the hypotheses
that you want to test?

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.340
Map out the steps you want
to build into your journey,

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.970
and then, in the
last vignette, you

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.979
can see adding contextual cues
like if you want to put a bus,

00:17:40.979 --> 00:17:41.520
put it there.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.240
If you want to put an overnight
concept, put a clock or a moon

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.890
or whatever it is that
you feel comfortable with.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.051
And then you get crafty.

00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:52.800
You get a printer.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.383
You print out all
the different things

00:17:54.383 --> 00:17:55.920
that you want to
have in the story.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.730
And you tape them all up.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.010
You put them in
the right sequence.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.220
And you roll it up, and
you are ready to go.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.830
Last step, manage
the expectations

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:06.786
of your participants.

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:08.160
Tell them, hey,
this is something

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.990
that we are going
to do together.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.200
You hold one side.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.110
I'm going to unroll
it from this side.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.860
You roll it back up
on the other side,

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.860
and we're going to look
at one screen at a time.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.390
And you tell me
what is happening.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.626
So it's a great
conversational piece.

00:18:20.626 --> 00:18:22.250
You're breaking down
a lot of barriers.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.220
There's no-- Nithya also
talked about minding the gap.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.860
This is a great way to come
on the same level as them

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.950
and make them feel
useful and familiar.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.450
You're no longer
the interviewer.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.170
You're going through
the story together.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.160
And you can really hear
it from their perspective.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.870
And, of course, if after
doing this for five times,

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.730
you realize something is really,
really wrong with your story,

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.460
just untape it, stick a
few other screens in there,

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.590
and you have a new
iteration on your concept.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.890
And you can do the next five
sessions with that version.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.070
So it's really
cheap, really fast.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.200
Why should you use it?

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.730
I think I talked to a
lot about these things.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.470
When you're still in
your wireframing stage,

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.410
you don't have your app ready.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.970
You don't have
your product ready.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.320
This is a really good way
to get that early feedback.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.530
It's really good for simulating
loading states because of all

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.480
the visuals that you can use.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.680
You don't have to have deeply
complex interactions quoted up

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.917
to get responses to-- imagine
you had to wait for 10 minutes.

00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:22.000
You don't have to get them
to wait for 10 minutes.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.520
You can just have that
be part of your story

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.900
that you're telling
to each other.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.500
And it really allows your
users to feel comfortable

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.320
with the medium, which is paper.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.190
It's tactile.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.180
It's familiar.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:37.560
And it's not overwhelming, like
technology can be sometimes.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.880
I think a bunch of you
have the scroll sheet.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.180
So if you have it and your
neighbor doesn't, please

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:42.710
exchange.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:47.110
And this is a good way to find
out who is sitting next to you.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.530
Immersives.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.030
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN:
So immersives are

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.800
activities to understand
the local experience.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.020
Often, when we travel to
a country to do research,

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.480
it's very easy to stay within
the comfort zone of a 5 star

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:05.790
hotel or a nice taxi ride
or just doing the things

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.550
that we're familiar
and comfortable with.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:13.500
Immersives are activities that
are planned around experiencing

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.760
the local point of view
where it's not necessarily

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.030
about an interview
or a conversation

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.230
with a participant, but it
is about using the researcher

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.750
as the instrument for research
and talking about one's

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.530
own felt experiences.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.480
When should you use immersives?

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.240
Use it every time you
go into the field.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.740
Step out of the office
and try to plan activities

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.010
that you can do on
your own or as a team.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.550
Use it to complement
participant research.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.400
You may get very
different points of view

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.140
when you experience
things for yourself.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.810
Use it as a team to understand
various perspectives.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.980
Each of us, in a product
team, brings together

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.130
our own values and
backgrounds and biases

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.710
and the way we see the world.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:04.620
And, often, this is
a good way to go on

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.000
to participate in an
activity together and talk

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.620
about it and exchange notes on
how you felt and experienced.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.520
Why should you do it?

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.250
You avoid parachuting
into a particular context

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.160
and gathering only
a few data points

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.530
and thinking that you
have the entire story.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.110
Often, the story is
outside of the four walls.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.480
So immersives help
us understand what

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.970
the larger cultural
and social context is.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.610
And our assumptions
and hypotheses

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.720
get challenged or validated.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.570
To build a product, we go
in with certain propositions

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.120
and assumptions.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.330
And immersives
help us participate

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:48.980
in the local activities to
know if it makes sense or not.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.400
So steps to immerse
yourself, one

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.350
is to identify activities that
are relevant for your product.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.590
For example, if you are
building a payment system,

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.330
you may want to go
into the marketplace

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.490
and buy a few things and bargain
and see how that whole offline

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.770
process of payments works.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:09.520
If you're building a
mobile application,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.090
you may want to go into a
mobile shop, purchase a phone,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.780
have the mobile seller
set it up for you,

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.930
top it up with mobile data,
and load a few applications

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:25.070
to understand really how that
particular community interfaces

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.830
with mobile phones
for the first time.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.420
Or go to a cyber cafe to
understand how internet

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.300
is used in public places.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.320
And the role of a social
agent in the cyber cafe

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.710
owner in educating their
customers on how to set up

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.450
an account for the first time.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.400
Engage with your local team
for advice, or local experts

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.680
or people from a
particular country,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.870
and really try to avoid
the touristy things.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.940
The goal here is to understand
the everyday, mundane

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.500
experiences of the
community that you're

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.490
trying to work with.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.220
And this may mean
taking public transport

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.190
or do what the-- in
order to understand

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.390
what people do when
they're waiting for a bus

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.680
or when they're in a crowd
versus when they have

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.070
a seat on the bus, and they
get to relax and take out

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.570
their phone.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:21.580
So try to go local when you
go into a particular context.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.550
Try to get out of
your comfort zone.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:26.360
And this might mean
buying a local phone,

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.930
setting it up with a local SIM
card and a local data plan.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.360
Some of the spaces
and activities

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:38.240
that are highly insightful are
marketplaces, religious sites,

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.260
where you can see how
communities come together

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.610
and what their values are,
bus rides, local sports,

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:47.210
getting your hair
done, and so on.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.270
So step 2 is to allow
time to acclimatize.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.940
For any international
research trip

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.520
there is jet lag in travel.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.940
So account for that.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.440
Different people
respond differently

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.460
to stress in the field.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.550
And field work is really
tiring and challenging,

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.600
as exhilarating as it can be.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.490
So account for that.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.870
Understand how your team members
respond to stress and plan

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.480
activities around that.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.350
Safety first.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.450
And balance work with fun.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.040
It's important to take
breaks in the field

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:27.930
and step away for some time
in order to regain your lens.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:33.850
So in your handouts,
you have all the steps.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:35.514
And back to Nipa.

00:24:35.514 --> 00:24:36.430
NIBHA JAIN: All right.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:41.450
So this is our fourth and final
research tool, clickthroughs.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.652
And again, I'm in charge of
all the literal methods here.

00:24:44.652 --> 00:24:46.610
Clickthroughs are exactly
what they sound like.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.854
It's a bunch of images
put in a serial order.

00:24:49.854 --> 00:24:51.520
Have you guys used
clickthroughs before?

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.510
Raise your hand if
you've used one.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.010
Excellent.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:54.510
OK.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.680
So this is basically
a low fidelity version

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.310
of what we are used to here.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:02.220
It's a collection of images
put in a serial order.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.000
And you put them on your
phone, and you're ready to go.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.090
It gives you an
illusion of progress

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.320
because when you
tap on one image,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.310
it goes to the next
image naturally.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.942
So you can imagine that
you're clicking on a button,

00:25:14.942 --> 00:25:16.650
and that's taking you
to the next screen.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.160
But it's just the
program progressing

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.940
through static images.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.030
When should you use it?

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.630
Again, while you're waiting
for the actual product

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.900
to be coded and
programmed, you can

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.100
go in with early
wireframes or low fidelity

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.392
mocks or high fidelity mocks.

00:25:35.392 --> 00:25:36.850
So this is something
that you would

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.790
use towards the [INAUDIBLE]
end of your product development

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:41.750
cycle when you're ready
to go, but you're still

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.100
waiting for those final
interactions to come in.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.430
More importantly, the
version that we're

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.880
going to share with
you today is about not

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.120
relying on the internet.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.380
So this works
completely offline.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.450
You can use it wherever and
on whichever devices you like.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.300
So a lot of times,
you will encounter

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.940
forms that are on
all GMS calls or have

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.940
outdated versions
of whatever it is

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.700
that you were trying to test.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.150
You'll just find
ridiculous things

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:12.358
when you go out in the field.

00:26:12.358 --> 00:26:14.560
And this will overcome
any of those things

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:20.100
because phones-- all phones
have photo galleries,

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.812
and so you can work with that.

00:26:21.812 --> 00:26:23.270
This is something
that you will use

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.310
to make it more real
than it actually is.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.950
So you can do a lot of amazing
smoke and mirror techniques

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.880
because you're basically
creating an illusion of control

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.210
and progression without having
to code any of those buttons

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.230
in.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:42.110
Again, start with the tasks
that you want to test.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.530
Make up the rough
screens that you

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.520
want to depict in that task.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.956
In what order
should they appear?

00:26:47.956 --> 00:26:49.580
And if you're working
on slides, you're

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.462
working on Illustrator,
Sketch, whatever

00:26:52.462 --> 00:26:54.670
is the program of your choice
where you're developing

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.040
your screens, you
take screenshots

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.680
that would be the exact
same size of the phone

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.060
or it matches the
phone size so that it

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.280
looks like a live
screen on the phone.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.380
Once you've got all your
screenshots in place,

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.252
rename those in
the right order so

00:27:08.252 --> 00:27:09.710
that they appear
in the right order

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.084
when you have them
on your phone.

00:27:11.084 --> 00:27:12.982
So you can go
Homepage, screen 1.

00:27:12.982 --> 00:27:14.690
When I click on the
tab, that's screen 2.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.640
When it shows up a search
button, that's screen 3.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.750
Whatever is the progression,
rename it accordingly.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.825
And then get your
images onto your phone.

00:27:25.825 --> 00:27:26.700
Get into the gallery.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.950
Find that folder.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.130
Click on the first image.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.260
Put it in full screen mode, and
your prototype is ready to go.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.640
Of course, for a lot of
these participants-- and you

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.850
can also, of course,
use something

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.970
like a peer-to-peer sharing
app, like SHAREit or Xender

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.870
and put it on your
participant's phone.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.480
So they get a really good
first-hand experience of,

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.680
imagine this app
was on your phone.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.280
And that's a very
different response

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.990
that you would get from,
hey, on my Nexus 6,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.040
this looks like this.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:52.880
What do you think?

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.570
And they've never seen
a screen that size.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.060
So this makes it
really versatile.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.500
And once you are with them, you
can set the expectations of,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.240
hey, when you click,
it'll go to the next one.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.890
So before you click
on it, tell me

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.265
what you think is
happening here.

00:28:07.265 --> 00:28:08.890
And then what do you
expect will happen

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.240
when you click on this button?

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.034
And then you progress
through the next one.

00:28:13.034 --> 00:28:14.950
So you manage their
expectations a little bit,

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.910
and then you basically
hand it over.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:20.981
And it's also really easy to
do this for feedback collection

00:28:20.981 --> 00:28:23.480
because you already know what
were the screens that you were

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.850
testing, so you can
summarize all your findings

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.240
at the end of that day.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.710
You say, on screen 1, we
found these things were great.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.307
These are the things
that we need fix.

00:28:31.307 --> 00:28:33.390
And on screen 2, people
were really confused about

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.390
what was happening.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.830
We really need to go back and
look at that problem again.

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:42.810
So this is our summary of an
offline clickthrough prototype

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:47.650
using a phone gallery.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.140
So if you have
comments, thoughts,

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.450
do tag them with
hashtag #EMpathy.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:54.350
All right.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.950
Thank you.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.408
NITHYA SAMBASIVAN:
Thank you, guys.

00:28:56.408 --> 00:28:59.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:05.200
