00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:01.860
- [Voiceover] So imagine
you've got an object

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.247
sitting in front of this concave mirror.

00:00:04.247 --> 00:00:07.035
If you wanted to figure out
where the image is formed,

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:08.583
you can draw ray tracings.

00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:10.227
And so one ray you can draw

00:00:10.227 --> 00:00:12.747
is a parallel ray that goes
through the focal point.

00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:14.234
But these rays are reversible.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:15.811
I don't have to draw that one.

00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.149
Turns out, if you send rays
back along the way they came,

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:22.036
they'll just retrace the path
they came along the other way.

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:23.489
So these rays are reversible.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.306
I send a ray parallel, it gets
sent through the focal point.

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:28.223
But if I send a ray
through the focal point,

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:30.070
it will get sent parallel.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.904
In other words, I don't
have to draw this ray.

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:33.603
I can draw this ray right here.

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:34.561
The one that goes

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.607
from the tip of the object
through the focal point.

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:38.281
That's gonna get sent parallel.

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.190
So I'm gonna draw this one just for fun

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.213
and then I'm gonna draw another one.

00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:44.088
You need two in order to
find where the image is.

00:00:44.088 --> 00:00:45.248
I'll draw this one here.

00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:48.249
So this white line is
called the principal axis.

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.148
It's drawn through the
center of this curved mirror.

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:53.354
I'm gonna draw a ray that goes
from the tip of the object

00:00:53.354 --> 00:00:54.820
to that center point

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.859
because I know the law of reflection

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.270
says that the angle in has
to equal the angle out.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.319
And the angles are measured
form the normal line

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.594
and it just so happens
that this principal axis

00:01:04.594 --> 00:01:06.445
that's usually drawn here anyways,

00:01:06.445 --> 00:01:08.755
is serving as a perfectly good normal line

00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:10.478
for this center of the mirror

00:01:10.478 --> 00:01:12.667
since it's passing through
that center of the mirror

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.179
in a perpendicular way.

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:15.422
I can just use that to my advantage.

00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:17.604
I know that the angle in's
gotta equal the angle out.

00:01:17.604 --> 00:01:19.599
I just have to make
sure that this angle out

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.421
is about, looks like that,

00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.072
about equal to the angle
that it came in at.

00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:26.222
So these two have to be
the same angle theta.

00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:28.221
And now I can find where my image is.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.041
The image of this object is gonna be

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:31.870
at the point where they cross.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.970
So the tip of this object

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.364
gets mapped to this point right here

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:37.270
and we get an image that's upside down

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.283
and it looks like that.

00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:41.446
So ray tracing is cool; it lets
you find where the image is.

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:44.216
But I mean I just kinda
eyeballed this angle here.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:45.938
This might have been off by a little bit.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.971
It might have been off by a degree or two.

00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:50.342
If I wanted to get exactly
where the image is,

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:52.940
I'd want an equation that
I could just plug into.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.062
In other words, that I could plug into

00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:57.410
how far was the object from the mirror,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.442
and how long is this focal length,

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:02.311
and it would spit out exactly
where the image is gonna be.

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.068
So that's what we're gonna
derive in this video.

00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:06.344
It's called the mirror equation

00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:09.107
and it'll tell us how to
relate the object distance,

00:02:09.107 --> 00:02:11.189
the image distance, and the focal length.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:12.022
So let's do this.

00:02:12.022 --> 00:02:13.007
How do you derive it?

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.330
If you look in the textbook,
it looks complicated.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.188
It's not actually as bad as it looks.

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:19.001
When I used to look at the first time,

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:21.653
I was like, "This is some sort
of mathematical witchcraft

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:22.805
"I don't want to deal with."

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:24.581
But it's not nearly as bad as it looks.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:26.096
We're gonna start with drawing triangles.

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:28.915
So we'll notice that these
two angles are the same.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.156
We're gonna use this to our advantage.

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:32.712
So we're gonna make two triangles

00:02:32.712 --> 00:02:35.712
that have these as one of their angles.

00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:37.632
So the first one, let's consider this one.

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:39.098
Let's say one of the triangles will be

00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:41.963
from the base of this image
to the center of the mirror,

00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:45.089
and then from the mirror
to the tip of the image,

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:46.388
and then from the tip of the image

00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:48.622
back down to the base of the image.

00:02:48.622 --> 00:02:50.503
So imagine this pink triangle right here,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.770
it's a right triangle

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.155
'cause that angle right
here is a right angle,

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:56.298
and it's got theta as one of its angles.

00:02:56.298 --> 00:02:57.714
But I could draw another triangle

00:02:57.714 --> 00:02:59.351
that has this angle theta.

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:01.232
I can go from the tip of the object

00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:02.871
to the center of the mirror,

00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:03.956
and then from the center of the mirror

00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:05.385
to the base of the object,

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.495
and then from the base of the object

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:09.445
to the tip of the object and
I get this blue triangle.

00:03:09.445 --> 00:03:11.138
That's also a right triangle

00:03:11.138 --> 00:03:13.249
since this angle here is a right angle.

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:15.670
So in other words, these
triangles are similar.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.264
They both have an angle theta,

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:18.711
they both have a right angle.

00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:21.002
Or in other words, if you
don't like similar triangles,

00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:22.220
just think about it this way.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.361
You could use a trig function.

00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:24.816
Pick your favorite trig function.

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:25.880
I'm gonna pick tangent.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.261
So let's take tangent theta.

00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:28.871
I know tangent theta by definition

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.540
is always the opposite over the adjacent.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.056
The opposite to this angle,

00:03:33.056 --> 00:03:35.331
we'll take this angle down here first,

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:38.049
the opposite to that theta is this side.

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.406
What does that side mean?

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:40.803
That's the height of the image.

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:43.600
So I'm gonna call that
"hi" for image height.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.298
That's how tall the image is.

00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:47.623
So I know that this is gonna
equal height of the image

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:51.109
divided by the adjacent
side to this angle here

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.626
is this distance right here

00:03:52.626 --> 00:03:54.078
and we're gonna give that a name.

00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:56.694
That's just how far the
image is from the mirror.

00:03:56.694 --> 00:03:57.527
So we give this a name,

00:03:57.527 --> 00:04:00.610
we call this distance from
the mirror to the image,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.296
we call that the image distance.

00:04:02.296 --> 00:04:05.121
And it's measured from
the center of the mirror.

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:08.084
So not from this end right
here, this little tip part,

00:04:08.084 --> 00:04:10.880
but from wherever the
center of the mirror is.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.973
It's measured from this point right here.

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:15.608
And that's this adjacent
side since this is

00:04:15.608 --> 00:04:18.124
how far that image is from
the center of the mirror,

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:21.529
so I'll call that "di" since
it's the image distance.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.301
But that was for this theta down here.

00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:26.458
I know that tangent of theta,
this is also a theta up here.

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:28.651
I can use the same
relationship for this theta.

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:30.338
And I know that tangent of this theta

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:33.040
also has to be opposite over adjacent,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.224
but the opposite of this
theta is this side right here.

00:04:36.224 --> 00:04:37.422
And what is that side?

00:04:37.422 --> 00:04:39.907
That's just the height of the object.

00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:41.335
So I'll call that "ho".

00:04:41.335 --> 00:04:42.590
That's the object height,

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.984
so the opposite side for this
theta is the object height.

00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:47.429
And then you divide by what?

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:49.153
You divide by the adjacent side.

00:04:49.153 --> 00:04:50.397
That's just gonna be this distance

00:04:50.397 --> 00:04:51.933
from the mirror to the object.

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:53.184
We'll give that a name,

00:04:53.184 --> 00:04:55.949
and if you guessed object
distance, then you guessed right.

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.674
This is gonna be the object distance.

00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:00.923
And again we measure it from
the center of the mirror,

00:05:00.923 --> 00:05:03.713
not some curved portion
that sticks out over here,

00:05:03.713 --> 00:05:06.298
but from the center part of the mirror.

00:05:06.298 --> 00:05:09.418
So that's the adjacent side
to this theta down here,

00:05:09.418 --> 00:05:11.208
so I'm gonna write that as "do".

00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:13.007
And so this is an important relationship.

00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:15.920
This is actually given
a name just by itself.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.923
This isn't the equation we're hunting for,

00:05:17.923 --> 00:05:19.886
but it's so important
it gets its own name.

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.967
Just part of this derivation
gets its own name.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:24.007
It's called the magnification equation

00:05:24.007 --> 00:05:25.504
but it's usually not written this way.

00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:29.099
People usually write it as hi
and then they divide by ho.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.371
So you get hi divided by ho equals,

00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:34.470
and then you multiply both sides by di,

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.586
you get di over do.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:39.280
So a lot of times this is called
the magnification equation.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.798
It gives you a way to find what
the height of the image is.

00:05:41.798 --> 00:05:43.341
So we were lookin' for a way to find

00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:45.356
how far the image is from the mirror,

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:46.838
but this lets you figure out, okay,

00:05:46.838 --> 00:05:48.869
you also need to know
how big is it gonna be?

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:50.847
So if we solve this height of the image,

00:05:50.847 --> 00:05:52.130
we get the height of the image is

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.772
the height of the object
times some factor,

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:56.275
and that factor's just gonna be

00:05:56.275 --> 00:05:59.640
the image distance divided
by the object distance.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.473
Here's the thing, though.

00:06:00.473 --> 00:06:01.306
Look at.

00:06:01.306 --> 00:06:02.575
This image got flipped over.

00:06:02.575 --> 00:06:05.289
So if we define this
image distance as positive

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.413
if it's on the same side as the object,

00:06:07.413 --> 00:06:09.341
we get a flipped over image,

00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:10.568
that'd be like a negative height.

00:06:10.568 --> 00:06:11.925
So since we want to represent

00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:14.209
flipped over images with a negative value,

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:16.157
we actually write this equation down

00:06:16.157 --> 00:06:17.615
with a negative inside of here.

00:06:17.615 --> 00:06:18.817
We say that the height of the image

00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:22.215
is equal to negative ho, di over do,

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.723
or you could put the
negative up here, too.

00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:25.418
So we stick a negative over here.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.886
That way we know that if you get

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:28.318
a negative value for the image height,

00:06:28.318 --> 00:06:29.870
you know it's flipped over.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.703
So in other words,

00:06:30.703 --> 00:06:34.815
if the value I got for hi was
negative three centimeters,

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:36.098
that means I'd get an image

00:06:36.098 --> 00:06:38.008
that had a height of three centimeters,

00:06:38.008 --> 00:06:39.185
but it'd be flipped over

00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:40.802
and that's what the negative represents.

00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:42.257
Okay, so that's kind of a side note.

00:06:42.257 --> 00:06:44.111
This is not what we're trying to derive.

00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:45.110
We're trying to derive a formula

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.086
that would give us the image distance

00:06:47.086 --> 00:06:49.619
based on object distance and focal length.

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:51.602
So we need to do another set of triangles.

00:06:51.602 --> 00:06:52.435
What we'll do now

00:06:52.435 --> 00:06:54.595
is instead of considering
these thetas here,

00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:56.332
we'll consider these angles here.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:57.692
Now I can't call them theta

00:06:57.692 --> 00:06:59.430
'cause we already called those theta,

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.714
so I'll call these phi.

00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:02.850
So these angles also have to be the same

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.519
because any time you have a line

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:06.297
and then you cut another line through it,

00:07:06.297 --> 00:07:08.679
these angles here will always be the same.

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:09.722
So we could do the same game.

00:07:09.722 --> 00:07:11.840
We could play the same
game we played for theta

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.250
with these phis.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.783
We'll form two triangles,

00:07:14.783 --> 00:07:17.765
each triangle's gonna have
phi as one of the angles.

00:07:17.765 --> 00:07:18.723
So for the first one,

00:07:18.723 --> 00:07:21.361
we'll do this object height as one side

00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:23.099
over here to the base of phi

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:24.727
and then back up over to here.

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:25.560
And then for the other one

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.744
we need to also have a
triangle that has phi in it,

00:07:27.744 --> 00:07:29.866
so we'll do this from here to here,

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.786
down to there, and then back up to phi.

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:34.065
So we've got two triangles.

00:07:34.065 --> 00:07:36.510
This triangle and this triangle,

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.009
and they both have phi and
they both have a right angle.

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:40.905
So these are also similar triangles.

00:07:40.905 --> 00:07:42.927
In other words, we'll play the same game.

00:07:42.927 --> 00:07:45.321
We'll say that tangent of this phi

00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:48.126
is gonna have to equal the
opposite over the adjacent.

00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:51.964
The opposite to this phi is
this side which is just ho.

00:07:51.964 --> 00:07:54.354
So we can write ho divided by

00:07:54.354 --> 00:07:56.710
the adjacent now is not do,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.595
'cause this side only goes to here.

00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:01.071
It doesn't go the whole way to the mirror.

00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:03.075
It only goes that far.

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:05.223
So that's the entire object distance

00:08:05.223 --> 00:08:07.764
minus this piece right over here.

00:08:07.764 --> 00:08:11.577
So if I subtracted this much
from the object distance,

00:08:11.577 --> 00:08:13.156
I'd get the remaining amount

00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:15.576
which is the adjacent
part of this triangle.

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:17.137
So this distance from the mirror

00:08:17.137 --> 00:08:19.351
to the focal point is given a name.

00:08:19.351 --> 00:08:22.305
It's called the focal length
and we represent it with an f.

00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:23.138
So a little confusing

00:08:23.138 --> 00:08:25.245
'cause f represents both a point

00:08:25.245 --> 00:08:28.394
and it represents the length
from the mirror to that point.

00:08:28.394 --> 00:08:30.842
So f is gonna represent
that length as well.

00:08:30.842 --> 00:08:33.371
So this adjacent side we could write as

00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:36.659
the object distance minus the focal length

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.106
since this remaining part right here

00:08:39.106 --> 00:08:40.323
is the adjacent side

00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:42.638
which is object distance
minus the focal length.

00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:45.520
But we know that this phi
is also equal to this phi.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.654
So I can do tangent of theta for this phi,

00:08:47.654 --> 00:08:49.967
the opposite side would now be this side.

00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:50.848
What is that?

00:08:50.848 --> 00:08:52.557
What is this side of the triangle?

00:08:52.557 --> 00:08:54.710
That's just equal to
the height of the image.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.068
This side is the same as the image height

00:08:57.068 --> 00:08:59.510
so I can say that this
whole thing, tangent of phi,

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.014
has to equal opposite over adjacent.

00:09:01.014 --> 00:09:03.881
This time the opposite of
phi is the image height.

00:09:03.881 --> 00:09:06.507
And we divide by this distance right here,

00:09:06.507 --> 00:09:08.152
which is just the focal length.

00:09:08.152 --> 00:09:11.046
So this adjacent side for this triangle

00:09:11.046 --> 00:09:13.331
is simply the focal length.

00:09:13.331 --> 00:09:14.860
So I'll just divide by f

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.024
and so what I've got are two equations

00:09:17.024 --> 00:09:18.161
that I'm gonna put together

00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:20.860
and we will get the mirror
equation out of this.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.182
There's different ways
to proceed at this point.

00:09:23.182 --> 00:09:24.205
What I'm gonna do is

00:09:24.205 --> 00:09:27.041
I don't want ho or hi in either of these,

00:09:27.041 --> 00:09:30.795
so I'm just gonna solve this
one here for ho over hi.

00:09:30.795 --> 00:09:33.253
And I get ho over hi,

00:09:33.253 --> 00:09:35.811
so imagine dividing both sides by hi,

00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:38.623
and then multiplying
both sides by do minus f,

00:09:38.623 --> 00:09:42.983
and I'd get ho over hi equals do minus f,

00:09:42.983 --> 00:09:43.816
the focal length,

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.441
divided by the focal length.

00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:46.694
But I could do the same thing up here.

00:09:46.694 --> 00:09:48.679
I can get ho over hi.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:51.422
It's just gonna equal do over di.

00:09:51.422 --> 00:09:54.381
So that's all you have to do
is divide both sides by hi

00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:56.894
and then multiply both sides by do.

00:09:56.894 --> 00:09:58.814
But this left-hand side right here

00:09:58.814 --> 00:10:01.322
is the same as this
left-hand side right here.

00:10:01.322 --> 00:10:03.053
So we know that ho over hi

00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:05.786
already equals do minus f over f,

00:10:05.786 --> 00:10:09.806
and up here we know that ho
over hi equals do over di,

00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:12.388
so that means that do minus f over f

00:10:12.388 --> 00:10:15.834
has to also equal do over di

00:10:15.834 --> 00:10:19.821
since both of these
expressions equal ho over hi.

00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:21.121
So we can set them all equal

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.889
'cause they're all
equal to the same thing:

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:24.440
ho over hi.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.135
And now we're gonna solve this.

00:10:26.135 --> 00:10:27.270
We're just gonna clean it up.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.008
The left-hand side I can write,

00:10:29.008 --> 00:10:30.481
I'll just stop using colors here,

00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:34.922
the left-hand side is gonna
be do over f minus one,

00:10:34.922 --> 00:10:37.701
since f over f just equals one.

00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:40.320
And that's gotta equal do over di.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.277
And now we can divide both sides by do.

00:10:43.277 --> 00:10:46.251
If I divide both sides
by do I get one over f,

00:10:46.251 --> 00:10:47.790
since the do cancels,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.755
minus one over do equals,

00:10:50.755 --> 00:10:53.576
and then the do will
cancel with this do on top,

00:10:53.576 --> 00:10:55.427
and I just get one over di.

00:10:55.427 --> 00:10:57.981
And now we made it except
it's usually written

00:10:57.981 --> 00:11:00.566
with this one over do added on the right.

00:11:00.566 --> 00:11:02.746
If we add one over do to both sides,

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:04.656
we finally get the expression we wanted,

00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:07.636
which is one over the object distance,

00:11:07.636 --> 00:11:10.828
plus one over the image distance,

00:11:10.828 --> 00:11:13.786
equals one over the focal length.

00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:15.570
It's a pretty simple formula.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.925
It took a little bit of
effort to get to this,

00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:21.130
but this is called the mirror equation

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.666
and it relates the focal
length of the mirror

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:26.126
to the image distance
and the object distance.

00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:26.959
In other words,

00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:29.554
if you now how far you put
the object from the mirror,

00:11:29.554 --> 00:11:31.321
and you know the focal
length of the mirror,

00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:35.126
that lets you figure out exactly
where the image distance is

00:11:35.126 --> 00:11:38.583
instead of just kinda eyeballing
it and using a protractor.

00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:41.461
This'll let you solve for
where that image is exactly.

00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:42.438
And if you couple it

00:11:42.438 --> 00:11:44.800
with this magnification equation up here,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.620
you can also figure out the
exact height of the image.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.963
Now you might be feeling a little sketchy

00:11:48.963 --> 00:11:50.125
about this negative sign.

00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:51.811
I mean I kinda threw
it in quick over here.

00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.438
What's going on with this negative?

00:11:53.438 --> 00:11:54.952
In fact how do we know
if any of this stuff

00:11:54.952 --> 00:11:56.290
is negative or positive?

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.188
Well the convention that I use,

00:11:58.188 --> 00:11:59.856
that a lot of textbooks use now,

00:11:59.856 --> 00:12:01.236
is the one where

00:12:01.236 --> 00:12:04.664
focal lengths will be
positive for concave mirrors,

00:12:04.664 --> 00:12:07.375
just like this mirror right
here, this is a concave mirror.

00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:08.878
But if it was bent the other way,

00:12:08.878 --> 00:12:12.377
if the mirror looked like
this, it'd be a convex mirror,

00:12:12.377 --> 00:12:14.232
and that would be a negative focal length.

00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:16.736
And it kinda makes sense if
the mirror was bent this way,

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.727
the focal point is kinda back this way

00:12:18.727 --> 00:12:19.843
which is kinda behind it,

00:12:19.843 --> 00:12:21.573
so it makes sense that
it's sort of negative.

00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:23.337
And the object distance over here,

00:12:23.337 --> 00:12:24.991
if it's on the same side as your eye,

00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:26.276
if you're using this correctly,

00:12:26.276 --> 00:12:28.198
your eye should be over on this side,

00:12:28.198 --> 00:12:30.090
you would see an object right here

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.642
but you'd also see an image
of that object right here.

00:12:32.642 --> 00:12:34.702
And if this object is on the same side

00:12:34.702 --> 00:12:36.502
as the mirror as your
eye, which it should be,

00:12:36.502 --> 00:12:38.496
then this object distance is positive.

00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:40.077
It's basically always positive

00:12:40.077 --> 00:12:42.237
unless you've got some
double set of mirrors

00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:43.509
or something weird happening.

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:46.141
If you got a single mirror,
there's no craziness goin' on,

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:49.605
this object distance is just
always defined to be positive

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:51.651
using the convention
that we're using up here.

00:12:51.651 --> 00:12:54.047
And again, there are other
conventions you can use.

00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:56.864
But this is the one used in a
lot of textbooks these days.

00:12:56.864 --> 00:12:58.707
The di is a little trickier.

00:12:58.707 --> 00:13:01.384
The di is also positive if

00:13:01.384 --> 00:13:03.774
that image is on the
same side as your eye,

00:13:03.774 --> 00:13:04.791
like it is right here.

00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:05.932
So this image

00:13:05.932 --> 00:13:08.226
would be considered a
positive image distance

00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:09.708
since it's on this side.

00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:12.693
If the image got formed on
this side of the mirror,

00:13:12.693 --> 00:13:14.255
say you formed an image right here,

00:13:14.255 --> 00:13:15.970
that would be a negative image distance.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.374
If this was five centimeters
behind the mirror,

00:13:18.374 --> 00:13:19.237
we'd consider that

00:13:19.237 --> 00:13:22.035
a negative five centimeter image distance.

00:13:22.035 --> 00:13:25.498
And if you use that convention
with this mirror equation,

00:13:25.498 --> 00:13:27.122
you'll get a correct relationship

00:13:27.122 --> 00:13:28.416
between the object distance,

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:30.119
image distance, and the focal length.

00:13:30.119 --> 00:13:32.187
And if you use that same sign convention

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.379
with this magnification equation,

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:36.613
you'll also get the
exact height of the image

00:13:36.613 --> 00:13:38.517
and if that image height
comes out negative,

00:13:38.517 --> 00:13:40.248
you'll know that it got
flipped upside down.

00:13:40.248 --> 00:13:41.980
And if the image height
comes out positive,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.277
you know that the image
will stay right-side up.

00:13:44.277 --> 00:13:47.285
So recapping, using a
bunch of similar triangles,

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.452
we were able to derive a mirror equation

00:13:49.452 --> 00:13:51.218
that relates the object distance,

00:13:51.218 --> 00:13:53.015
image distance, and focal length,

00:13:53.015 --> 00:13:56.084
and along the way we derived
a magnification equation

00:13:56.084 --> 00:13:58.710
that relates the heights
of the image and object

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.877
to the distances of the image and object.

00:14:00.877 --> 00:14:02.923
And you have to be very
careful with signs.

00:14:02.923 --> 00:14:04.415
Even though the object distance

00:14:04.415 --> 00:14:06.205
is basically always positive,

00:14:06.205 --> 00:14:08.710
focal length can be positive or negative.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:11.618
Focal length will be
positive for concave mirrors,

00:14:11.618 --> 00:14:14.094
and it'll be negative for convex mirrors.

00:14:14.094 --> 00:14:15.864
Image distances will be positive

00:14:15.864 --> 00:14:18.835
if they're on the same side
of the mirror as your eye,

00:14:18.835 --> 00:14:20.192
if they're in front of the mirror.

00:14:20.192 --> 00:14:22.579
But they'll be negative if
they're behind the mirror.

00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:23.469
And again this is not

00:14:23.469 --> 00:14:25.636
the only sign convention you could use,

00:14:25.636 --> 00:14:27.995
but it's as good as any
other sign convention

00:14:27.995 --> 00:14:31.371
and it's the one used in a
lot of textbooks these days.
