00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.523
[inaudible]

2
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.370
<v 1>what do I do when I feel unfocused or overwhelmed?</v>

3
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.480
There are a few things. Uh, first I have a short checklist.

4
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.610
Am I eating enough? All right,

5
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.080
so it's very fashionable with intermittent fasting to skip breakfast,

6
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:32.750
skip that meal, skip another meal for myself,

7
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:37.751
I've realized in less I am in ketosis unless I'm on a ketogenic diet or fasting

8
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.200
or have ketones in my blood, which is an alternative fuel to glucose,

9
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.940
I need to eat. And uh, of course you can supplement with exotic in as ketones.

10
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:48.860
But am I eating enough?

11
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.430
If I skip breakfast and it's 1:00 PM and I haven't had lunch and I'm feeling

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.750
unfocused or overwhelmed,

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.410
I probably don't need to sit there and journal on my existential dilemmas.

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.330
I need to eat some fucking macadamia nuts and maybe have some beans or salad or

15
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:05.350
something like that. All right? So simple, simple, simple. Uh,

16
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.680
the second would be am I consuming too much caffeine?

17
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.510
Real simple for me. If I'm feeling anxious, overwhelmed,

18
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.930
very often if I want to achieve a more zen-like state,

19
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.880
there are at least two things I can do. And one is meditate twice a day,

20
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.890
which I like to do. Doesn't always happen.

21
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:29.000
Meditate twice a day and do all of these other things related to cultivating

22
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.870
peace of mind. The second one is stop consuming so much caffeine.

23
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.750
All right, real, real, real simple.

24
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.500
Then last are a few tactical and strategic questions and being overwhelmed and

25
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:44.870
unfocused I think are quite different things. Typically,

26
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.560
sometimes they come along together, they're two questions, uh,

27
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.310
or I should say two pairs or groups of questions that I use a lot.

28
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:57.311
The first one is an 80 20 analysis and there are two questions as part of them

29
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.880
and I put this on paper always on paper because I want to trap my thoughts on

30
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:05.240
paper to see if they hold any weight to see if there's any insight to see what

31
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.020
is ridiculous.

32
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.500
Maybe I have worries that once I put them down or really unfounded and kind of

33
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.690
ludicrous. First question is,

34
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.020
what are the 20% of activities or people that are producing 80% or more of the

35
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:23.870
results and positive emotional states that I want?

36
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.770
The positive emotional states part is really important. All right,

37
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.510
so you spend one or two pages on that. The second part is the opposite.

38
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.030
What are the 20% of activities,

39
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.640
responsibilities or people that are producing 80% or more of the pain,

40
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.720
the headache and the negative emotional states that I would prefer not to have

41
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.050
do another page or two. And then the last question,

42
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.950
if you're engaged with a specific project or relationship,

43
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:57.260
could be anything really is very simple.

44
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.250
It's what would this look if it were easy?

45
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.720
And I think very much if we're type a personality, we've competed in school,

46
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.970
we've competed next, we've competed in Y and z.

47
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.400
We are trained by ourselves to believe that if we're not red lining,

48
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.460
if we're not overcome with effort,

49
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.640
that we're not doing a good job, we're not trying hard enough.

50
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:23.641
And I think that often leads us to seek complicated paths with many,

51
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.130
many moving pieces. So what would this look like if it were easy?

52
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.451
So for instance,

53
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.080
if I'm having trouble with a book and I have three months left to write it,

54
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.170
I'll ask myself, what would this look like if it were easy?

55
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:37.270
What if I had to finish this book in a week?

56
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.630
If I had a gun to my head or a gun to my dog's head or Molly and I had to save

57
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.510
Molly, what would I do? All right, you have a week. That's it, period.

58
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.560
How would you write this book? And that carrot gets rid of a lot of fluff.

59
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.700
And I start saying, all right,

60
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.930
well how could I use money instead of time to fix this problem?

61
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.640
How could I ask other people for help instead of trying to do it all myself in

62
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:03.790
this situation? What would this look like if it were easy?

63
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.860
And you can find a lot of gems that way and just expect 95% what you write down

64
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.240
is going to potentially be ludicrous and you should come up with the absurd,

65
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.610
right? Don't edit when you're putting stuff down.

66
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.780
But within that you might find one or two things and you're like, that's it.

67
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.420
Now I can say if 80% of my headache,

68
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.170
80% of my axed because I don't have to do it the hard way.

69
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.190
And then you can find an elegant solution that produces an even better product,

70
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:31.330
even better outcome.

71
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.170
So those are a few of the things that I regularly do when I'm feeling

72
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.160
overwhelmed or unfocused or distracted. Hey guys,

73
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.940
if you're enjoying the tips and tactics and how to on this channel or in the

74
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.230
podcast, the Tim Ferriss show, I made this for you, tribe of mentors,

75
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.610
short advice from the best in the world. This is the book that I wanted to read.

76
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:53.110
So I went out and I put it together,

77
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.300
created a dream list of 130 of the best at what they do.

78
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.110
People who are icons, legends and ask them all the same questions.

79
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:06.220
These are people in some cases I wanted to reach out to my whole life ranges

80
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:10.570
from many, many billionaires, cofounders of every company imaginable,

81
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.920
elite athletes ranging from surfing to tennis to power lifting. Everything else,

82
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.030
country stars, actors, directors, and you can spot the pattern.

83
00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:22.990
So some of my friends have said, this is the easiest to read,

84
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.990
most useful book that I've put together yet.

85
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.460
So checking out tribal mentors.com you can find sample chapters,

86
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:33.670
the whole list of mentors, everything, tribe, mentors.com.
