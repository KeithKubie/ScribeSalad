00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.410
COLEEN MURPHY: You
need to figure out

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.220
what makes you
excited and what's

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.130
going to make you come
into lab every day.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.290
I always want to come
into lab, because I

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.620
want to bother them and ask
them what they found out

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.210
while I was gone.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.910
That excites me.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.290
My name is Coleen Murphy.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.330
I'm a professor of genomics
and molecular biology

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.900
at Princeton University.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.800
You doing [? germine ?]
stuff today?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.180
[? SUBJECT 1: I'm ?] actually
doing that for [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.970
COLEEN MURPHY: The goal
of our research lab

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.570
is to try to understand what are
the molecular mechanisms that

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.660
underlie aging.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.020
We use a small laboratory
animal called C. elegans.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.650
So C. elegans is
this little worm.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.270
It's not scary.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.480
It's very tiny.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.440
And the reason we use it
is because 80% of its genes

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.000
are shared with humans.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.770
By working on a
problem like aging,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.480
there's also the hope that
we can help other people

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.130
down the road.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.850
SUBJECT 2: So I set up
the one, the first cross.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.680
And I'll be doing the
second cross tomorrow.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.000
COLEEN MURPHY: OK.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.620
SUBJECT 2: And then I am
setting up the first cross--

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.110
COLEEN MURPHY: I like to work
on a bunch of different things

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.980
at once.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.000
As anyone in the lab will tell
you, I like having-- we have,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.520
you know-- we counted
the other day.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.660
We have 20 ongoing projects.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.860
And while that can
be a lot to juggle,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.280
it really makes it interesting
to come into lab every day,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.830
and talk to my students, and
find out some new, cool thing

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.350
that they've found.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.430
So how's the analysis
going with the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.990
SUBJECT 3: I finished,
like, all of last week.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.410
And then because I'm
putting together the slides,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.730
Rachel said she would pick up.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.590
RACHEL AREY: She is a great role
model for female scientists.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.190
She kind of, in a way,
has it all, I guess.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.740
She has a family, she's
successful, she's great,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.400
and I just love working for her.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.270
I can't say enough
positive things about her.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.300
But she also really
fosters independence,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.260
which is important
for what we do,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.400
because my goal is to eventually
run my own laboratory.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.990
And she really lets me
think outside the box,

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.550
pursue whatever project
I'm interested in,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.410
and tells you to just
kind of run with it.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.910
And she's not afraid
of new things either.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.620
COLEEN MURPHY: It's
not a medical school.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.650
And so what this means for me
is that I can work on something

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.590
that seems somewhat
esoteric that eventually

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.760
leads back to public health.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.500
But you're not
being forced to do

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.260
something that has immediate,
really immediate practicality.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.720
And that is great,
because we never

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.310
would've ended up studying
the things that we do study

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.620
if that had been the
demand from the beginning.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.680
And so having that sort
of academic freedom

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.810
that you get at a
place like Princeton,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.800
where it's not a medical
school, I actually

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.810
think is really helpful
for ending up doing

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.320
medical research, in fact.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.220
And the students all come in
with various backgrounds, too.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.470
And so at this point, because
they develop the assays

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.050
they use-- it's a
little embarrassing,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.350
but they're the
experts in what we do.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.140
I have the big picture
idea, but they're

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.100
the ones who know how to
do every single thing.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.030
So when someone asks me how--
like, nit-picky questions,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.400
I always say, well, you need
to ask Rachel that question,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.360
because she knows
exactly how you do this.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.280
So they're the experts,
really, at this point.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.050
RACHEL AREY: --HG.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.630
INDIA ROGERS-SHEPP: Because I
just chunked the [? AWC. ?] And

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.140
the plate I wrote
on it was for--

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.260
RACHEL AREY: That one's it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.320
[?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.690
INDIA ROGERS SHEPP: My crown? ?]

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.550
RACHEL AREY: No,
it's right here.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.450
INDIA ROGERS-SHEPP: I remember
reading that, you know,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.750
there was someone
in Coleen's life

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.180
who really encouraged her to
take that next step further

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.590
to realize and fulfill
her self potential.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.920
And I think that she's done
the same with me by inviting

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.680
me to work in her lab.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.570
And I don't really
come from-- no one

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.870
in my family does anything
related to research.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.820
And I feel like
she's kind of helped

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.280
me realize, like,
this is something

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.640
that I could really see
myself doing in future years.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.220
It's something that
I've come to love.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.910
RACHEL AREY: She
really, I think,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.280
emphasizes work-life
balance a whole lot.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.510
And she does not, like, keep
us on a timetable, time clock.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.530
And she understands that you
need your time to do things.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.470
We have plenty of lab
members with families.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.960
And she totally
supports that and has

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.130
been nothing but supportive.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.330
COLEEN MURPHY: One of the
surprising things, I guess,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.070
about doing this job has
been how wonderful it

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.540
has been to be able to
have kids during this time.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.940
So a lot of women, I
think, talk themselves

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.130
out of doing science
or becoming professors

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.460
when they are in graduate
school or doing their postdoc.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.330
And in fact, actually,
it's a really flexible job.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.720
And so it's been pretty
reasonable to try

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.800
to do all of that at once.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.550
And so I just wanted
to convey-- because I

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.630
think women get a lot of
discouraging information.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.760
And I would like to convey
to the graduate students

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.530
and postdocs it actually really
is a reasonable path to take.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.970
And they should stay in science.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.970
INDIA ROGERS-SHEPP: [LAUGHS]

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.970
RACHEL AREY: I just set it up.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.470
INDIA ROGERS-SHEPP:
That's perfect.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.970
All right.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.390
COLEEN MURPHY: You know, being
excited about your question

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.870
is really the most
important thing.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.690
And it's hard.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.610
At the end of graduate
school, right, I always

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.220
tell the students, you
start in all excited,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.630
and then things start working
about your fourth year,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.550
and then you get tired
around your fifth year.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.780
And that's normal, right?

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.890
I always tell them that.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.350
But they shouldn't
get discouraged.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.720
And almost always, they have
a ton of data at that point.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.610
And you're almost, like, pushing
them out of the nest, right.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.470
They should be sick
of you, because it's

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.860
time for them to go elsewhere.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.900
It's part of the process.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.650
I hope that they always
retain this idea that there's

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.110
something fun to
study and there's just

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.960
something exciting.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.120
And that's what I mostly
want them to learn.
