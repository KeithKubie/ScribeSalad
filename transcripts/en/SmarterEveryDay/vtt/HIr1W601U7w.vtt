[music]

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.876
Hey it's me Destin,

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:03.208
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:05.313
So last year about this time I made a video

00:00:05.313 --> 00:00:07.407
on the Project For Awesome website asking you

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:09.646
to vote for an organization called Not Forgotten

00:00:09.646 --> 00:00:12.293
that's working to get sexually exploited children off the streets

00:00:12.293 --> 00:00:15.632
of Iquitos Peru, which is a majorly isolated city and a

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:16.825
hub for sex trafficking.

00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:20.027
Holy cow you people trust me because between the

00:00:20.027 --> 00:00:21.730
Project for Awesome and direct donations

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.919
over $78,000 were raised.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.775
That is a lot of money.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:29.401
We actually built an orphanage in the rainforest

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:30.628
and it is amazing.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:31.472
So here's what we're gonna do.

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:33.240
I'm gonna go show you everything we built

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.051
and if you feel that we're doing it right,

00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:36.837
if you feel like you can trust us,

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.479
I would ask you to support us again.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.453
But first, let me show you what we did,

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:41.741
cause it's awesome.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:42.531
Let's go.

00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:44.332
My buddy CJ and I have been working with Not Forgotten

00:00:44.332 --> 00:00:45.627
for several years now.

00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:49.111
Iquitos Peru is a city of 400,000 people that you can only get

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.579
to via airplane or boat, which makes it the ideal

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.773
place if you're a human trafficker because there's

00:00:53.773 --> 00:00:55.419
not a large government presence here.

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:57.725
OK now it's time to show you what we've done on the orphanage.

00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:58.723
This is the fun part.

00:00:58.723 --> 00:01:01.529
There's a wall, and let's go through a butterfly puddle on the way.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.440
Isn't that awesome?

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.379
Let's go check out what's been built on the orphanage.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:07.470
The reveal.

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:10.030
Wowwww.

00:01:10.963 --> 00:01:13.006
(Destin) Wow, so Project for Awesome built one of those.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.169
- They built two of those.

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:16.398
- Really? From the private donations as well.

00:01:16.398 --> 00:01:18.992
- Yeah between private donations and Project for Awesome

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:20.569
both these homes have been built.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.129
- OK let's rack and stack what we've actually done with the money.

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:24.261
OK step one.

00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:25.944
- That wall from last year, we completed it.

00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:27.814
And we're building this guard shack.

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:29.370
- Keep the boys safe. Next thing.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.601
A decorative plant.

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.573
- I hope you like them because we planted like 50 of them up the driveway.

00:01:33.573 --> 00:01:34.446
[laughs]

00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:38.606
(Destin) We built legit soccer goals, for the soccer field.

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:39.896
You're not gonna believe this.

00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:41.124
What happened here?

00:01:41.124 --> 00:01:42.222
This is one tree right?

00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:45.594
- That's right. So this huge tree fell down in the back of the property,

00:01:45.594 --> 00:01:46.753
out in the middle of the jungle.

00:01:46.753 --> 00:01:49.589
So we cut it up and we're building a gazebo in the middle of the water.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:51.151
- Which is awesome!

00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:52.122
(Children) Gracias!

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:54.254
(Destin) Check it out, a farm.

00:01:54.254 --> 00:01:57.486
I have no idea what to call this stuff in Spanish, but Tyler does.

00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:58.570
- piÃ±a.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.361
Ahi.

00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:00.482
Banana.

00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:02.551
- But we're not really sure what that is.

00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:03.333
- Papaya.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.558
Cocona.

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:06.081
[Very saucy accent] Hierba Luisa!

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.769
[laughs]

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:09.608
Mango.

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:10.869
- Excellent, OK food covered.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.101
Now let's go look at the actual building that was built.

00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:14.318
OK check it out.

00:02:14.318 --> 00:02:16.684
This is the first building. This is the common room.

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:20.473
Right here we actually have bedrooms for the boys.

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:21.476
We're doing it legit.

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:25.450
First aid, fire alarms, fire extinguishers.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.830
We're not messing around here.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.216
- We've got power!

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:29.137
[laughs]

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:30.062
(Destin) That's a big deal.

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:32.620
In summary, we built two buildings and in doing so we

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.204
employed 14 local fathers. This income provided their

00:02:36.204 --> 00:02:39.151
family with more stability. We also funded the higher education

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:42.027
of 4 older orphans in order to transition them more smoothly

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.481
to adulthood which is hugely important.

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:46.884
For example, in Iquitos we were stopped by a policeman

00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:49.064
who was once a street boy helped by Not Forgotten.

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.326
So clearly the system works.

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:54.069
The one thing we splurged on is a full set of soccer jerseys

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.398
for a local orphanage that was already established.

00:02:56.398 --> 00:02:57.923
These kids loved them.

00:02:57.923 --> 00:02:58.700
So there you go.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.569
That's where all $78,000 of your money went.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.974
OK the first step before you actually bring kids into the orphanage

00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:07.647
is to get the right families in place to host them.

00:03:07.647 --> 00:03:09.367
You can tell there's a meal going on here.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:10.529
We've got how many couples?

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:11.276
- 6 couples.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:13.281
- 6 couples are being interviewed in here.

00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:15.831
[laughter and voices]

00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:18.390
Obviously they're happy people,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.100
so what we're doing is, the next what, 3 days..

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.045
- The next 3 days we'll be looking at their educational background,

00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:26.765
evaluating them psychologically, and seeing how they

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:28.896
interact with kids to make sure we have the best people in place

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:29.805
to take care of them.

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:31.524
- It's pretty cool. Here's some footage we shot earlier

00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:33.675
of a psychologist going through a class with them

00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:36.110
and figuring out how these people rack and stack.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.002
It's pretty interesting.

00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:39.722
OK that's what we did this year with the money for Project for Awesome.

00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:41.174
Physically built buildings.

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:43.544
So, if you trust us and you think we're doing this the correct way,

00:03:43.544 --> 00:03:45.805
the goal now is to use more money from this year,

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:47.383
if you can vote for us,

00:03:47.383 --> 00:03:50.072
to hopefully get operational costs under control.

00:03:50.072 --> 00:03:52.333
That way when we get these kids, and we get the host parents here

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.585
we have everything covered.

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:54.752
Alright have a good one buddy.

00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:56.523
Alright so that's the last thing.

00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:59.734
We're about to start actually getting boys and bringing them to the orphanage.

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:03.286
So if you'd like to help, please go to the Project for Awesome website,

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:07.029
click the link at the bottom, vote for what we're working on here,

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.141
it's a really good thing.

00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:09.688
So thank you for your support in the past

00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:11.724
and I really hope you'd support us in the future.

00:04:11.724 --> 00:04:15.645
I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one.

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:18.089
OK I've tried to make this as simple as possible.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.609
Click on that top red button there, or the first link in the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.095
video description to go to the Project for Awesome website.

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:25.784
Scroll down and click Vote for this video

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:27.443
and that will put us in the running.

00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:28.534
It's a really big deal.

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:31.114
You have one vote though, but your friends have many.

00:04:31.114 --> 00:04:32.503
So if you'll look at these other buttons,

00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:35.840
possibly share this video, you can help us with some compound voting.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.326
Thank you so much for your time and now I'll let the

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:39.968
boys say thank you themselves.

00:04:41.058 --> 00:04:43.789
- Thank you Project for Awesome.

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:49.932
- Don't forget to be awesome.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:56.857
- My name is Julio Cesar. I'm from Peru.

00:04:56.857 --> 00:05:01.792
I am 17. Thank you Project for Awesome.
