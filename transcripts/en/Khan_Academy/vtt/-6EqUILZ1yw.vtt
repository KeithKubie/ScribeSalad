00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Teresa went skydiving.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The graph below discribes Teresa's height, measured in meters, as a function of time, measured in seconds.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.140
So let's look at this graph over here. It's actually quite large, so let me zoom out a little bit.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:24.700
And we can see that at time zero her height is seven hundred meters and then as time increases, as we move to the right her height is decreasing.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.300
And her height is decreasing at faster and faster rates as we move to the right so her- her-

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.000
the rate of decline of her height is quite steep as we approach ten seconds after she jumps

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.760
And then we can see all of a sudden, then we can see all of a sudden her rate of decline slows down

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.040
She's still declining as -as we move forward in time, but she's declining at a slower rate.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.760
And so we can say she's declining at a --- or she is --- her height is changing at a less negative rate

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.060
It's -It's quite a negative rate right over here --- seems roughly a fairly negative rate

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.560
but then it becomes a less negative rate right over here

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.200
her height is changing at a less negative rate

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.600
and it makes sense that this is when she deploys the parachute, so after 10 seconds

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.060
she deploys the parachute

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.440
so she jumps at 0 seconds, 10 seconds she deploys the parachute.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.400
Alright so let's see what they're asking --- actually asking us.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.900
They say

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.860
Complete the following sentence

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.740
Between 3 seconds and 8 seconds after Teresa jumped, her height decreased, on average, by approximately

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.940
blank meters per second.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.320
So between 3 seconds, and 8 seconds, so at 3 seconds --- so time is 3 right over there

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.320
So, Let's see what H(3) is.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.659
what is her height at 3 seconds and I'm just looking
at a graph so I'm going to have to

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.340
Ballpark it so at 3 seconds at 3 seconds
her height looks pretty close it's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.649
pretty close we just have to approximate
it so her height at the height after 3

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.960
seconds it looks like it's about halfway
between 600 and 700 so it looks like

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.060
it's about 650 meters and then we care
between 3 seconds and 8 seconds so our

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.830
height at 8 seconds let's look at that
at 8 seconds let's see this looks about

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:25.220
halfway it looks about halfway between
350 between 350 and 400 so I'll say her

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.000
height at 8 seconds actually since I'm
approximating it let me put a little

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.350
squiggly equal sign here her height
after 8 seconds looks like it's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:43.280
approximately 300 and looks
approximately 375 meters 375 meters so

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.840
what is her average rate of change her
height decreased on average by

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.990
approximately so we what we want to do
is we forgot to figure out the average

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.340
rate of change which you could view as
the slope of the line that connects

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.360
these two points the slope of this line
is going to be her average rate of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.080
change so let's think about that her
average rate of change her change in

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.990
height over the change in time for that
interval well her change in height after

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:15.260
at 8 seconds she is at let me write it
this way her height at 8 seconds - her

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.190
height at 3 seconds so this is going to
be her change in height and the change

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.380
in time is 8 seconds she finishes at 8
seconds - where she started or the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.350
interval that we care about starting at
3 seconds and so H of 8 we already said

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.620
this is approximately 375 H of 3 this is
650 and then of course 8 minus 3 is

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.930
going to be equal to 5
I just want emphasize this is just her

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.400
average rate of change for approximate
average rate of change over this

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.769
interval as we as we go from 3 to 8
seconds our height goes from H of 3 to H

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:58.670
of 8 so this is going to be let's see
375 - 650

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:06.380
let's see if it was 375 - 675 it would
be negative 300 and so this is going to

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.640
be but then we're not subtracting 675
we're subtracting 650 so it's going to

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:18.830
be 25 it's going to be 25 more so this
is going to be negative 275 over 5 let

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.640
me make sure I did that math right let
me make sure I did that math right so

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:29.449
it's 375 - 650 is
negative 275 does that make sense

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.639
let's see 275 plus 375 would be 2 650
yeah that is right all right so let's

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.590
just figure out what this is so 5 I'll
just figure out what 5 goes into 275 and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.440
then we can remember the negative 5 goes
into 27 5 times 5 times 5 is 25

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.110
subtract we get a to bring down to 5 5
goes into 25 five times and then we're

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.880
not going to have a remainder so this is
going to be equal to negative 55

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.750
negative 55 and the unit's our height is
given in meters so this part up here

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.669
this is in meters up here meters per
second so her change in height or

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.070
average change in height over or the
average rate of change of height over

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.889
this five seconds over this five seconds
is negative 55 meters per second one way

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.020
to think about it the slope right over
here the slope is equal to negative

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.780
55 now it might be tempting to just
write negative 55 right over here but

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.289
let's just think about whether that
would be right between 3 seconds and 8

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.660
seconds after Teresa jumped her height
decreased on average by approximately

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.409
negative 55 meters per second and
decrease is important because they're

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.289
already saying that it's decreased when
this negative is telling us that we're

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.360
decreasing we're decreasing at a rate of
55 meters per second our average rate of

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.000
change is a decrease our average rate of
high a change of height over time is a

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.870
decrease of 55 meters per second well
the negative is already saying the

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.680
decrease so we're not decreasing at a
negative rate of change we would be

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.620
decreasing at 55 meters per second so
let me just write it 55 meters per

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:15.139
second if they asked if they asked her
height if we asked her height if we if

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:23.900
they asked the average change of height
average rate of change let me write this

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:36.349
the average rate of change of change of
H over or let me say of H from 3 seconds

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.620
3 seconds
to 8 seconds

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.570
well now this would be negative 55
meters per second but when they're

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.390
saying that her height decrease that's
re taking the negative into

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.970
consideration they're saying it's
definitely decreasing that's what the

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.110
negatives already telling us it's
decreasing by a rate of 55 meters per

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.466
second hopefully that makes some sense
