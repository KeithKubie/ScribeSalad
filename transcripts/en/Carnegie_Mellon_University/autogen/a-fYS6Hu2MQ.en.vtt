really interactive and that means that
 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
really interactive and that means that
there<00:00:14.049><c> might</c><00:00:14.500><c> not</c><00:00:14.650><c> be</c><00:00:14.889><c> a</c><00:00:14.920><c> puppeteer</c><00:00:15.429><c> in</c><00:00:15.759><c> the</c>

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm excited about the lab is
 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.089 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm excited about the lab is
because<00:00:27.970><c> the</c><00:00:28.180><c> entertainment</c><00:00:28.720><c> industry</c><00:00:29.140><c> as</c><00:00:30.039><c> a</c>

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 align:start position:0%
because the entertainment industry as a
 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
because the entertainment industry as a

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
research in academia and so this is a
 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.990 align:start position:0%
research in academia and so this is a

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
real opportunity to change that and
