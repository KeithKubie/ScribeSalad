00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now what's the probability of winning from a state?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It seems complicated. It seems like we've got a lot of work to do,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but actually, we've almost solved the whole thing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
All we have to do is say, "What's the end point?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So remember, we start out in the start position,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and then we have some end positions

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where the game is over, and we have to assign utilities,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is the same as probability of winning,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which is either 0 or 1.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So this is a losing state, so it gets a Pwin of 0.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is a winning state. It gets Pwin of 1.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We assign all of those, and then

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
all the other states that depend on these--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we've already figured that out in terms of the Q function.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let's see how that works.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So the probability of winning is 1 if my current score

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
plus the pending is greater than or equal to goal.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Then I win automatically just by reaping those pending.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
My probability of winning is 0 if your score

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is greater than the goal and I haven't won.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And otherwise, my probability of winning

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is the probability that I get by taking the best action.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So for all the actions--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
among all the actions I can do,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
look for the Q value of that action--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
from the current state

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
according to the utility function--

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
try to maximize that, and that's going to be

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
my probability of winning.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So that's saying I can make the best choice that I can.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So we said that we had 3 choice points.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Here, I'm making the best choice by maximizing.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Here, the die gets to roll, and we're averaging--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we're summing them all up and dividing by 6,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
so that takes care of the averaging--

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and what about the worst choice that the opponent makes?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Well, that's just folded in because rather than

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
explicitly worrying about me and my opponent,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I just said, "Well, I can use

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
1 minus the probability of me winning."

00:01:44.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's the probability of the opponent winning.
