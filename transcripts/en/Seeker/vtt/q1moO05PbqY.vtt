00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.670
Some people just have no imagination.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.380
Hey brainiacs, Jules here for DNews.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.950
If I asked you to count the windows in your
house right now without getting up, you’d

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.170
probably have no problem recounting them all,
unless you live in a glass house, in which

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.450
case you just have one giant window and have
to get dressed in the basement.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.310
But when you’re tallying up all the windows,
can you practically see each room?

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.789
Do you feel as though you’re standing in
your kitchen or your living room as you count

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:28.789
them?

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.770
That’s the experience most people have,
but for a small percentage of you, that’s

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.410
not the case at all.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.260
And this may be the first time you’re learning
that your brain works differently.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.150
Some people have no imagination, and I mean
that in a literal sense.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.100
While others can read a book and hallucinate
a magical world of wizards and friendship,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.350
these people “see” nothing.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.570
The condition isn’t unheard of; it was first
identified in 1880, but it’s unexplored

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.180
enough that it didn’t have a name until
2015.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.190
Dr. Adam Zeman is Ze-Man who coined the name
aphantasia.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.629
The prefix a- means “without,” and phantasia
is the classical greek term for imagination.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.270
Zeman and his colleagues first began studying
the phenomenon in 2003 when a 65 year old

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.181
man approached them complaining that he had
lost the ability to picture things after a

00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:12.181
heart surgery.

00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.930
How a heart surgery could do this?

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.930
No idea.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.970
Anyway the patient, given the codename MX,
was a unique opportunity for science.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.590
Zeman and team ran him through numerous tests.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.439
His brain was examined in an fMRI machine
while he looked at pictures of famous people

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.950
and was asked to name them.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.689
At this point everything in his noodle was
unremarkable, but when he was only given their

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.200
names and asked to picture their faces, the
visual areas in the back of his brain went

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.200
dark.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.170
Forming an actual picture in your mind requires
regions all across your brain.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.790
To call up a mental image the frontal and
parietal lobes think about what you want to

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.490
see while the occipital and temporal lobes
provide the actual visuals of the objects.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.979
If one of these areas functions differently
than normal or gets damaged, it can result

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:53.979
in aphantasia.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.549
MX seemed like a rare find…

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.729
Until his story was covered by Discover Magazine,
and some of the readers wrote in to say they

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.240
had never been able to picture things since
birth.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.720
Even stranger, for some of them they were
just discovering that they were different.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.799
Their whole lives, they were under the impression
when someone asked them to “picture” something,

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.159
it was a metaphor and there were no actual
pictures in their mind.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.909
Biologist and aphantasiac Craig Venter says
it’s like a computer without a screen.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.019
There’s memory, processing, and inputs,
but no way to see what’s happening.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.970
It doesn’t have to be just visuals either;
when programmer Blake Ross thinks of a beach

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.030
he doesn’t hear the waves, smell the salt,
or feel the warmth.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.620
He just thinks of facts about beaches.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.129
While a lack of imagination may seem like
a drawback, people with aphantasia seem to

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.799
have developed ways around it.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.230
MX showed increased brain activity in his
frontal regions when asked to picture faces,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.359
and could still solve puzzles that require
most people to mentally rotate an object.

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.709
Zeman surveyed 21 people who claimed to have
this problem and asked them to count the windows

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.709
in their house.

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.370
14 of them could do it.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.760
Because they can work around their lack of
visuals, people with aphantasia lead normal

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.749
lives and run the gamut from engineers to
artists.

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:04.790
No one knows how many there are but surveys
estimate it’s around 2 to 3 percent of the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.790
population.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.720
The real number could be higher though, as
many don’t realize they’re different until

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.799
it’s pointed out to them.

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.700
They just need one thing to tip them off,
like a news article… or this YouTube video.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.010
Whether or not you can visualize things, you
might be interested in how things are made.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.370
I am, and I like to binge watch on the show
How It’s Made.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.729
Now you can watch that and other Science Channel
shows on the Science Go App!

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.319
Check it out and download for free at your
local App Store.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.079
Some of you can’t picture things, but others
may see more than you intend to.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:52.979
If you want to know more about hallucinations,
Trace and Julian cover them right here.

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:57.480
So -- after watching this, are any of you
just realizing you might have aphantasia?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.549
Technically 2% of you should!
