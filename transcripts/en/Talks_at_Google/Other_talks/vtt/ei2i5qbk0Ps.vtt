TIM WILDE: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.750
Thanks for coming to today's
Authors at Google session.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.340
I'm Tim Wilde, for those
of you who don't know me.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.970
Today we're joined
by Joyce Chaplin,

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.779
Ph.D. She's an award winning
author and the James Duncan

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.070
Phillips professor of early
American history at Harvard

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.009
University.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.300
Joyce will be talking to us
about her most recent book,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.640
which most of you have copies
of, "Round About the Earth--

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.630
Circumnavigation from Magellan
to Orbit," in which she

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.780
explores the full
history around the globe

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.274
travel over the course
of almost 500 years.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.440
So without further ado,
thanks for speaking with us,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.840
Joyce, and here you go.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.809
Welcome.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.850
JOYCE CHAPLIN: Thank you.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.350
Thanks so much.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.610
It's really a great
pleasure to be here

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.570
and to be speaking
about this book

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.020
that I did that came
out a couple years ago

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.230
and I kind of miss as a project.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.410
It was really, really,
really fun to work on,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.940
so I'm always delighted
to talk about it.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.780
And I'm going to begin
with an invitation,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.950
a kind of imaginative exercise.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.610
Please imagine that
for some odd reason,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.890
you have to ordered your
very own around the world

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.820
kit, which comes
in several pieces

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.100
and requires special delivery.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.490
It takes the form of a
theater in which you're

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.970
going to stage your own
around the world voyage.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.930
You're going to manage that.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.070
The kit will require
special delivery

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.940
because the theater
itself, which is round,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.110
is about 8.25 meters
across-- in circumference,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.120
I mean-- so just under
nine feet across.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.380
You can just about enter it.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.230
Not very big, but surprisingly,
the other components

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.670
turn out to be even
smaller, as you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.230
discover when you
enter the theater.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.490
On the door of the theater,
you'll find an envelope.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.840
The envelope has a map
and a magnifying glass.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.360
The map of marks with
an x a particular spot

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.860
within the theater,
and you're going

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.760
to need the magnifying
glass to find

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.720
what is at that spot marked x.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.850
It is a tiny ship, a ship
the size of a head of a pin.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.220
Beside that ship, you'll
find a microscope,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.480
and only with its
help will you discover

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.360
that what look like tiny bits
of dust on top of the ship

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.360
are tiny sailors,
like specks of dust.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.200
They're tiny dolls
that represent

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.950
the men who keep
the ship on course.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.470
Now, this kit that
you've ordered

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.070
has these kind of
bizarre dimensions

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.110
because correctly
proportioned to each other,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.200
the theater is the
Earth, this ship

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.230
is the Victoria-- the first
ship to make a circumnavigation.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.550
The tiny dolls are the
sailors, the angels that dance

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.080
on the head of this
particular pin.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.870
Given the high mortality
rates during most

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.280
of the history of around
the world voyages,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.840
sailors were indeed angels
in the making, about to die.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.990
Their tininess and the
smallness of their ship

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.330
make a circumnavigation of the
comparatively enormous globe

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.470
seem impossible, and yet it
happened-- over and over,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.670
hundreds of thousands of times,
and even more circumnavigations

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.880
are taking place
right now as I speak

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.510
on every level of the
Earth, both beneath the sea,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.710
on the surface, and in orbit.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.950
With those repeated embraces
of the globe from 1519 onward,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.510
human beings have
established what

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.810
is now a nearly
500-year tradition

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.490
of going around the world.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.000
It's the longest tradition
of a human activity done

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.360
on a planetary scale, 500
years of a planetary activity.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.040
Around the world
travelers therefore

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.740
make a grand gesture as
big as the physical world

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.590
itself even though
they are individually

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.650
so small that the huge global
stage on which they make

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.605
those voyages makes
them hard to find.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.800
I like to say that I found
the topic of circumnavigation

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.990
in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.130
Seven years ago in
St. George's Bermuda,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.390
I embarked on 140-foot sailing
ship, the Sea Education

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.740
Association's sailing school
vessel, the Corwith Cramer.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.500
So off I went with
a group of students.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.990
I was going to be at
sea for three weeks.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.920
I was an instructor
and deck hand.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.570
It's a very interesting
combination.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.540
And it was a three week
stint that I would spend away

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.540
from telephone,
internet, everything.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.120
It was actually kind of blissful
to be removed from all of that.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.960
But I was in the
middle of a project.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.015
My book before this
one was a project

00:04:56.015 --> 00:04:59.160
on Benjamin Franklin
and science,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.150
and this was going to require
me to read material in French.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.180
So I decided when I was at
sea for these three weeks

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.050
being a deck hand,
occasionally teaching,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.710
I would brush up my French.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.070
I was going to bring
a novel in French.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.550
Completely by chance,
I picked Jules Verne,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.540
"Le Tour du monde en
quatre-vingts jours"--

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.710
"Around the World in 80 Days"--
first published as a newspaper

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.620
serial in 1872.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.770
When I wasn't on wash
or being a deck hand,

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.960
I made my way pretty
slowly at first

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.090
through this French novel.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.530
My French was good
enough, kind of

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.580
to my surprise, that I
actually enjoyed the book.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.070
I really got into
the story, a lot

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.090
of the details of which
I had kind of forgotten.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.140
As a historian, I
appreciated the period

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.156
detail of the novel,
the late Victorian era.

00:05:44.156 --> 00:05:45.780
And I especially
appreciated the nature

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.910
of the bet, the wager that sends
a Verne's character, Phileas

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.660
Fogg, racing around the world.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.770
At his London club, Fogg remarks
that scheduled travel services

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.790
could now put a person
around the world in 80 days.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.900
His fellow club members
don't believe him,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.770
so they say prove it,
and so off he goes.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.780
That 80-day measure-- 80
days around the world--

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.770
was only conceivable by
the late 19th century.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.660
In the age of sail,
going around the world

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.340
would have required
weeks-- I'm sorry months,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.520
if not years-- so my
sailing vessel would

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.680
have lost Phileas Fogg.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.980
80 days would have
been impossible.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.520
It was the invention
of steam power,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.980
but also the creation of
regimented European empires

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.740
around the globe plus commercial
travel services that together

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.950
made it just
possible by the 1870s

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.010
to go around the
world in 80 days.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.130
I appreciated the period
detail of the novel.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.570
The second thing that impressed
me about Verne's story

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.370
was how the material
developments that sped up

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.180
global travel required a
dramatically increased use

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.450
of natural resources.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.850
When Fogg leaves
London on his voyage,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.540
he takes his new
valet, Passepartout,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.890
the comic character
of the novel.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.920
The two men board a night
train, which has scarcely

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.210
departed London when
Passepartout lets out,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.030
as Verne says, a
real cry of despair.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.550
"In the rush, my
state of confusion,

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.520
I forgot to switch off the
gas lamp in my bedroom.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.320
'Well, my dear fellow,'
Phileas Fogg replied coolly,

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.000
'you'll be paying the bill.'"

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.560
The gas lamp is the
novel's running joke.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.210
You know it's burning
the whole time.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.750
80 days of gas
burning in someone's

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.540
bedroom back in London.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.220
True, it's only a small
part of the journey's cost,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.060
but we present day
readers of Verne

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.420
quickly realize that
the joke is on us.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.525
We are notoriously
the first generation

00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:53.270
that has realized what the
planetary bill for centuries

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.540
of burning fossil
fuels is going to be.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.780
And Verne himself recognized
this on some level.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.150
He does not discuss
a carbon footprint

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.220
for this 80-day
journey, but it's

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.250
represented in the frontispiece,
the illustration, where

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.250
Passepartout and
Fogg are gazing up

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.480
the world that
they're going around.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.910
Right, there they are
with various modes

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.220
of their transport represented--
elephant, sailing ship,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:18.720
and so on.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.678
But in the middle of that
globe, if you notice,

00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:22.380
there's the gas lamp
burning, burning,

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.200
burning for all
of those 80 days.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.540
Fossil fuel represented in the
very first page of the novel.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.620
In Verne's era, coal
and other fossil fuels

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.400
were costly but essential
parts of modern progress.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.600
Yet Fogg's
steam-powered exploits,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.929
set at the height
European imperialism,

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.010
represent a face of the
past that truly is history,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.930
meaning it's now over.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.820
Airplanes have replaced the
coal-burning locomotives

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.410
and ships that hurdled
fog around the world.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.760
The empires that protected some
people at the expense of others

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.790
have been replaced with
other political regimes.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.560
It's now difficult to cross
the surface of the world in 80

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.740
days, though easy to fly around
it if you can afford the ticket

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:12.330
and if your government
gives you a passport.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.310
So that is what
I learned at sea.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.290
Once I was back
on land, I looked

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.330
for a history of around
the world travel.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.960
I thought, there must be one.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.670
There was none.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.100
So I wrote one.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.530
I decided that that was a
gap that I did absolutely

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.610
want to fill.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.410
So here we are.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.250
When I began the
book, I very quickly

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.000
decided that there
is no point in trying

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.940
to document all of the
round world voyages,

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.890
even all of the important ones.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.230
There were far too many.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.230
I didn't want to
write an encyclopedia.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.560
That's not what the book is.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.415
It records a number of firsts.

00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:47.165
They're all there.

00:09:47.165 --> 00:09:50.100
You can look it up
as a reference work,

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.999
if that's the way you
want to approach it.

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:54.540
But really, the part of the book
that I thought was important

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.520
was its argument.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.000
I wanted to explain why
a circumnavigation is

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.850
distinctive.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.310
Why does going around
the world matter

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.896
in the larger scheme of things?

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:08.520
It matters because it shows how
human beings have been thinking

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.630
themselves on a planetary
scale for a fairly long time,

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.250
for almost 500 years.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.290
Circumnavigators have generated
nearly half a millennium's

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:22.850
worth of evidence of humanity's
direct tangible connection

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.700
to something that's
usually perceived

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.230
in the abstract,
the whole Earth.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.800
This is really
significant that we

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.630
have this history of thinking
of ourselves in relation

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.450
to the planet very, very
tangibly for almost 500 years.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.930
Of course, humans have
had a relationship

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.230
to the planet for as long
as they have existed.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:44.640
But consciousness and
awareness of that connection

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.470
has been thought to
be only very recently,

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.060
from maybe the 19th
century onward.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.630
Most people in the
more remote past

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.750
are not usually
thought of as having

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.880
any conception of themselves
on a planetary scale.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.440
They were supposed
to be thinking small,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.620
to be tucked into very
small parts of the globe

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.280
and to only kind of think
of themselves locally.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.090
So it was allegedly
only by the 19th century

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:12.570
that mastery of the oceans and
penetration into continents

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.830
gave Europeans, Western
Europeans, the world's

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.800
first version of a
planetary consciousness,

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.430
augmented by developments
in science and geography.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.520
It was only supposedly, again,
with the famous Apollo 8

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.880
photographs of 1968-- the
Apollo 8 photographs of Earth--

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.620
that humans first truly grasped
their place on the Earth

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.510
as a whole.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.850
Today, of course, we're
hyperaware of our connection

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.770
to the planet given our ongoing
environmental crisis, most

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.120
of which can be attributed
to human actions

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.310
in generating matter that
overheats the atmosphere,

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.620
clogs land, air, and water.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.840
We use our planetary
consciousness today

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.200
both to praise and to
criticize ourselves,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.830
to emphasize our greater
scientific awareness

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.950
about the Earth, for
example, but also to stress

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.030
our unprecedented
transformation of it.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.330
Plus, there's a sense of
globalization-- a key word

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.320
everyone talks about
now, globalization.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.560
Surely, we must have
a greater awareness

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.890
of the planet given the
globalized culture in which we

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.540
live, the global connections
we know we now have with people

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.790
all over the world,
not least represented

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:27.480
in international business
education efforts such as are

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.710
represented very well
here in Cambridge.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.905
But it may just be
the case, I think,

00:12:32.905 --> 00:12:35.030
that no one has looked hard
enough to find a longer

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.488
history of planetary
consciousness.

00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:38.400
If you don't look
for it earlier,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.030
obviously you're not
going to find it.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.530
Part of this has
to do with the fact

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.420
that globalization
has really hogged

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.760
all of the attention,
globalization.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.650
Global is social.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.190
It implies the human
to human connections

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.530
among people over
the entire globe.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.640
In contrast,
planetary is physical.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.420
It implies the
physical planet itself

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.090
and humans' awareness
of how they're

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.670
connected to that
physical place.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.580
Far more studies, a
lot more journalism

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.405
has been devoted
to the former than

00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:11.540
to the latter--
globalization again hogging

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:12.470
all the attention.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.180
That's because human
to human interactions

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:19.330
are usually what historians
and journalists focus on.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.270
Only recently for historians
have human relationships

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.220
with the non-human
parts of nature

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.830
been put into dialogue
with the human

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.370
to natural interactions that
are the other part of history.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.900
We have only really begun
to read historical documents

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.770
thinking of the natural
world, the physical world,

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:43.030
as a context for understanding
human to human relations.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.370
Circumnavigators' long
tradition, 500-year tradition,

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.740
of engagement with
the planet questions

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.466
our sense of
historical uniqueness.

00:13:50.466 --> 00:13:51.965
Maybe we're not the
first generation

00:13:51.965 --> 00:13:53.770
that has a planetary
consciousness.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.380
Maybe it's not
something that only

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.880
emerged in the
late 19th century.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.771
Instead, circumnavigators'
awareness of the planet

00:14:00.771 --> 00:14:02.270
may teach us something
worth knowing

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.290
about why we think about the
Earth the way that we do.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:10.020
I found that the
premodern circumnavigators

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.650
starting in 1500s onward
were by definition

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.500
not only thinking of themselves
in relation to the planet,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.460
but doing something
in relation to it,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.030
meaning they went around it.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.420
Circumnavigation again is
the oldest human activity

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.240
done on a planetary
scale, and it's

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.750
16th century sailors
who did it first.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:27.260
That's really kind
of astonishing.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.090
With a technology we no longer
think is very efficient,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.886
they did it.

00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:33.260
I'm going to
proceed now to point

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.820
out three ways in which
circumnavigators described

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.390
themselves in terms of a full
planetary existence, traditions

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.470
that again, we still have.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.870
First of all, the
circumnavigators' paradox.

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.440
This is the day that
is gained or lost

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.350
in going around the world,
crossing what we now

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.910
refer to as the
International Date Line, IDL.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.320
It had been
theoretically known--

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.330
astronomers and geographers
had speculated yes, this

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.270
should happen-- if human
beings go around the world,

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.230
their calendar will
shift along with them.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.220
But no one had experiences
until Magellan's surviving crew

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.740
made it back to Spain in
1522, having lost a day.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.200
I like that kind
of random having

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.940
lost a day as they did so.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.300
So ever since, the
temporal transition

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.450
has been a hallmark
of circumnavigation.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.670
If you were to ever go around
the world over the poles,

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.010
hypertechnically,
that's referred

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.269
to as a transpolar
voyage because there

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:34.310
isn't the temporal shift.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.210
It's not technically
a circumnavigation,

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.960
believe it or not.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.200
It lacks this hallmark
characteristic of gain or loss

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.500
of a day.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.970
All travelers change
their place on the globe.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.450
They move through space.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.810
Only circumnavigators change
the day on the calendar,

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.960
they change their place in time.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.340
Second, circumnavigators
mark their voyages

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.590
on maps and globes as an entire,
again, planetary circuit.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.180
The first example
occurred around 1530

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.230
with a small globe
probably made in Nuremberg

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.010
with the root of
Magellan's expedition

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.694
scored all the way around.

00:16:07.694 --> 00:16:09.360
You see in the Atlantic
Ocean the voyage

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.105
going out, south,
through the Strait that

00:16:12.105 --> 00:16:15.420
would bear Magellan's
name and then coming up

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.310
around Cape Horn in
Africa-- I'm sorry,

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.480
Cape of Good Hope in Africa.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.030
This becomes, again,
another hallmark

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.850
of the circumnavigators'
passage--

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.390
the swoop around the
full globe, the desire

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.490
to mark on a map or
globe how you did it,

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.130
that this is the
circumnavigator's track,

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.440
was the first graphic
representation

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.590
of a human planetary
activity and becomes

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:41.780
very characteristic.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.320
This is a beautiful map with
Magellan's track made in Venice

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.780
around 1540.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.000
You see it more clearly there.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.500
One of my favorite
examples, though,

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.570
has to be Francis Drake looted
his way around the world,

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.520
gaining a lot of silver
from the Spanish Empire.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.830
So when he got back, he had this
beautiful double hemisphere map

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.900
made with his track
that you can see,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.950
made in silver, the element
that he had returned with.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.359
That's what he wanted his
circumnavigation marked as.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.270
The temporal element--
the gain or loss

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.139
of a day-- the representation
of an entire planetary activity

00:17:21.139 --> 00:17:22.680
through the
circumnavigator's tracks,

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.270
the third element was
how circumnavigators

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.950
took the physical globe as their
personal emblem or accessory.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.980
The first to do so
was Sebastian Elcano,

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.910
the commander who
survived Magellan.

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.060
Magellan is the most famous man
never to go around the world.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.920
He died in the
Philippines, and it

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.780
was Elcano who brought the
surviving ship to Victoria

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.450
back.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.550
He was rewarded by
the King of Spain

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.730
with a coat of arms
that featured a globe.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.910
So was Francis Drake,
so you see Drake

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.870
here with his coat of arms.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.790
It has that globe with his
shift, the golden hind,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.370
teetering on it at the top.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:06.090
Later on, James Cook
would be awarded

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.990
a coat of arms that
also features a globe.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.050
There would be a lot
of portraits also make

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.530
with circumnavigators holding
or leaning on a globe.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.080
That is really interesting
because previously

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.220
to this, the only people
who would be pictured

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:23.220
with the whole world as
a kind of personal emblem

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.350
would be God, Christ,
and rulers, monarchs.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.010
For ordinary
civilians or commoners

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.030
to gain this as an accessory was
quite extraordinary, and again,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.280
marking a kind of understanding
of how going around the world

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.570
was so distinctive.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.520
Many circumnavigators
beginning with Drake

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.250
had portraits made them in
which they hold globes, again,

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.700
something that only monarchs
or Christ had done so.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.460
From the 16th century
onward, circumnavigators

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.682
claimed the privilege of
claiming the whole world

00:18:54.682 --> 00:18:55.890
to mark their accomplishment.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.860
As I discovered these elements
of circumnavigation, defined

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.930
very early from the
16th century onward

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.750
as characteristic way in
which people could have

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.240
a relationship with
the entire planet,

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.390
I defined around the world
travel as a geodrama,

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.860
using the Greek
for Earth, "Gaia,"

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.330
and for action, "drama."

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.310
Within the European
countries that

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.004
sponsored the first
circumnavigations,

00:19:25.004 --> 00:19:26.420
there was an
established tradition

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.650
of considering the world
as a theater, teatro

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.830
mundi-- all the world's a stage.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.660
This was an ancient Greek idea
updated in the Middle Ages

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.630
and Renaissance and exemplified
in Shakespeare's claim

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.160
that all the world's a stage.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.670
Theatro mundi was a
metaphor, obviously,

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.990
but around the world travelers
made it into a reality

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.200
by presenting
themselves as actors

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.690
on a stage of
planetary dimensions.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.320
Over time,
circumnavigations would

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.090
be presented as
dramatic entertainments,

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:03.480
first in print, then on
stage, and today on film.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.500
A geodrama is different
from geography,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.360
which studies depictions of the
Earth made by writing, graphos.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.470
While geography engages
the human eye and the hand

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.772
and the mind, geodrama
requires all of the body,

00:20:16.772 --> 00:20:19.650
everything-- all
of a human being

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.290
and its range of physical
experiences in relation

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.080
to Gaia, the Earth.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.940
That whole body experience
of the whole Earth

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.500
is well documented in the
accounts of circumnavigations,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.690
which describe what it
felt like-- from agonizing

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.102
to exhilarating, depending
on the period of time

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:38.560
when the circumnavigation
was done,

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.420
depending on the
person's experience.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.640
In fact, most people do not and
have not gone around the world.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.960
It's a minority experience.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.100
But everyone knows something
about how it should be

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.990
and how it might feel.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.380
Everyone has some idea
of the big statement

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.800
that a circumnavigation
makes through geodrama.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.260
For that reason, published
first person accounts

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.490
were the primary sources
that I used for the book.

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:05.270
And frankly, the more famous
the account, the better

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.210
because that indicated
the extent to which there

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:10.460
was an audience for
that work and many more

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.360
people knew about by
reading or experiencing it.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.070
Together, the accounts
of circumnavigation

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.270
constitute the longest
and most sustained way

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.050
in which people have been
able to consider themselves

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.480
as actors within
a geodrama, even

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.200
as the drama changed over time.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.950
Here, let me go into the
basic stages or changes, which

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.750
can be expressed as 3
acts in the drama, three

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.620
phases in which humanity
comprehend their place on

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.320
and experience in the world.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.210
In the first act, which lasted
from Magellan's departure

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:49.770
from Spain through to James
Cook's death in Hawaii,

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.840
so down to 1779, the sailors
who went around the world

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.030
did so in fear.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.194
It was reasonable for
them to be fearful

00:21:59.194 --> 00:22:00.860
given the dangers of
an around the world

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.140
voyage in the age of sail.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.970
It was in this initial
phase-- the longest,

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.770
if you notice, in the
history of circumnavigation--

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.220
that death prevailed.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.450
Humans might take on the
planet, but I think of it

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.710
as if the planet could
just shrug them off,

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.320
which the plant routinely did.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.950
I will go into the confidence
and the doubt later,

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.370
but I want to just give
some more detail about how

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.660
the fear was actually a
very rational response.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.340
The death rates on
early circumnavigations

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.580
were, in fact, appalling.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.700
This is why I'm using PowerPoint
rather than Prezzie in order

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.020
to get all the data in.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.950
I did not cherry pick
the worst experiences.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.830
These are absolutely
representative.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.940
Attrition rates for
these early expeditions

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.660
could reach into the
90th percentiles.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.550
Mortality rates nearly in
the 60th and 70th percentiles

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.660
were considered quite good.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.820
The expectation eventually was
that you could not possibly

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.780
expect a return with
all of your ships.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.050
You would lose
some along the way.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.400
If you brought back one
or two, that was great.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.320
So as you can see,
the attrition was

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.650
built into the experience
of the expedition.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.690
Having a fearful attitude about
taking on the entire planet

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.080
through a circumnavigation
was entirely rational.

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.860
Let me just give
some comparisons.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.470
Mortality statistics
for naval battles

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.890
and for maritime disasters
were in fact lower than

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.170
for circumnavigation.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.810
Three examples-- the
first European voyage

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.390
to India, only 50%
of the men lost.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.320
The Spanish armada casualties
on the Spanish side, 66%.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.560
And then the Titanic disaster
of the 20th century, 68%.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.260
This is just to give a
sense that the dangers

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.760
of a circumnavigation
combine the dangers

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.790
of war and disaster.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.502
That was the
proportion of mortality

00:23:50.502 --> 00:23:51.960
that people would
have experienced.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.380
As well, again it was
expected to lose ships,

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.880
giving some indication of the
extraordinary expense of trying

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.020
to put on a circumnavigation
for a nation state that

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.560
would send out
such an expedition.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.300
Of the five ships that Magellan
commanded, only one returned.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.450
Three famous expeditions
that followed--

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:18.320
I'll show this to you again--
lost all of their ships.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.400
This meant that the
few survivors we know

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.490
came back to Europe, got
back on someone else's ship.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.510
That was the before picture
or the early picture

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:29.440
of circumnavigation.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.270
Let me move to the improvement
in the 18th century,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:37.150
when through deliberate effort,
the mortality rates went down.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.360
The idea now was not to lose
most of the men in ships,

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.080
but to keep them.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.800
Rates of return for
circumnavigations

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.500
shot up into the 90th
and 80th percentiles,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.240
reversing the earlier
pattern entirely.

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.970
Survival rates just in
the 60th percentiles

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:59.630
were now consider troubling
rather than amazingly good.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:03.990
From the 1780s until the
1920s-- what Stearns called

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.880
the long 19th century
or the 19th century

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.570
extended on either end--
during this period of time,

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.730
travelers who made their
way around the world

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.510
did so with a
striking confidence

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.490
that they could
survive the process.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.610
They and their
companions would make it.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.240
This was because
Western societies

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.340
had generated technology
and political networks that

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.510
seemed to have
conquered the globe.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:27.930
It was not only possible
to go around the world,

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.230
but it became a popular pastime.

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.850
There were costs, not
all of them hidden,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.830
but they seem outweighed
by the glories and the ease

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.340
of making a swing
around the planet.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.369
Over the end of the 18th century
and over the whole course

00:25:43.369 --> 00:25:45.160
of the 19th century,
going around the world

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.840
was no longer an
achievement confined

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.410
to the ranks of
professional sailors,

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.390
but instead available to
a broader range of people.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:55.950
Two examples-- the first
handicapped person,

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.000
James Holman-- who was
blind-- went around the world

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.350
in the 1820s.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.650
The first woman, a
stowaway, had gone

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.560
around the world in the 1770s
and a handful followed her,

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:09.590
but the first woman
to do it alone

00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:13.340
all by herself, in confidence
that she could do this,

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.380
managed to do that in the 1830s.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.520
Ida Pfeiffer was
a Viennese widow

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.449
who decided that
she wanted to travel

00:26:20.449 --> 00:26:21.490
for the rest of her life.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:25.190
And she goes around the
world more than once.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:29.810
New signs of the new safety,
obviously, that people

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.600
who were handicapped,
unprotected

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.650
by a considerable masculine
presence, for instance,

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.740
could now go around the world.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.740
It became important, as
well, for individual nations

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.840
to send ships or delegations
around the world.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.670
A lot of nations
did this as soon

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.850
as they felt like they
could possibly do it.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.580
It was like joining
a global club.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.830
Yes, we have mounted
a circumnavigation.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.040
We did so in this year.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.460
The United States first did a
circumnavigation in the 1780s,

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.190
shortly after the
American Revolution,

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.990
an important demonstration
of independence.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.920
Russia does it around the
same time, China and Japan

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.610
by the 1870s.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.300
so this is the
global map made by

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.810
the first Chinese
circumnavigator, who

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.750
goes around the
world in the 1870s.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.660
Korea does a circumnavigation.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.760
They send a diplomatic
embassy around the world

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.780
not long after this.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.110
And so at the present day,
when nations still mark

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.870
the first time, for
instance, that they

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.070
are able to put a
satellite in orbit

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.870
or to send an astronaut to the
International Space Station,

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.170
it still is a kind of
important demonstration

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.370
of your national
prestige, that you

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.480
are part of the club
that has this kind

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:43.340
of planetary presence.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.140
The around the world travelers,
who in the 19th century

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.510
were pioneers in
this democratization

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.000
of circumnavigation,
were assisted

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.950
by two important developments.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.860
First, the spread
of European empires

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.080
over most of the
globe, which meant

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.720
that a great deal of
the world was made

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.290
accessible to travelers
from the global West,

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.130
meaning from Europe
and its offshoots,

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.610
including the United States.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.580
The second factor was
the emergence and growth

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.440
of commercial travel
services, which

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.870
we continue to benefit
from, obviously.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:15.940
That trend was very
well represented

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:18.360
in Jules Verne's novel
"Around the World in 80 Days,"

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.080
when indeed, it is commercial
travel services that

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.240
mostly send Fogg
around the world.

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.060
This was possible after the
opening of the Suez Canal,

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.840
for instance, and the completion
of the transcontinental

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.550
railroad across
the United States.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.270
In the very same year that
Verne's novel appeared

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.620
as a book, 1873, the English
travel company Thomas Cook

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.770
and Son organized the
first around the world tour

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.740
and it becomes a very common
thing for travel services

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:47.790
to offer from that time onward.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.480
If you can pay for
this kind of travel,

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.090
certain services would
be provided for you.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.040
Many other agencies
throughout Europe

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.890
would imitate that grand global
package tour and shipping

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.840
companies began to sell
around the world tickets.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:03.610
These were great.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:06.110
These were often for a
stated period of time.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.880
You could get off in Singapore,
stay there for awhile

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.720
if you had business or
wanted to see things,

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:16.090
and then you would
catch the ship

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.300
that would come around next.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.280
Sometimes the ticket
would be available to you

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.560
for two years or so.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.560
You can make your
way around the world

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.774
in leisure, or deciding to
stay in different locations,

00:29:27.774 --> 00:29:29.190
simply catching a
ship to continue

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.220
as convenient to do so.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.140
It was glamorous to
go around the world.

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.640
Deliberately, it was packaged
as a very glamorous thing

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.090
to do for your honeymoon,
for your wedding anniversary,

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.690
after graduating
college, et cetera.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:46.370
Going around the world was
glamorous, pleasurable, even

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.930
joyful.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.080
This is one of my
favorite illustrations

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.710
from the period--
a Jazz Age couple

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.400
dancing their way
around the world.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:01.200
Over the 20th century
and now into the 21st,

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.790
however, the confidence
about the human ability

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.450
in spanning the globe
gave weight to doubt.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.860
That's the last act of geodrama,
the one in which unfortunately

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.930
we still kind of live.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.950
Technologically,
newer forms of travel,

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.550
especially airplanes and
rocket-propelled space

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:21.560
capsules, revive the
sense of extreme danger

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.640
that had faded during the
relatively safer 19th century.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.160
Just one famous example.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.360
Amelia Earhart was trying
to set a record flying

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.380
around the world
when she was lost

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.890
trying to make a very perilous
landing on tiny Howland Island

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.510
in the middle of
the Pacific Ocean.

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:40.950
So really aviation and
continuing into space travel

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.460
revived a sense of
the intense danger

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.630
that had faded in
the 19th century.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.100
Equally, it's now clear
that it was imperialism

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.480
that had smoothed the way for
most earlier circumnavigators

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.640
under political and
social circumstances

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.680
that it would be impossible
and unwise to try to reinstate.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.250
Above all, there's
a growing sense

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.070
that the planet is again
beginning to bite back.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.060
Now that the environmental
costs of planetary domination

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.530
have begun to haunt us,
to fly around the world

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.370
takes a prodigious
amount of fossil fuel

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.550
to do that in a jet plane,
a private plane, whatever.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.680
Going into orbit
requires even more.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.250
When the NASA space
shuttle still operated,

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.290
it required over 1,000 gallons
of liquid fuel per second

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:29.800
to achieve liftoff.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.540
This is not an
inconsiderable use

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:37.710
of what we know is a shrinking
supply of energy and one

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.720
that is damaging to the planet.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.860
This has meant that the new
trend in circumnavigation

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.960
is to demonstrate
sustainable energy.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.500
Many sailing ships
have done this so far,

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.280
and solar impulse, the
solar powered airplane,

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.720
wants to make an entirely
solar powered circumnavigation,

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.760
indicating that entire
circuit of the planet

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.790
remains an important measure
or metric for how you measure

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.774
anything, including
sustainable energy.

00:32:06.774 --> 00:32:08.232
That is the most
recent development

00:32:08.232 --> 00:32:10.790
in circumnavigation.

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.810
I think today, we live
with all three legacies

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.540
of around the world travel.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.550
We have a reemerging fear
that the planet could simply

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.220
shrug us off.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.380
We still have, however,
continuing confidence

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.000
that we might be able
to generate technologies

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.650
and political alliances
to dominate the planet,

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.880
yet we doubt that it's
always wise to do so.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.440
It's especially apparent at
this point in our history

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.830
that the characteristic
confidence of the 19th century,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.850
especially the
late 19th century,

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.260
has been the shortest of
historical experiences

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:52.260
and perhaps the most
atypical, yet obviously

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:53.810
the most difficult
to relinquish.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:55.970
We don't want to give that up.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.040
Our current doubts seem
to be taking us back

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.960
to the fears of the
early modern period,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.510
a circular return that matches
the swings around the planet

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:07.239
that themselves went through
the three acts of geodrama.

00:33:07.239 --> 00:33:09.280
I want to stress, however,
that there were always

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.880
more hopeful elements to this
story, and those bright moments

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.920
matter, too, and
they make it clear

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.110
that the human past is
complicated and contradictory

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.370
as its present, whether seen
on a small scale or large, even

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.750
the largest of all.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.910
In tracing this history
of planetary consciousness

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.410
as expressed through the history
of around the world travel,

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.520
I want to end by
pointing out that

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.660
individual circumnavigators
are themselves aware

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.090
of the history
and the traditions

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:41.180
that they are reenacting.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.980
That has really continued
to the present day.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.780
Circumnavigators from very early
on read each other's accounts

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:49.690
and commented on each
other's experiences

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:53.150
and saw themselves as extending
a process from the past

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.590
into the future.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:57.420
They read each other's accounts
as models for their own voyages

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.160
and narratives.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.770
I'll just give one
genealogy of this.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.050
Sir Francis Drake
read the account

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.200
of Magellan's expedition.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:11.670
William Dampir, a famous pirate
circumnavigator, read Drake.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.830
George Anson read Dampir.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.214
Louis Antoine
Bougainville read Anson.

00:34:18.214 --> 00:34:21.469
A Russian circumnavigator
Krusenstern read Bougainville,

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.350
and then Charles
Darwin, who sails

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:26.750
around the world in the 1830s,
read Krusenstern, and so on,

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.250
even in the present day when
around the world sailors still

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.170
all pretty much routinely read
Joshua Slocum, the first person

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.940
to sail around the world alone.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.697
He's kind of canonical reading.

00:34:37.697 --> 00:34:40.030
You cannot be an around the
world sailor without reading

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:45.150
Slocum, who himself read Darwin,
so the genealogy continues.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:48.440
Even people who would go around
the world by different means--

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.560
by bicycling, motorcycling,
walking, et cetera--

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.729
would refer back to the
longer maritime tradition

00:34:54.729 --> 00:34:56.889
on which they thought
they were building.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:58.730
We see this sense of
history, for example,

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.230
in the naming of spacecraft.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:05.720
When NASA sent an unmanned
expedition to orbit Venus,

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.100
it was called Magellan.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.980
They chose very well
by saying that this

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.970
would be a famous
circumnavigator,

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.090
the first
circumnavigation of Venus,

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.040
so why not call it Magellan?

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.740
It was also well named
because the device did not

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.290
make it back.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:24.740
It resembled Magellan in
that way, like its namesake.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.290
It was programmed to
descend into Venus'

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.030
spacecraft-meltingly-hot
atmosphere.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.680
At some point, it stopped
transmitting data.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.010
It was, unlike
Magellan, timed to die

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.120
at a very certain moment.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.520
This naming pattern
was also true

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.300
of several of the space
shuttles which took astronauts

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.200
to orbit on the
International Space Station.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.570
Several were named for famous
circumnavigating vessels,

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.930
including the Columbia, named
for the first US vessel,

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.930
to make a circumnavigation.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.870
The history of our
planetary consciousness

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.770
is right there in these
extended traditions

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.040
of encompassing the entire
planet, which go back

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.510
to the start of
the 16th century.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.200
It's a way in which we
are early modern even

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.550
as we think we are
very, very modern.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:17.230
We are planetary because
we participate in and are

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:20.570
aware of traditions that go
back for half a millennium.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:21.310
Thank you.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.370
I'm very happy to take
questions if anyone

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.800
has anything they would
like to ask about.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:31.050
AUDIENCE: I was especially
interested by the [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:34.045
re-used for individuals
rather than just the monarchs

00:36:34.045 --> 00:36:34.545
or Christ.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.604
This notion of
circumnavigation, it

00:36:41.604 --> 00:36:43.020
must be connected
also to the idea

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.478
of getting to the
ends of the Earth

00:36:44.478 --> 00:36:49.520
in various directions, the
edges of the known Earth.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.650
We think of Marco Polo,
but as far as I know,

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.690
no one even in the 15th
century was thinking,

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.320
can I get from the
easternmost part of China

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.820
to the southernmost
part of Africa

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.780
or something like
this over land, even.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.800
Is that because land
travel was so much

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.440
more difficult than sea travel?

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.945
Marco Polo was there
in the 12th century.

00:37:16.249 --> 00:37:18.040
JOYCE CHAPLIN: Land
travel was much slower.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.880
Everyone recognized that
maritime travel was-- doesn't

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.640
seem fast to us, but
it was much faster

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.780
than trying to go
continentally over land, which

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.870
is why a lot of
intercontinental exploration

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:33.600
was not done until
the 19th century.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.760
It was, in fact, harder to do.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.490
Yeah.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:40.030
People did have a
sense that going

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.780
across a large extent of the
Earth, perhaps by sailing ship,

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.880
would be a prodigious
feat, even possible.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.580
Commentary obviously on
Columbus and on De Gama

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.110
for crossing oceans.

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.360
Going around the
entire world, however,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.060
was more than the
sum of its parts,

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.460
and I think recognized
as such at the time.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.050
It had not been Magellan's
original intention.

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.299
He was just going to sneak
up to the spice islands

00:38:07.299 --> 00:38:09.090
through the back door,
as it were, and then

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.580
go back the same way.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:17.890
It's only after he dies, after
the survivors are in Indonesia,

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.360
that they realize they've
gone around most of the world.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.620
Going back would be crazy.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.260
They do an unintended
circumnavigation,

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.460
thus proving it was
possible, but again,

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.140
coming back with a tiny
percentage of crew.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:36.380
One ship was a big
warning that not what you

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.440
want to do every day,
so seen qualitatively

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.110
as being quite different from
other kinds of long distance

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.960
travel, combining all of the
dangers of longer distance.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.390
AUDIENCE: But even so,
for long distance travel,

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:48.350
there were pre-existing
trade routes--

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.100
we're talking about commercial
travel in the 19th century--

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:56.140
there were trade networks
back into ancient times,

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.653
going all the way to China.

00:38:57.653 --> 00:39:00.230
I don't know how far into
Africa the trade networks were

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:05.460
continuous, but certainly
into Ethiopia and further.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.870
But the idea that
an individual would

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.350
make trips to go to
the ends of the Earth

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:13.920
doesn't seem to be
an idea, or does it?

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.980
JOYCE CHAPLIN:
Well, I guess it's

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:21.440
an idea glimmering into
focus after expeditions

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.190
like Columbus and De Gama.

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.730
But again, there did seem to
be something qualitatively

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.800
different about doing the entire
globe as a trading venture.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.650
And indeed, the thing
about Magellan's survivors

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:36.370
when they get back is
everyone loses money on that.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:37.670
It was not lucrative.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:41.810
The King of Spain gets whatever
advantage there might be

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.470
and no one else
does, even anywhere

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.600
near what they thought they
would get out of that voyage.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.270
It was a real
question for a while

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.370
about why you would
want to do another one,

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.317
and indeed, given the
attrition rates, not attractive

00:39:56.317 --> 00:39:57.650
necessarily to sign on for that.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:02.900
Given the cost, a good sailing
ship was a real investment,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.030
and to lose four or
five of them was not

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.800
something you would
want to do lightly.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.060
So it remains a
real question, why?

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:11.873
What kind of training
voyage, for instance,

00:40:11.873 --> 00:40:16.250
would benefit from a whole
circuit of the globe.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.235
It remains kind of
problematic of a voyage

00:40:19.235 --> 00:40:22.500
to do through at least the
early part of the 18th century,

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.230
though people continued to try.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.190
Often, though, they
are unintended.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:29.240
Somebody gets further than
they thought they were going to

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.535
and they just continue rather
than go around the other way.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.120
AUDIENCE: What specifically
made it less lethal?

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.390
What was the big change?

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:49.830
I assume most people got
sick or starved, so what,

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.500
did they just start
bringing more food?

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:58.520
JOYCE CHAPLIN: Yeah, they
don't know about the citrus.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.700
Scurvy was a big,
big, big killer.

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.660
And again, there's
a cumulative effect.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.560
Crossing one ocean
was bad enough.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.790
But your reward as a
circumnavigator was there

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:08.400
would be another one.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:13.240
People just could not
bring enough food.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.730
There's a political
problem as well,

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:19.210
that for a lot of the globe,
it was dangerous to make land

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.720
and to get food.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.900
You were not welcome there.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.510
So the provisioning was a kind
of physical problem of getting

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:29.750
enough on a ship, but
then reprovisioning

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.560
is a social and
political problem,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.210
and that would not go away until
the empires of the 19th century

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:39.000
would say no, sailing ships
from particular nations

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.640
have the right to stop there.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.170
That would help a lot.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:47.770
Interestingly, sailors referred
to scurvy as earthsicknesses,

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.610
meaning that they
were sick for land.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.800
It's like being homesick.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.900
They were convinced that
to make land itself,

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:59.770
to breathe the air, just to be
on the land would restore them.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.380
Because if it was a malady
that existed at sea,

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.430
then being on land
should probably cure it.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.170
So there are accounts of sailors
being buried in the earth.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.860
That would be even
better, right,

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.240
because they were in
their little earth vats

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.542
soaking up whatever
gave them strength.

00:42:13.542 --> 00:42:15.750
Again, you've got to be able
to make land to do that,

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.630
and politically,
that was a problem

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.380
until late 18th,
early 19th century.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:24.750
The rising survival
rates, however,

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.780
during the 18th
century were probably

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.130
due to more careful
provisioning.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.940
There's an account of one of
those ships where the ship is

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.230
so tightly packed
with provisions

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:38.700
that they joke about having
to eat their way through.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.985
That would help, certainly.

00:42:41.985 --> 00:42:45.360
The work regimen was
often altered, as well,

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.700
so men would get
more sleep and rest.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.170
Scurvy is one of those
debilitating diseases

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.195
where if you begin to have it,
any other stress on the body

00:42:53.195 --> 00:42:54.560
is going to accelerate it.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.810
Probably, the modified work
schedule helped, as well.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:59.470
But they didn't pack
a lot of lemons.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.252
The citrus cure, not
something that they

00:43:02.252 --> 00:43:03.210
realized at that point.

00:43:06.084 --> 00:43:09.382
AUDIENCE: How would
they pack lemon?

00:43:09.382 --> 00:43:10.590
JOYCE CHAPLIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.594
AUDIENCE: I thought that
the big cure for scurvy

00:43:12.594 --> 00:43:15.169
was fermented, like sauerkraut.

00:43:15.169 --> 00:43:16.460
JOYCE CHAPLIN: Sauerkraut, yes.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.850
It's so interesting.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:25.040
It's so interesting-- NASA
compares space sickness--

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:29.060
the bad effects on
the body by not having

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.910
an Earth level of
gravity-- to scurvy.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.890
NASA has said that they need
something like sauerkraut.

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:40.380
Sauerkraut didn't cure
anybody of scurvy.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.500
There is no magic bullet
in this scenario, actually.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.010
It did seem that it was
simply having more food,

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.310
whether had Vitamin
C in it or not,

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.310
which people didn't understand
until the 20th century,

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.700
and having a
modified work regimen

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.040
that helped to a certain extent.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.520
Now even people like
James Cook think

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.485
that the land cure
works, that earthsickness

00:44:04.485 --> 00:44:07.520
is the best way of
describing scurvy.

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:11.140
He would order his men, whenever
they made land, go for walk,

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.580
pick greens, and eat them.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:14.620
That probably helped, too.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.502
Not for the reasons he
thought, but that probably

00:44:17.502 --> 00:44:18.335
would have assisted.

00:44:18.335 --> 00:44:20.515
If they can make land
frequently enough to do that,

00:44:20.515 --> 00:44:21.181
that would help.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.130
Yeah, scurvy is a bad disease.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.090
Must be sad.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:30.127
Sorry, you had another question.

00:44:30.127 --> 00:44:31.210
AUDIENCE: I did, actually.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.940
I was curious to the gas light.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.090
I haven't read "Around
the World in 80 Days."

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.890
I should go back to it.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.370
But the gas light, one of the
interesting about gas light,

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.690
is that it stays on.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.660
Like a candle.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.510
Is that used as a metaphor
that candles burn down and gas

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:51.520
lights don't?

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.520
JOYCE CHAPLIN: It doesn't
mention it explicitly,

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.580
but obviously, everyone
reading the novel in 1872

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.450
would have understood that.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:00.935
Why Phileas Fogg didn't a friend
or neighbor or housekeeper

00:45:00.935 --> 00:45:02.986
to turn the darn thing off--

00:45:02.986 --> 00:45:05.954
AUDIENCE: Yeah, could
have texted him.

00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:08.120
JOYCE CHAPLIN: Telegraph,
it was called at the time.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:12.350
But it's a great running
joke-- the cost, pennies

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:13.570
and pennies and pennies.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.690
And poor Passepartout
is calculating them.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:18.697
What is he paying me,
and will that cover it?

00:45:18.697 --> 00:45:20.780
There's a great illustration
of the very end where

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.380
he's slumped in a chair reading
the bill, which sort of scrolls

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.550
down all over the floor.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.890
They never give an estimate
of how much Fogg has spent,

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:32.490
though clearly by the
end it's catastrophic.

00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.790
He's just throwing
money at people

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.650
who can take him
on the next leg.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:41.580
The gas lamp is a calculation
of how an ordinary person would

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.369
think of that.

00:45:42.369 --> 00:45:44.077
It's a kind of brilliant
stroke, I think,

00:45:44.077 --> 00:45:47.057
if he would have that
imaginative touch

00:45:47.057 --> 00:45:47.723
to keep a tally.

00:45:51.454 --> 00:45:52.370
I recommend the novel.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:56.590
Thank you.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.090
Thanks so much.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.240
[APPLAUSE]
