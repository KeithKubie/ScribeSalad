in the power of technology i think

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
in the power of technology i think
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.650
in the power of technology i think
particularly if you look at the history

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
particularly if you look at the history
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.830
particularly if you look at the history
of human endeavor you could write that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840
of human endeavor you could write that
 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.069

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
with the internet for example I think
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.869
with the internet for example I think
that has been a tremendous tremendous

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879
that has been a tremendous tremendous
 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.720
that has been a tremendous tremendous

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
force that has affected the way we have
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.130

developed as species I think the other

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
developed as species I think the other
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.160
developed as species I think the other
would be the move away from subsistence

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170
would be the move away from subsistence
 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.090

creating a greater comfort in the way we
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.340
creating a greater comfort in the way we
live but I think also in allowing us the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
live but I think also in allowing us the
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.660

leisure time that allows us as humans to

leisure time that allows us as humans to
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.749

in higher education in the United States

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
in higher education in the United States
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.219
in higher education in the United States
has been has really been several things

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
has been has really been several things
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.080
has been has really been several things
actually now that I think about it the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
actually now that I think about it the
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.359
actually now that I think about it the
first I think was the commitment really

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
first I think was the commitment really
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.219
first I think was the commitment really
from the very beginning of this country

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
from the very beginning of this country
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.190
from the very beginning of this country
to free public education that I think

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
to free public education that I think
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.039
to free public education that I think
was a revolutionary idea in some

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
was a revolutionary idea in some
 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.600
was a revolutionary idea in some
respects and I think it is one that has

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
respects and I think it is one that has
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.440
respects and I think it is one that has
served the country very well in

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
served the country very well in
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.199
served the country very well in
until relatively recent times and I

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209
until relatively recent times and I
 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.089
until relatively recent times and I
think if I have one concern about how

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099
think if I have one concern about how
 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.680
think if I have one concern about how
that is now playing out today in 2007 I

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690
that is now playing out today in 2007 I
 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.750
that is now playing out today in 2007 I
worry about the enormous difference in

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
worry about the enormous difference in
 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.759
worry about the enormous difference in
the quality of the very best and the

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769
the quality of the very best and the
 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.780
the quality of the very best and the
very worst of our public schools in this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790
very worst of our public schools in this
 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.720
very worst of our public schools in this
country the gap between what happens in

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
country the gap between what happens in

Princeton High School and what happens

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610
Princeton High School and what happens
 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.850
Princeton High School and what happens
in the high schools in Trenton which are

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860
in the high schools in Trenton which are
 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.289
in the high schools in Trenton which are
just 20 miles away our night and day and

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299
just 20 miles away our night and day and
 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.630
just 20 miles away our night and day and
I worry about the degree to which are

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
I worry about the degree to which are
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.100
I worry about the degree to which are
striving for free public education has

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110
striving for free public education has
 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.640
striving for free public education has
really been diminished in this country I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650
really been diminished in this country I
 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.770
really been diminished in this country I
think the same thing could be true about

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780
think the same thing could be true about
 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.440
think the same thing could be true about
the great state universities they were

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450
the great state universities they were
 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.059
the great state universities they were
created so that every individual capable

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069
created so that every individual capable
 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.710
created so that every individual capable
of doing work at the university level

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
of doing work at the university level
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.600
of doing work at the university level
would have an opportunity to go to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610
would have an opportunity to go to
 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.800
would have an opportunity to go to
college as those state colleges and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810
college as those state colleges and
 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.390
college as those state colleges and
universities are being financially

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400
universities are being financially
 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.660
universities are being financially
squeezed by their state legislatures

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670
squeezed by their state legislatures
 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.400
squeezed by their state legislatures
they have only one choice and that is to

they have only one choice and that is to
 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.400
they have only one choice and that is to
raise tuition and as they raise tuition
