00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.200
Edmund Burke on: the sublime

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.400
Normally, we hate being made to feel small.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.320
We can't stand being humbled, or reminded of our own insignificance;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.440
we get affronted and resentful.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.440
The 18th century Anglo-Irish philosopher, Edmund Burke, however,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.840
thought that these experiences could be rather wonderful, and quite important too.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.260
To explain what he meant he developed the idea of the sublime

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.640
in a beautiful book called, "A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful",

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.560
first published in England in 1757.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.100
In modern use, sublime just means "very, very nice":

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.180
"a sublime glass of chambertin", "a sublime plate of scrambled eggs with truffles".

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.840
But, this wasn't at all what Burke was interested in, although there is a slight connection.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.760
For Burke, a sublime experience is indeed one that's really nice,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.880
but it's nice for a very strange reason: it makes us feel insignificant.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.700
Burke was obsessed with a range of experiences, that is, sublime experiences,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.000
in which being slightly humiliated is actually something we relish.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.840
He was picking up on a sector of human experience that, up to then, had been totally ignored.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.140
One of his key examples is storms, the vast dark skies oppressive, the wind is horribly powerful,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.620
large trees are overturned, we feel we're nothing in the face of the violence of nature.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.580
But, this helps put things in perspective:

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.600
in comparison with the storm, the familiar irritants of daily life seem less significant.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.860
Something similar happens when we contemplate a huge mountain,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.660
or view the enormous frozen wilderness of the Labrador Coast from the window of an Airbus A380.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.660
Burke also liked vast, momentous stories.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.240
He loved Milton's "Paradise Lost", which describes the cosmic struggle between God and Satan,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.340
because stories like these also make the irksome details of ordinary life seem, for a moment, almost idiotically minor.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.220
Burke is latching onto a good way of being made to feel small.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.780
He's noticing that when we feel small in some ways, we become good and large in other dimensions:

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.940
bits of our egoism and pride seem less impressive,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.600
so we might be moved to be more tolerant â€“ less wrapped up in our own concerns.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.520
Burke saw the sublime as a useful corrective;

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.640
it restores perspective, and that's why we like it.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.480
It's a psychological maneuver that can benefit us in many ways,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.380
and shows its utility whenever there's an excessive tendency to get caught up in the details of an immediate situation.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.160
Thanks to Edmund Burke, a little, but valuable area of experience gained a name.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.740
It became possible to focus on it, and see its role in life more clearly.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.900
The sublime emerged, at first, in connection with nature and the arts,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.280
but its contribution to existence is actually quite broad:

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.520
we don't just need the sublime on holiday, or in an art gallery, which are, unfortunately, the places we're liable to encounter it;

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.760
it's something we need to build into our lives on a daily basis.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.380
In the Utopia, there would be deliberate strategies to ensure we encounter the sublime on a regular basis.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.780
In the past, religions were quite careful to set up a meeting with the sublime every Sunday.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.780
After a week in a factory, or the office, or caught up in domestic life,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.360
everyone would be confronted with ideas of internal grandeur:

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.680
a God who loves the world so much that he sacrifices his only son for our salvation,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.600
architecture that asserted the heritage of a thousand years and music calculated to make us feel part of the whole of humanity.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.860
But, for almost everyone that resource is no longer available.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.380
We're collectively in need of new occasions to meet the sublime in a reliable frequent way

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:58.420
so that we can be made to feel small in the most helpful way on a regular basis.
