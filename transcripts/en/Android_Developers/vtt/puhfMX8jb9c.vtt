00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.740
When your app gets some
super cool new information

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.320
that your user might like,
how can it share that info

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.720
without being disruptive?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.470
I'm Joanna Smith, and
I'm here to tell you

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.050
how Snackbar just might
change your life forever,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.060
or your app at least.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.380
One of the finer points of
communicating information

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.880
in your application has to do
with on-screen notifications,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.540
but when that information is
critical or requires the user

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.610
to make a decision, you
probably want to use an alert.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.140
Historically, you had two
approaches here-- first,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.320
a dialog could present
information to the user

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.190
that they would then act on.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.220
But dialogs are interruptive
and force the users

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.700
to stop what they are doing
and deal with your dialog.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.810
I mean, do you enjoy
being interrupted?

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.420
Do you love confirming
that you really

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.260
wanted to do the thing
that you were doing?

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.680
Do just like push dialogs?

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.840
I mean, this is kind
of annoying, isn't it?

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.910
So dialogs should really
be used sparingly,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.739
which brings us around to the
second approach-- Toast, which

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.280
you can use to confirm that the
thing that the user was doing

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.530
really did happen.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.630
But what if the action was
destructive like a deletion?

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.570
Your user might not
have meant to do that,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.820
and now they are panicking
and looking for the undo

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.430
and wondering why you didn't
double check before deleting

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.040
that super cute pic.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.710
OMG.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.300
Are you trying to ruin my life?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.440
And that is where the
Snackbar comes in.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.841
Snackbars are
similar to a Toast,

00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:14.590
but they're more
versatile in that they're

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.250
interactive like offering
that undo your user

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.705
is still searching for.

00:01:18.705 --> 00:01:21.080
A Snackbar animates upward
from the bottom of the screen,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.250
and you can swipe
it away, or not.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.220
If you do nothing, it
will time out on its own

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.494
and automatically
disappear, and Snackbars

00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:29.160
contain a short string
message, and they

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.750
can offer a single
action, such as an undo.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.360
So now you have
three components that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.906
will help you interrupt your
users in the perfect way.

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:37.530
Use the dialog when
the user's response

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.070
is critical to your app
flow, because you need to be

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.550
disruptive in these moments.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.250
But use a Toast to give a
user a tidbit of information

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.120
that doesn't change anything.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.130
And for everything in
between, the Snackbar

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.090
is your new best friend.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.490
And so there you have it--
another great material design

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.465
principle brought
to life in your app.

00:01:54.465 --> 00:01:56.090
So check out the
Design Library for all

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.610
of the support you need
to introduce Snackbars

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.580
to your own app, and
have fun in the world

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.340
of non-disruptive alerts.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
But most importantly, just
continue to build better apps.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.690
