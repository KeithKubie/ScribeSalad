00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.120
To finish off the section on exponent methods. let's look at an interest

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:10.030
problem. let's say that Grant puts $1000 in an account that receives 3% interest

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.760
per year compounded yearly. How long is it going to take for him to have $1250

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.910
in the account? Well, let's remember that equation that we used for calculating

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.170
compound interest before. It was A equals P times 1 plus r over n to the nt.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.600
Here A is equal to the money in the account. P is equal to the principal, the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
amount initially invested. R is the interest rate per year written as a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.490
decimal. N is the number of times interest is compounded each year. And t is

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.960
equal to the number of years that have passed. So, what we really need to come

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.150
up with right now is an equation for A after t years, of course, making it fit

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.649
this situation. Please write that in here.
