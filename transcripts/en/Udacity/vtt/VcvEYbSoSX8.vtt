00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We'd calculated the circumference of the earth.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That's a huge accomplishment but now let's move on. Let's calculate the size of the moon.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here I've drawn a little diagram of what's going on with the earth, the moon, and the sun.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now keep in mind that this is not the scale at all.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In fact the sun should be way, way, way bigger and way, way, way farther off the screen.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In fact if I drew this right, these rays would all be more or less completely parallel.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The idea behind measuring the size of the moon is we can exploit the fact that lunar eclipses occur.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, what's a lunar eclipse? Well, here's the sun and here are few of its rays which I've traced.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You can see that if you were in your spaceship flying around over here or here or there,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you'd would be illuminated, you would be in the sun's rays

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and everything would be bright and wonderful.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
As soon as you got behind the earth, however, things get dark. You're in the earth's shadow.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The same things happens to the moon.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What we want to do is figure out how big is the moon compared to the earth

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
since we know the size of the earth already.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Can we fit one, two, three moons in one earth shadow?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If that were the case, then the moon would be one-third the size of the earth

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
or is it two moons in the earth shadow or seven or 12--I don't know, let's figure that out.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
How are we going to answer this question, "How many moons fit in the earths shadow?"

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
All we're going to do is time how long the moon spins in the earth's shadow,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
how long we can't see it for during a total lunar eclipse.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The longer time it spins, the smaller the moon is compared to the earth.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Once we know how much time the moon spins in the earth shadow,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I can convert that into moon widths, let's call it.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What I mean by a moon width? I mean this distance here. That's one moon width.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We have to know how long does it take the moon to move from here

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
over to here, to move one moon width in its orbit.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
We can answer that by noting the fact that the moon has an angular size

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in the sky of about half a degree. What do I mean by that?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If you're standing on earth and if you first look at the top of the moon

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
then look at the bottom of the moon, this angle here is 0.5 degrees.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We also know that it takes 28 days for one complete orbit.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
In 28 days, it's gone 360 degrees so that means it's gone 720 moon widths since each width

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is only a half a degree and 720 is twice 360 which means 28 days per 720 moon widths,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and if we do some unit conversion that works out to be 0.93 hours for one moon width.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Every 0.93 hours, the moon has moved one width over.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So it's gone from here to here or from here to here, etc.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now, I'm just going to give you the data.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm going to tell you what we can observe, and you're going to have to do

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
some thinking and probably some unit conversion to answer this question.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The observed fact is the following.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The moon spins 205 minutes in eclipse and what do I mean for the moon to be in eclipse?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Well, we start the eclipse timer when the moon is completely in the earth shadow

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and end it just as it's leaving the earth shadow.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Okay, we know the moon takes 0.93 hours to go one moon width and we know

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it spins 205 minutes in eclipse and we know earth's circumference is equal to 40,000 kilometers.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Now I think you can answer the question--now how many moons fits in the earth shadow?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Do it one step better,"What is the circumference of the moon?"

00:03:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter you're answer here in kilometers.
