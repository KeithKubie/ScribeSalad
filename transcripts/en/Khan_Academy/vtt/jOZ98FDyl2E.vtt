00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:01.843
- [Voiceover] Let's get
some practice comparing

00:00:01.843 --> 00:00:03.862
and computing rates.

00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:06.997
So they tell us the pet
store has three fish tanks,

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:09.667
each holding a different volume of water

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:11.735
and a different number of fish.

00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:16.495
So Tank A has five fish, and
it has 40 liters of water,

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:19.791
Tank B, 12 fish, 100 liters of water,

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.914
and Tank C, 23 fish, and
it has 180 liters of water.

00:00:23.914 --> 00:00:27.035
Order the tanks by volume per fish

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.033
from least to greatest.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:33.537
So let's think about what volume per fish,

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:36.834
and we could think about this
as volume divided by fish.

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.901
Volume per fish.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:40.897
All right, so here for Tank A,

00:00:40.897 --> 00:00:45.031
it's going to be 40 liters

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:46.935
for every five fish.

00:00:46.935 --> 00:00:50.558
40 for every five fish, and let's see,

00:00:50.558 --> 00:00:52.458
40 over five is eight,

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.818
so you have eight liters per fish,

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:58.638
is the rate at which they
have to add water per fish

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:00.247
for Tank A.

00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:05.146
Now, Tank B, you have 100 liters

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:08.166
for 12 fish,

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.574
so what is this going to be?

00:01:09.574 --> 00:01:12.964
This is going to be, 12
goes into 100 eight times,

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:16.748
so eight times 12 is 96, and
then you have four left over.

00:01:16.748 --> 00:01:20.393
So this is going to be eight and 4/12,

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:25.385
or eight and 1/3 liters per fish.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.846
And all I did is I converted
this improper fraction,

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:31.679
100 over 12, to a mixed
number, and I simplified it.

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.442
12 goes into 100 eight times
with a remainder of four,

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:35.812
so it's eight and 4/12,

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.109
which is the same thing as eight and 1/3.

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.618
And then finally in Tank C,

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:42.892
I have 180 liters

00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:47.482
for 23 fish.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:48.546
So what is this going to be?

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:52.875
23 goes into 180. Let me
try to calculate this.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:57.286
23 goes into 180, it looks like it's going

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:58.378
to be less than nine times.

00:01:58.378 --> 00:01:59.817
Is it eight times?

00:01:59.817 --> 00:02:01.628
Eight times, no, not eight times.

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:03.230
Let's see, seven times.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.085
Seven times three is 21,
seven times two is 14,

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:09.592
plus two is 16.

00:02:09.592 --> 00:02:12.216
When you subtract you
get a remainder of 19.

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:15.119
So this is going to be seven
with a remainder of 19,

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.818
or you could say this is seven

00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:21.188
and 19/23 liters

00:02:21.188 --> 00:02:22.898
per fish.

00:02:22.898 --> 00:02:24.291
So which one has,

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:26.751
we're going to order the
tanks by volume per fish,

00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:28.377
from least to greatest,

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:31.511
so Tank B has the largest volume per fish,

00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:34.460
has eight and 1/3 liters per fish,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.295
so this is in first place.

00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:38.687
And then Tank A is in second place.

00:02:38.687 --> 00:02:40.753
Tank A is in second place.

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:45.188
And then Tank C is in third place.

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:47.250
Oh, actually we wanna go
from least to greatest,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.268
so this is, let me write it this way.

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:51.678
This is Tank C is the least,

00:02:51.678 --> 00:02:55.628
and Tank A is the greatest.

00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:57.749
So we really have to
swap this order around.

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.305
Now, I just copied and pasted this

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:00.513
from the Khan Academy exercises.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.020
Let me actually bring
the actual exercise up,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.436
and I can rearrange it.

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:06.154
C was the least,

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:09.804
and B was the most,

00:03:09.804 --> 00:03:11.564
and we check our answer
and we got it right.
