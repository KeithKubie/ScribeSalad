ALEX KAMMERLING: OK, well,
thank you very much for

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.970
turning out to hear me talk.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.620
It's a real honor
to be at Google.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.173
If it wasn't for Google, I think
I would have had to have

00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:21.920
gone to the library to research
some of this stuff,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.710
or spoken to a real person.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.580
So, thanks to Google, most of
this research was done with

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.220
your search engine.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.830
Thank you very much.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.090
So I guess I should probably
start with introducing myself.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.790
My name is Alex Kammerling.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.250
My background is bar tending.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.580
I started almost 20 years ago,
and actually was an artist.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.780
I was a sculptor and worked in
bars to pay my rent, and had

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.580
far more success making
cocktails for people than in

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.970
selling art to people.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.040
Anyway, so as life takes you on
these courses, and I ended

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.350
up channeling creativity
into making cocktails.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.310
And it was one of my fortes.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.440
I went on to design lots of
cocktails for brands.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.330
I went into a cocktail book for
the BBC, and then went on

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.620
to do a bit of journalism.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.760
I still work for different
brands, such as Grey Goose

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.430
vodka, Millers gin, Appleton
rum and Campari.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.070
So I've been around.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.740
But actually, it was when I
was working for a brand of

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.680
gin, called Millers, and I was
talking about training.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.490
I was training bartenders and
doing these consumer talks

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.570
about the histories
of spirits.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.090
And I would talk about the
history of gin and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.240
the history of vodka.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660
And at some point in this
history, I'd talk about how

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.100
alcohol was being used
medicinally.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.180
Then I thought, what happened
to healthy booze?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.540
So I went off and I developed my
own brand of spirit, which

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.910
is what you're drinking
right now.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.730
I'll tell you about it later.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.430
But actually first, I'm just
going to talk to you about

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.970
this history of alcohol as
medicine, because I think it's

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.570
fascinating, and I hope
that you do, too.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.750
If you have any questions, we'll
do the first bit of the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.990
talk, and then I'll make some
cocktails and demonstrate some

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050
of the drinks that you can make
with it, just in little

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.890
small ones, I'm afraid.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.830
You won't be stumbling
out of here too

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.400
drunk, just little samples.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.260
If you've got any questions,
then please ask me at the end.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.960
In the beginning,
there was booze.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
As soon as alcohol had been
discovered, it was used for

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.210
medicinal practice and
as a medicine itself.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.669
And if you look at alcohol on
a very simple level, it's

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.150
antiseptic, it anesthetizes, and
it increases well-being.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.770
In early operations, if you
had a gangrenous leg that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.540
needed removing, they would
get you blind drunk before

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.020
they hacked it off
with a blunt saw.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.120
Wouldn't take away much of the
pain, but it would help.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.070
And then they'd use alcohol
on the wound

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.750
afterwards to clean it.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.930
And there's of course,
the oldest toast,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.110
let's drink to health.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.590
Now we forget alcohol
is natural.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.980
Fermentation is a
natural process.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.090
It's yeast feeding on
sugars, which turn

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.020
into CO2 and alcohol.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.390
It's how beer and it's
how wine is made.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.560
What we don't realize is while
alcohol is actually produced

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.630
in our stomach, that
fermentation process happens

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.830
in our stomach all the time.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.810
Some people have it more than
others, so their liver is

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.420
quite used to processing
alcohol.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.695
It's one of the jobs
of the liver.

00:02:52.695 --> 00:02:55.580
It's only when we overload it
with too much alcohol that it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.400
becomes a bit stressed, and that
causes lots of problems.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.140
One of my favorite quotes,
"I've taken more out of

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.340
alcohol than alcohol has taken
out of me." Winston Churchill.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.410
Humans are not the only
creatures that

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.240
like to drink alcohol.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.460
Don't know if you saw this
in the news last year.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.955
This is elk that got drunk,
because it was eating

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:15.130
fermenting apples.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.530
So animals are attracted
to the high

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.650
calorific content of alcohol.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.530
An elephant can smell the
rotting fruit of a marula tree

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.220
from 10 kilometers away.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.056
And if you give an elephant
alcohol, it drinks more when

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.300
its stress levels are higher.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.125
Same as humans, we all drink a
little bit more when we're a

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.780
bit more stressed.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.380
So I want to talk
about nature.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.260
Let's talk about herbal medicine
first of all, then

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.270
we'll talk about the
use of alcohol.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.580
Of course, nature goes towards
nature for its drugstore.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.320
If you're an animal, you would
chew a leaf, you'd scratch a

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.220
bark, you'd dig something up,
and you'd naturally gravitate

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.190
towards it.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.910
Chimpanzees are thought to
consume 125 different plant

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.220
varieties in their life, just
to keep them healthy.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.660
So the classic way, once humans
have come along, and we

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.030
can use these as well, of
course, make soups, make teas

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.910
out of them, cook with
them, eat them raw.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.160
But actually, the best way to
extract the oils and the

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.700
alkaloids and the resins that
are contained within plants,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.660
and their medicinal properties,
is to infuse them

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.880
into alcohol.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.595
Alcohol is a solvent.

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:09.800
It breaks those down.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.150
It preserves those properties.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.430
And also alcohol goes into the
blood stream immediately,

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.990
taking that desired effect
to the parts of the body.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.069
Now let's start with alcohol,
first of all.

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.980
Now the first medical records
were from Egypt.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.910
This is the Edwin
Smith papyrus.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.350
It records back to 1,500 BC,
thought to contain information

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.820
that goes back 3,000 BC.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.440
And here is documented various
formulas for childbirth,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.420
including dates and onions and
honey and cow's milk, but they

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.680
used to give beer
to their mothers

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.790
before they gave birth.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.970
You think about it, alcohol
relaxes muscles and takes away

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.670
some of the pain.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.360
And if you're going to have a
small human removed from your

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.270
body, a couple pints of
beer is going to ease

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.793
that process somewhat.

00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:54.220
That's all they had,
unfortunately.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.250
The father of modern medicine,
Hippocrates, he used wine as a

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.430
base for medicine.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.200
And he made something called
vinum Hippocraticum, or

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.150
Hippocratic wine.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.520
And what it was was this local
wine, and local herbs and

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.430
spices and berries and
nuts and peels

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.460
infused into that wine.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.500
Really, it was the first form
of vermouth, but it was his

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.260
cure for intestinal worms.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.100
Now the thing with wine is
it eventually goes off.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.290
But it will extract some of the
properties of the plants.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.120
It will preserve them
to a certain extent.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.790
And wine will go into your
bloodstream much more

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.830
effectively than if you were
making nettle soup.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.410
Nettle wine goes straight in.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.450
But of course, wine goes off.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.650
So it wasn't until the Chinese
came along and invented

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.955
distillation.

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.040
Of course, fermentation
is a natural thing.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.400
Distillation is a man-made
process.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.670
So it means that you're
concentrating the alcohol by

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.560
refining it.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.190
You're heating it up, you're
concentrating the alcohol,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.340
you're reducing the water.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.920
And so you're just making a much
purer form of alcohol.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.570
So what the Chinese did, along
with their traditional Chinese

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.860
herbal medicines, their use of
distillation was put together.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.800
And essentially what
they created

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.410
was the use of tinctures.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.210
So this here is a very small
bottle of echinacea tincture.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.210
Echinacea root infused
into 45% alcohol.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.590
This was just bought from
Neal's Yard Remedies.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.940
So it's 2,000-year-old
information that's still being

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.890
used today, albeit not
as often as it was.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.640
We'll come on to that
in a minute.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.780
So from this point on, alcohol's
been a really useful

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.600
base for medicine.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.100
Now let's just talk about
the Chinese, quickly.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.170
The Chinese were the
first alchemists.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.390
They believed in
transmutation.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.330
Transmutation was turning
one thing into another.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.160
So turning lead into
gold, for example.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.840
They believed that if you
ingested gold, you lived a

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.230
longer, happier life.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.560
They also believed if you
ingested mercury, you lived a

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.090
longer, happier life.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.760
So take with a little bit
of pinch of salt.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.020
But they were finding
distillation.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.000
They were turning wines and
beers into spirits.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.990
They believed in harmony in the
body, yin and yang, and

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.710
the balance and the five
elements were all connected.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.850
The Persians, the Greeks, the
Arabs all went to China to

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.530
learn about this alchemy.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.080
And they brought that through
into the Arab countries where

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.780
the Arabs were making

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.080
perfumes, as well as medicines.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.020
Now eventually, they came
into Western Europe.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.180
And it was the Western European
alchemists that set

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.660
the benchmark for the great
spirits of the world.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.025
This is a lovely painting from
an English painter, kind of at

00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:12.030
the end of the alchemic era.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.060
But what I like about it is just
the way that the light is

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.890
shining down.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.700
It's beautifully painted.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.040
Being an artist, I
appreciate that.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.195
But you can see this
wizened old man

00:07:21.195 --> 00:07:22.670
leaning down at his flask.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.830
There's almost this divine light
shining down on him.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.060
Because they really believed
that what they were creating

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.980
here had magical properties.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.955
You can see these guys in the
background here-- if my laser

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:34.910
pointer's working--

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.400
the apprentices here, just
making notes, in awe of this

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.840
wise old man.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.060
These guys, the alchemists,
they were the druids, the

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.530
philosophers, the doctors, the
scientists of the day.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.370
And very secretive
bunch of people.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.500
There was no alchemist.com.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.860
You had to learn information
through word of mouth.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.760
He would tell him.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.370
He would grow old and
tell someone else.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.540
So it spread very slowly.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:56.165
They were very secretive.

00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:58.520
They didn't share their
information like what we share

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.190
information today.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.770
And if you had connections
to these guys, it

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.960
was a status symbol.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.210
You drank--

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.690
you got beer, wine and spirits,
because you could.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.070
Because you had these
connections and you were a

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.760
powerful person.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.330
Now at the time, they didn't
realize that alcohol killed

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.760
germs, and they don't realize
that the water was carrying

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.520
the diseases.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.650
So the people that drank more
alcohol than water lived

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.160
longer, which is why the
original spirits were known as

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.020
eau de vie, aqua vitae, and
acquavir, the water of life.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.280
Now gin was one of these
spirits that was

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.809
created as a medicine.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.409
Juniper berries are diuretic.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:40.970
The theory was that these
infused into alcohol would

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.559
extract the oils and the
properties, preserve them,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.250
because they were going on long

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.740
journeys to the West Indies.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.210
And this guy here was a Dutch
university professor who was

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.320
the first person accredited
with making gin.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.430
Sent it to the West Indies.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.710
He thought that by clearing the
bladder, it would clear

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.100
the bloodstream-- or the body--
of dengue fever and

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.650
yellow fever, and all the other
tropical diseases they

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.110
were getting.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.570
Of course, it doesn't.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.540
But it does take very nice with
tonic water, which is

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.850
much better at curing malaria.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.060
And also we had the
apothecaries.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.540
Because the apothecaries, this
is the start of pharmacy here.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.190
And it was really the
commercialization of the

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.280
alchemic arts.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.840
So you can see here, this
is in the 1400's.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.420
So you've got someone taking
a prescription here.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.440
You got this guy just grinding
down in his special

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.570
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.650
Someone at the back here
weighing out a prescription.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.330
All these jars and things
in the bottom.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.880
Now apothecary comes from
apothecarios, or storekeeper.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.920
They were storing botanicals,
natural

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.290
botanicals, wines and spirits.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.080
During this period, remember
that the French, the Dutch,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.510
the Spanish were all traveling
the world, colonizing,

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.180
importing clothes and nutmeg and
ginger and mace, and all

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.270
these things that they'd
never seen before.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.390
So suddenly, the apothecaries
had not only their own

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.920
botanicals growing all around
in the countryside, but also

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.390
these exotic botanicals,
as well.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.490
And so this is about how
pharmacy really started.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.800
So we're going to skip
400 years now.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.050
This is a plate from an
apothecary doing exactly the

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.240
same thing.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.930
But it's much more grand,
very ornate.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.410
Beautiful buildings, nice
detailing on it.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.100
And they were really designed to
be attractive places to be.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.480
They were temples to health,
if you like.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.130
During the 1800's, a number of
brands were invented that

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.230
still are around today.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.630
Angostura bitters, invented by
a German doctor to help the

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.860
troops in Venezuela.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.020
Peychaud's bitters here,
which is something that

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.560
you might not see.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.940
This is a bit more of a
bartender's brand, but it's

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.440
bitters created by an apothecary
in New Orleans.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.600
Gaspari Campari was a major
liquor reached in Milan.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.710
And even Coca Cola was invented
as a health drink.

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.816
Coca Cola was sold
in pharmacies.

00:10:40.816 --> 00:10:43.520
It was sold with soda water.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.400
Soda water was believed
to give good health.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.460
And so the Coca Cola concentrate
was mixed with

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.540
that soda water.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.290
And it was sold as a
restorative, as a pick-me-up.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.860
Nine milligrams of cocaine in
each serve does help pick you

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.060
every day, I find.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.720
Interestingly, the alcohol-- the
temperance movement came

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.550
to America before--

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:04.930
came to Atlanta before
the rest of America.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.880
And they said, no, no, no, you
can't have alcohol in here.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.650
Alcohol was bad.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.470
So you're OK with the cocaine,
just take the alcohol out.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:16.030
So for years they had cocaine
and not the alcohol.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.940
Next up, we've got more
apothecaries.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.146
Now this is, for me as an
ex-bartender, this is where it

00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:22.550
starts to get very interesting,
because we've got

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.680
the grey area of pharmacy and
bar tending all kind of

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.280
converging.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.970
And cocktail culture was
really developed

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.670
through this time.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.370
Now I don't know if anyone of
you like drinking cocktail

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.360
bars, but there's a number of
cocktail bars that look very

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.730
much like this, these days,
whistling shop, if you ever go

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.060
to [INAUDIBLE], Speakeasy style
is very fashionable at

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.790
the moment.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.620
This is a defining photo for me,
because look at this guy

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.870
behind the counter here.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.310
White jacket and tie.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.130
I don't know if anyone's ever
been to 69 Corporate Row, but

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.000
this is exactly what they
wear behind the bar.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.540
If you look on the counter here,
straws, glasses, bitters

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.620
bottles, up here Coca Cola
sign, lots of jars and

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.960
infusions and things going on.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.750
But look at these two guys
here, just quite relaxed,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.630
hanging out, a table, glass
in front of them.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.130
They're having a drink
in their pharmacy.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.430
If you wouldn't ever go into
booths and just track a bottle

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.175
of Benylin, you'd
get arrested.

00:12:13.175 --> 00:12:16.150
But this was how people were
taking their medicine.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.030
Of course, what helps
medicine go down?

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.790
Spoonful of sugar.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.160
Spoonful of sugar helps
the medicine go down.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.970
Bitters, like these things,
were not very nice by

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:26.950
themselves.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.870
You add some sugar, you add some
spirit, you heat it up or

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.710
you cool it down with ice, and
you've got a cocktail.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.400
And this is how cocktail
culture was developed.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.370
This is a very old drink,
the Sazerac.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.800
But before we talk about that,
let's talk about this.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.610
The 1896 definition of a
cocktail is a mixture of

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.155
spirits of any kind, water,
sugar and bitters.

00:12:45.155 --> 00:12:47.110
The important bit here
is the bitters.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.430
To make that palatable and to
make a nice drink, add some

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.050
spirit, add some water
and some sugar.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.050
Cocktail culture.

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.760
How many people walk into bars
and still say, I'll just have

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.230
a little one, for medicinal
purposes?

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.300
So there are huge amounts of
bitter brands on the market.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.640
This one here, although it's
got Montreal on the label,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.690
this was Stoughton's bitters.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.262
This is a coffee, actually.

00:13:08.262 --> 00:13:11.130
Stoughton's bitters was one of
the first patented medicines

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:11.810
in this country.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.982
It was patented in 1712, before
the word cocktail had

00:13:15.982 --> 00:13:18.970
even been defined, this was
being mixed with brandy as a

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.170
kind of restorative.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.480
So most of these brands
were stomach bitters.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.810
I won't mention this one here.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.090
Let's go past that, if
this is being filmed.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.530
But anyway, the bitters were
generally stomach-based.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.130
The idea was that the bitterness
would get the

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.640
gastric juices flowing, so the
food, when it hit the stomach,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.940
would help you digest the food,
and the nutrients from

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.155
the food would get absorbed
into the bloodstream.

00:13:40.155 --> 00:13:42.770
That was the theory.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:45.200
Now there was a little bit of--
during Prohibition, these

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.390
things weren't banned because
of their medicinal values.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.910
There was also a small movement
from the doctors,

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.020
really, because the doctors at
the time had been prescribing

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.210
alcohol as part of their--
one of their medicines.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.790
If they came in for surgery and
they said, doctor, doctor,

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.620
I'm really stressed, for
whatever reason it was, they

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.956
would say, go home,
have a couple of

00:14:03.956 --> 00:14:05.840
whiskeys, you'll be OK.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.390
But there was growing paranoia
in America about alcohol.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.670
People weren't really sure about
whether it was safe or

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.300
[INAUDIBLE], because the
temperance movement was so

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.745
big, and obviously, led
to Prohibition.

00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:17.240
So 13 years without alcohol.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.460
But the small little loophole
was, for a few months, you

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.765
could actually get alcohol
in prescription.

00:14:21.765 --> 00:14:23.870
If you could find a doctor that
was willing to fill you

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.570
out forms and say, yes, this man
has got chronic stress, he

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.210
must have whiskey every evening,
you could actually

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.380
get anything that was being
confiscated back in.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.370
So something happens here,
which completely

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.940
revolutionized the way that
medicine is created.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.590
And I think this is why we are
so paranoid about alcohol

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.840
these days.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.610
So the story of aspirin.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.580
Aspirin comes from two
natural botanicals,

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.110
meadow sweet and willow.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.500
The active ingredient
is salicylic acid.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.820
Now meadow and willow sweet--

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.180
meadow sweet and willow have
been used as pain relief for

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:04.150
thousands of years, infusions
of wines made into teas and

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.610
tinctures and all sorts.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.280
A German company called Bayer,
you may have heard of them,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.010
they found a way to synthesize
the salicylic acid without

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.145
needing the natural botanicals
anymore.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:15.910
So managed to chemically
replicate this, and they

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.890
invented aspirin, without
needing these anymore, and

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.580
also without needing
the alcohol.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.820
And of course, they
patented aspirin.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.720
You can patent aspirin, but
you can't patent nature.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.990
Put a huge amount of
money into the

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:28.960
pharmaceutical industry.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.020
It's now worth $350 billion,
something like that.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.770
Of course, anything that's gone
before is old fashioned.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:35.460
It's outdated.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.790
It's not right.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.020
I'm not a herbal medical
practitioner by any stretch,

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.030
but what I'm interested in
is the lack of alcohol.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.000
You didn't need it anymore.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.170
Suddenly, you needed alcohol to
extract these botanicals,

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.130
and with the invention of modern
pharmacy, you didn't

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:49.640
need it anymore.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.570
So it just slowly started dying
out, and no one really

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.820
raised an eyebrow.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.350
Guinness is good for you.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.630
This is how it was advertised
for years and years.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.840
An actual fact, the NHS used to
give every mother who gave

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.050
birth a bottle of Guinness.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.860
Fascinating, isn't it?

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.040
Until the mid-1980s.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.550
Someone in procurement was,
yes, 10,000 swabs, 50,000

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.650
needles, 2 palettes
of Guinness.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.665
I just find it amazing that the
NHS were buying Guinness.

00:16:17.665 --> 00:16:19.450
Of course, the only alcohol
you're going to find these

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.610
days in a hospital is in the
antiseptic hand gel.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.450
This is an interesting
shot which you

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.670
don't see very often.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.610
It's funny, this.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.910
This is a few years ago.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.315
It was published in 2006.

00:16:31.315 --> 00:16:33.790
The American Medical Association
published it.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.070
It was a study from 34 different
countries, one

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:36.820
million subjects.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.870
And it looked at drinkers and
non-drinkers and the general

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.570
mortality rate.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.250
Here's your death rate,
along here.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.830
You've got number of units of
alcohol consumed a day.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.850
The solid line here
is for a man.

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:51.670
Dotted line here
is for a woman.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.300
Now you can see, as soon as
you have half a unit of

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.980
alcohol a day, your death rate
goes down, or your life

00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.840
expectancy goes up.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.830
According to this, and this is
obviously a fairly broad

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.180
statement, but a man can have
3 and 1/2 units of alcohol

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.681
every day and still be better
off than abstaining.

00:17:08.681 --> 00:17:09.849
That's what that says.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:13.119
That's what that says.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.780
Now the reason why you don't see
that is because obviously

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.119
people are silly, and
they think, oh

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.040
yes, alcohol is fine.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.859
We can drink as much
as we want.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.000
Of course, you cannot.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.819
It's about moderation.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:27.430
Now there are loads of health
benefits to alcohol.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.300
Here's a few.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.570
There's been tons and tons
of research done on it.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.860
Unfortunately, most of these
institutions don't put their

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.210
neck on the line and say,
actually, if you're going to

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.530
have a drink a day, you're
going to be all right.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.180
There's a chance you're
going to be OK.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.850
It's been associated with a
reduction in risk of kidney,

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.630
thyroid cancer, Alzheimer's,
stroke, diabetes, and even

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.220
catching a common
cold is rescued

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.630
from moderate drinking.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.140
There's one institution
that does--

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.590
the British [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.780
they do say that it's-- well,
the interesting thing here is

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.200
the word may.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.010
Drinking small amounts, one to
two units of any alcoholic

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.200
drink, regularly may offer some
protection against heart

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.140
disease, especially in men aged
over 40 and women who

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.840
have been through
the menopause.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.580
Now most of the research that's
done hasn't been of a

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.530
whole generation, so they're
all fairly short.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.750
So you have to take the older
generation, because they're

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.040
the ones that are dying off.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.830
So it might still work
for people under 40.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.625
I'm getting near to that point,
as well, so I certainly

00:18:20.625 --> 00:18:22.490
am going to be having one
to two units a day.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.890
Alcohol basically thins the
blood and helps the clots.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.020
So heart disease is, along with
cancer, pretty much neck

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.630
and neck as the number one
killer in this country.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.030
An interesting statistic that I
saw recently that came from

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.890
America that said that if all
of the drinkers in America

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.560
stopped drinking, there'd be
80,000 more deaths in America.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:47.610
Have a look.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.780
Google it.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:50.880
Google it.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.480
That's quite interesting.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.840
So here's a couple of quotes
on my last slide, before I

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.930
make some cocktails.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.540
So this first quote comes from
a university professor in

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.845
Tennessee who's an addiction
specialist looking at family

00:19:01.845 --> 00:19:03.430
medicine, especially
with alcohol.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.910
So "alcohol is accurately viewed
as beneficial nutrition

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.340
that prolongs life and enhances
a gracious and joyful

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.760
lifestyle for some, and is
equally and accurately

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.360
recognized as a life destroying,
multi-system toxin

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:14.920
for others.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.700
Nowhere in medicine is the
double-edged sword so sharp on

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.240
both sides." Thank you,
John, for that.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.100
Very good.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.020
This comes from the UK
Department of Health, which

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.030
they are reviewing, this
might not be--

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.430
this might be changing
quite soon.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.650
But currently, this is the UK
Department of Health's, from

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.920
the Sensible Drinking Report.
"Middle aged or elderly

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.220
non-drinkers may wish to
consider the possibility that

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.000
light drinking might be of
benefit to their overall

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.900
health and life expectancy."

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.960
Of course, again, the very
English way to say, if you

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.940
have a drink a day, you'll
probably be alright.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.060
So I don't know about
you, but I will

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.310
certainly drink to that.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.050
Right.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:55.310
Before I make the cocktails,
if you have got portable

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.530
communication devices, follow
me on Twitter or like my

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.768
Facebook page.

00:19:59.768 --> 00:20:00.266
Thank you very much.

00:20:00.266 --> 00:20:09.898
[APPLAUSE]
