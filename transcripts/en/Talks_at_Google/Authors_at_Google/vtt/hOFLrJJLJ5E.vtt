SPEAKER: Can you
give us a back story

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.340
on what led you to write
"Feminist Fight Club"

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.420
and also how you came up with
all the amazing nomenclature

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.860
in the book?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.130
JESSICA BENNETT: I really
like puns as you will see.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.920
So as Melissa mentioned in my
very long, maybe too long bio,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.340
I am in a real life
feminist fight club.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.290
And a number of the
women are in the video.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.190
But it's essentially
a group of creatives.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.720
We are journalists and
writers and comics.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.810
And we began meeting
about a decade ago

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.030
when we were just
starting our careers.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.620
We're all in New York City.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.150
And most of us were in very
white male-dominated fields.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.620
And we were struggling.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.010
We were frustrated.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.690
And we didn't know what we could
be doing better to get ahead.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.050
We often questioned whether
what we were experiencing

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.790
was actually sexism or something
more individual or personal.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.790
And so we would gather
about once a month

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.630
in one of our member's parents'
houses, because we couldn't

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.350
put that many people in any
of our tiny studio apartments.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.270
And we would just
talk about what

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.550
was going on for
us at work and try

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.150
to provide support and offer
each other advice on how

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.030
we might try to combat
some of the issues.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.130
So the feminist
fight club was real.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.490
And back then, the first
rule of the fight club was

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.070
like in real fight club--

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.790
that you didn't
talk about the club.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.710
And that was funny, but
also for real reasons, which

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.510
were that a lot of the
women in the group,

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.884
who were working
at media outlets

00:06:38.884 --> 00:06:42.100
and different
organizations, did fear

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.980
that if word got out that they
were in what was essentially

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.930
a feminist consciousness
raising group,

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.800
they would be either stigmatized
or potentially penalized.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.260
And so we didn't
talk about the club.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.510
But lo and behold, here I am.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.410
So the rules have changed.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.140
And now the first
rule of the fight club

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.970
is you must talk
about the fight club.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.900
SPEAKER: Love it.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.670
So at the beginning
of the book, you

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.400
kind of admit that the tone
of the book is really light.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.070
And you know, it's very
friendly and casual.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.140
There are a lot of swear words.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.270
So I'm just wondering--
and that's not

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.700
to say that it's lacking
in data or substance

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.200
or seriousness of subject.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.034
So why did you decide
to write in this tone?

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:21.949
JESSICA BENNETT: Yeah,
I mean on the one hand,

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.090
it sort of is my tone.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.220
I can't speak without
swearing apparently.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.840
And as a journalist, I've sort
of come up on the internet.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.290
So I wanted to speak
to young people

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.930
in their language, which
is also my language.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.800
And I felt like I've been
working on and writing

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.240
about these issues
for a number of years.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.000
But I often was focused on the
problem, not on the solution.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.930
And throughout my work with
Lean In and other outlets,

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.600
I always end up reading all
of these academic studies--

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.030
that buried somewhere in page 19
there's some little fight move

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.420
or solution for how to
combat a 'manterrupter' or a

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.590
'mansplainer.'

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.810
But it's not used
in that language.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.490
And so I kept
thinking to myself,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.280
if there was some way to just
pull this stuff out and put it

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.520
into a format that was fun
to read and digestible,

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.550
but also really practical
and rooted in research,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.160
then it would provide a
service that, frankly, I

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.920
wish I had when I was
starting my career.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.170
And so I hope that
there's something

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.850
in this book for
everyone but I wanted

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.950
to speak in a language
that was light.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.740
And you know, sexism
is not a fun topic,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.720
but it can be fun to read about.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.909
SPEAKER: So speaking
about those tactics,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.260
those are more of those
individual or personal tactics

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.570
versus policy or
institutional changes.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.829
Why did you decide to focus on
those individual level tactics?

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:46.370
JESSICA BENNETT:
Yeah, I mean I think

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.340
that ultimately dealing
with gender equity

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.020
needs to come from every level.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.680
So it needs to happen
on a policy standpoint,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.500
though currently in our
leadership in this country,

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.690
I'm not very optimistic
that that's going to happen.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.350
It needs to come from a business
and a company standpoint.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.570
But I also think
that I have felt,

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.200
in my career for many years,
that I was frustrated.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.830
And I didn't want to wait
around for HR policies

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:18.320
or legal policies or politics
to solve these problems for me.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.880
Not to mention that a lot of the
forms of sexism we face today

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.560
can't actually be prosecuted
in court or legalized for.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.430
So what do you do?

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.760
Well, there are
actually ways that we

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.010
can fight back against
some of this stuff

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.690
in our everyday lives.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.820
And it doesn't have
to feel overwhelming.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.900
Some of these are small things.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.030
But we can do it on
behalf of ourselves.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.170
And we can do it on behalf
of our fellow women.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.420
And so I wanted
something that felt

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.070
like I had agency, that would
allow me to engage and try

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.900
to work towards a larger, more
equal world and more equal work

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.610
place that I could do every day.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.350
And so I certainly recognize
the need for policy change

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.720
and change from a
corporate level,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.250
but if you feel overwhelmed
in your daily environment,

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.570
and you're constantly being
interrupted when you speak,

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.607
there are things you
can do to solve that.

00:10:13.607 --> 00:10:15.440
SPEAKER: So I want to
talk a little bit more

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.330
about those forms
of sexism that you

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.400
talk about a lot in the book.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.840
You call it death by
1,000 cuts type of sexism.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.260
It's the insidious, casual,
politically correct,

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:32.380
even friendly sexism or
racism that people experience.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.140
And that is in contrast
with an overt, clear cut

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.620
discrimination, like you said,
that has a legal definition.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.420
So why is this kind of
subtle sexism so much harder

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.870
to report, so much harder
to fix, and so much easier

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.820
to dismiss?

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.600
JESSICA BENNETT: I think because
often we've internalized it

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.480
in a lot of ways.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.190
I know this is Silicon Valley.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.290
We talk about unconscious
bias a lot here.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.790
I probably don't
need to define that

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.956
for the people in this room.

00:10:59.956 --> 00:11:04.160
But once upon a time,
sexism was very overt.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.340
And so I began my career at
"Newsweek" as a young writer.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.090
And while I was there,
I started facing things

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.960
like pitching an idea and
having it be turned down.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.540
And then seeing it appear
on the pages of the magazine

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.060
under a man's byline
a few weeks later.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.270
Or feeling uncomfortable
speaking up

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.420
in very white
male-dominated meetings.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.320
Or feeling like if I
negotiated for more money

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.200
after finding out that
a man with the same job

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.890
title and description was
making thousands of dollars

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.510
more than me that I would be
perceived as pushy for wanting

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.560
too much.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.260
So it's these subtle things,
whereas the generation prior--

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.270
while I was at
Newsweek, I found out

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.670
about the women who
had actually sued

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.680
that company for
gender discrimination

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.900
in the year 1970.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.000
There's an Amazon series
now about these women

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.620
called "The Good Girls Revolt."

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.230
But at the time, this was
the first case of its kind.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.850
And women who
worked at "Newsweek"

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.100
were told yes,
you will be hired.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.290
You can do all of the job
duties that a man can,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.700
but you're not allowed to write.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.460
We don't allow women
to have bylines.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.650
And so at the end
of the day, they

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.280
would hand over their notes
and probably a cup of coffee

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.130
as well, to a man who
would get the credit.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.900
And they sued.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.810
And they were able to
sue because it was clear

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.240
that this was discrimination.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.710
They were saying outwardly
that women are not allowed

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.510
to write here and men are.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.270
And so this prompted lawsuits
at "The New York Times"

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:36.910
and "Time" magazine and
"Sports Illustrated."

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.240
These women paved the way
for female journalists.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.690
And yet 40 years later,
here I was, I was a writer.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.490
I had the title to prove it.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.940
And yet I was still facing
some of these subtle things

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.370
on a daily basis that frankly,
like HR policies can't really

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.300
solve for.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.960
Like if you're the default
note taker in a meeting,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.720
or you're constantly
being interrupted,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.510
or you're perceived
as bitchy or bossy

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.330
when you make a
command, when that

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:11.470
is what is expected
ultimately of leaders,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.612
what's HR going to do about it?

00:13:13.612 --> 00:13:15.070
Some of this stuff
is internalized.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.400
And for what it's worth, it's
not just internalized sexism

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.390
that men possess,
it's women as well.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.700
SPEAKER: You include a
ton of data in the book

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.840
to back up the type of
sexism and discrimination

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.160
that you talk about.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.560
So what sort of practical
advice would you

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.890
give to someone who wants to
start sharing this type of data

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:40.150
with their teams to
educate and empower them

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.190
with what we have
after reading the book,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:47.094
without coming off in that way?

00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:49.510
JESSICA BENNETT: Yeah, totally,
which we'll just point out

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.340
it sucks that we
have to worry about,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.260
and we shouldn't have to.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:56.260
So lucky for you
there is a book,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.960
it's for sale in the back,
and you can just leave it

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.970
underneath bosses' doors.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:02.590
Put one in the ladies room.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.540
Put one in the men's
room, whatever.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.990
You can tear pages out
of it, do your thing,

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.140
and then you can blame it on me.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.630
So it doesn't have
to be-- but actually

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.960
there is research showing
that if you can present

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.480
an idea on behalf of the
group, rather than on behalf

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.260
of yourself, it's more likely
to be accepted or taken

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.770
in a way that doesn't leave
you feeling like you're

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.850
being too demanding.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.050
So I literally tell people to
print out studies, and bring

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.580
them up in whatever
the scenario is.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.150
So OK, women are actually
more likely to be

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.470
interrupted than men.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.770
Twice as likely, and more so
if they are a woman of color.

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.800
Obviously, in workplaces
where meetings

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.009
are such a huge
part of it and ideas

00:14:47.009 --> 00:14:49.300
are such a huge part of it,
if you're being interrupted

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.387
every time you speak.

00:14:50.387 --> 00:14:52.720
You're not contributing ideas,
and you're not ultimately

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.050
getting credit.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:55.930
So OK, how do you stop that?

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.420
Well, you can tell
someone to shut up

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.760
when they interrupt you.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.260
I can tell someone that I want
to hear what you have to say,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.301
when you're being interrupted,
so that it doesn't

00:15:04.301 --> 00:15:06.130
make you look like the bad guy.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.910
Bad guy-- I guess guy's a
gender term-- the bad person.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:14.890
But also if you wanted
to casually bring up

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.580
that women, in fact, data
shows are twice as likely to be

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.040
interrupted as men, there's
a study you can print out,

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.190
and there's a footnote in the
back of the book to do that.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.250
And then it's putting
it on data and research,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.890
not on you being too emotional
or touchy and offended

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.090
by a certain behavior.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.180
So I say whenever you can
blame something on the data,

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.130
it's actually really effective.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.900
And part of the
reason why the book

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.150
is so reliant on it,
in addition to me

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.950
not liking to just
give personal advice,

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.991
because I'm a journalist.

00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:47.470
I am trained to not do that.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.280
But it means that you
can always refer back

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.190
to a "Harvard Business
Review" study that

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.479
can't be argued with.

00:15:55.479 --> 00:15:57.520
These are all things we
should do because they're

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.020
the right thing to do.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.420
But it can be hard to
tell people that this

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.580
is the right thing to do.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.230
So you can tell them that
they should do it because it's

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.420
actually better for business.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.170
And companies with more gender
equality have higher returns.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.680
They're more profitable,
more collaborative,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.450
and so there's all of these
really data driven reasons

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.397
why it makes sense.

00:16:18.397 --> 00:16:20.230
SPEAKER: So in one of
your previous comments

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.320
you mentioned unconscious bias.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.230
And unconscious bias
training has seemingly

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.210
taken over Silicon Valley.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.390
Can you share some of your
thoughts on implicit bias

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:36.220
and what it means to A,
become aware of it and B,

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.566
go through a training
program to address it?

00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:40.690
JESSICA BENNETT: Yeah, and
so, for what it's worth,

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:41.800
I did the--

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.080
I think it was MIT--

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.052
has an implicit bias test,
where you can take it and see

00:16:47.052 --> 00:16:47.760
if you're biased.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.900
And yes, I, too, am biased.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.630
So I think it's very
important to talk about this,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.090
and the fact that
implicit bias is

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.436
a word that's being
tossed around now

00:16:57.436 --> 00:16:59.320
and people know what it means.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.140
It allows us to recognize
that we all have it.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.140
And I think that recognizing
that we all have it

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.230
is the first step
toward overcoming it.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.630
I think that some of
the problems with some

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.150
of these training programs is
that they don't necessarily

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.079
offer solutions.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.190
And so I think while the first
step and a very important step

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.260
is recognizing that
we have bias and being

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.040
able to notice it or check
for it in the moment,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.310
we have to also think about
changing our behavior.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.640
And so in the moment when
you notice it, what can you

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.230
do to stop yourself?

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.780
Or how can you point
out when someone else

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.170
is exhibiting bias?

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.520
And for what it's worth, I
was in a meeting recently.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.860
And a man and a woman walked in.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.970
And I caught myself
in a moment of bias,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.790
assuming that the woman was
the assistant to the man.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.411
And in fact, she was his boss.

00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:53.160
And this is like--

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.750
I wrote a whole book about this.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.790
I talk about these
issues all the time.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.060
But our brain takes
these cognitive shortcuts

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.750
that we have
internalized over, I

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.630
mean, literally
thousands and thousands

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.130
of years of us
being taught that it

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.940
is white men in charge and
women who are supporting that.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:13.110
And so I feel if I have
it, we all have it.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:15.360
And so I think it's really
important to talk about it.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.609
And I think that there's no
downside to these training

00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:20.430
programs, but I also
think that, especially

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.260
here in Silicon Valley, the
idea of diversity and inclusion

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.510
and bias trainings,
these are words

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.820
that are tossed around a lot.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.630
And we can't just
talk about them.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.105
We need to also have
action associated.

00:18:34.105 --> 00:18:36.480
SPEAKER: Absolutely yeah,
because only talking about them

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.270
and learning about them
tends to normalize them.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:46.290
And then nothing gets done
as a result. So on the cover,

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.810
there's an asterisk
note for men.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.264
So what is your message for men?

00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:52.680
JESSICA BENNETT:
So for those that

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.390
don't have the cover
in front of them,

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.310
there's a little
asterisk right here.

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.240
And then it says book is
21% more expensive for men.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.910
It's not really, because
that would be illegal.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.730
And actually it
should now be 20%,

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.540
because we gained a penny,
yay, in the wage gap.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.450
No, my message for men is
ultimately that we need you,

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.160
and we cannot fight for equality
without men by our side.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.470
They are so important
to this battle.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.730
And yet I try to use humor as a
way into some of these issues.

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.660
And so the 21% is supposed
to be a joke, ha ha.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.930
And in fact, I've seen it
be effective in the sense

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.330
that I've seen men
perusing the book.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.150
And then seeing that asterisk
and sort of chuckling and then

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.230
opening it up.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.220
So hopefully that's a way in.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.600
And I try to use
humor as a way to talk

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.400
about really tricky issues.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.030
You know this stuff is hard.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.340
And sometimes it's
really uncomfortable.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.630
And I think that sometimes
men understandably

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.940
feel uncomfortable
engaging on these topics

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.400
or knowing how to be an ally.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.190
And so I think it's so
important to include them

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.320
in the conversation.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.320
And let them know-- and not
just men, but women, too--

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.870
that we are actually going
to screw up sometimes.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.360
We're not going to be perfect
talking about this stuff

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.260
all the time.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.070
But with a commitment
to be better, then

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.990
we can screw up
and correct for it.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:22.210
And at the end of the day,
men are half the population.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.457
We cannot achieve equality
without their support.

00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:25.290
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.420
So speaking on the
topic of inclusion,

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.390
I want to talk a little
bit about intersectionality

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.650
and just sort of get your
view on intersectionality

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.970
and how it maybe has changed
or evolved, especially

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.224
in our current climate.

00:20:40.224 --> 00:20:42.390
JESSICA BENNETT: Yes, so
intersectionality for those

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.200
who don't know--

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.680
the concept that feminism
must be intersectional.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.920
It must also look at the cross
section, the intersection

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:54.370
of race, of class, of gender
identity, of sexuality.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.360
And that really,
feminism is not feminism

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.120
if it's not intersectional.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.540
And that's certainly my belief.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.039
This stuff needs
to be incorporated.

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:04.800
And we need to be thinking
about it all the time.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.250
I think that traditionally, the
mainstream women's movement,

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.500
at least the public part
that you learn about

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.080
in history books or you
read about in the press,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.800
has not done a great job
of taking intersectionality

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.330
into account.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:22.950
Primarily the 1970s movement of
women's liberation was white.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.280
And there were all sorts of
really amazing subgroups, women

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.230
of color that were
also rising up.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:30.330
But they just weren't
talked about as much.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.870
So I do think that right
now what we're seeing

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.980
is a much more intersectional
view of all of this.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.650
This is something that we're
talking about regularly.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.710
Mainstream
publications that don't

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.900
assume any knowledge
of feminism are using

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.286
that word, intersectionality.

00:21:47.286 --> 00:21:48.660
"The New York
Times" recently did

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.690
it, which was a great
thing for them, I think.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.700
And it's also
important that some

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.100
of the new, emerging
leaders we're

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.150
seeing talking about this,
the women of the Women's March

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.960
are of every race.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.300
And so I think that
it's so important,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.160
because I think
that ultimately you

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.400
can't be a feminist if you don't
also care about these issues.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.320
Feminism is intersectional.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.640
SPEAKER: So I want to talk
about one of the pitfalls

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.160
that you mentioned in the
book that really affects me.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.950
So I can say I am
an 'ever faithful.'

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.340
And that means that
I want to believe

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.450
that everything is fair,
that career and the workplace

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.160
is a meritocracy.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.650
So what advice would you
give for people like me

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:36.040
who still want to
believe in a meritocracy

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.470
and behave as if we exist in
one, despite all the research

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.677
that disproves that?

00:22:43.677 --> 00:22:45.760
JESSICA BENNETT: I would
say that loyalty does not

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.670
pay the bills.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:53.110
And I think that, as women, we
too often put our heads down

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:56.010
and do good work and expect
to be recognized for it.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.900
And that's not our
fault. Typically, it

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.301
is harder for women to
self-promote and call attention

00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:02.800
to the good work
that they're doing.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.070
Because when we do, we're
perceived as too braggy

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.550
or we're disliked for it.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.990
And so we sort of
internalize these structures

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.510
that have told us over
years and years and years

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.400
that we're supposed
to be modest.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.440
And so yes, I would
like to believe

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.240
it's a meritocracy,
too, but I think

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.840
that I'm too cynical for that.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.860
So any moment you can
take to call attention

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.290
to your accomplishments
is not a bad thing.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:32.170
And if you feel uncomfortable
doing it, enlist someone else.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:36.030
There's a term I have in the
book called 'boast bitch.'

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.932
This is a person who
brags on your behalf.

00:23:38.932 --> 00:23:40.390
And there's a real
reason for this.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:42.160
It's because women
are disliked when

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.430
they brag about themselves.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.909
But of course, we're working
in competitive office

00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:46.450
environments.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.940
We need to draw attention
to the work that we do.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.720
So you and I are both bitches,
we have an unspoken or spoken

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.520
agreement.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.370
I boast for you.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.870
You boast for me.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.560
Every time you do
something great,

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.360
I send an email to our
entire team and cc you on it.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:04.810
And then you can look
completely humble.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.880
I'm going to look like
a great colleague.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.160
And everyone gets credit.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.050
So meritocracy, yes, it would
be great if that existed,

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.884
but I think that the
numbers show us otherwise.

00:24:16.884 --> 00:24:19.300
SPEAKER: I think we need to
create a marketplace at Google

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.380
for boast bitches.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.744
You can sign up to be one.

00:24:21.744 --> 00:24:23.410
JESSICA BENNETT: If
you feel comfortable

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.270
with the word bitch, you can
call it a boast bae, whatever.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.070
And for what it's worth, bitch
in the sense that I mean it,

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.560
boast bitch can be
a man or a woman.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.010
Anyone can be a boast bitch.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.476
It's just someone
who has your back.

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.100
SPEAKER: Another of
the chapters that I

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.950
thought was really powerful
was the one on negotiation.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.320
And I especially loved
the piece of advice

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.240
to view your ask in shades
of gray, not black and white.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.730
Can you share your point
of view on negotiation

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.540
and how women and men approach
negotiation differently

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.240
and therefore get
different results?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.730
JESSICA BENNETT: There's a lot
of research around the issue

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:01.660
of negotiation.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.180
And what the newer
research is finding

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.270
is that women who do
negotiate are often

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.340
viewed as aggressive
or pushy, and it

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.280
makes them less likely to
actually get the raise.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.280
So all right, well, how are
you supposed to overcome that?

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.970
There's no real solution to
that other than keep asking,

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.860
and it will become normalized.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.300
And then we won't
view a woman who

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.430
asks as pushy or aggressive.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:29.410
But in addition to that, women
are often less likely to ask.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.910
And so I know that when
I was starting my career

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:33.970
I never asked.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.440
I felt so incredibly
lucky to have a job.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.130
This was when I was at
"Newsweek" in the early 2000s,

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.630
and journalism was
imploding everywhere.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.770
So I was, in a way,
lucky to be employed.

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.900
But it caused me to not ask.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.630
And it wasn't until I realized
there was this other guy who

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.430
I worked with, with
the same title,

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.590
was making many thousands
of dollars more than me

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.860
that I was like, OK, I
have to go in and ask.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.630
And so what I did is I tried to
be very data driven about it.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.920
I didn't want to go in and tell
them that I felt I deserved it

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.850
or that I needed to pay
off my student loans.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.970
I wanted to come in with a list
of statistics about the work

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:15.570
that I'd done.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.230
So I added up every possible,
conceivable statistic

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.210
you could find in a
field like journalism

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.040
where there's not
really metrics.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.430
But so things like page views
on articles, number of articles

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.430
written, perceived
value of press

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.670
hits that I'd done
on television.

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.510
What else?

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.920
Anything else I could find.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.800
And I, in fact, then wrote it
up like a Buzzfeed listicle, top

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.840
10 list, why you should give
Jessica Bennett a raise.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.760
And I went in and I
tried to express this,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.940
and naturally I was
stuttering and stumbling

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.650
over my words in bright red.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.690
But then I followed
up with the email.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.700
So I think it's
important to be really

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.410
data focused and data driven.

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.770
I think it's important to
know that women do struggle

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.740
with this, and they're often
penalized, more so than men.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.490
But truly the way that we're
going to make this equal

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.130
is by continuing to ask.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.400
And I think that what
companies can do as well

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.320
is look at salary parity.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.300
I think Google is doing
something around this.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.840
But comparing is there
a gap in your company

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.050
between men and women, and
if there is, solving for it.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.207
SPEAKER: Yeah, definitely.

00:27:23.207 --> 00:27:24.040
That's great advice.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.010
Thank you.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:31.380
So your feminist fight club
is largely outside of work,

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.050
but obviously made up
of professional women.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:38.670
But inside of the
workplace, would you

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.244
recommend a feminist fight
club made up of colleagues?

00:27:43.244 --> 00:27:44.160
JESSICA BENNETT: Yeah.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.326
SPEAKER: What do you think
are some of the strengths

00:27:46.326 --> 00:27:48.960
and some of the limitations of
that sort of environment taking

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.190
place at work?

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:51.840
JESSICA BENNETT:
Yeah, I mean, anyone

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.330
can form a feminist fight club.

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.830
And there's a guide at the back
of the book on how to do so,

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.705
which basically is like
do whatever you want.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.030
And many people, in fact, have
forms of feminist fight clubs.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.510
We called ours that, and we
also had a top secret name

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.470
that I can't reveal.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.370
But we thought it was
important for our group

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.100
to have a mix of women
in creative industries,

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.680
but not all in the same field.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.350
Because we wanted to have
a diversity of voices.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:23.640
And so we sort of handpicked
based on that, but a lot of it

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.720
was also random.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.970
I ended up there
through a mentor

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.530
whose daughter was in it.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.745
And a lot of it just
came organically.

00:28:31.745 --> 00:28:33.870
But I think that talking
about these issues at work

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:35.190
can be so important.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.220
Lean In circles are now in
companies all over the world.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.230
And I think it's been
really effective to talk

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.600
about them with colleagues.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.580
And so forming a
feminist fight club,

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.929
yeah, basically
by being here, you

00:28:46.929 --> 00:28:48.720
are all members of the
feminist fight club.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.180
Welcome, lifelong
membership, there's

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.480
no dues, like you're in.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.650
But you can also
form smaller groups.

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:01.710
And I don't know, for me, having
a group of women who I knew

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.100
were unconditionally
supportive, and I could always

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.550
turn to if I had a
problem has truly

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.740
helped me grow in many ways
throughout my career and even

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:12.750
my personal life.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.730
And I think there's
no downside to it.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.650
I think that we need
to help each other.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.100
The third rule of the
new feminist fight club

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.020
is we fight patriarchy,
not each other.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.510
So the idea of
treating other women

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.160
as allies, not as enemies.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.690
We don't need to be competitive.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.610
We are more powerful together.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.560
We can lift one another up.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.140
SPEAKER: One of the pieces,
or one of the chapters

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.850
that contained a
ton of great advice

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.650
was "What Would Josh Do?"

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.830
And this was sort
of advice to think

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.610
like Josh, who's a male
colleague with chutzpah,

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:47.310
meaning shameless
audacity-- not to be

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.360
confused with utter bullshit.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.062
So I'm just wondering,
first of all,

00:29:51.062 --> 00:29:52.770
how do you distinguish
between those two?

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:53.895
JESSICA BENNETT: Very hard.

00:29:53.895 --> 00:29:56.850
SPEAKER: Because I think I
struggled with that chapter,

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.880
because some of the
advice felt like would I

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.240
be going against what is
sort of natural to me?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.801
And how much do I
need to work on that?

00:30:06.801 --> 00:30:08.300
JESSICA BENNETT:
So yes, the chapter

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:13.230
is called WWJD, the other
J, what would Josh do?

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.700
Carry yourself
with the confidence

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.290
of a mediocre white man.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:21.320
And Josh, in fact,
is a real person.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.410
He's not named Josh.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.910
And he's a lovely individual
and a good friend of mine.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.870
But we used to share
a wall at "Newsweek."

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:28.230
We sat next to each other.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.070
And so I got to sort of
observe him in all scenarios.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.000
And we had similar jobs, except
that every time there was

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.700
a meeting I would be in my
office with a door closed--

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.120
this was back when
people had offices,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.620
I'll never have an office again,
now I just work in my bed--

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:47.780
but I would be studying up for
a pitch meeting, determined

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.680
to have every fact right, so
nervous, being so prepared.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.810
And he would be in his
office with his feet

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.960
up on the desk, just ready
to go in and bullshit

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.260
his way through.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.350
And in his case, he
was also very smart.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.990
So his bullshit was
educated bullshit.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.410
But what the research
shows is that actually we

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:10.240
mistake sometimes
confidence for competence.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.440
And so the way that
he was delivering it,

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.410
with such confidence,
was almost as effective

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.360
as my really studied, but
unconfident, pitches as well.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.670
And so it allowed
me to observe him.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.380
And so throughout
the chapter, I advise

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.630
asking yourself in
various scenarios

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:32.330
WWJD, or WWMD, what
would a man do.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:37.400
Not so women can start
mimicking male behavior,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.220
but because we often
underestimate ourselves.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.550
And so I know that for
me, in a scenario where

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:48.440
I was feeling nervous or wasn't
sure how to go about something,

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.820
I would ask myself
what would Josh do.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.820
And then I would end up
somewhere in the middle.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.360
Like Josh would do this,
I would naturally do this,

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.070
I would end up here.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:02.591
And so often we underestimate
ourselves or we face imposter

00:32:02.591 --> 00:32:04.340
syndrome, or we don't
feel like we deserve

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.810
to be there or belong, and
so a little bragging actually

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:11.630
may get us to the point
where we should be,

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.820
where we're not
underestimating our abilities

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.260
and our accomplishments.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:18.980
So yeah, I probably carry
myself with the confidence

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.200
of a mediocre white man.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.640
SPEAKER: I love it.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.030
So last question, you sort of
described yourself as a cynic.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.900
But I'm holding out hope
that you're still hopeful.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.960
And so I'm wondering,
how do you remain

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.340
hopeful and humorous and
encouraged when digging

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.590
into this research
that's really sort

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.906
of challenging to confront?

00:32:41.906 --> 00:32:44.600
JESSICA BENNETT: Right, and
what's happening in the world?

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.590
Yes, so I try to have a
sense of humor about it.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.190
If I couldn't laugh
about some of this stuff,

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.900
I think I would
just be depressed.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.860
So I still try to find humor
in some of these things.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.380
Feminists, in fact,
are really funny.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.690
We do have senses of humor.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.700
There's the joke,
how many feminists

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.830
does it take to screw
in a light bulb?

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.530
And then it's like,
that's not funny.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:12.510
But actually it is funny.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.880
We can laugh about this stuff.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.590
It's serious, yes, it's serious.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.580
But we can laugh.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.990
And I also find a lot of hope
in the younger generation.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.870
A lot of the women that
I work with and talk

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.530
to for stories and who helped
me on "Feminist Fight Club"

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.740
social media are college
women and college men.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.920
And the way that they talk about
and think about these issues

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.652
is so much further along
than I was at their age.

00:33:37.652 --> 00:33:39.110
The way that they
think about, they

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.910
approach this intersectionally.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:42.260
And the hope that they have?

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.030
There is a study that
came out recently

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.090
about how Gen Z and
younger millennials

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.820
are actually much more
hopeful than the rest of us.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.490
So look to the youth.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.430
The kids are all right.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:58.575
And so I go to them whenever I
need a dose of bringing me up.

00:33:58.575 --> 00:33:59.450
SPEAKER: I love that.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:00.230
Thank you.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.620
So now I want to open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.204
And Lizzie has a microphone.

00:34:05.204 --> 00:34:07.370
AUDIENCE: So we were just
talking about this before.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.110
Every now and then,
something happens

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.050
where a man does something
that's well-intentioned,

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.130
but tone deaf.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.110
So recently we got an
email from some men

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.082
inviting us to a
mixer for women.

00:34:17.082 --> 00:34:19.040
I thought, why are the
men inviting us to this?

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.989
Why is there not a woman
throwing the mixer,

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.909
and why are the men
even part of it?

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.699
And so I asked my boss, like
this is pretty tone deaf.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:28.429
And his response was yes,
but it was well-intentioned.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:29.556
How do you respond to that?

00:34:29.556 --> 00:34:31.639
Because I feel like a
message could, maybe should,

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.972
get to the men who sent it,
but it was well-intentioned.

00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:35.514
And so why do we
want to bring it up?

00:34:35.514 --> 00:34:37.346
JESSICA BENNETT: I mean
I would say that you

00:34:37.346 --> 00:34:38.600
have to call these things out.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.440
Like you don't have to be a
bitch calling this stuff out,

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.800
or be perceived as a bitch.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.620
It's important to talk about it.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:50.010
And so if it is tone deaf,
then he should let them know.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.370
So I don't know.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.354
So much of this stuff
is so individual.

00:34:53.354 --> 00:34:55.270
Depends on your power
within the organization.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.679
Is this person your boss?

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:58.780
Do you feel comfortable
speaking up?

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:02.020
And I always fall back
on, if it's not just you,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.570
if it's a number of women
part of that group who

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.430
are asking for
something to happen,

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:10.420
then not any individual
can be singled out.

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:14.680
And so perhaps the response
would be for multiple of you

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.620
to go back and say,
I totally understand.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.490
And I appreciate you passing
this information along

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.840
or whatever it may be.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.630
Because a lot of this
is tone deafness.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.040
And we make mistakes.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.930
But no one is going
to learn if they don't

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.400
know that they're tone deaf.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:35.060
And so the message needs to
make it back to those people.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.480
AUDIENCE: I think my question
is around the incidents that

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.710
have sort of played out at
Uber, which have become pretty

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.990
well-known, I think, especially
here in Silicon Valley

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.080
over the last few weeks.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.100
And I think obviously
that was an extreme case,

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.770
that the writer sort of talked
about in her article on Medium.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:57.470
But I think for a
lot of us that work

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.000
in Silicon Valley as women,
we're like, of course.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.840
These subtle daily acts of
sexism happen every day.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.400
Why is this so
surprising to people?

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.280
But I think one
thing that made me

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.650
start thinking was one
of the follow up articles

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.890
was talking about how Uber's
performance system is a bell

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:13.410
curve.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.800
And how they have five
performance buckets.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:22.100
And it sort of encourages people
to undercut their teammates,

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.200
or because of things
like imposter syndrome,

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.400
it encourages the men to shine
and the women not to shine.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.220
And then I think that their
performance system is probably

00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:33.699
directly modeled after Google's,
or it's very, very similar

00:36:33.699 --> 00:36:34.740
from what it sounds like.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.660
So my question to you is, have
you read anything about that

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.910
or have you thought about
that or do you have any sort

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.285
of data-- and, I haven't read
it yet but I'm excited to--

00:36:43.285 --> 00:36:46.880
but data that sort of supports
this idea of performance

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.300
and the best ways to
measure that so it's not

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.060
a systemic problem for men
versus women succeeding

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.970
in a company?

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.490
JESSICA BENNETT: Right.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.040
Well, I think that one
very important thing

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:02.140
is setting really clear
criteria for success.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.900
So Lean In and McKinsey put out
this study every year of women

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.250
in the workplace.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:11.000
And this past one, they
found that something

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.730
like 78% of companies said that
they support gender equality.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.460
or it was the employees
saying that they

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.770
believe their CEOs really
supported gender equality.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.740
And yet like 50% of the
managers in those companies

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.260
didn't actually know what to do.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.380
And then only 38%
of those companies

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:34.460
actually set clear criteria
for things like hiring.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.820
And what we know is that, at
least as it pertains to hiring,

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.550
but I imagine it pertains
to performance reviews

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.340
as well, women are
often judged based

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.250
on their past performance,
and men are judged

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:48.060
based on their potential.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:51.330
So literally we have to have
a line item on our resume

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:54.020
and looking at a man, you're
like, wow, he could do it.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.880
I can see him as
a future leader.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.370
And oftentimes, those
people seeing those people

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.080
as future leaders are also men.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.230
And so the reality is
it's sometimes easier

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:06.470
to see someone who
looks like you rise up.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:08.840
So what can you do?

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.150
Well, if you have
very clear criteria

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:12.920
and you know that
that's existing,

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.680
then you can set metrics for it.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.020
And you can make
sure that you're not

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.680
hiring or reviewing
based on what you think

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.620
a person's potential may be.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:29.570
I don't know specifically what
companies have done to try to,

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.520
I don't know, I guess
solve for that bell curve.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.140
But I have to think that
having more women in leadership

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.790
to talk about these things--

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:39.470
I mean it's like
the same reason why

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.210
we were talking about earlier.

00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:45.560
Our microphones don't clip
on to the back of a dress.

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.910
Because they were made by men,
and they were made for men.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:54.080
And so you see this across
the board in small things

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:54.890
and large things.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:58.070
And if women are involved
in the decisionmaking

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:02.120
process about how
people are judged

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.380
or about how whatever
this may be in this case,

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:11.779
then I think that they can
elevate some of these issues.

00:39:11.779 --> 00:39:13.820
So that's not a perfect
solution on how to do it,

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:16.850
but I think all of this
stuff is so interconnected.

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:20.104
And until half of the
leaders are women,

00:39:20.104 --> 00:39:21.770
we will continue to
have these problems.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.770
But I also think it's important
that people are speaking

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:26.330
out and talking about it.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.090
That woman writing that piece
that went completely viral

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.330
has sparked a conversation that,
yes, I totally agree many of us

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.070
are like, yeah, duh.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.810
Obviously this is happening.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:37.010
We know this.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.860
But it appears that a lot
of people didn't know it.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.300
And it's getting mainstream
press attention now,

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.700
which is a good thing.

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.620
And Uber is obviously
under scrutiny

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.900
to change some of its policies.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.000
And so I think that,
or I hope that, we'll

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.860
see a ripple effect there.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.930
But oftentimes it
does take someone

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.840
speaking out and going out
on a limb, which is why

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.050
I go back to power in numbers.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:00.800
She wasn't working at
the company anymore,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.640
so she felt comfortable
speaking out.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.420
But for those who
are inside, sometimes

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.630
it helps to band together
and approach it as a group.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.310
Because you can't be penalized.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.850
You're more powerful.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:13.730
And if you're
experiencing something,

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:16.100
probably someone else is, too.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.520
AUDIENCE: Any resources to share
about language to push back

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.380
on disempowering praise?

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.780
I recently got 'she's
a smart cookie'

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.610
on a project I'm leading.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:28.160
I have a PhD in
neuroscience, and eight years

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.930
of industry experience.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:30.665
I'm not a cookie.

00:40:30.665 --> 00:40:33.050
I am an expert.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.560
Any advice?

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.000
JESSICA BENNETT: Call it out.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.010
Yeah, you're not.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.710
I call that the underminer.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:44.690
The person who's
like, great job,

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:47.600
kiddo, or thank you,
honey, or cookie.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.200
All of those little language
pieces that are so tiny,

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.000
but they're so undermining.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.740
If you're standing
there and your team

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.900
sees you being called a
cookie by some other leader,

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.160
are they going to respect you?

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.810
So I think calling
it out sometimes

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.229
you may have to take that person
aside and be like, hey, we're

00:41:06.229 --> 00:41:07.520
all in this for the same thing.

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.670
I think it actually
benefits you for our team

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.780
to see me as a leader.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:16.670
And when you call me a cookie,
it undermines my authority,

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.880
so calling out the behavior.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.490
You know I think that
we're being more cognizant

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.340
these days of speech patterns.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.860
So from things like
that to the way

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.800
that so much of our
language is gendered.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.920
I've started trying
to find alternative

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.510
when I say you guys.

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:37.010
But

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:39.260
Even things like--
there's a dictionary

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.720
in the book, an A
to Z-- it's "How

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:46.590
Not to Be a Dick-tionary,
an A to Z Guide to Nonsexist

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:47.090
Language."

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:49.280
But things that I
had never realized,

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.330
like the word seminal.

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:52.790
It comes from semen.

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:55.790
That is a male-derived term.

00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:59.900
And that is what we use
to describe great works.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.830
And so this stuff
is so, so ingrained

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.490
into every tiny
bit of our culture.

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:10.160
And sometimes it's a matter of
calling it out when we see it,

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.070
because people do
not even realize it.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.420
And for what it's worth,
would you call a man cookie?

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.050
No.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.050
You can pretty much apply
that question to anything.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.900
Would I view her as
bossy if she were a man?

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.586
Probably not, so asking
that question as well.

00:42:26.586 --> 00:42:28.460
AUDIENCE: Trying to
formulate this question--

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.800
I guess this is about
any lessons learned

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.480
from male allies.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.970
And I guess I'm seeing this
through the lens of anxiety.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.860
You know, anxiety is
important, because it

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.370
pushes people to change.

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.740
But it can also
prompt a backlash.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.070
And I like the language
that you used about, hey,

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:47.310
I'm actually trying
to be helpful to us.

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.490
So just any thoughts
that you have again,

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.830
like things that
you feel have been

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.890
successful in sort of
recruiting allies or getting

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.680
mind shift in allies
to see common cause,

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.550
anything like that.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:01.220
JESSICA BENNETT: Yeah, I mean,
I think just talking more

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.860
openly is really step one.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.160
Because I think we're hesitant
to talk about these issues.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.680
And we're fearful that
we're going to screw up.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.140
And you know, I
wrote a whole book

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.390
that has language like
mansplaining and manterruption

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.160
and bro-appropriation
everywhere.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.690
And on some level, that
can make men feel targeted.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:23.060
I'm also trying
to use it as a way

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.520
to have humor to open
up some of these issues.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.560
But I think we have
to get over our fears

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.120
about talking about it.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.248
And just discuss more openly
so that the stigma goes away.

00:43:33.248 --> 00:43:35.876
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just sort
of a follow up thought

00:43:35.876 --> 00:43:39.500
to that is basically
I have this notion

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.870
of sort of lowering the
cost for screwing up.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.000
I mean I guess it's
proportional to the screw

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.370
up, like in some ways we'd
have to raise the cost.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:50.210
But for those like
maybe microaggressions

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.880
should have a micro price.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.340
And it's basically
look, you know,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.460
I appreciate that we're
all working together.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.670
And making it less like--

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:05.960
I read an article that
was like basically,

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.050
implicit bias is the new way
to say that you're a racist.

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.540
And the person was just
like, I'm not a racist.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.730
It's like, no, oh, my god.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:14.510
It is the exact
opposite, it's trying

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.540
to say we all, because
of us as primates,

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.880
we have these
cognitive shortcuts.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.010
It's meant to say look,
you're in good company.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.891
But it's having kind
of the opposite effect.

00:44:24.891 --> 00:44:26.390
JESSICA BENNETT:
That's interesting.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.060
I mean I try to
talk about the ways

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:33.470
that I've screwed up frequently
as a way to let my audience

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:37.130
or whomever it may be know
that if I'm doing it too,

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.360
then we're all doing it.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.130
And it's OK.

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.211
And so maybe one
way to approach it,

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:43.460
at least from trying to get
other people on your side,

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.920
is by beginning with
something that you've

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.454
done that you realized.

00:44:48.454 --> 00:44:50.120
And then maybe they
won't feel attacked.

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.610
I mean we shouldn't have
to dance around this issue

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:54.530
and walk on eggshells.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.180
But the reality is that like
we work in office environments,

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.430
and we want to be respectful,
and we don't want people

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:00.830
to feel attacked or offended.

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:04.370
And I think that the reality
is that most men really

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:06.485
do want to help, and
they want to be allies.

00:45:06.485 --> 00:45:09.350
And I believe
that, but it's also

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:12.680
backed in all sorts of data,
and especially young men.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.950
They want gender equality,
they want equal relationships.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:21.450
But for hundreds and hundreds
of years, men have run shit.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.480
And so there is
a learning curve.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.410
It does take some time to
overcome some of these issues.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:30.470
So yeah, I think
talking about a way

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:32.270
that you have experienced
it is one way,

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:34.290
and talking about
things in groups

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.030
so that one person
doesn't feel attacked.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.707
But also just knowing that
sometimes uncomfortable stuff

00:45:39.707 --> 00:45:40.540
is going to come up.

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.130
But we can still have productive
conversations about it.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have
just a couple of questions

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.090
that I'll try to keep short.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:52.900
What do we do about the fact
that the F word of feminism

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.030
turns some people
off immediately,

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.630
and how do we get those people
back into the conversation

00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:59.440
hopefully?

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.606
JESSICA BENNETT: Let me do--

00:46:00.606 --> 00:46:02.450
I'll do that one first.

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:05.620
So I really do think that the
stigma around the word feminism

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:06.770
is changing.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.680
I think that
celebrities have had

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.300
a lot to do with this in fact.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:15.430
Seeing Beyonce onstage at
the VMAs defining the word--

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:19.270
that's bigger than any other
feminist could ever accomplish.

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:21.670
So I think that the
stigma is going away.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.680
I also think that
continuing to talk

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.040
about what the definition
of feminism actually is-- it

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.890
means that it's a person
that believes in gender

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:32.380
equality between the sexes.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.750
And that's the most
benign thing ever.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.210
Who's going to say
they're anti-that?

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:39.970
So I think that it's going away.

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:42.496
I also think I'm of the
belief that if you don't

00:46:42.496 --> 00:46:43.870
want to call
yourself a feminist,

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.911
but you believe in these
things, and you're going

00:46:45.911 --> 00:46:47.350
to fight for them, like fine.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.190
That's better than nothing.

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:52.060
And so whether you call
yourself a feminist or not,

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:55.750
I think it's about
working towards equality.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.300
And for what it's worth,
when I was pitching

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:01.060
this book in the beginning,
which was a couple of years

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.197
ago, I said to my
male agent, do you

00:47:05.197 --> 00:47:07.030
think we should call
this ladies fight club,

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:09.279
because people are going to
be so offended by the word

00:47:09.279 --> 00:47:10.420
feminist.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.520
And I'm coming from a
mainstream news background.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.520
I didn't want to go with
a niche feminist press.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.340
I wanted this book
to reach the masses.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:20.260
And he to his
credit was like, no.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.507
Feminist is a stronger title.

00:47:21.507 --> 00:47:22.840
We're going to go out with that.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.100
And so we did.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:25.190
And I was sort of wary.

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:26.950
I was nervous about
what would happen.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:32.200
And to my surprise, we
had bids from a dozen

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.440
different mainstream publishers,
not niche feminist presses.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.674
And so that to me
was very encouraging.

00:47:37.674 --> 00:47:39.590
And I think that that
was still two years ago.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:43.310
I think that the word has become
more mainstream since then.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.160
But there will
always be arguments

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.110
about the word feminism.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:48.820
For so long, this has occurred.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.340
And I don't know, every
decade or so there's

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:53.800
a conversation around
should we rebrand feminism,

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.840
should we call it
something else?

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.990
And I don't think
that's going to happen,

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:03.370
but if you're willing to
wear the title proudly,

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.120
I say do it loud.

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:10.860
AUDIENCE: And then just
around intersectionality--

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:15.510
I feel like I'm often fearful
that I've heard people

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.240
in other minority
groups who are also

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.420
women complain that they feel
like their voices are not

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.470
heard.

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:25.830
What advice do you
have for white women

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:30.150
or anyone who wants to make
sure that they're supporting

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:33.240
and raising up those voices,
rather than potentially,

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.700
accidentally talking over
them or shutting them out

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.570
of the conversation?

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:38.111
JESSICA BENNETT: I
think first of all

00:48:38.111 --> 00:48:40.410
trying not to be defensive.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:42.810
Because I see this
happen online so much.

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:47.190
Where white women are called
out for some of their behavior,

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.020
and probably much
in the same way

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.910
that men feel attacked at
work, the immediate response

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:53.880
is defensiveness.

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.942
And I think that we
need to listen more.

00:48:56.942 --> 00:48:57.900
We need to listen more.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:02.700
We need to respect that these
voices have been marginalized

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.300
for years and years and years.

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.110
So even if we may not think
in a particular moment

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:09.540
that we are drawing
them out, we have long

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:14.030
had a voice, not as much of
a voice as men, but a voice.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.580
And there was a
really long history

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.900
of racism in the
women's movement.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:24.420
And so I think, yeah, we have
to be OK with screwing up.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.460
And be OK with being
called out for it,

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:31.189
and try to correct the
behavior and move on, I think.

00:49:31.189 --> 00:49:32.730
AUDIENCE: You sort
of addressed this.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:34.410
But let's go
directly to it again.

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:36.390
One of the senior
leaders on my team

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.220
has recently received
a bit of flack

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.980
for using guys too
often as a blanket term

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.080
when addressing a
mixed gender group.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.750
It doesn't bother me, yet
when someone uses ladies

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:48.720
to email only admins, it does.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.925
What's your take on
sensitivities like that?

00:49:50.925 --> 00:49:53.550
JESSICA BENNETT: I think we need
to just right here, right now,

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.920
come up with a
better term for guys.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.270
Like y'all feels
weird to me, folks.

OK, yes, so maybe we

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.709
have solved this
right here, thank you.

be so progressive?

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:24.300
Yeah, I think that this stuff is
so entrenched in our language.

Even human-- hu- man.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:48.150
Basically all language is sexist
if you really get down to it.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:52.320
AUDIENCE: About a year ago, I
had an incident with a friend,

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:57.270
a good friend who was
talking about the efforts

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:59.640
going on for hiring
diverse people.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.260
This was a very respectful
person that I am on good terms

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:02.760
with.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.820
But he said, you know that--

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:08.010
to use his words, and
I still remember this--

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.560
the pendulum has swung too far.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.850
And people are being
hurt by these efforts,

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:16.590
like basically
good people are not

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:20.050

something, something,

implying the woman thing.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:27.990
And I didn't know how to
respond at the time, which

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:29.730
was going to be like not--

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:33.610
I didn't want to say, blah,
blah, blah, blah, feminism.

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:35.360

what I want to do.

wanted to say that,

but it's not going
to solve the problem.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.770
And I don't know
how to address it.

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:45.060
Advice please.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:47.490
JESSICA BENNETT: Yeah,
and feel free to chime in

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.480
if anyone else has advice, too.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.980
Well, as you were saying that
I want to do rah, rah, rah,

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.400
feminism thing for the record.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.720
I mean it's tricky.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.800
It's yeah, well,
welcome to history

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:05.130
where these people
have been marginalized

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:07.730
and not hired for years
and years and years.

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.260
And we have to correct
for that somehow.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.800
But I think that also--

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.290
I don't know, I mean
throwing the numbers back

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:18.670
in that person's face.

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:22.510
Like probably they're
referencing a team or a company

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:24.790
that is still
majority white male,

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:28.630
even if this person feels that
the pendulum has swung too far.

00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:35.260
And then potentially making
note of the fact that actually,

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.420
it's better for the company
to have a more diverse team.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:42.280
And listing off all those
stats about how teams

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.230
with more diversity
are more collaborative

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:45.930
and more successful.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:49.420
And companies with more women on
the board have higher returns.

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:54.040
And even things like
in a room in a meeting

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:58.900
where there are at
least 25% women, which

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:02.950
is what social science calls
the point of critical mass,

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:05.380
then those women
in the room will A,

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:10.150
feel more comfortable speaking
up, and B, what they are saying

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:11.980
will actually be heard more.

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:14.110
It's sort of this
point where we stop

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:17.170
viewing that 24%
as a minority group

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.300
or as speaking on
behalf of women

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.100
or on behalf of
their race, and just

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.310
view them as experts
who are in the room.

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:27.070
So that's not a perfect
answer, but trying

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.270
to remind that person.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:31.669
Does anyone else want to
chime in with their thoughts?

00:53:31.669 --> 00:53:33.460
AUDIENCE: So moving on
to a different note,

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.930
you brought up imposture
syndrome, which

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:36.910
I think a lot of people in
this room can identify with,

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:37.576
myself included.

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.250
You know that you're
good at your job.

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:45.750
Logically, you understand that
you do a good job every day,

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.701
and an email comes in
on Friday afternoon

00:53:47.701 --> 00:53:49.450
with your manager
asking to meet with you.

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:50.890
And you panic, right?

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:53.182
Because you're like, oh,
I'm totally in trouble.

00:53:53.182 --> 00:53:53.890
There's no doubt.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:54.780
JESSICA BENNETT: Exactly.

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:56.430
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm totally
getting fired, right.

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:57.750
JESSICA BENNETT: He should fire
me, in fact, I'll just quit.

00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:59.050
AUDIENCE: Right,
exactly, like maybe I'll

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:01.591
just quit on Friday afternoon
so I don't have to have anxiety

00:54:01.591 --> 00:54:02.920
all weekend about it.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.500
What are your tips
for dealing with that

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.530
and trying to deal with the
internalized sense of I'm

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.300
a failure or I'm
going to be a failure

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.280
or should be a failure, right?

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.330
JESSICA BENNETT: Right.

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:16.540
I think first knowing that
you are not the only one

00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:17.590
to feel this way.

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.270
Imposture syndrome,
this sense that you

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.311
don't belong, that you
don't deserve to be there,

00:54:21.311 --> 00:54:23.950
that you're not good at your
job-- this disproportionately

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:26.620
statistically affects
women and minorities,

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:30.280
so LGBT, racial minorities.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.240
And oftentimes it's because
those groups of people

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:38.200
have this added pressure
of accomplishing firsts,

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.240
or needing to not fuck
up, because they'll

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.550
be judged on behalf of
their gender or their race

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:43.660
if they do.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:47.290
So first off knowing
that literally I

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:49.960
power posed before I go onstage.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.330
And I was speaking at
a law firm on Monday.

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:53.530
And it was a paid gig.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:55.900
And I was like literally why
are these people paying me?

00:54:55.900 --> 00:54:59.302
Like I should pay them,
like I can't believe--

00:54:59.302 --> 00:55:00.510
and it was like a well-paid--

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.260
I was like, I don't
deserve this much.

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.750
So OK, so we all experience it.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.250
So you're not alone.

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:10.480
Second, you can try
to trick your brain

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.530
and this has been
found to be effective,

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:16.210
so that instead of
focusing on how you feel,

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:19.670
you focus on the issue
of imposture syndrome.

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:23.310
Like it's not me, it's the
imposter syndrome talking.

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:26.770
And literally like
saying that in the mirror

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.200
has been proven to be effective
in trying to overcome it.

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:33.170
Because it makes it an
issue, not your issue.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:36.070
I also think that having
friends and allies and members

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:38.890
of your feminist fight club or
whomever it is to remind you

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:40.300
that you're not getting fired.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.290
You don't suck.

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:43.870
It's going to be OK.

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:46.090
I know that you're
good at what you do--

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:49.600
can be the voice that
you need inside your head

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.980
to support you.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.980
There's other things you can
do, too, like power posing.

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:55.510
There's a list of
them in the book.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:59.860
But I think that remembering
that you know, Sheryl Sandberg,

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.390
says she felt like a fraud.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:03.940
And Meryl Streep, the
woman with the most Oscars

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:06.400
has said that every
time she wins an award,

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.340
she thinks they must
have made a mistake.

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:14.170
And so it's all of us, and
even some of the world's most

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:15.897
famous and successful people.

00:56:15.897 --> 00:56:17.980
SPEAKER: Thank you all so
much for your questions.

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:19.180
And thank you, Jessica.

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:24.030
[APPLAUSE]
