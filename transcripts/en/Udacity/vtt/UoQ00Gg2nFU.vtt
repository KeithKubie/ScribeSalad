00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.106
Along the way, you've picked up some useful tools for model building and

00:00:03.106 --> 00:00:03.760
data analysis.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.440
We've gained some insight in how the amount of data relates to

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.920
accuracy in our models.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.082
We've learned to look for structure in our data.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:18.829
Sometimes, there is no functional relationship in data and

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.656
what you're seeing is the simple result of a random process.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:23.456
In which case,

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:27.030
the best performing model we can come up with is a fit to that process.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.770
We've seen how to identify non-linear relationships between variables.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.220
Sometimes, these relationships cannot be picked up by linear model tools,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.300
such as linear regression.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.520
We've seen that information gain is a more general and powerful tool for

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.770
identifying relationships.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.750
And finally, we've learned how to quantity and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.270
communicate the uncertainty in our model using confidence bands.
