believe it or not a clock on your head

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210
believe it or not a clock on your head
 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.999
believe it or not a clock on your head
beats at a different rate than a clock

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009
beats at a different rate than a clock
 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.629
beats at a different rate than a clock
on your foot we can now measure this and

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
on your foot we can now measure this and
 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.080
on your foot we can now measure this and
it has practical importance as well

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090
it has practical importance as well
 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.419
it has practical importance as well
first of all I'm Stine said that time is

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
first of all I'm Stine said that time is
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.990
first of all I'm Stine said that time is
a river so gigantic river we're all

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000
a river so gigantic river we're all
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.019
a river so gigantic river we're all
swept up in the river of time and it can

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
swept up in the river of time and it can
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.720
swept up in the river of time and it can
speed up and it slows down for example

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
speed up and it slows down for example
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.060
speed up and it slows down for example
on the moon did you know that time beats

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
on the moon did you know that time beats
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220
on the moon did you know that time beats
faster on the moon than it does on the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
faster on the moon than it does on the
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.009
faster on the moon than it does on the
earth and we can measure this on Jupiter

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
earth and we can measure this on Jupiter
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.920
earth and we can measure this on Jupiter
time beats slower on Jupiter than it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
time beats slower on Jupiter than it
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.440
time beats slower on Jupiter than it
does on the earth so time beats at

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
does on the earth so time beats at
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.250
does on the earth so time beats at
different rates

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
different rates
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.830
different rates
when an object moves very fast time

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
when an object moves very fast time
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.950
when an object moves very fast time
slows down inside that rocket that is

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
slows down inside that rocket that is
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.619
slows down inside that rocket that is
moving very fast if that rocket is then

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
moving very fast if that rocket is then
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.010
moving very fast if that rocket is then
placed on the moon time beats faster so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
placed on the moon time beats faster so
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380
placed on the moon time beats faster so
we have two competing effects this has a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
we have two competing effects this has a
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.510
we have two competing effects this has a
direct implication with regards to your

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
direct implication with regards to your
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.689
direct implication with regards to your
cell phone your cell phone has GPS which

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
cell phone your cell phone has GPS which
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490
cell phone your cell phone has GPS which
allows you to locate objects on the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
allows you to locate objects on the
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.529
allows you to locate objects on the
planet Earth by focusing in on

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
planet Earth by focusing in on
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.310
planet Earth by focusing in on
satellites orbiting the planet earth

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320
satellites orbiting the planet earth
 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.109
satellites orbiting the planet earth
satellites travel at 18,000 miles per

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
satellites travel at 18,000 miles per
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.850
satellites travel at 18,000 miles per
hour if they're in low-earth orbit

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
hour if they're in low-earth orbit
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.390
hour if they're in low-earth orbit
therefore time slows down for those

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
therefore time slows down for those
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.450
therefore time slows down for those
low-lying satellites but if satellites

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
low-lying satellites but if satellites
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.480
low-lying satellites but if satellites
go farther and farther away gravity gets

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
go farther and farther away gravity gets
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060
go farther and farther away gravity gets
less and less and less so time speeds up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
less and less and less so time speeds up
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010
less and less and less so time speeds up
so we're not a space we have two

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
so we're not a space we have two
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.710
so we're not a space we have two
competing effects fast satellites slow

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
competing effects fast satellites slow
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.530
competing effects fast satellites slow
down in time very far away satellites

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
down in time very far away satellites
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.770
down in time very far away satellites
slow speed up in time and in fact at one

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
slow speed up in time and in fact at one
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.050
slow speed up in time and in fact at one
radius you can calculate time beats

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
radius you can calculate time beats
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090
radius you can calculate time beats
exactly the same rate as it does in the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
exactly the same rate as it does in the
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.969
exactly the same rate as it does in the
planet Earth so what does it mean your

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
planet Earth so what does it mean your
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.730
planet Earth so what does it mean your
GPS system would totally fail without

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
GPS system would totally fail without
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.429
GPS system would totally fail without
Einstein's theory of special and general

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
Einstein's theory of special and general
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.789
Einstein's theory of special and general
relativity this also means that the top

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799
relativity this also means that the top
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679
relativity this also means that the top
of your head because it is farther from

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
of your head because it is farther from
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.630
of your head because it is farther from
the center of the earth beats at a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
the center of the earth beats at a
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.389
the center of the earth beats at a
faster rate time beats at a faster rate

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
faster rate time beats at a faster rate
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.170

than your feet so you can actually show

than your feet so you can actually show
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389
than your feet so you can actually show
that even within your own body now our

that even within your own body now our
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.399
that even within your own body now our
instruments are so accurate that you

instruments are so accurate that you
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.980
instruments are so accurate that you
could show within your own body the fact

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
could show within your own body the fact
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.630
could show within your own body the fact
that time beats at different rates

that time beats at different rates
