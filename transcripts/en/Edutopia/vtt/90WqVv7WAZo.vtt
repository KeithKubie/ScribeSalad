00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:13.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Built in 1898, this brick
schoolhouse on the southwest side

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:16.486
of Chicago has seen
good times and bad.

00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:17.466
&gt;&gt;Arne: Twenty years ago,

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.236
we were called the worst
school system in America.

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:21.126
I don't know whether
that was true or not,

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.516
but we definitely didn't have a
school system we could be proud of.

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:25.626
And we've come an extraordinarily
long way,

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:28.666
particularly since the
mayor took over in 1995.

00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:33.236
And I absolutely am convinced that
where school becomes the true heart,

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:35.326
the true center of the
community, our students are going

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.146
to do extraordinarily well.

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:41.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One of Chicago's most
successful new initiatives began

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:43.856
in this old schoolhouse in 2003.

00:00:44.526 --> 00:00:47.836
It's a pre-kindergarten through high
school learning community called

00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:50.776
Spry, where test scores
are on the rise

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:54.496
and the graduation rate
hovers around 100 percent.

00:00:55.196 --> 00:01:00.206
&gt;&gt;Student: I pledge to myself
to do only my best and to lead

00:01:00.206 --> 00:01:02.376
by example for all of the rest.

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:05.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To alleviate overcrowding
and avoid conflict between younger

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:08.896
and older students, Spry
devised a unique schedule.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.486
K-8 students start
the day at nine a.m.

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:15.276
and the high schoolers'
first class starts at eleven.

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:16.666
&gt;&gt;Tim: Okay, similes.

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.096
What is a simile?

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:20.616
&gt;&gt;Isamar: It's good, because
I'm not a morning person.

00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:22.826
&gt;&gt;Tim: Get specific, you understand?

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:24.916
Go the extra step.

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:28.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: High school students
put in a full eight-hour day,

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.406
and many participate in
afterschool programs.

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:35.636
They also attend sessions on Saturday
and throughout the summer in order

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.426
to graduate in just three years.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:40.466
&gt;&gt;Isamar: I'm a sophomore, but
it's like we also call each other

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:44.086
"sophners" because in a different
school, we would actually be juniors.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:45.566
We have to come during the summer.

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.816
I thought at first it was going
to drag, but it's gone by so fast.

00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:50.916
It's like, I can't even believe
it that next year, you know,

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:51.706
I'm going to be a senior.

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:52.026
&gt;&gt;Tim: All right?

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:53.636
Again, the details
of pictures come in.

00:01:53.636 --> 00:01:54.666
So Cora, which one did you use?

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:58.126
&gt;&gt;Cora: The room is crowded like
a mall on a Saturday afternoon.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:01:59.906
&gt;&gt;Tim: Oh, the details.

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:01.546
&gt;&gt;Carlos: We aim for
100 percent graduation.

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:03.506
We have the highest expectations.

00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:07.156
And our theme is that
the greatest influence

00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:08.846
on the student is the family.

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:12.956
And the greatest influence on
the family is the community.

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:17.346
So it is very important to develop
a school to meet community needs.

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:19.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school
takes advantage

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:24.426
of many community resources, like a
local hospital, where Isamar Martinez

00:02:24.426 --> 00:02:28.086
and several of her classmates spend
three mornings a week as interns.

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:31.776
&gt;&gt;Tim: The internship is a very
special part of what the school is.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:33.046
And it's important for
a number of reasons.

00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:34.096
Number one, getting them out there.

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.606
Number two, giving
them the opportunity

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:38.966
to see what may be working
is all about and the kind

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:40.276
of difficulties you're going to face.

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.476
&gt;&gt;Arlyn: Put together discharge kit.

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:45.786
&gt;&gt;Arlyn: Right now, the students
are scheduled and assigned

00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:47.786
in all different departments.

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:51.476
They work with information
systems, finance,

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.656
medical records, telecommunication.

00:02:55.086 --> 00:02:59.876
And everybody enjoys having
the students here with us.

00:02:59.876 --> 00:02:59.956
&gt;&gt;Isamar: [speaks Spanish]

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:00.296
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:02.966
&gt;&gt;Isamar: I work with
the pediatricians.

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:07.036
And if I finish early, I get to
watch them do like everything,

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:08.346
like take the temperature.

00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:11.126
And I like that because, I mean, not
that I don't have anything to do,

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:13.586
but I like the fact that I get to
watch them do what they do, you know?

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:16.826
&gt;&gt;Tim: Some kids, it's a success
from the get-go, and some kids,

00:03:16.886 --> 00:03:18.306
they're going to fall
on their face sometimes

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:19.866
or not do what they're
supposed to do.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.336
But I think that's why it's valuable.

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:24.306
I mean, I think you learn more
from your mistakes than you ever do

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:25.916
from just being successful
all the time.

00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:29.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Some high schoolers
get to experience the successes

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:32.706
and failures of teaching, serving
as tutors for the elementary kids.

00:03:32.706 --> 00:03:35.446
&gt;&gt;Claudia: If you see that they're
still struggling giving you a good

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:37.226
summary, ask them questions.

00:03:37.746 --> 00:03:41.406
&gt;&gt;Claudia: It has been so helpful,
especially with the newcomers.

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:44.826
They enjoy it, because they're,
you know, they could relate to them

00:03:45.046 --> 00:03:46.106
and they know they're language.

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:47.026
They're also bilingual.

00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:48.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Who wants to keep
reading on the third paragraph?

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:49.436
Go on.

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:52.936
&gt;&gt;Claudia: And I've noticed that
as soon as they start working

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:55.696
with the high school kids,
you get more interaction,

00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:58.126
you get more involvement,
so they enjoy it more.

00:03:58.946 --> 00:04:02.926
&gt;&gt;Carlos: Sometimes when we
describe our model, some people ask,

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.516
"You're going to have high school
kids and elementary kids together?

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:07.696
That's not a good practice.

00:04:07.966 --> 00:04:10.446
That's not safe, you know.

00:04:10.446 --> 00:04:11.816
That's why we have
high schools separate."

00:04:13.226 --> 00:04:17.566
Well, I think our work
is incomplete if we think

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:19.236
that after eighth grade,
well, we're done.

00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:23.176
And then suddenly, they go elsewhere,
and many of them are not successful.

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:24.146
&gt;&gt;Student: And then choose one--

00:04:24.646 --> 00:04:26.526
&gt;&gt;Carlos: We work with the
high school students saying

00:04:26.526 --> 00:04:29.396
that you are role models
to the elementary children.

00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:32.326
You represent what
they would like to be.

00:04:32.816 --> 00:04:36.996
So there's an added degree to
personal responsibility to this.

00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:39.756
&gt;&gt;Ana: Move this window
down over here, just for a--

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:41.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Another program
that links elementary

00:04:41.496 --> 00:04:46.066
and high school studies is a national
afterschool program called Miracles,

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:48.486
which offers a project-based
curriculum

00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:50.646
in an all-inclusive computer lab.

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:53.586
&gt;&gt;Ana: Miracles is a two-hour
program three times a week.

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:57.886
The students have access to
computer and they learn Word,

00:04:57.886 --> 00:05:00.826
Excel, PhotoShop, Publisher.

00:05:00.826 --> 00:05:04.816
And so that gives them an advantage,
as opposed to the other students

00:05:04.816 --> 00:05:07.036
in their class who are
not members of Miracles.

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:09.066
&gt;&gt;Ana: So you do need to crop this.

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:12.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Designed to boost math,
reading, technology, and life skills,

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:17.376
Miracles requires students to commit
to a six-hour per week program

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:21.106
that begins in the sixth grade
and continues through high school.

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:25.166
Sixth grade students illustrate
the life skills they learn

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:27.276
by creating claymation movies.

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:30.516
&gt;&gt;Adrian: The first thing you have to
do is to draw it, so see how it looks

00:05:30.516 --> 00:05:32.526
on the computer in Paint.

00:05:32.526 --> 00:05:35.516
And then we get the clay for
it to be hard and steady.

00:05:36.026 --> 00:05:38.716
So and then we move it, we
take more and more pictures

00:05:38.716 --> 00:05:39.756
for it to look like a movie.

00:05:40.576 --> 00:05:43.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This movie illustrates
the life skill, friendliness.

00:05:43.756 --> 00:05:46.546
&gt;&gt;Adrian: So he's walking
and then he falls down.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:50.186
And then he sees that he's
fallen, so he picks him up.

00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:53.436
He is the person that helps
another person without asking.

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:55.976
So then that's a life skill.

00:05:56.286 --> 00:05:57.936
&gt;&gt;Ana: How many pegs does it have?

00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:00.786
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In seventh grade,
they build Lego robots.

00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:02.946
&gt;&gt;Ana: Basically, I
just kind of watch

00:06:03.106 --> 00:06:06.606
that they don't get sidetracked, or
that-- if I see that they're stuck,

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:08.106
just kind of guide them a little.

00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:13.456
Because the beauty of this program
is that they can be creative with it.

00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:16.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Miracles lab
also serves the community

00:06:16.436 --> 00:06:19.996
with adult literacy and computer
fundamentals classes offered

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:20.746
on Saturdays.

00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:22.586
&gt;&gt;Student: [speaks Spanish]

00:06:22.586 --> 00:06:26.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's just one of the many
out-of-school time offerings at Spry.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:31.156
By partnering with agencies like
the Boys and Girls Club directly

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:35.116
across the playground, Spry
offers everything from adult math

00:06:35.116 --> 00:06:38.556
to computer science and salsa.

00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:46.146
[music] Spry has become the
fulfillment of its principal's dream,

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:50.286
a community where learning
happens everywhere, all the time,

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:53.416
and everyone has a stake in it.

00:06:53.556 --> 00:06:55.866
&gt;&gt;Carlos: This trilogy
of school, family,

00:06:55.866 --> 00:06:57.116
and community is very important.

00:06:58.046 --> 00:07:02.536
Because if you take a look at our
school and you see the potential

00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:05.886
when they move to the local
church, to the Boys and Girls Club,

00:07:06.646 --> 00:07:10.656
when they go to their homes, and the
message of education is reinforced,

00:07:11.116 --> 00:07:13.136
then the opportunities
for success are greater.

00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:15.436
I think it empowers us.

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:18.276
And we know it's extra work,

00:07:18.676 --> 00:07:22.496
but we have to share the
work, and that's what counts.

00:07:24.086 --> 00:07:26.296
