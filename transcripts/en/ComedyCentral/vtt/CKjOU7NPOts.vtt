00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.724
SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.392
- WELL, ADAM, HOW MANY GIRLS
HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH?

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:28.228

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.999
YOU CAN'T ASK ME THAT.
- SORRY.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.400

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.469
JUST KIDDING.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.337
[both laugh]
[softly] FIVE.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.939
- YEAH, I'M JUST TRYING
TO SEE SOMETHING

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:42.409
WAY MORE REAL THAN GOD,
LIKE...A DRAGON.

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.977
THAT'D BE SWEET.

00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.046

00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:48.882
HERE'S YOUR COLLAR.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.017
- NO CAN DO, GUYS.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.318
ALICE JUST BUZZED MY CELLY

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.053
AND WANTS ME TO JOIN HER
IN WEST COVINA

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:54.555
FOR A BUSINESS CONVENTION.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:56.690
- THEN YOU EXPLAIN TO HER
THAT YOU CAN'T,

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.792
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING ACID
WITH US, RIGHT?

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.661
- WE'RE DOING DRUGS, WE'RE DOING
A LOT OF DRUGS TOGETHER.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:01.862
- GUYS...COME ON.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.330
THIS IS KIND OF
A BIG DEAL FOR ME.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.065
IT'S MY FIRST BUSINESS TRIP,
RIGHT?

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.067
I'M LIKE STEVE MARTIN
IN THAT JOHN CANDY MOVIE.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.235
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO BE LIKE STEVE JOBS

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:09.803
AND DO A BUNCH OF ACID
WITH US.

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.705
- STEVE JOBS, RIGHT?
CREATED APPLE.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:12.806
GREAT COMPANY.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.441
BUT THEN HE LEFT
AND CREATED PIXAR,

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.876
WHICH IS WAY BETTER,
THEN HE CAME BACK TO APPLE,

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.344
MADE THAT WAY BETTER.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:19.146
WE GOT iPADS, iPHONES,
ALL SORTS OF STUFF.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.981
LET ME GO CREATE
MY PIXAR.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.283
THEN I'LL COME BACK AND WE'LL
DROP iPHONES, OKAY?

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:25.719
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
ANY OF THAT STUFF MEANT.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.087
- NO.
- AM I PIXAR?

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.989
WE ARE DOING ACID TOGETHER,
DUDE!

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.592
[buzzing and screaming]

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.126
- [high-pitched screaming]

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.229
- OH! OH, GOD!

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.797
- OKAY, HELP ME OUT.
- OKAY, GET THIS OFF.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.831
- HELP ME OUT.
- OKAY.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:38.799
- WISH ME LUCK!

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.400
- WE ARE DOING ACID TOGETHER
