00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.250
For those of you who
are just starting

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.700
to learn about the
history of China

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.000
in the first half
of the 20th century,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.750
it can be a little
bit confusing.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.040
So the goal of this video is
really to give you an overview,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.070
to give you a scaffold, of
the history of the first half

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.980
of the 20th century in China.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.680
So as we go into
the early 1900s,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.390
you have the end of imperial
dynastic rule in China.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.380
This is a big deal.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.510
China has been ruled
by various dynasties

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.670
for multiple thousands of years.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.340
But as you get into the
1900s, the dynastic rule,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.190
in particular the Qing Dynasty,
was getting weaker and weaker.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.670
It had suffered at the
hands of the Japanese

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.310
during the first Sino-Japanese
War at the end of the 1800s.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.290
There was growing discontent
amongst the opposition

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.400
that the dynasty,
that the emperors,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.440
were not modernizing
China enough.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.121
Remember, this is
the early 1900s.

00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.370
The rest of the world was
becoming a very, very modern

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.110
place.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.380
China in the 1800s had suffered
at the hands of Western powers

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.220
who were essentially exerting
their own imperial influence

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.210
in China.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.480
Many people felt that this
was because China was not

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.950
as modernized
economically, politically,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.480
technologically as
it needed to be.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.860
And so you fast-forward to 1911.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.220
You have what is known as
the Wuchang Uprising, which

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.400
led to the overthrow
of the Qing dynasty.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.510
By 1912, a Republic of China
was established in Nanjing.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.470
So Nanjing right over here
was where it was established.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.550
Beijing was, of course, the
seat of dynastic rule in China.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.870
And the first
provisional president

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.530
of the Republic of China was Dr.
Sun Yat-sen, right over here.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.700
And he actually did not
directly participate

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.970
in this final
uprising that finally

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.460
led to the overthrow
of the Qing dynasty.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.660
He was actually in Denver at
the time, Denver, Colorado.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.810
But he was a leading or one of
the leading figures in the run

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.830
up to this uprising, one
of the leading figures

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.449
who was providing
opposition and had tried

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.940
multiple times to
overthrow the dynasty.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.090
Now along with Sun Yat-sen,
he was essentially in cahoots

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.820
with Yuan Shikai, who was a
general in the old dynasty.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.270
And he has his own
fascinating history.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.600
And Sun Yat-sen struck
a deal with Yuan Shikai,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.250
who was very
politically ambitious.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.830
Yuan Shikai said, hey, if I
can get the emperor Puyi, who

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.230
was the last emperor of China,
if I can get him to officially

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.740
abdicate, I want to
become the president.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.320
So Sun Yat-sen agrees to this.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.050
So Yuan Shikai
becomes the president

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.880
of the Republic of China.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.450
But that wasn't enough for him.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.030
He declares himself
emperor in 1915,

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.390
which you could imagine did
not make many people happy

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.370
because they were tired
of having emperors.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.990
And by 1916, he abdicates
and he passes away, actually.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.420
And this actually
begins a period

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.510
of extremely fragmented
rule for China.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.440
Even under imperial rule,
the Chinese military

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.240
was not one consolidated body.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.640
The military was controlled
by various warlords

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.590
in various regions that all
had allegiance to the emperor.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.630
Once you have Yuan Shikai
abdicating and then dying

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.960
in 1916, and even
prior to that, when

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.980
he declared himself
emperor, people

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.220
did not want to pledge
allegiance to Yuan Shikai.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.460
And so you had what is known
as the beginning of the Warlord

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.130
Era in China.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.790
And this is a fragmented
period where you did not

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.850
have any centralized leadership.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.310
This map over here shows
kind of the rough picture

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.040
of what the Warlord
Era looked like.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.010
Each of these regions
were controlled

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.390
by a different warlord
who was in charge

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.850
of a different military.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.440
When this was going on
during the Warlord Era,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.680
especially as we go back
to the early '20s, in 1921

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.120
in particular, Sun
Yat-sen hasn't given up.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.340
He goes to the
south in Guangzhou

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.510
and sets up, essentially,
a revolutionary government,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.820
essentially a desire
from there to try

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.810
to consolidate power in
China again and reestablish

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.970
the Republic of China.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.540
So he goes there.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.440
But unfortunately he passes
away in 1925 from cancer.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.790
And the hands or the power of
the movement that he started,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.710
which is now being referred
to as the Kuomintang-- Let me

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.550
write that down.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.150
Essentially, the
power there passes on

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.042
to Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek.

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:01.500
And Chiang Kai-shek,
the reason why

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.166
we say the power
essentially goes to him

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:05.530
is because he was in
control of the major part

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.540
of the military forces
of the Kuomintang.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.040
And this is essentially the
very nascent early stages

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.050
of what would essentially
be the Chinese Civil

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.890
War because in the period from
1921 until Sun Yat-sen's death,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.990
you actually had a
lot of collaboration

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.590
between the Chinese
nationalists, the Kuomintang,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.540
and the Soviet Union, and
the Chinese Communist Party.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.910
They were trying to
collaborate in order

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.810
to think about how
China would unify.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.830
But then once Sun Yat-sen dies
and the power of the Kuomintang

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.890
essentially goes into the
hands of Generalissimo Chiang

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.080
Kai-shek, he starts
to consolidate power.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.070
And right from the
get-go, he doesn't

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.810
antagonize the communists.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.010
But by 1927, he's
starting to consolidate,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.840
he's starting to merge
these various factions

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.970
in the rest of China.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.900
So he's able to
consolidate power.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.470
But he also starts to
go after the communists.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.976
So Chiang Kai-shek,
by '27, also starts

00:06:11.976 --> 00:06:13.100
to go after the communists.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.683
And the communists
are saying, hey, we

00:06:14.683 --> 00:06:18.110
are the ones that really
represent the spirit of what

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.375
Sun Yat-sen represented,
while the Kuomintang

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:23.750
under the leadership of Chiang
Kai-shek said, no, no, no.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.060
We represent what Sun Yat-sen
represented when he first

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.330
established the
Republic of China.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.531
And so in 1927, you have the
beginning of the Chinese Civil

00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:37.030
War.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.650
This is when the Kuomintang,
as part of its efforts

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.550
to consolidate
power, not only tries

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.350
to consolidate power
of the warlords,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.670
but also goes after
the Communist Party.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.990
Now while all of
this is happening,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.210
as we get into the early
1930s, Japan once again

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.470
is trying to exert its
imperial, its military,

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.860
might on the Chinese mainland.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.970
They had already
captured Formosa,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.400
which is now known
as Taiwan, and Korea

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.340
during the first Sino-Japanese
War at the end of the 1800s.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:16.250
And then in 1931, the Japanese
start to encroach on Manchuria.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.860
And this would essentially
become a multi-year occupation

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.960
and infiltration of
Japan into China.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.790
And this continues all
the way until 1937,

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.350
when it becomes an
official all-out war

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.870
between the Japanese
and the Chinese.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.130
And I have a map
here that shows kind

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:40.050
of the maximum Japanese
control over this period.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.250
And so in east Asia between
the Chinese and the Japanese,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.440
World War II was really just
part of the Sino-Japanese War.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.780
The Japanese had
already encroached

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.310
on the mainland of China
well before World War

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.790
II had officially begun.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.020
Now while all this
is happening, Japan

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.640
is encroaching into Manchuria,
in 1934, you have to remember,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.370
the Kuomintang, the Nationalist
Party under Chiang Kai-shek

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.160
is going after the communists.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.560
And in 1934, he almost
has them, or he does.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.510
The communists are
nearly defeated.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.810
They're surrounded by
the Nationalist Party.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.590
And this becomes what
is a fairly famous event

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.790
in Chinese history, the
famous Long March, where

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.410
the Chinese Communist
Party, their military,

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.820
is marched through
extremely tough terrain

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.330
all the way to the
northwest of China.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.490
So this right over here is
a map of the Long March.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.060
The Chinese Communist Party
seemed to be on the ropes

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.370
here in 1934.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.580
And it was during
this Long March

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.670
that Mao Zedong really started
to exert and show leadership.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.580
The leadership during
this Long March,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.080
during this retreat to
the northwest of China,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.950
is really what allowed Mao
Zedong to eventually take

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.180
control of the Chinese
Communist Party.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.140
Now as we fast forward, we know
that the Sino-Japanese War--

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.700
you could view this as one
theater, eventually, of World

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.360
War II-- eventually the
US goes in on the side

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.200
of the Allies against
Japan after Pearl Harbor.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.210
And then in 1945,
you have the attacks

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.900
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
with atomic weapons,

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.640
which essentially ends
the Pacific theater.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:36.240
It's defeat for Japan, and
Japan has lost World War II.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.530
And at this point,
full-scale civil war

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.720
between the two parties
break out again.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.720
The Civil War started in 1927,
and then it kept continuing.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.780
But then once there was a common
enemy in Japan that was clearly

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.140
aggressively trying to take
over more and more of China's

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.750
people, resources, exert
its imperial influence,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.370
then you had the two parties
kind of go into a low-grade war

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.420
and say, hey, we need
to fight these Japanese.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.880
But once World War
II ended in 1945,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.670
once the Japanese were
defeated, then you

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.530
had full-scale
civil war break out

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.100
again between the
Chinese Communist

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.260
Party and the Kuomintang.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.850
And this is probably one of the
biggest comebacks in history.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.892
This was the Chinese Communist
Party that in 1934 and 1935

00:10:18.892 --> 00:10:20.350
looked like they
were on the ropes.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.964
They were forced into,
essentially, retreat.

00:10:23.964 --> 00:10:25.130
They were able to come back.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.480
And in 1949-- and
there's a lot of theories

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.086
as to why they were
able to pull this off.

00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:33.800
That they were able to get
much more of the support

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.090
from the rural population.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.460
They were more savvy about
getting support generally

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.360
than the Kuomintang.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.070
But we could talk about
that in a future video.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.290
But by 1949, they
were able to defeat

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.770
Chiang Kai-shek
and the Kuomintang,

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:53.770
force the Kuomintang
to retreat to Taiwan,

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.570
establish government in Taiwan.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.760
And ever since then, you
had the establishment

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.440
by the Chinese
Communist Party in 1949

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.144
of the People's
Republic of China.
