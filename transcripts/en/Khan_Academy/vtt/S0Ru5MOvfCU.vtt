00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:01.964
- [Instructor] What
we're going to focus on

00:00:01.964 --> 00:00:05.735
in this video is the idea of impeachment,

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:08.705
what it is and how it
works, with a little bit

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:10.233
of historical background.

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.838
So, before we go into impeachment,

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:15.343
let's just review some key
ideas about the US government.

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:17.724
We have this idea of separation of powers.

00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:20.236
Where you have these
three, somewhat independent

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.462
branches of government.

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:22.595
You have the Executive Branch,

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:24.734
headed by the President
of the United States,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.276
in charge of running the
state, running the government.

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:30.917
You have the Legislative Branch,

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:33.903
which in the United States has two houses,

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:35.547
you have the House of Representatives

00:00:35.547 --> 00:00:37.507
and you have the Senate.

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:39.443
And it's in charge of passing laws

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:42.622
and deciding on the budget
that the government,

00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:47.195
that the Executive Branch
uses to run the government.

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:49.369
And we have the Judicial Branch,

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:51.869
which is the US Supreme Court.

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.486
And related to this idea
of separation of powers,

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:58.191
they're not completely independent,

00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.855
but it's designed to be in a way

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.961
that not one group or no one
group can overrun the others.

00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:05.445
And what helps them do this is this idea

00:01:05.445 --> 00:01:08.018
of checks and balances.

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:11.626
That for example, the
Legislative can pass a law,

00:01:11.626 --> 00:01:14.509
but the Executive Branch can veto it,

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.996
but the Legislative
can override that veto.

00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:20.881
You have the Judicial
Branch that can decide on

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.619
the constitutionality of a law
that the Legislative Branch

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.895
passes or even an action that
the Executive Branch takes.

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:30.436
And it can even interpret the laws

00:01:30.436 --> 00:01:32.278
that have already been passed.

00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:36.263
The Executive Branch can
appointment the members

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:38.456
of the US Supreme Court.

00:01:38.456 --> 00:01:41.187
So, you see this idea
of checks and balances.

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:43.408
And perhaps the biggest check

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:47.575
that the Legislative Branch
has, is the idea of impeachment.

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:49.938
So what is it?

00:01:49.938 --> 00:01:53.049
So, some people believe, or
are under the impression,

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.094
that impeachment is, if
someone gets impeached

00:01:55.094 --> 00:01:58.176
they are removed from
office, that is not the case.

00:01:58.176 --> 00:02:01.178
Impeachment is really a formal accusation,

00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:04.320
in legal terms you might
hear the word indictment.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.153
Indictment is a formal accusation.

00:02:08.134 --> 00:02:10.503
And so if the US House of Representatives

00:02:10.503 --> 00:02:14.020
with the majority vote decides
to make a formal accusation

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.588
against, say, the President,
that would be impeachment.

00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:19.794
But even if that passes,
then the Senate will try

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:24.107
the President, to decide if
they will actually be convicted.

00:02:24.107 --> 00:02:26.830
So, once the indictment happens
and this would be the House

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.672
that does this with
just a simple majority,

00:02:30.672 --> 00:02:34.875
then the Senate, so this is
the Senate right over here,

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:39.568
they're going to decide whether
to convict the individual,

00:02:39.568 --> 00:02:42.874
which could be the President,
or they might acquit,

00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:46.330
which is saying that formal
accusation is not valid.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.586
Now another thing to appreciate is,

00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:51.165
the Senate can't send
the President to jail,

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:54.163
but what they can do is
remove them from office

00:02:54.163 --> 00:02:56.734
and keep them from holding
office in the future.

00:02:56.734 --> 00:03:00.003
Now historically, only two
President have been impeached.

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:03.090
This right over here is a
drawing of the impeachment

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.414
proceedings for President
Andrew Johnson in 1869,

00:03:07.414 --> 00:03:09.507
17th President of the United States.

00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:11.711
And he was impeached,

00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:15.185
which means the House of
Representatives, had a majority

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:19.314
saying that he did a high
crime and misdemeanor,

00:03:19.314 --> 00:03:21.401
and we'll talk more about
that in a little bit.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.576
Which officially by doing that indictment

00:03:23.576 --> 00:03:25.911
that made it an impeachment,

00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:27.513
so he has been officially impeached.

00:03:27.513 --> 00:03:30.577
They claim that he violated
the Tenure of Office Act,

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:34.564
which prevented the President
from firing cabinet members

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:36.551
without congressional permission,

00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.789
but he decided to fire
his Secretary of War,

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.331
which is now called the
Secretary of Defense,

00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:43.407
without congressional approval
and so they impeached him.

00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:46.620
But he did not get
convicted, he was acquitted,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.325
the Senate was not able to
get the two-thirds majority.

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:54.514
The other President to be
impeached is much more recent.

00:03:54.514 --> 00:03:57.503
This is President Bill Clinton in 1998,

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.942
the US House of Representatives
with a simple majority

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:04.308
was able to impeach him on accusations

00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:07.143
of obstruction of justice,
so that you can imagine

00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:10.243
is something that prevents
a prosecutor from, say,

00:04:10.243 --> 00:04:13.791
finding information and perjury,
which is lying under oath.

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:16.482
But once again, even
though he was impeached,

00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:18.553
when it went to the Senate,
they weren't able to get

00:04:18.553 --> 00:04:22.653
the two-thirds super majority,
to remove him from office.

00:04:22.653 --> 00:04:25.016
So, neither of them, even
though they were both impeached,

00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:26.916
were actually removed from office.

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:29.791
The closest that a President
actually got removed

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.428
from office from something
that was like impeachment

00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:33.757
was Richard Nixon.

00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:36.255
Richard Nixon was about to be impeached,

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:38.465
but he resigned instead
of having to go through

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:40.412
the impeachment proceedings

00:04:40.412 --> 00:04:42.840
and then possibly getting convicted.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.566
But to really appreciate
what impeachment is,

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:48.338
let's just go straight
to the original text

00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:49.758
in the Constitution.

00:04:49.758 --> 00:04:52.811
This is from Article
I, Section 2, Clause 5,

00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:55.623
The House of Representatives shall chuse,

00:04:55.623 --> 00:04:58.258
and this is actually how
they spelled the word choose

00:04:58.258 --> 00:04:59.293
in the Constitution.

00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:01.181
The House of Representatives
shall chuse their Speaker

00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:03.138
and other Officers;

00:05:03.138 --> 00:05:06.888
and shall have the sole
Power of Impeachment.

00:05:08.184 --> 00:05:11.364
The Senate shall have the sole Power

00:05:11.364 --> 00:05:13.544
to try all Impeachments.

00:05:13.544 --> 00:05:16.562
So, once again the impeachment
is just the formal accusation

00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:19.625
it actually gets tried by the Senate

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.039
to decide if the person is actually guilty

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.275
of that accusation.

00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:26.690
When sitting for that Purpose,

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.357
they shall be on Oath or Affirmation.

00:05:29.357 --> 00:05:31.359
When the President of the
United States is tried,

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:34.630
the Chief Justice shall preside.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.912
So, once again, we often
associate impeachment

00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:39.143
with the President, but
this is making clear

00:05:39.143 --> 00:05:41.369
it's not just about
impeaching the President.

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:43.861
When it is the President,
who's being tried,

00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:46.123
it would be the Chief Justice who presides

00:05:46.123 --> 00:05:49.481
over the proceedings, in the Senate.

00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:51.378
And no Person shall be convicted

00:05:51.378 --> 00:05:54.059
without the Concurrence of two thirds

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.131
of the Members present.

00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:58.715
So, in the House, if
they can get to over 50%,

00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:00.483
then the accusation is formal,

00:06:00.483 --> 00:06:02.320
the person is essentially being indicted,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.152
which is called impeachment,
but they're not going to

00:06:04.152 --> 00:06:06.380
be convicted without two
thirds of the Senate.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.055
I encourage you to think
about why the threshold

00:06:09.055 --> 00:06:10.151
here is higher.

00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:12.010
Why the founders of our country decided

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.019
to make this threshold two thirds instead

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:15.391
of a simple majority.

00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:19.097
Judgment in Cases of
impeachment shall not extend

00:06:19.097 --> 00:06:21.184
further than to removal from Office,

00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:23.965
and disqualification to hold and enjoy any

00:06:23.965 --> 00:06:28.191
Office of honor, Trust, or
Profit under the United States:

00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:31.075
but the Party convicted
shall nevertheless be liable

00:06:31.075 --> 00:06:35.570
and subject to Indictment,
Trial, Judgment and Punishment,

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.914
according to the Law.

00:06:36.914 --> 00:06:39.810
So, here they're saying, the
most that the Senate can do,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.941
through the impeachment proceedings

00:06:41.941 --> 00:06:44.718
is remove them from office
and maybe prevent them

00:06:44.718 --> 00:06:46.713
from holding any other office,

00:06:46.713 --> 00:06:49.008
but they can't send them to jail,

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:52.161
the same way the traditional
legal system could.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.793
But if someone really did commit a crime,

00:06:54.793 --> 00:06:57.799
they still will be subject to
the traditional legal system.

00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:00.854
Finally, we see here in Article II,

00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:04.403
The President, Vice President,
and all civil Officers

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:07.454
of the United States, shall
be removed from Office on

00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:10.792
Impeachment for, and Conviction
of, Treason, Bribery,

00:07:10.792 --> 00:07:14.693
or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

00:07:14.693 --> 00:07:17.387
And there's actually two
points of ambiguity here.

00:07:17.387 --> 00:07:21.156
Who falls under all civil
officers of the United States?

00:07:21.156 --> 00:07:23.391
Does a member of congress
fall into that category?

00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:25.235
This is actually a matter of some debate.

00:07:25.235 --> 00:07:27.425
And what is a high crime and misdemeanor?

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:31.051
Most people understand what
treason and bribery are.

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:33.911
But what is a high crime and misdemeanor?

00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:35.614
And this has been subject of debate.

00:07:35.614 --> 00:07:37.975
What is an impeachable offense?

00:07:37.975 --> 00:07:41.085
And to answer that question,
I'll leave you with a quote

00:07:41.085 --> 00:07:44.666
from Gerald Ford, who became
President when Richard Nixon

00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:47.015
resigned because he was
about to be impeached

00:07:47.015 --> 00:07:49.780
and this is what he had to say.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.438
"An impeachable offense is
whatever a majority of the

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:55.075
"House of Representatives
considers it to be at a given

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:56.535
"moment in history;

00:07:56.535 --> 00:07:58.727
"conviction results from whatever offense

00:07:58.727 --> 00:08:02.019
"or offenses two-thirds of
the other body," the Senate,

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:05.672
"considers to be sufficiently
serious to require removal

00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:07.302
"of the accused from office."

00:08:07.302 --> 00:08:10.006
So, he's taking a very
pragmatic stance here.

00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:13.052
You have this notion of high
crimes and misdemeanors,

00:08:13.052 --> 00:08:13.885
what does that mean?

00:08:13.885 --> 00:08:15.144
And Gerald Ford is saying, well,

00:08:15.144 --> 00:08:17.711
whatever the House of
Representatives thinks that means.

00:08:17.711 --> 00:08:19.604
And so an interesting question is,

00:08:19.604 --> 00:08:21.772
how susceptible does this make the notion

00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:23.971
of impeachment to politics?

00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:25.702
And is that okay?

00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:28.080
And maybe the founders of
our country recognized that

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.013
and that's why they had a higher threshold

00:08:30.013 --> 00:08:33.738
for actual conviction and
removal of office in the Senate.
