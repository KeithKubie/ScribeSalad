00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:01.320
- [Voiceover] We're told that a particle

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.913
moves along the curve x squared, y squared

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:07.321
is equal to 16, so that
the the x-coordinate

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:09.514
is changing at a constant rate

00:00:09.514 --> 00:00:12.264
of negative two units per minute.

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:16.683
What is the rate of
change in units per minute

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:19.023
of the particle's y-coordinate

00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:22.273
when the particle is at the point 1, 4?

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.128
So let's just repeat, or
rewrite, what they told us.

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:28.568
So the curve is described by x squared,

00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:30.651
y squared is equal to 16.

00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:32.938
They tell us that up there.

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:34.572
They tell us that the x-coordinate

00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:37.197
is changing at a constant rate.

00:00:37.197 --> 00:00:38.471
We underline that.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:39.633
The x-coordinate is changing at

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.931
a constant rate of negative
two units per minute.

00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.473
So we could say that dx ...

00:00:45.473 --> 00:00:47.291
I'll write over here
on the right hand side.

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:48.707
Dx, dt.

00:00:48.707 --> 00:00:50.731
The rate of change of the x-coordinate

00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:53.726
with respect to time is
equal to negative two.

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:57.643
And they're saying units,
sub-unit of distance,

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:01.598
units divided by minute.

00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:03.015
Units per minute.

00:01:04.304 --> 00:01:05.757
What they want us to figure out

00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:07.381
is what is the rate of change

00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.679
of the particle's y-coordinate.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:10.963
So let me underline that.

00:01:10.963 --> 00:01:15.150
What is the rate of change of
the particle's y-coordinate?

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.789
So what they want us to
find is what is dy, dt.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.221
What is that equal to?

00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:25.258
And they say when the
particle as at the point 1,4,

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:29.176
so when x is equal to
one, so x is equal to one.

00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:33.268
And y is equal to four,
y is equal to four.

00:01:33.268 --> 00:01:36.463
So can we set up some
equation that involves

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.773
the rate of change of x with respect to t,

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:42.019
y with respect to t, x and y?

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:43.918
Well what if we were
to take the derivative

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:47.019
of this relation that describes the curve?

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:48.170
What if we were to take the derivative

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.541
with respect to t on both sides?

00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:52.421
So let me write that down.

00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:53.500
So we're going to take the derivative.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.083
Actually let me just erase this

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:01.791
so I have a little bit more space.

00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:03.105
Alright.

00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:06.103
That way I can just add it.

00:02:06.103 --> 00:02:09.443
So let's take the derivative with respect

00:02:09.443 --> 00:02:11.693
to t on both sides of that.

00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:14.384
And if at any point you get inspired

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.685
I encourage you to pause the video

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:19.076
and try to work through it.

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:20.625
Well on the left hand side, if we view

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.340
this as a product of two
functions right over here,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.507
we could take the derivative
of the first function,

00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:32.749
which is going to be the derivative

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.571
of x squared with respect to x.

00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:39.440
So that is 2x, and remember we're not

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.948
just taking the derivative
with respect to x,

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:43.710
we're taking the derivative
with respect to t,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.995
so we're going to have
to apply the chain rule.

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:46.301
So it's going to be the
derivative of x squared

00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:48.325
with respect to x, which is 2x,

00:02:48.325 --> 00:02:51.490
times the derivative
of x with respect to t.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.823
So times dx, dt.

00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:56.118
And then we're going to multiply

00:02:56.118 --> 00:02:58.508
that times the second function.

00:02:58.508 --> 00:03:00.091
So times y squared.

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:02.580
Times y squared.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.141
And then that's going to be plus

00:03:04.141 --> 00:03:08.262
the first function,
which is just x squared

00:03:08.262 --> 00:03:10.211
times the derivative of the second

00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.243
function with respect to d.

00:03:12.243 --> 00:03:13.686
So once again we're going
to apply the chain rule.

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:18.233
The derivative of y-squared
with respect to y is 2y.

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:19.849
I'm gonna do that in that orange color.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.349
It is equal to 2y.

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:27.615
And then times the derivative
of y with respect to t.

00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:28.698
Times dy, dt.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.985
And then that is going to be equal

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.624
to the derivative with respect to t of 16.

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:38.404
Well that doesn't change over time,

00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:41.479
so that's just going to be equal to zero.

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.564
So here we have it.

00:03:42.564 --> 00:03:44.255
We need to simplify this a little bit.

00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:46.142
But we have an equation that gives

00:03:46.142 --> 00:03:49.084
our relationship between
x, derivative of x

00:03:49.084 --> 00:03:52.998
with respect to t, y, and
derivative of y with respect to t.

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:54.220
So actually let me just rewrite

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.314
it one more time so it's
a little bit simplified.

00:03:56.314 --> 00:03:59.564
So this is 2xy squared dx, dt, plus ...

00:04:05.032 --> 00:04:06.702
Actually I don't even
have to rewrite it again.

00:04:06.702 --> 00:04:09.762
All we're trying to do
is solve for dy, dt,

00:04:09.762 --> 00:04:12.055
so let's actually just
substitute the values in.

00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:13.982
So we know we want to figure out

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:16.104
what's going on when x is equal to one.

00:04:16.104 --> 00:04:20.137
So we know that the x's
here are equal to one.

00:04:20.137 --> 00:04:23.334
This x, x squared, well that's
just going to be one squared,

00:04:23.334 --> 00:04:25.273
so that's just going to be equal to one.

00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:27.321
We know that y is equal to four.

00:04:27.321 --> 00:04:31.488
So this is going to be 16 and
this is going to be eight.

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:35.603
We know the derivative of x with

00:04:35.603 --> 00:04:37.217
respect to t is negative two.

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:39.736
They tell us that in
the problem statement.

00:04:39.736 --> 00:04:41.000
Negative two.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.895
So now this is a good time
to simplify this thing.

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:46.228
So this will simplify to ...

00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:48.940
Let's see, all of this is going

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.976
to be two times one times negative two,

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:53.809
so that is negative four times 16.

00:04:55.704 --> 00:04:59.371
So that is negative 64,
and then we have ...

00:05:01.963 --> 00:05:05.064
We'll use a color you can see.

00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:06.516
And then we have all of this.

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:08.930
Well this is just going to be
one time eight times dy, dt.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.426
So this going to be eight dy, dt.

00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:14.340
So plus eight times the derivative of y

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.084
with respect to t is equal to zero.

00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:20.203
Add 64 to both sides and we get ...

00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:21.741
I'll switch to a neutral color.

00:05:21.741 --> 00:05:23.523
Eight times the derivative of y

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:26.672
with respect to t is equal to 64.

00:05:26.672 --> 00:05:30.291
Divide both sides by eight and you get

00:05:30.291 --> 00:05:33.298
the derivative of y with respect to t

00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:37.480
is equal to 64 divided by eight is just 8.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.726
If you want to look at the units

00:05:39.726 --> 00:05:42.456
it will also be in units per minute.

00:05:42.456 --> 00:05:45.206
Sub-units of distance per minute.

00:05:47.383 --> 00:05:48.716
And we are done.
