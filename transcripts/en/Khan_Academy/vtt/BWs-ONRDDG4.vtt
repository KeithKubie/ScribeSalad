00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:09.210
This right here is a picture
of Henrietta Swan Leavitt.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.330
And she made, a little
over 100 years ago-- this

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.420
is in the early 1900s, while
working for Edward Charles

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.430
Pickering, who was a Harvard
astronomer, while working

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.770
for his observatory, she
made what is arguably--

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.130
well, definitely, one of the
most important discoveries

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.380
in all of astronomy.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.840
And I would say it ranks their
top three, because it really

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.820
enabled people like
Hubble to start

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.730
realizing that the
universe is expanding

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.920
or even being able to think
about how to measure distances

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.840
to objects in space well
beyond the reach of our tools

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.500
with parallax.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.370
We saw with parallax, you have
to have extremely sensitive

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.880
instruments just to
even measure distances

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.700
to stars relatively close to us.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.810
Very sensitive
instruments to get to

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.390
stars maybe further
out into our galaxy.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.840
And we don't have the
instruments, even today,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.530
to measure things
beyond our galaxy.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.730
But because of
Henrietta Swan Leavitt,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.680
we were able to
approximate or get

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.830
good senses of the distance
to objects beyond our galaxy.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.090
So let's just think
about what she did.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.360
So her job was literally
to classify stars

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.640
in the Large Magellanic, I have
trouble saying that, Magellanic

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.429
Cloud and the Small
Magellanic Clouds.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.970
And this is what they look like
from the Southern Hemisphere.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.630
This is the large,
right over here.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.950
And that this is the
small, right over here.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.840
And remember, this is before
Hubble realized that there--

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.650
or showed the world-- that there
are stars beyond our galaxy,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.530
or that there are galaxies
beyond our galaxy.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.613
So at this point in time,
people didn't even fully

00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:47.560
appreciate that these
were separate galaxies.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.700
We just said, hey, these
are kind of these blobs

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.810
or these clusters
of stars that we

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.469
see in the Southern Hemisphere.

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.010
And just to get a
sense of where they

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.110
are relative to our galaxy,
the Milky Way Galaxy--

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.020
this is obviously not
an actual picture.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.300
We can't take a picture
from this vantage point.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.050
This would have to be
very, very far away.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.220
But this is the
Milky Way right here.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.970
And this is the Small
Magellanic Cloud.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.640
And this is the Large
Magellanic Cloud.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.870
I'm getting better at saying it.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.070
So her job was literally just
to classify the different stars

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.620
that she saw.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.140
But while she was
classifying, she

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.879
looked at these things
called variables.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.420
And it turns out
what she was looking

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.490
at were a class of stars
called Cepheid or Cepheid,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.470
Cepheid variable stars.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.360
And what's interesting
about them is two things.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.230
They're super-duper bright.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.650
They're up to 30,000 times
as luminous as the sun.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.330
And they're 5 to 20
times more massive

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.720
than the sun, 5 to 20
times the sun's mass.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.420
But what makes them interesting
is one, they're really bright.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.190
So you can see them
from really far away.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.700
You can see these
Cepheid variable stars

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.060
in other galaxies.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.980
In fact, we can see it
well beyond even the Small

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.120
Magellanic Cloud or the
Large Magellanic Cloud.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.629
But you could see these
stars in other galaxies.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.420
And what's even more
interesting about them

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.000
is that their
intensity is variable.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.010
That they become
brighter and dimmer

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.290
with a well-defined period.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.790
So if you're looking at
a Cepheid variable star--

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.340
and this is just kind of
a simulation, a very cheap

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.520
simulation-- it
might look like this.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.130
And then over the course of
the next three, four days,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.990
it might reduce in intensity
to something like this.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.650
And then after three, four days
again, it will look like this.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.420
And then it'll look
like this again.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.630
So it's actual intensity
is going up and down

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.040
with a well-defined period.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.510
So if this takes three
days and then this

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.980
is another three
days, then the period,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.560
one entire cycle of its
going from low intensity

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.820
back to high intensity,
is going to be six days.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.160
So this is a six-day period.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.190
And what Henrietta
Leavitt saw, and this

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.640
wasn't an obvious
thing to do, she

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.702
assumed that everything
in each of these clouds

00:04:04.702 --> 00:04:06.160
are roughly the
same distance away.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.440
Everything in the
Large Magellanic Cloud

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.890
is roughly the
same distance away.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.920
And it's obviously not exact.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.310
This is an entire galaxy.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.680
So you have obviously things
further away in that galaxy

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.555
and things closer up.

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:18.170
You have stars here and here.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.670
And their distance isn't going
to be exactly the same to us,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.096
even though we're sitting
maybe over here someplace.

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:24.220
But it's going to be close.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.290
It wasn't a bad approximation.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.730
And by making that assumption,
she saw something pretty neat.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.970
If she plotted-- so let me
plot this right over here.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.660
So she plotted on
the horizontal axis,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:46.790
if she plotted the
relative luminosity.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.030
So really, the only way
that she can measure this

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.164
is just how bright
did they look to her?

00:04:51.164 --> 00:04:53.080
And she's assuming that
they're same distance.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.130
So obviously, if you have a
brighter star, but it's much,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.080
much further away, it's
going to look dimmer.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.132
So if you assume that they're
all roughly the same distance,

00:05:01.132 --> 00:05:02.590
then how bright it
is will tell you

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.250
how bright it is
at the actual star.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.830
So she plotted relative
luminosity of the star

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.950
on one axis.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.180
And on the other axis,
she plotted the period

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.800
of these variable stars.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.879
She plotted the period.

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.420
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.836
to do this on a
logarithmic scale.

00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:23.250
So let's say this is in days.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.200
So this is one day.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.220
This is 10 days.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.230
This is 100 days,
right over here.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.960
It's a logarithmic scale because
I'm going up in powers of 10.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.290
If we take the log of
these, this would be 0,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.384
this would be 1,
this would be 2.

00:05:40.384 --> 00:05:42.050
And so that's what
I'm using as a scale.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.010
So I'm using the
log of the period

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.830
or I'm just marking
them as 1, 10, 100.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.170
But I'm giving each of these
factors of 10 an equal spacing.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.260
But when you plot it on this
scale, the relative luminosity

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.800
versus the period,
she got a plot

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.300
that looked something like this.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.670
And this is obviously not exact.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.030
She got a plot that looks
something like this.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.900
It was a fairly
linear relationship

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.840
when you plot the
relative luminosity

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.970
against the log of the period.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.630
So this is obviously a
logarithmic scale over here.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.770
And so you could fit a line.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.500
And why, I'd argue and I
think most people would argue,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.330
this is one of the most
important discoveries

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.039
in astronomy is if you
know-- because think

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:25.330
about what the problem here is.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.144
We can look at all of
these stars in space.

00:06:28.144 --> 00:06:29.935
Let's say you look at
a fraction of the sky

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:32.380
and you look at something
that looks like that.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.580
So it's really bright.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.681
And then you see something
dim that looks like that.

00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:38.680
So if you have a very
superficial understanding,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.590
you say, oh, this
star is brighter.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.370
You would say that this is a
fundamentally brighter star.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.440
But how do you know that?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.890
Maybe, instead of
being brighter,

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.880
maybe it's just a
dimmer, closer star.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.225
Maybe this is a closer star.

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:54.060
Maybe this is an
entire galaxy, but it's

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.410
so far away that
you can't even tell.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:03.652
But all of a sudden, by the
work that Henrietta Leavitt did,

00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:05.880
if you see one of
these Cepheid variable

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.030
stars in another galaxy, you
know its relative brightness

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.704
compared to other
Cepheid variable stars.

00:07:12.704 --> 00:07:15.120
And so if you can place just
one of these Cepheid variable

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.411
stars, if you know exactly
the distance to one of them,

00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:19.580
and then you know its
absolute luminosity,

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.830
you then know the
absolute luminosity

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.370
of any other Cepheid
variable stars.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.580
So let's say using parallax,
which is our other tool,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.330
we find-- let's say there
are some star in our galaxy.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.690
And let's say using
parallax we're

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.490
able to come up with
a pretty good measure

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.740
that it is, I don't know, let's
say it's 100 light years away.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.640
And this star is a Cepheid,
this is a Cepheid variable star.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.580
And let's say its
period is one day.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.660
It's one day.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.500
So we now know
something interesting.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.570
We know variable stars
with a period of one day,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.780
at 100 light years away,
will look like this,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.690
will look like this
drawing right over here.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:14.530
So if we later on, if we later
on see a Cepheid variable

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:22.500
star with a period of one day,
so it gets brighter and dim

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.326
over the course of one day and
maybe it's red shifted as well,

00:08:26.326 --> 00:08:27.950
but maybe it looks
a little bit dimmer.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.290
It looks like this.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:34.750
We now know that if it
was 100 light years away,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.150
it would have this luminosity.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.419
So based on how
much dimmer it is,

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.760
we can then figure out
how much further away

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.674
this Cepheid variable star is.

00:08:42.674 --> 00:08:44.090
If that confuses
you a little bit,

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.423
I'll do a little bit more
details in the next few videos

00:08:46.423 --> 00:08:49.172
so we can get a closer sense
of how the math would work.

00:08:49.172 --> 00:08:50.380
But this was a big discovery.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.957
Just discovering this class of
stars, this Cepheid variable

00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:56.040
class-- she wasn't on the
one who discovered them.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.600
People knew before
her that there

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.870
were these stars that
got brighter and dimmer.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.650
But what her big
discovery was is

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.150
seeing this linear relationship
between the relative luminosity

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.020
of these stars and their period.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.450
Because then, if we see
Cepheid variable stars

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.630
in completely different
galaxies or galactic clusters,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.290
by looking at their
period we know

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.700
what their real
relative luminosity is.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.330
And then we can guess how
far those things really are.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.110
We could estimate how far
those things really are.
