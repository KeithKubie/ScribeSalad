00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.350
&gt;&gt; My name is Lynn Neary, and I
cover Books and Publishing for NPR.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.830
This is the second year
that I have been part

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.630
of the National Book Festival,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.730
and it's an event I'm
really learning to enjoy.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.210
Because last year when I came
here, I kept bumping into friends,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.890
and colleagues, and neighbors,
and people who, you know,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.560
kids went to school with my
kid, and it just made me feel

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.890
like I was really part of a great
reading, book-loving community here

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.710
in Washington, D.C., so I
think it's just a great event.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.090
It also gives me a chance to bump
into some of my favorite authors,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.630
one of whom is sitting
right here next to me.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.950
Richard Russo, you all know him.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.750
I found when I --

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.420
[ Applause ]

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.450 position:56%
I found when I told people that I
would be interviewing Richard Russo,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.900
everybody had a favorite book.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.110
Everybody immediately came up
with a favorite book of his,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.440
whether it was "The Risk
Pool," from "The Risk Pool"

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.350
to "The Straight Man," to
"Bridge of Sighs," and, of course,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.830
his latest book, "Everybody's
Fool" is a sequel

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.440
to the hugely popular
"Nobody's Fool."

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.780
Of course that was
made into a movie,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.600
so a lot of people were
introduced to it through the movie,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.200 position:56%
starring Paul Newman, unforgettable,
of course, as Sully, who was --

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.170
is one of the -- is maybe the
most unforgettable character

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.610
that Richard Russo has created.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.140 position:56%
And then, of course, there is my own
personal favorite, and I think a lot

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.650
of people's personal favorite,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.490
the Pulitzer prize winning
novel, "Empire Falls."

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.610
[ Applause ]

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.130
How did I guess that?

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.810
And again, Paul Newman had
a major role in that movie,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.380
so I don't know what
your relationship is --

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.890
was with Paul Newman, but he has
turned some of your characters

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.850
into very unforgettable -- it
was made into an HBO miniseries,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.250
actually, into great TV and
film characters, as well.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.730
I like to think of
you, Richard Russo,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.650
as the bard of the working class.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.640
I think you know what it means
to be a working class guy,

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.190
because you grew up in a town that
prosperity had sort of passed by,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.560
as I understand it, Gloversville?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.860
Am I saying that right?

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.160
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.460
&gt;&gt; I'm assuming I am because --

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.760
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.060
&gt;&gt; They made gloves.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.360
&gt;&gt; They did, indeed.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, and then -- and then no more.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.900
So I wonder what it is about
these small towns in America,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.730
these sort of -- we pass
through them sometimes on trips,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.710
and they're kind of gloomy
and depressing looking,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.180
but you're fascinated by them.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.690
What keeps bringing you
back to that setting?

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.470
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that, yeah, I am
fascinated by these towns, and,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.450
you know, I've given Gloversville
half a dozen different names during

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.230
the decades that I've
been writing about it.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.910
I've called it Mohawk and
North Bath, and Thomaston,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.350
and even Empire Falls,
despite the fact

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.250
that Empire Falls is
technically in Maine, it's --

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.320
you all recognize it, right?

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.440
And I keep going back there, and
I think it has something to do

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.490
with the fact that, I
mean, there are all kinds

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.610
of ways that we learn things.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.610
When we're young, I think
the world is deeply wonderful

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.830
and deeply mysterious,
and the older we get,

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.020
the less mysterious it becomes,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.690
because we see things
happen repeatedly.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.910
And repetition causes us to believe

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.220 position:56%
that the world is not the miraculous
place that it seems like to a child.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.810
As a child growing up in
Gloversville, New York,

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.880
the things that I was
observing, observing as a child,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.930
were things that I didn't
understand and couldn't articulate.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.990
Why did my grandfather
have to work so hard?

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.750
Why, as a result of
the work that he did,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.550
did he get sick and die so young?

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.410
My, I mean, all families
are mysterious, aren't they?

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.130
My folks split up when
I was young, so I was --

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.630
and I was one of those -- I
was the only person I knew,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.090
the only kid I knew that was
from a broken family in that way.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.260
And yet my family was not broken.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.410
My grandparents were
there, my aunts and uncles,

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.350
and my cousins were there.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.530
And so I was, as a kid, you
know, growing up, you know,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.330
from being a small
boy to being a 17,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.760 position:56%
18-year-old when I left Gloversville
to go to the university,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.560
during that time, I
was asking myself

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.580
in a very child-like
way answers to questions

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.860
that don't have answers, really.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.920
And that's part of the mystery
and the wonder of childhood

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.900
as you ask yourself these, without
even articulating them exactly,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.290
you ask yourself these questions
that do not have answers.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.590 position:56%
As I say, later on, you know, you go
to the university, you read books,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.170
you become more sophisticated,
and --

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.470
and there is all that
repetition, as I said.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:34.680
But the effect of that is to make
you feel like you know something.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.660
&gt;&gt; Don't.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.960
&gt;&gt; You don't.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.680
&gt;&gt; The older you get,
the more you know, right?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.980
&gt;&gt; You don't.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.280
You don't.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.860 position:56%
And, and so we have more knowledge
as we grow older, but for me anyway,

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.890 position:56%
it's always going back, always going
back to those initial questions

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.910
about my family, about the
way people worked back there

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.020
in these towns without ever
seeming to prosper very much.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.690
The very sense that
you get in a community

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.280
that nobody really cares
about you, you know?

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.590
You watch television and
there's nobody like you on there.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.790
People are doing the kids of work
that nobody in your community does.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.760
And yet, you realize that these
are the people that you love more

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.560
than anything else in the world.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.710
And so it seems to me like the
most natural thing in the world

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:33.180
to keep going back, to keep
trying to get some answers

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.100
to these questions
that baffle a child.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.760
&gt;&gt; Have you really
gotten some answers?

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.480 position:56%
Have you worked through some answers
for yourself by writing these books?

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.280
Have you come to some conclusions?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.970
&gt;&gt; I have, I have replaced
questions with other questions.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.270
Let's put it that way.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:07:01.090
I always feel like, and this is an
example I use, but often, but --

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:08.570
you look at a writer like
Dickens, and this majestic career

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:15.760
that Dickens had, but he has --

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.680
I don't want to say he has a
narrow bandwidth, because in terms

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.640
of subject matter,
his bandwidth is huge.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.140
But he keeps coming back to
certain themes of poverty,

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.800
of child abandonment, all those
Dickens novels so full of orphans.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.250
You know, you just want to say,
well, come on, what's with the --

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.290
every -- another -- more
-- what's with orphans?

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:44.460
And it comes back to the fact that
Dickens, at some point, was --

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.280
when his father was about to go

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.640
to debtor's prison,
got kind of sold off.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.500
He became an orphan.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.160
He was put in that blacking
factory, where, as a sensitive kid,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.800
he felt abandoned there by the
very people should've loved him.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.050
And so that sense of him
as a vulnerable child,

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.360
as an orphan child, remained with
him throughout his entire career.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:12.020
And you trace his writing about
that throughout all of those books,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.120
and you find, I think you find a
man answering certain questions,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.600
but the answers to those
questions pose other questions,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.910
and they tend to be in the
same bandwidth, the same range

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.170
of concerns that you just never
have -- and you know what?

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.260
The fact that you can't get those
answers, that's the good news.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.560
&gt;&gt; Why is that the good news?

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.020
&gt;&gt; Because that's where
these books come from.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:43.260
I think that that's where
those of you in the audience

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.880
who are not writers, I think
when you read books, I suspect,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.440
and I've talked with
a lot of readers,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.620
I think that you all
suspect that we write books

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.870
to tell you what we know.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.550
And at least, it might
be true for some writers.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.610
I write these books not to
tell you what I don't know.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.100
I write these books to
explore what I don't know.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.630
And so if I ever get to the
point where I have answers

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.620
to my questions, I'm going to be
shit out of luck, as far as --

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.040
and I'd like to think so will you.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.070
[ Laughter ]

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.490
&gt;&gt; You'll be writing
more non-fiction.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:28.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Because, no, I think we write out
of curiosity and I think we write

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.910
out of ignorance, and out of
a lot of other motivations,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.860
but it's not a show-offy thing.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.450
Or at least it shouldn't be.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.750
It's not, yeah.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.330
&gt;&gt; Well, okay, in "Everybody's
Fool,"

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.990
you return to a very specific town.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:47.010
Not only the town based on
the real town you grew up in,

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.710
but to North Bath, which you
created first for "Nobody's Fool."

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.930
And I read "Nobody's Fool" right
before I read "Everybody's Fool."

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.900
I wanted to remind myself of all
the territory and the characters.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I did the
same thing, by the way.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.050
&gt;&gt; Well, we'll talk about that.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.320 position:56%
But -- so the expectation coming out
of "Nobody's Fool," for me anyway,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.290 position:56%
and I think a lot of readers, was it
was going to be about Sully again.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.420
And Sully is a major character.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.400
But at first, I was a little
surprised and disappointed

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.220
when I realized, well, he's talking
an awful lot about Doug Raymer.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.520
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.240
&gt;&gt; And Doug Raymer was this kind
of bumbling young police officer

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.350
in the first book, and
now he's the police chief,

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:31.160
and he was not a particularly
likeable character.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.740
And I thought, at first I
thought, why is he doing that?

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.520
And then I got to like Doug Raymer.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.140
So I wanted to hear that
process for you as a writer.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.910
At some point I thought,
how did he do that?

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.280
How did he get me to like
this character that I kind

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.130
of didn't like in the last book?

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.680
I think we all have that
feeling about books,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.920
where we're initially resentful
if something doesn't go the way

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.010
that we had anticipated
that it was going to go.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.610
And it can happen sometimes four or
five times within the same novel.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.810
You know, you start a novel, you
get caught up with a character,

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:16.650 position:56%
you read the first long chapter,
which is maybe 45 pages or something

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.030
like that, and you're so
caught up with the character,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:24.190
and there's a space break or a
chapter break, and the first word

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.730
in the new chapter is
somebody else's name.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.480
And you realize, oh, wait a second,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.470
we're going to a whole
new character,

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.280
and maybe a whole new place.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.340
And our sense of resentment
when that happens is terrific,

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.450
because what you're feeling is
no, I was happy where I was.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.260
Don't take me somewhere else.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.310
I loved it there.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.350
I loved Sully.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.490
Don't -- you're never
going to make me as happy

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.180
with Doug Raymer as
I was with Sully.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.070 position:56%
And that's a challenge for a
writer, because you know that you --

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.670
&gt;&gt; This has happened to you,
and so you know it's going

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:03.970
to happen with other people, too.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.910 position:56%
And the challenge is, that if you're
going to take me someplace new,

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:13.840
or if you're going to focus me
on somebody else when I want

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.900
to be focused on, well,
boy, you really got

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.880
to deliver the goods then, because
you're already starting in this --

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.170
&gt;&gt; In this place for the
reader of deep resentment.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.050
And from the writer's
standpoint, you have to say, well,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.330
whatever I'm giving these folks

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.770
who are initially disappointed,
it better be good.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.950
It better be as -- the place that
I'm going to take you had better be

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:38.850
as good as the place you left.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.480
And the person that I'm going to
ask you to focus on had better be

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.940
as worthy of that attention.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.310
And Doug Raymer in the earlier
book was just, number one,

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.680
he was just a pawn on the Board.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.150
He was a foil for Sully.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.450
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.750
&gt;&gt; Someone to get angry at.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.050
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.150
&gt;&gt; And who would've suspected that
such a man even had an inner life?

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.450
&gt;&gt; Right? Yeah.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.680
&gt;&gt; That you would want
to spend time with.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.950
So, Lynn, I think what you're
saying is probably what everybody

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.070 position:56%
in the audience who's read this book
has felt was why is he betraying us

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.390
this way?

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.610
He's teasing us with Sully in
the first Sully chapter saying,

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.250
you know, Sully's just
been given a diagnosis.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.550
This is not a spoiler.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.460
It's in the -- early going in
the book if you haven't read it.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.510
Sully, now 70 years old, has been
given a not terribly surprising

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.940
diagnosis, health diagnosis.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.720
And so here's a character
that you love,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.190
and is being immediately
put in jeopardy.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.840
And what does this
dick of an author do?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.500
He's going to give us a minor
character from the first novel

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:49.420
that we don't care a damn thing
about, and ask us to care.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.520
But Doug Raymer, in fact,
did have, and does have --

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.150
&gt;&gt; Does have an inner life.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:57.860
And he's in a horrible position.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:03.410 position:56%
And he's been told his entire life
that he is a fool by people who care

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.090
about him, and also
by people who don't.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:14.730
And he is at a point in his life
where he is either going to have

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.310
to discover that he's not as big
a fool as everybody claims he is,

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.970
and that he thinks he
is, or his life is over.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.680
Everything is at stake for him.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.710
And what I discovered
was the longer I spent --

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.180
and this happens to me a lot --

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:38.350
but the longer I spend inside
somebody's thoughts and fears

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:44.350
and aspirations, the
more I come to care.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.220
And what I have to hope when I'm
foolish enough to do something

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:51.330
like this, to ask you care about
somebody when you have reasons,

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:56.480
good and sufficient reasons not
to, what I have to do is believe

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.600
that I can convince you that this
person is worth spending time with,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.280
and maybe investing some
emotional attachment to.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.110
&gt;&gt; I got really emotionally
attached to Doug Raymer.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.710
&gt;&gt; I'll say.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.310
So did I.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.610
&gt;&gt; What made you want
to go back to Sully?

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.370
What is it you wanted to explore
about Sully again as a character?

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.880
This is, again, for those of
you who haven't read the book,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.630
but maybe thinking about it.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.900
This is just -- I was thinking,
is irascible the right word?

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.300
I'm not sure that's the
right word, but I love using

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.600
that word, so it gives me --

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.200
Yeah.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.500
&gt;&gt; The opportunity to do so.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.800
But, you know, he's
just a, you know,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.420
he's a guy that's just
kind of a laborer, really.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.230
A construction worker, and
does all the dirty jobs,

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.890
and drinks a lot and, you
know, lets people down, and --

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.030
but he's a smart guy
and you get to really

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.020
like him in both of these books.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.320
Why did you want to go back?

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.620
What did you want to
discover about --

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.500
and what's changed
about him, do you think?

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.250
Besides the fact that
he kind of, now,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.310
gets along with Doug
Raymer, actually?

00:15:54.310 --> 00:16:00.410
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, yeah, well, one of
the obvious reasons for going back

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:06.290
and writing this book and
resurrecting Sully is that Sully,

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.330
like one or two other of my rogue
male characters that you can kind

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.320
of trace through Dallas
Younger in the first book,

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.930
and Sam Hall in the second,
and then Sully in the third,

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.410
all the way through Max Roby,
you know, in Miles' father

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.700
in "Empire Falls," and now
revisiting Sully again.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:30.060
One of the principle advantages,
one of the principle reasons

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:37.410
to do something like that is that
all of those characters were based,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:42.590
to a large extent, on my own
father, who, in real life,

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:46.140 position:56%
I just never got enough of in a way.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.790
He and my mom split up when I
was young, and so I spent most

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.710
of my youth kind of in longing
for a man who wasn't around.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:59.350
And he became more interested
in me around the age of 18,

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.600
because back then in New
York, you could drink at 18.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.900
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.200
I grew up in New York, too.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I became interested -- I
became more interesting to my father

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.960
when I was old enough to drink.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.070
And so during my college
years when I came back

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:20.440
and was working road construction
with him, I really got to know him

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.570
and got to know what made him tick.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.530
And we became good friends.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:34.080
In a way, it wasn't, I mean
there was a father-son aspect

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.380
to our relationship,
but it was a little --

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.680
it was more complex than that,

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.510
because we hadn't been
father and son for so long.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.970
And because I -- and it wasn't that
long after that that he became ill.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:56.240
And so I just kind of never
got my fill of the man.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:03.760
And so returning to North Bath
and resurrecting Sully was

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.670
at one level kind of Psych 101
level, was just a way for me

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.260
to spend more time with my father.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.660
The other interesting
thing, though, about this,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:19.150
was that because the wonderful
Robert Benton movie was made,

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:29.090
of that novel, I was not only able
to resurrect Sully, my character,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:32.500
and my father, the real person
whom this book was based on.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.070
&gt;&gt; I also got to resurrect
Paul Newman, who --

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.740
Paul, I worked with Paul
on three different movies.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:43.420 position:56%
He was -- I wouldn't say we had like
an intimate friendship or anything

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.950
like that, but we both --

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.830
We saw the world in the same way.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:57.700
And he was -- he really
liked writers a lot.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:04.000
And I discovered in
resurrecting Sully that because

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.450
of his incredible portrayal
of my character,

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:12.640
I no longer had sole
proprietorship over Sully anymore.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.240
Because, you know, in
every scene that I wrote --

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.670
when I was writing "Nobody's Fool,"

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.550
in every scene I was
seeing my father.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.930
Now I'm seeing -- it
goes back and forth

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.440
between seeing my father
and seeing Paul Newman.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.570
Who, by the way, looked
nothing like my father.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.720 position:56%
You can imagine my mother's surprise

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.700
when Paul Newman was
cast to play her husband.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.650
I mean, it's just --
the mind boggles.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.230
So there was this -- and, you
know, the entire book was about --

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.930
the whole book takes
place over Memorial Day,

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.240
and it's a book about memory.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.810
&gt;&gt; And so until I began writing it,
I didn't realize what the upside

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.110
to this book was going to be.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:11.680
And that it was going to plumb
depths in me and needs in me

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.770
that I just didn't suspect until
I actually began writing it.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.070
&gt;&gt; So this raises another question.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.240
I was wondering about this,
exactly what you just brought up,

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.880
because I had a hard time getting
Paul Newman out of my head.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.690
And I don't know that that's

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.960
who I would've imagined had he
not been there to begin with.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.710
&gt;&gt; Because I think I
saw the movie first.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:34.120
But Philip Seymour
Hoffman played Doug Raybey.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.740
&gt;&gt; Doug Raymer, yeah.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.040
&gt;&gt; Doug Raymer, I'm sorry.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.000
&gt;&gt; And so is he now in your head?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.300
&gt;&gt; Oh, God, yes.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.420
&gt;&gt; And as you were writing the
book, were you actually seeing him?

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.720
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.020
&gt;&gt; Because he was in
the original movie.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.320
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.360
&gt;&gt; So what does that do to
you as a writer when you -- ?

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.060
&gt;&gt; Well, it was interesting, Lynn,
because we got the terrible news

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:58.980 position:56%
about Philip's death, I was probably
250, 300 pages into the book.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.280
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.680
&gt;&gt; And, of course, that's who I'd
been thinking about, and while,

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:10.470
as a writer, as a novelist, I
know better than to cast a novel

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:16.460
when I'm writing it, because even
if the actor that I'm thinking

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:21.670
about wanted to play the role, the
odds against it are still enormous,

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.840
because actors of that
caliber, you know, they do two

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.920
or three movies a year
sometimes, and the chances

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.030
that Philip Seymour
Hoffman would be available

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:37.980
and would have the interest
in playing Raymer in a movie,

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.660
those are pretty long odds.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.850
But he was not only -- he not only
played Raymer, but then he went

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:52.050
on after that, of course to play
a major role in "Empire Falls."

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:58.060
It was just impossible
not to see him.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.990
And it was also impossible not
to, you know, keep it in the back

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.930
of your mind as far as
you can, but what if?

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.340
What if he were able
to play this role?

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.680
&gt;&gt; Because seeing him
the way I was seeing him,

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.130
I was also imagining something of
not only my character's inner life,

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.350
but just how wonderful Philip
Seymour Hoffman always was

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:24.860
in his career, in playing
people who had kind

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:28.360
of almost paralytic self-doubt.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.920
I mean, think of the
great roles that he had.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.570
And so many of them were about
people who were in a state

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:42.290
of almost paralysis as a result
of insecurity, fear, self-doubt.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.780
And so I was -- I mean,
there he was.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.700
And then we got the news of
his death, and I thought,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.000
all right, now what do you do?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.420
It wasn't that -- it wasn't the
obvious that, you know, I mean,

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.430
now there's no chance, obviously,
the man is dead, he's not going

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.040
to play Raymer in the movie.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.600
It didn't have anything to
do with anything like that.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.200
It was, I thought, now what do
I do with what's in my head?

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:16.440
What do I do with the fact
that I'm seeing this man?

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.940
What should I do?

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.510
Should I start now thinking
in terms of somebody else?

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.300
And for a while I tried to,
and it was just impossible.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.460
And so I thought, you know what?

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.880
Let him be the muse.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:37.140
&gt;&gt; Because with these characters,
when I think back on all

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:42.150
of my fictional characters, not one
single actor has ever been chosen

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.880
that I would've chosen had
I been in charge of casting.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:51.090
Ed Harris in "Empire Falls."

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.980
What a wonderful job that he did.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:01.770
But I had described, what I had
described, the man I had described

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:05.610
in "Empire Falls," my
novel of "Empire Falls,"

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:11.820
a man who had been literally eating
his mistakes for most of his life.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.080
Whenever he makes a
mistake at the grill,

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.780
there's nothing left
to do but eat it.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.990
You know? And the man that
I had described, you know,

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.810 position:56%
if you had been casting on my
physical descriptions would've been,

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.280
I don't know, James
Gandolfini, somebody like that.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.620
A big guy.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.610
Throughout the book he's
referred to as Big Boy.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:38.020
&gt;&gt; But the first -- and
then they cast Ed Harris.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.550
Trim, little, buff Ed Harris.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.530
And I thought what in the
world are they thinking?

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.020
Are they going to make
him wear a fat suit?

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.890
I just couldn't get it.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.940
I couldn't see it.

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:55.240
And then we went on the set.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.320
My daughters and my wife and I
went on the set and we saw a daily,

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:06.440
and one of the dailies was a
shot -- was a scene with him --

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.860
it took place in the diner,
and it was a scene with him

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.980
and his beautiful daughter.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:19.220
And the way he looked at her,
I thought, there's Miles.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.520
There's Miles.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:26.470
And so when you write to a
particular kind of actor,

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:31.180
what you're seeing is something
physical, but what they're going

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.960 position:56%
to bring to the role, if it's a
great actor, is not physical at all.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.800
And so, at some point, that
wisdom dawned on me, I guess,

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.410
that it was just perfectly fine

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:44.480
to see Philip Seymour
Hoffman in my mind.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.140
Because some great actor is
going to come and find something

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.040
in that character, and if
he doesn't look like the guy

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.980
in my head, it doesn't matter.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.280
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.580
I've got one more question
for you before we open it

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.420
up for questions from the audience.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.650
Because this is something
I had talked

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:03.950
about with you one other time.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.510
I met you this May, in May.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.030
I was thinking, as I was
reading your books recently

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.510
that they span several decades,
and yet over those several decades,

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:16.840
in each of these towns, they've
already gone through a period

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.190 position:56%
where the industry has left, they're
bereft, people are leaving the town

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.750
because there's no jobs there.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.050
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.350
&gt;&gt; People are scrounging
for a living.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.800
And yet here we are in
this election cycle, 2016,

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.980
and the issue of jobs
leaving the country,

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.170
going elsewhere, is still an issue.

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.550
It's not a new issue.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.800
And I was struck by the fact
that this issue has actually been

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.680
around for not years, decades.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.440
And I know you have some
thoughts about your own characters

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.940
who are working class white guys,
and what they may or may not do,

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.310
might or might not do in this
election year, and I'm curious

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.910
if you could just address that.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:00.450
&gt;&gt; Well, here's an opportunity
to alienate half the audience.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:06.040
&gt;&gt; Sorry. It is Washington,
D.C., after all.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:15.260
&gt;&gt; Well, no, I do feel like my
novels, what I've been writing

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:21.130
about in my novels since, you
know, for a very long time now,

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:25.550
since the early 1980s, I've
been writing the same thing,

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.360
but because Gloversville, the town
that I grew up in, which lost all

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.350
of those manufacturing
jobs back in the 60s.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.870
I mean, it was all over by
the end of World War II.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.600
In a way, Gloversville, New
York, I've come to think of it

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.160
as the canary in the coal mine.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:50.010
It was happening there then, but
since that time, it has just --

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:56.490
the story of Gloversville, New York
has just expanded exponentially.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:02.420
And I think that now everybody,
suddenly everybody is talking

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.500
about what I've been talking
about, and it seemed to me

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.970
that throughout all of these
years, I kind of had this subject,

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.190
not to myself, but --
let's put it this way.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.630
The field was not overly crowded.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:18.930
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.150
&gt;&gt; And now suddenly, as you
say, with this election cycle,

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.300
suddenly everybody is
talking about work.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.300
Suddenly everybody is talking
about the fact that in America,

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.950
we don't seem to make
things anymore,

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.450
that all of these jobs
have been outsourced.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.180
Manufacturing jobs, in
particular, have been outsourced.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.550
And that all of this
that's now coming home to us

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:51.020
as a nation is suddenly front and
center in a political campaign,

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:55.310
and the rage that we're
feeling as a result

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.130
of this is pretty astonishing.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:03.980
And in Upstate New York and
in a lot of the Rust Belt,

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.940
it was interesting, because
I think we tend to see that,

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:09.380
and certainly Donald
Trump did very well

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.980
in the Rust Belt and
Upstate New York.

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.190
There was, as it's always
been, there's New York City,

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.940
and then there's everywhere else.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.950
And Donald Trump did very
well throughout that swatch

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:24.580
of the Mohawk Valley all the way
through Buffalo, and you know,

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.980
straight on through into
Ohio and all of that.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:32.480
What's not been reported
quite so widely is

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.860
that Bernie Sanders did
very well there, too.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:43.280
And the anger, I think,
in both the Trump camp,

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.490
as a result of these loss
of manufacturing jobs,

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:54.270
many of them had been
traditionally white male jobs.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:30:00.640
The anger in both the Trump camp
and the Bernie Sanders camp,

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:05.110
it's both there, it's just
a question of who you blame.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.890
The Trump folks blame
one group of people,

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:14.180
and the Sanders folks blame
another group of people.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.220
And I was asked once, you know,
who would my characters --

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.030
now, I'm talking sociologically,

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:24.310
but who would my characters
have voted for?

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.950
And, you know, we won't go through
all of them, but I will say this.

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:34.390
Miss Beryl in "Nobody's
Fool," and "Everybody's Fool,"

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:39.310
she wouldn't have been fooled
by Donald Trump for a second.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.110
&gt;&gt; I think she would've been
for Hillary [inaudible].

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:52.000
&gt;&gt; And I think Sully would
have understood the anger,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.310
but he was based on my father.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:08.560
My father was a D-Day guy, and he
had done his service all the way

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:16.360
from Utah Beach to Germany,
and he knew what service was,

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.850
and I don't think he
would've been fooled either.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.340
&gt;&gt; Okay. I think people
want to ask questions,

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.970
so if you do, there's
mics right here.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.920
&gt;&gt; If it works.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.090
&gt;&gt; Maybe. So that's better.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:37.760
Years ago I went to see a movie,
and it had people I liked in it.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.060
It was, what was it?

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.360
Ice?

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.660
&gt;&gt; "The Ice Harvest."

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:42.960
&gt;&gt; "Ice Storm."

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.260
&gt;&gt; "The Ice Harvest."

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.560
&gt;&gt; And it had --

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.860
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.160
&gt;&gt; And it had Billy
Bob Thornton in it.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.460
I liked that.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.760
And then it had you as the
writer, and I said, wow!

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.060
This is really going to be good!

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.360
But it's not particularly
your style.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.660
It's more of a film
noir kind of thing.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.260
&gt;&gt; How did you write
differently for that?

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.560
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.890
Yeah, the question is about a
film called "The Ice Harvest,"

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.390
which, I'm so glad you saw it.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.510
I was wondering who the other
person who saw that movie was.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:08.440
[ Laughter ]

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.930
I loved it.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.940
And it had a terrible black
humor to it, based on a novel

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.070
by Scott Phillips, which I loved,
and so when the assignment came

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.600
to me, I was thrilled to get it.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.780
I think what attracted me

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:27.480
to that movie was the darkness
of it, the humor of it.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.890
And when I signed on to write it,
one of the principle tasks for me,

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:34.720
because the book was so dark,

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.290
much darker than anything I had
ever written, was to infuse it,

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:46.630 position:56%
because movies are not books, and so
you will, you know, you will find,

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.930
if you were to look at the
movie and then read the novel

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.920
and compare the dialogue, you
would find some lines in there

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.880
that were not in the book.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.670
And it would be interesting
for you to compare them

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:04.210
and see what you see -- what
is Scott Phillips in the movie

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.120
and what is Richard Russo?

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:12.310
It's probably more effort than
anyone would want to expend.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.610
But thank you for that question.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.920
I really loved that movie,

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:22.580
and I thought John Cusack was
particularly wonderful in it.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, go ahead.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.580
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:27.880
&gt;&gt; And they're very funny.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.310
Lower? Is this better?

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:34.030
I just -- we're doing this
book in our book club.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:35.330
&gt;&gt; Which one?

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:36.630
&gt;&gt; "Everybody's Fool."

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.930
&gt;&gt; Everybody's?

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.230
Okay.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.530
&gt;&gt; And, but just last month,
we read a book where one

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.430
of the issues was reinventing
oneself.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:47.920 position:56%
When I think about these in your
books, nobody seems to be interested

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.300
in reinventing themselves, really.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.520
In fact, they don't
even seem interested

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.960
in evolving as they get older.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:01.060
So, and it sort of goes with the
question, the political question.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.130
I mean, the Rust Belt, there
may have been opportunities

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:10.370 position:56%
to change your life, but most people
stayed in there the way they are.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.620
And I'm wondering what
thoughts about that,

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.920 position:56%
if you have any thoughts about that.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.360
Do you intend to -- I mean, you
clearly like your characters,

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.720
and we like them when we read them.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.230
But on the other hand, they're
sort of stuck in some ways.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.510
And I wonder if you could
make a comment about that.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.070
&gt;&gt; Well, I tell people,
and I think it's true

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:32.560
that I am the poster boy
for the American Dream.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:39.170
I am a product of public
schools, public institutions.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:44.970
Because of the fact that there
were so few opportunities

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.450
in Upstate New York and the
town where I grew up in general,

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:52.130
almost everybody in my
graduating class, both the public

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.380
and Catholic high school.

00:34:54.380 --> 00:35:02.920
Wherever I go, I see people from my
home town, because they simply --

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.310
the vast majority of them couldn't
-- they had to reinvent themselves.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:12.390
And I spent a long time -- I went
all the way to the University

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:14.940
of Arizona, which will give
you an idea of how far I wanted

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.200
to get away from Upstate New York.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:22.170
And I was there doing various
degrees for about 10 years.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:26.980
And I considered it my
mission, in large part,

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.290
because it was my mother's mission.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.580
She tried most of her adult
life to get out of Gloversville

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.700
and always ended up right
back where she started.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.280
It was her mission for me
to do what she couldn't do,

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.210
which was to escape this place.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.510
Haha. And --

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.240
And part of that, in
order to do that,

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.030
it's not just getting
away geographically,

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.330
it's reinventing yourself.

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.010
It's becoming a different person.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:01.090
And with every degree that I
got, I got a BA, an MA, a PhD,

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:07.470
and then after a PhD, I actually
went back and got a MFA in writing,

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.790
in fiction writing, and the
idea was that with every one

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:17.140
of those degrees, I would distance
myself even further by reinvention,

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:24.190
by becoming a person that no
one would recognize back home.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.970
I would reinvent myself
and distance myself.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:35.260
Only to discover, of course,
my one true subject, right?

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.890
So you reinvent yourself,
and for most of --

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:40.700
for so many of the
people that I write about,

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:45.010
reinvention is they
had all they could do

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:47.630 position:56%
to invent themselves the first time.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:52.460
They haven't had the
opportunity for reinvention.

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.600
Sully, in this book,
in the earlier book,

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.860
discovers that when he falls off
that ladder and shatters his knee,

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.690
has the opportunity to go
back to Community College

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:05.260
and learn something like
refrigeration repair,

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.500
and finds himself at age 60 in a
classroom full of 18-year-olds.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.330
And he manages about two
classes before he quits.

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.720
Reinvention for Sully?

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.390
At age 60?

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.930
Having done the same
thing all of his life?

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:27.740
And that's politically part
of the dilemma with all

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:32.260
of those manufacturing jobs
that have left the country,

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:35.800
you say that -- educated
people say, well, I mean,

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.210
look at the writing on the wall.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.970
Those jobs are not coming back.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.130
Learn to do something else.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:45.230
What do you mean learn
to do something else?

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:50.700
At that age when you've done
that work all of your life?

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.830
And not only have you done it,
you found meaning in doing it.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.640
That's the thing that I find
astonishing about Sully.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.040
Is not that he's done
the kind of shit jobs

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.820
that nobody else wants to do.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:07.130
This is a guy who takes pride
in doing those exact jobs.

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.890
And for somebody to tell him, all
right, well, somebody to come in

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.960
and say, well, you
should do something else.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.260
Really?

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.560
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.860
We're going to go to
another question.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:24.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. So I read faster than you
write, and so when I'm done with one

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:27.980
of your books, I want another
one as soon as possible.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.510
How long do I have to wait, and
what are we thinking about writing?

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.080
[ Laughter ]

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.510
&gt;&gt; You need to read slower.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:40.180
[ Laughter ]

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:44.970
Well, the good news, I suppose --

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:48.090
thank you, first of all,
for the high compliment.

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:50.590
I have a book of short
fiction coming out next year.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.330
I've delivered it to
my editor earlier.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.040
It will come out in May.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.420
I am finishing up a book of
essays about life and art

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.520
that I will be delivering in
about three or four weeks,

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:14.980
and I have in the back of my brain
a little bent gene or something

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:21.840 position:56%
that feels like it could be a novel,
but I'm a couple of months away

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.820
from being able to begin it.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:27.820
And at any rate, you know, it takes
me a while to write these things.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:32.050
So you've got a couple of books
that are coming that will allow you

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.330
to pedal, kind of,
in a stationary --

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:38.440
two books that amount to
kind of a stationary bicycle,

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.720
and I've got sort of an idea.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.050
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right, we'll
take this question here.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.350
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.650
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.080
&gt;&gt; "Straight Man" is one of
my all-time favorite books.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.380
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:54.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And it's just beautifully written
and hilarious, and reading it is

00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:00.330
such an interesting experience,
because the main character is --

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.600
He does things as if
for his own humor,

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:07.990
and it's kind of like the reader
and him have a special relationship

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.890
that no one else in
the story seems to get.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.530 position:56%
So I'm just -- could you just
comment on the experience of writing

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.870
that book, and where it came from?

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.340
&gt;&gt; Sure. "Straight
Man," of all my novels,

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:27.480
was much the easiest
book of mine to write.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.270
I had been hitched to the
academic sled for many years,

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:39.250
in a variety of institutions,
and when I started writing

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.840
"Straight Man," it was as
if the flood gates opened.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:49.320
All of my store of
academic insanity stories --

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:55.560 position:56%
it was just suddenly all right
there, and it just came gushing out.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.220
And part of it was
William Henry Devereaux,

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:11.210
who was based on a
real colleague of mine,

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:18.130
and he was by nature,
I think, an anarchist.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:21.690
He just loved to stir the pot.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.470
And he lived life exactly that way,

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.710
doing things for his own
amusement and entertainment.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:35.980
And the academic shrapnel
from that was amazing

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.960
to behold and wonderful to behold.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:46.530
And so when I sat down to write
that book, I just remembered him

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.920
and the way he went about things,
the gleeful way he would turn

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:55.660
on his friends and support his
enemies, as Hank does in that book.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:57.520
That material was all prepped.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:02.100
I didn't really have to --
I mean, of all of my novels,

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.180
that's the one that's the --
there's the most verisimilitude.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.850
In some ways, it's the most
outrageous, but I didn't have

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:11.260
to invent anything in that book.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.910
It was just all there.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.350
Pure reportage.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.650
Reportage in that book.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:17.950
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.780
Let's see if we can get one
more question real quickly.

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you, and good afternoon.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.380
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.860
&gt;&gt; You spend a lot of time
talking about movies, and --

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.160
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, talking about?

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.020
&gt;&gt; You spend a lot of
time talking about movies.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:35.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And I was curious, when you write
novels, do you aspire or even expect

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:37.820
that they're going to
be made into movies?

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.580
And if so, how does that affect
the way that you write them?

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.880
Thank you.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:48.020
&gt;&gt; You know, when I was a
younger writer, I probably thought

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:52.650
that one day, maybe a movie
would be made of mine.

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:57.610
It didn't affect the way
I thought of my novels,

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.350
and I certainly didn't want to
make the novel more movie-like

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.020
in order to attract interest.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.060
So I've always kept one in one --

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.290
one compartment and the
other in another compartment.

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:13.810
Lately, I think, if
you're a story-driven,

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:18.760
character-driven literary writer,
you'd be a damn fool to think

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.040
that a book of yours is likely
to be made into a movie,

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:27.810
because the movies have given
themselves over to big budget,

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:31.510
you know, action-driven stuff.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:38.170
The real writing these days
is being done on television.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:42.460
So I mean, obviously there
are exceptions to that.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:48.990
There are some character-driven
movies being made in the kind of,

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:52.850
you know, two to six to
eight million dollar range,

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:57.480 position:56%
but "Nobody's Fool," all those years
ago, two decades ago, was made,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.850
the budget for that movie
was like 21, $22 million.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:06.890
You couldn't get anybody today

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:12.100
to spend $22 million making
a movie like "Nobody's Fool."

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.160
That kind of money just
isn't spent anymore.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.030
And so I don't even think about it.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.610
And I don't even think
about it as a possibility.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.310
Every now -- and whenever
anybody comes to my agent thinking

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:32.680
about a book of mine now, it's as
a limited television mini-series.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:37.590
&gt;&gt; On that note, I think we have to
say farewell, and thanks so much.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.890
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.700
&gt;&gt; To Richard Russo.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.290
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:46.950
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
