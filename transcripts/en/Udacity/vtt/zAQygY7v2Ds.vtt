We have just seen the power, of the Chrome developer tools and how we

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.850
can inspect our page, to learn what visual elements correspond to HTML elements.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.230
What technology, do you think makes it possible for

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.330
us to either inspect elements, through the developer tools by hovering over

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.380
HTML, and seeing which visual element it corresponds to on the page.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.650
Or vice versa, to right click on a visual element on our webpage, and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.200
find out the HTML tags that compose it.
