00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.200
Here we go! In 3, 2...
[crack]

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.200
Is anyone shooting any--
[explosion]

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.300
Hey guys, welcome back!
It's a beautiful day.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.700
And today, we are playing
with something you should

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.480
absolutely not try at home.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.720
I hate to be the one to say that,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.900
but it's absolutely true.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.800
Now in our last video,
we tried using dry ice

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.300
to see if we could make
improvised carbonated drinks at home,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.300
and it worked.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.540
And I also suggested,
it may not be the best idea

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.300
to put dry ice in a sealed container.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.600
I'm about to show you why...

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.600
Now today's experiment was inspired 
by a comment from Dotz0cat,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.600
who asked if we could try melting dry ice
in a sealed Coke bottle.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.180
I think the question here is to see

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.600
if we can get the dry ice to melt
and hold it in liquid form.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.500
And if that really works,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.800
can we heat it up
to a supercritical temperature?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.400
Now I'm sorry, Dotz0cat,
the answer is absolutely not.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.600
But I am still going to go ahead
and do the experiment anyway,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.700
just so you can see
what happens if you try.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000
Now I'm going to keep
this experiment fairly simple for you.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.900
I'm going to use
an empty 500ml Coke bottle

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.300
and a handful of dry ice.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.200
I've crushed this dry ice down
into a powder so it has more surface area.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.120
The idea being,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.900
it'll sublimate a little bit quicker.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.660
So all we really have to do is find a way
to get our dry ice inside our bottle,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.240
cap it off and get very, very far away.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.200
Alright guys,
I just smashed up the dry ice.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.800
I used funnels, I used my hands.
I used every method possible

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.300
to try and get the dry ice
into these bottles, and here we are!

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000
I filled one bottle up nearly to the top
with dry ice snow.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.700
And I filled another bottle up only
about a third of the way full,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.000
so we can cap them off
and just observe if there's any difference

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.800
as the dry ice starts
to warm up and sublimate.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.300
Here we are guys, moment of truth.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.260
I've got rolls of duct tape here
on the bottoms

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.600
because as these bottles fill up,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.400
they probably are going
to pressurize and swell.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.600
And I want them
to be held relatively in place.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.540
So let's go ahead
and put the caps on the top now,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.800
seal up nice and tight,
and then get very, very far away.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.200
Which bottle is going to explode first?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.800
The one with more dry ice
or the one with less?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.100
Put your predictions down
in the comments below.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.600
It's hard to tell if the one
on the left is actually swelling up

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.800
or if it's just pulling moisture out
of the atmosphere

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.500
and growing in size from the frost.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.400
This could be a really long process.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.620
I can see that bottle expanding.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.000
It's almost there.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.800
Can't believe that's held on so long.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.300
But that's gonna go any second,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.800
so I'm getting excited.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.220
I'm tired of being so nervous, 
ex-explode already!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400
[bottle explodes]

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.700
Whoa! Oh my goodness,
oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
That was amazing.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.620
Boom.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.180
That was very, very loud.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.520
Dude, that was a big explosion!

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.000
That was massive.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500
Who knows how long that's gonna take.
[chuckle]

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.200
The hardest thing about this is, you know,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.000
you never know exactly
when it's gonna go off.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.400
Okay, I'm stickin' my neck out here
for you guys. [chuckling]

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.900
Let me see if we can get you
a little bit closer there.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.600
You can actually see the liquid CO2
in the bottle,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.100
and small chunks
of dry ice floating at the top.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.500
There's a small leak in that bottle
which is why it hasn't exploded yet so,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.200
but if you look at the neck there...

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.660
you should be able to see all the cracks,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.880
like that thing is very unstable
and it's ready to go.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.200
Makes me really nervous... being here.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.760
Oh you can see the carbon dioxide
still bubbling in there.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.700
It's turning into a gas.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.700
I do not want that to go off right now.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.700
That would hurt... tremendously.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.200
There we go.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.800
Yeah!

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.000
Quick update, guys.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.700
The bottle has grown about as big
as it can get without exploding,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.100
but there's a slight leak in it,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.300
which means the gas is hissing out
faster than bottle can explode.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.600
This a very dangerous situation,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.760
because it could theoretically
sit here indefinitely

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.840
until something pokes it or pushes it
and causes the reaction.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.900
So to help catalyze the reaction
and bring it to little safer condition,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.200
I went and got a BB gun.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.600
Here we go! On 3, 2...
[BB gun fires]

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.600
A little high, okay. Resettin'.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.200
Here we go! In 3, 2...

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.200
[crack]

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.540
Is anyone shooting any--
[explosion]

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.700
Trigger, trigger!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.660
That was not me.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.940
I did not do that.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.500
Whoa.
[laughs]

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.200
Whoo, doggy!

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.220
So that was crazy guys.
I went to shoot it with a BB gun

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.400
and it actually blew up by itself
like seconds before I pulled the trigger.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.100
So, even though it had a hiss,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.520
it was actually pressurized enough
to self explode

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.300
and now there are pieces everywhere.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.400
And that was loud,
like that's earplug worthy.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.300
You can hear bubbling
and cracking over here,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.200
I mean look at this.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300
Look at this piece of plastic, guys.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.860
It has almost like melted
and warped, somehow.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.800
You can hear it cracking. It's almost
like it's got some kind of permanent burn

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.800
from the CO2? I don't know.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.420
It's turned to like a styrofoam texture
and it's got different layers.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.200
That's really interesting.
I haven't seen this before.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.300
The rest of this plastic is clear,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.800
but this almost looks like a foam,
a styrofoam of something of that nature...

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.600
that I can peel off.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.520
Look at that. What the heck?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.200
What on earth?

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.400
How do we turn plastic bottles
into styrofoam?

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.780
I don't get it, but that's what happened.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.400
That's crazy.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.540
Very, very exciting.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.800
Very, very exciting,
and hopefully a lesson learned

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.100
about why you don't put dry ice
in soda bottles.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200
Let's talk about that.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.800
So we started this experiment today
to see what would happen

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.720
if we put dry ice inside of a soda bottle,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.340
and screwed the lid on tight.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.200
Would the carbon dioxide melt down
into liquid CO2 and if so,

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.700
could we heat it on an oven
to make it go supercritical?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.400
The answer is, "kind of."

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.680
Yes, the dry ice did melt down
into liquid CO2 but the problem is,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.660
These bottles are only pressure rated
for around 150 to 200psi.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.420
Whereas once dry melts,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.600
the pressures can increase
to well over 1000psi.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.020
So obviously, it's just a matter of time

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.900
until your container is going to explode.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.920
Now in this case,
the results were surprising.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.200
We filled up one bottle almost full
with dry ice,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.900
and the other
about a third of the way full.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.600
What we found was the bottle,
filled a third of the way with dry ice,

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.700
exploded first.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.300
The reason, I think, that happened,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.860
is because as long as you have dry ice
in a solid state,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.220
it's going to keep the liquid cool.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.400
But once all the liquid
has completely melted,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.000
it can all rise in temperature
and increase the pressure dramatically.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.500
So the bottle we filled up
nearly to the top with dry ice,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.060
took over 45 minutes longer to explode.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.000
And that's kind of unpredictable
when they're gonna go off

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.000
because it all depends
on temperature, humidity,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.000
and whether or not
the bottle springs a leak.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.000
So to answer your question.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.660
Can you put dry ice in a bottle
and have it turn to liquid CO2?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.560
The answer is, yes.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.780
But should you? Absolutely not!

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.760
By putting dry ice in a sealed container,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.860
you're essentially making a bomb,
a dry ice bomb as it were.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.900
And in most states
and counties these days,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.700
dry ice bombs are illegal
for obvious reasons.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.700
But what really surprised me
about this experiment

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.940
is how long it took
for the reaction to take place.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.380
How long it took for the bottles
to actually explode.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.600
The first bottle took
almost an hour and a half,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.100
the second bottle,
almost two and a half hours.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.380
Based on all my experiences
working with dry ice,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.800
my honest suggestion to you
is please don't try this at home.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.400
You really never know
who you could end up getting hurt.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.700
But I'm really glad that you could join me
for this experiment today,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.300
so you could observe the power
of the reaction for yourself.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.800
And of course, a big thanks to our friend,
Dotz0cat, for suggesting this experiment.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.300
You can go ahead
and check your YouTube inbox,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.800
I'm sending you 25 bucks.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.540
Thanks for joining me
for this experiment guys,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.400
and I'll be looking for you
in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.500
[crack]

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.500
Oh...

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.200
Just broke my funnel.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.000
That's what happens when it cools down
and you smash it too hard.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.400
Sorry honey!
