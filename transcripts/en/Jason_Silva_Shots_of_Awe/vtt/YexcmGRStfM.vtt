JASON SILVA: I hit
a milestone here

00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:05.410
on Shots of Awe,
200,000 subscribers.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.420
So I really just want
to take the time to say

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.020
thank you for supporting
these epiphany

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.230
bombs, these
mind-aware broadcasts.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.260
I'm just trying to share
my inspiration and my awe

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.272
and my wonderment and my
curiosity with the world,

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:22.730
you know, so that
we can experience

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.010
some kind of
intersubjective ecstasy

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.490
and feel like we are connected
because we are witnessing

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.180
the world through the
same lens for a moment.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.340
So that's Shots of Awe.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.490
Thank you for supporting.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.710
And thank you, all 200,000
of you supporting the love.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.210
And please continue to do so.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.170
Thank you.
