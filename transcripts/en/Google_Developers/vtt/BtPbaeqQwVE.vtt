CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
Hi everyone.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.210
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.400
My name is Claudio and I am one
of the engineers in the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.280
Google Drive Developer
Relations Team.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.410
Today with me I have two special
guests, Austin and

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.330
Sebastian from Cooliris.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.270
Austin is the co-founder
and CTO of Cooliris.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.390
And Sebastian works on Business

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.780
Development, is that right?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.260
SEBASTIAN MUEHL: Exactly.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.190
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Today they're
going to show us their

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.630
app, Cooliris, which is, I would
say, visually stunning.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.520
It's an amazing way to browse
your photos and do a lot of

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.500
other things.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.620
And I am pretty sure they can
explain it and show it much

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.150
better than I could do.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.190
Austin, do you want to
show us what Cooliris

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.720
does and what it is?

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.650
AUSTIN SHOEMAKER: I'd love to.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.850
So Cooliris is an app for mobile
devices and the web,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.880
which allows you to organize and
view all your media in a

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.019
unified experience, which allows
you to first access the

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.000
media on your device.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.550
So here I'm accessing all
of the photos that are

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.740
stored on my tablet.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.850
All visible in this user
interface we've created that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.940
we call the Wall.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.330
So the Wall actually allows me
to see everything and zoom

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.860
into it and see the high
resolution content without the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.490
need to leave the grid of
photos that I'm in.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.930
So that makes it much easier for
me to just come and zoom

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.250
in and see one photo without
having to keep pressing the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.830
back button in the top left.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.060
So I can browse content
from my camera roll.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.980
And I can also link all of the
web services that I'm using.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.630
So for example, we support
your device, Facebook,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.170
Instagram, Twitter, Picasa,
Google+, Google Drive, Flickr.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.360
And we just introduced
support for Renren

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.420
in China and SmugMug.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.250
You can also search Google
Images to find images.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.260
And one of the big features that
you can take advantage of

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.930
in Cooliris is sharing any media
that you can browse with

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.039
private groups.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.690
So that enables you to start a
conversation around anything

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.590
that you see.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.500
And more than that, integrating
Google Drive has

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.980
enabled us to let you save
content from anywhere into

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.540
your Drive, which provides a
really great bridge between

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.820
your mobile device and
your computer.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.850
So let me jump into Google Drive
and show you what that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.390
looks like.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.720
So all I do is tap on that
stack of photos.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.170
And I'm already looking at all
of the media in my Drive.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.890
So when we looked at, how do
we want to integrate Drive,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.450
we're a very media-centric
experience, and so what we've

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.270
done is use the Google Drive
API to show you your photos

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.380
that are stored in Drive in
reverse chronological order.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.810
So these are the latest
photos that have

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.170
been added to my Drive.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.660
And as I scroll, we actually
allow you to scroll through

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.250
all of the media that's
stored in Drive.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.760
And if I select a photo, it
actually will load the high

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.770
resolution version
of this photo.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.250
But that's where it starts to
become really cool that we're

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.480
able to take advantage
of the Drive API.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.580
So these images might be very
large JPEGs, or even more

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.190
large files like RAW.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.470
Since Google Drive indexes
thumbnails, we're actually

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.130
able to request not only a small
thumbnail of the photo,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.610
which allows us to go through
the grid very quickly, but we

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.030
can also load the exact high
resolution representation

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.170
that's needed to display
it on your device.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.680
So instead of loading a three or
four megabyte JPEG, we can

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.850
actually load exactly 300
kilobytes, which is enough to

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.180
show it on your--

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.610
And one of the really cool
things that we're able to do

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.120
is keep this up-to-date.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.820
So the APIs that we're using to
populate the user interface

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.170
are the Drive files API, which
we use to pull in the files

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.860
sorted by a date modified.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.600
And once we've loaded the
initial pages of files from

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.430
the files.get API, we then,
instead of refreshing that,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.400
will pull the changes feed,
which gives us an ordered set

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.880
of changes to files that
are in your Drive.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.680
And by using files.get to
paginate out as you scroll

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.810
backward, and also using changes
list in order to get

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.600
the updates that have occurred
to what we've loaded, that

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.140
makes it very efficient for us
to show you a updated view of

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.030
content from your Drive
without pulling

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.760
everything up front.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So you're
using a number tricks here to

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.950
have this very fast browsing
experience.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.640
So all already to
the Drive API.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.030
First, you're downloading the
whole set the very first time,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.270
but then using the changes
feed to only get changes.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.440
And--

00:04:45.440 --> 00:08:43.820
[TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES]

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.440
AUSTIN SHOEMAKER: --in
that conversation.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.860
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO:
That's very nice.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.330
Thank you.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.070
So I think my first question
when I saw that is, I said,

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.760
this is beautiful, and
unfortunately, I

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.025
do not have an iPad.

00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:59.780
But I work at Google and I have
some Android devices.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.610
Any plans to have Cooliris
on Android?

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.350
AUSTIN SHOEMAKER: So it's very
exciting that we can say we're

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.720
actively building our
Android application.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.000
So the next major release of
Cooliris is 3.0, and that will

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.230
be fully supported on
iOS and Android.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.550
And we think this is really
important because people who

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.120
are using this app to
communicate and share with

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.930
each other want everyone
to be able to

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.230
interact with each other.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.770
So we don't really have a
complete communication product

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.540
until everybody can
actively engage.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.070
And we're very excited about the
latest platform features

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.070
in Android and plan to take full
advantage of them when we

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.000
release our product.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.890
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So let's say
I have Android device and

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.250
you have an iPad, and we both
use Cooliris, can we do

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.460
whatever you just did with
conversation and share

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.530
everything?

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.040
Doesn't matter what device
I use, right?

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.760
AUSTIN SHOEMAKER: Exactly, so
same experience across devices

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.930
and the web.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.590
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Cool.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.500
That's awesome.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.740
Can I ask you how many
users you have?

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.510
SEBASTIAN MUEHL: Yeah,
right now, we

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.910
see 2.3 million installs.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.710
So we just launched
in July 2012.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.310
And I think this is a very
good head start.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.710
We also see 350 million photos
viewed, which is an amazing

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.080
number, I think.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.250
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Nice,
good job guys.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.350
So you said what's coming
next, that's very good.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.460
You also mentioned some of the
features we are working on,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.030
like push notifications.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.520
At Google we are working
on adding these kind of

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.040
notifications to the Google
Drive API, which is also going

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.232
to help you.

00:10:25.232 --> 00:10:27.740
Can you talk a bit more about
your experience with the

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.450
Google Drive API?

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.710
I mean, you're using a
lot of cool things,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.400
like advanced features.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.750
Was there anything you
didn't find as good?

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.460
AUSTIN SHOEMAKER: Using
Google Drive?

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.940
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Maybe you
couldn't find anything bad,

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.755
but maybe you did.

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:41.980
AUSTIN SHOEMAKER: Oh, so when
we first integrated with the

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.030
version two API, which was the
first time we could really

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.830
build our product.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.900
In the version one API, you were
only able to store and

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.150
get files created by
the application.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.400
And in the version two API we're
able to request access

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.210
to all the files that are on
Drive, which is what we were

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.400
able to build the Wall with.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.490
There's no image centric
metadata.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.910
And that's one of the things
that the Drive--

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.730
other image metadata, which
we're able to display in the

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.350
little metadata bar
at the bottom.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.750
And there's no way that we could
actually display that to

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.000
you without API assistance
because we'd

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.820
have to load the files.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.660
So the beautiful thing here is
that Drive API can stream us

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.860
the content that we need.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.190
First, the metadata, and then
the low resolution thumbnail,

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.630
and then, on demand, the high
resolution content.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.430
It was initially a limitation,
and then it was quickly

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.760
addressed in the API.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.680
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: You mentioned
the image metadata.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.480
When we released the first
version API we got a lot of

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.580
requests about adding more
and more metadata to the

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.750
image and we did.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.570
We added some of the
common Exif fields.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.700
So what fields do you
actually surface?

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.990
I see you use file name,
and the file size,

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.750
and width and height.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.420
Do you also use other fields,
like location or what camera

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.750
took that photo, things
like that?

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.300
Are those needed?

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.420
AUSTIN SHOEMAKER: Yeah, so
right now, we don't show

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.690
extended Exif metadata, like
camera make, model, et cetera.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.350
We'll probably add that
in the future.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.270
One of the ones we do use
today is location,

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.320
which is very cool.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.840
So if your photo has geographic
coordinates, then

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.590
we get that information from
the Drive API and then we

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.280
reverse geocode that into a
named location, which we

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.580
display in the metadata bar
when you select the photo.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.500
So that's really great because
then you can get more context

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.400
for your media.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.580
Instead of just seeing the
photo, you can see when and

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.970
where it was taken.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.700
One feature that Drive
has always had--

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.190
which is really cool and that
makes us look even more cool,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.500
although it's purely the
API doing this, I'd

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.460
love to show you--

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.300
content based search.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.390
So all of the photos that you
add to Drive are instantly

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:58.530
indexed by Drive to extract
landmarks, objects, and other

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.460
recognizable searchable terms.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.580
So I've put a whole bunch of
photos in here and I want to

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.910
go look for some photos
of the Eiffel Tower

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.580
that I remember taking.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.660
So all I have to do is
actually search--

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.910
you can't probably--

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.640
--the next feature requests.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.420
I would absolutely love
to build on that.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.850
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Yeah, I mean,
this is another common

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:25.760
feature request we got.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.990
You're not the only ones
asking for this.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.020
We think that the Google Goggles
integration-- which is

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.750
what you just showed-- is one
of the very cool features of

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.330
Google Drive.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.800
So anyone can just go to Drive,
even without the API,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.810
go to their Drive account on the
web, search for things, as

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.430
you just did looking for
Germany, and see things that

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.330
are related to that.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.550
Because we recognize the image
and that's super cool.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.380
I think we are probably the only
ones having that, which

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.310
is amazing.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.890
And we're still debating how
to expose that information

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.360
through the API.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.230
We will definitely talk
more about that.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.500
Yeah, that's a great request
and it's a common one.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.990
So good job with that.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.650
And we will probably
do something.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.580
OK, cool.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.500
Yeah, I think that's
it with Cooliris.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.830
That was an awesome
description of the

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.480
application, and how this
actually works, and all the

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.740
APIs it uses, and all the tricks
these guys have used to

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.940
make things fast
and beautiful.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.160
And my takeaway is that I'm
really looking forward for the

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.100
Android version.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.980
You don't want to say anything
about dates, right?

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.370
AUSTIN SHOEMAKER: Not
yet, but we will

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.950
definitely keep you posted.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.170
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: OK, cool.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.820
With that, I would say
thank you guys again.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.310
Thank you for joining me.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:46.320
And I will see all of you next
time we go live, that is next

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.460
Tuesday at 11 AM.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.740
Thank you very much and see
you next time on Google

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.990
Developers Live.
