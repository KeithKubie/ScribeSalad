00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.640
 
I think that it's really impossible to

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650
I think that it's really impossible to
 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.980
I think that it's really impossible to
do something unless you you really care

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990
do something unless you you really care
 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.539
do something unless you you really care
about something and I think that's a way

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549
about something and I think that's a way
 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.999
about something and I think that's a way
for science and for academics and for

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:18.009
for science and for academics and for
 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.569
for science and for academics and for
friends and I think most importantly

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579
friends and I think most importantly
 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.819
friends and I think most importantly
they just needs to be some kind of

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829
they just needs to be some kind of
 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.859
they just needs to be some kind of
functional connection that once you hit

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869
functional connection that once you hit
 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.380
functional connection that once you hit
something you know it just kind of

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390
something you know it just kind of
 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.630
something you know it just kind of
clicks and that you need to aggressively

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640
clicks and that you need to aggressively
 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.119
clicks and that you need to aggressively
pursue that a lot so I was very

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129
pursue that a lot so I was very
 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.060
pursue that a lot so I was very
fortuitous that my first experience was

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070
fortuitous that my first experience was
 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.650
fortuitous that my first experience was
science with stem cells and that was

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660
science with stem cells and that was
 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.479
science with stem cells and that was
just a very natural fit and I think that

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
just a very natural fit and I think that
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.820
just a very natural fit and I think that
the first real at really really big step

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830
the first real at really really big step
 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.170
the first real at really really big step
is just finding something you believe in

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180
is just finding something you believe in
 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.280
is just finding something you believe in
and then after that you can definitely

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290
and then after that you can definitely
 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.699
and then after that you can definitely
make things happen
