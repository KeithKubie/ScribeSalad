00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.060
Given this description about how
a traditional Turing Machine can

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.200
simulate a random access model,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.380
I want you to think about how
long the simulation takes.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.270
We'll let R be a random access machine,
and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.570
we'll let M be its
multi-tape equivalent.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.400
n will be the length of the binary
encoding of the input to R.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.600
And we'll let t be the number
of steps taken by R.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.050
Then M takes how long to compute R?

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.770
This is a tough question so
I'll give you a hint.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.210
The length of
the representation of a number

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.660
increases by most a constant in M,
as it simulates a step of R.
