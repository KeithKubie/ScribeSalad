functions really really effectively to
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.350
functions really really effectively to
repel the challenge and as a white

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
repel the challenge and as a white
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.170
repel the challenge and as a white
person I moved through the world

racially comfortable virtually 24/7 it
 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.600
racially comfortable virtually 24/7 it
is exceptional for me to be outside of

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610
is exceptional for me to be outside of
 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.760
is exceptional for me to be outside of
my racial comfort zone and most of my

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770
my racial comfort zone and most of my
 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.610
my racial comfort zone and most of my
life I've been warned not to go outside

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
life I've been warned not to go outside
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.860
life I've been warned not to go outside
my racial comfort zone and so on the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870
my racial comfort zone and so on the
 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.280
my racial comfort zone and so on the
rare occasion when I am uncomfortable

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
rare occasion when I am uncomfortable
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.490
rare occasion when I am uncomfortable
racially it's it's a kind of throwing

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500
racially it's it's a kind of throwing
 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.940
racially it's it's a kind of throwing
off of my racial equilibrium and I need

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950
off of my racial equilibrium and I need
 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.430
off of my racial equilibrium and I need
to get back into that and so I will do

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
to get back into that and so I will do
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.830
to get back into that and so I will do
whatever it takes to repel the challenge

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
whatever it takes to repel the challenge
 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.860
whatever it takes to repel the challenge
and get back into it and in that way I

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870
and get back into it and in that way I
 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.230
and get back into it and in that way I
think white fragility functions as a

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240
think white fragility functions as a
 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.230
think white fragility functions as a
kind of white racial bullying to be

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240
kind of white racial bullying to be
 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.000
kind of white racial bullying to be
