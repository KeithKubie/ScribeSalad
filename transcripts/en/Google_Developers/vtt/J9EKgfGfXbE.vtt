[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.270
MIHAI IONESCU: Hello,
and welcome

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.860
again to Payments Live.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.670
My name is Mihai, and with me
today I have my colleagues

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.190
Peng on the left, and on my
right is my colleague Nasir.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.400
PENG YING: It's good
to be back.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.470
MIHAI IONESCU: And I guess
everyone is really excited

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.390
because today we have
a fabulous topic.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.870
And that is a recap of the
Google Wallet announcements

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.710
and product launches at Google
I/O. So this year's I/O was

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.030
one of the best for
the Wallet team.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.450
Besides meeting all kinds of
developers and getting

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.260
valuable feedback, we had some
very interesting sessions and

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.490
product launches.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.910
And we had thousands of people
watching our sessions and

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.920
interacting with us in the
Developer Sandbox.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.630
So let's get right into it.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.595
What did we announce
at Google I/O?

00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:53.151
And I'll switch.

00:01:53.151 --> 00:02:14.810
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.880
MIHAI IONESCU: Hello, everyone,
and welcome again to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.930
Payments Live.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.420
My name is Mihai, and with me
today I have my colleague Peng

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.520
on the left, and on the right
is my colleague Nasir.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.100
NASIR KHAN: Hi.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.390
MIHAI IONESCU: And everyone is
really excited today because

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.700
we have a fabulous topic.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.070
And that is a recap of the
announcements and Google

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.150
Wallet product launches at I/O.
And this year's I/O was

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.140
one of the best for
the Wallet team.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.080
Besides major product
announcements and meeting lots

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.960
of developers, getting valuable
feedback, we had some

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.550
very interesting sessions.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.900
And thousands of people watched
our sessions and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.640
visited our Developer Sandbox,
where we interacted with the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.750
Wallet team.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.280
So let's get straight into it.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.580
What did we announce?

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.900
Let me switch to my slides here,
where we have the list

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.160
of sessions.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.980
And we had two major
themes this year.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.410
And the first one was around
improving the purchase

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.630
experience in a mobile world.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.595
More and more purchases are
happening on smartphones and

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:14.800
on tablets.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.020
And there are some serious
improvements that can be made

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.500
around the purchasing
experience.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.800
And for this, we had two
interesting sessions.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.000
The first one was "Selling
Physical Goods on Android with

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.230
Google Instant Buy." And the
second was "Building

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.300
Compelling mCommerce Experiences
on Android." And

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.840
I'll briefly talk with Nasir
about what we did to improve

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.650
the customer experience there.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.430
And the second theme, which
Peng will go into in more

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.620
detail, was around digitizing
the entire information that

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.870
you have in your physical wallet
and move it to your--

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.180
PENG YING: Cloud wallet.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.026
MIHAI IONESCU: Cloud wallet.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:55.450
PENG YING: Google Wallet.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.750
MIHAI IONESCU: Digital wallet.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.350
And again, two great
sessions here.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.760
The first one was "Digitizing
the Entire Wallet, Introducing

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.890
Wallet Objects," which
is our new API.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.550
And the second one, which goes
into a little bit more detail,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.470
is "Redefining Loyalty in the
Mobile Age." And, of course,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.430
we also announced a very
interesting product, which was

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.209
Pay by Gmail.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.210
And we didn't have a session
for it, but it was very

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.773
popular with the I/O crowd and
all the attendees who got to

00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:27.650
send money to each other.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.460
PENG YING: I think we gave
everybody $10 as well.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.540
MIHAI IONESCU: We
gave everybody--

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.066
PENG YING: That usually helps.

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:36.170
MIHAI IONESCU: It is still
rolling out to all the Gmail

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.350
users in the US.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.370
But you can also get earlier
access if you have friends who

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.342
already have it.

00:04:42.342 --> 00:04:44.910
Or if you know anyone who
attended Google I/O, just ask

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.040
them for money.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.865
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:51.140
They can give a few
dollars to you.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.780
So let's go through the
sessions one by one.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.576
Let's start with the Instant
Buy session.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.490
So Nasir, we announced Google
Wallet Instant Buy.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.810
NASIR KHAN: Yes.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.596
MIHAI IONESCU: For Android,
which is a pretty significant

00:05:07.596 --> 00:05:08.044
announcement.

00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:10.280
And can you go into
more details, tell

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.030
us more about it?

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.640
NASIR KHAN: Absolutely,
I'd love to.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.490
So as you said, this
is an Android API.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.290
This is actually an Android API
for physical goods which

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.560
was recently announced on May
15 on day one of I/O. And we

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.010
also had this session that you
talked about that Prakash and

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.550
Michael Galpin from
engineering--

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.011
Prakash is our PM, and Michael
Galpin, who is our tech lead,

00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:34.060
they presented.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.500
So it was a very interesting
session.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.330
They actually covered
their entire

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.220
product in great detail.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.560
And I wanted to give you a quick
overview of what the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.010
session was all about.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.350
The most interesting piece of
information that comes out of

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.650
the first few slides of the
session was this number, 97%.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.580
This is the rate of abandonment
on mobile devices

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.250
for any purchase.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.950
Now why this happens,
they went into

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.750
detail of why this happens.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.080
As you know, form factors
play a big role.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.120
You have to enter a lot of
details while you are

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.430
purchasing things.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.510
And people just can't do
it on a small device.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.200
They just either are moving
fast, and it's really painful

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.110
to enter your name, address,
shipping address, billing

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.620
address, credit card
information, and so forth.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.600
And this is where this
product comes in.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.920
So essentially, what was
launched here is this Instant

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.740
Buy, which is basically an API
that enables fast checkout for

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.170
physical goods on the device.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:38.140
It's a native API which works
from within the native app for

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.330
merchants, and so users don't
have to go out at all from

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.920
their app experience.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.590
You just skip the registraion
and sign-in, and essentially,

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.360
you're already signed in
to an Android device.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.320
Because once you have an account
on an Android device,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.660
you're already signed in.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.700
It's extremely secure.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.160
So from the user perspective,
they get all the benefits that

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.130
they have using Wallet.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.270
The merchants get the complete
payment flow as they would get

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.000
the flow with any other
payment instrument.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.130
But essentially, with Wallet,
they get what we call a

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.460
one-time-use card.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.490
So the user is protected by the
amount that they actually

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:14.860
purchased with the merchant.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.740
And the merchant gets a pretty
seamless experience, which is

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.700
the other beauty of it.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.610
Because the integration
is extremely simple.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.650
It's almost zero changes to
their back end, really.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.790
And best of all, it's
free from Google.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.172
So Google doesn't charge
any additional

00:07:30.172 --> 00:07:30.940
fee for this product.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.800
So from a merchant's
perspective, it's like any

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.455
other credit card coming
into their flow.

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.040
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, so you
get best of both worlds.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.950
NASIR KHAN: Exactly.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.200
So let me now go into it
a little bit more.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.990
So they also announced 11
merchants that went live on

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.810
the same day.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.220
MIHAI IONESCU: I see some
pretty big names here.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:48.860
NASIR KHAN: Pretty
big names here.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.130
As you can see, they are from
a wide array of verticals.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.140
We have travel, Priceline,
Expedia, Airbnb.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.920
We have some overhead kind
of merchants like

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.010
Tabbedout and GoPago.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.640
If you have traveled in a big
city, you're taking a cab, you

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.740
must be familiar with Uber,
which is a pretty nice

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.700
experience.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.630
So all of these were launched
on that day, and pretty

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.130
significant.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:15.933
We're seeing a great update
on new apps ever since.

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:19.390
But let me give you a little bit
more insight of what this

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.160
product is all about.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.960
So, like I said, a native app,
from the user perspective when

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.350
they are interacting with it,
from within the app, they get

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.770
to access their Google
Wallet in the cloud.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.809
And the way it happens

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:39.280
seamlessly is the app accesses--

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.850
and I'll come to it in a
minute about what the

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.710
architecture looks like.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.865
But essentially, from the user
perspective, they don't move

00:08:43.865 --> 00:08:45.415
out of the app at all.

00:08:45.415 --> 00:08:48.360
They access their Google Wallet
securely, and from

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.780
there, they can select the
instrument of their choice and

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.160
the shipping address
of their choice.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.670
And the information comes back
to the app, which can then be

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.190
passed on to the merchant's
payment

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.620
processor in the cloud.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.300
So it's a pretty
seamless flow.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.480
So users just interact
with Wallet once.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.200
Merchants get what we call a
one-time or a proxy card.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.320
And then they use that proxy
card as they would use any

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.000
other card with their payment
processor in the cloud.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.900
So pretty seamless and nice
experience for both the

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.830
merchant and the user.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.785
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, I like it
that we started the design

00:09:22.785 --> 00:09:24.276
with the user in mind.

00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:27.520
Make it as seamless as possible
for the user.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.270
Keep in mind the restrictions
of mobile devices, limited

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.470
screen size.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.990
And then as seamless
as possible for

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:39.340
the merchant as well.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.070
Give them a card.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.790
They'll charge it.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.530
They're done.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:43.150
Very nice.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.660
NASIR KHAN: And going back to
the number that I started

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.750
with, 97%, this actually, as
you'll see, we have a demo

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.420
actually for you that will show
you as to how this really

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.240
reduces that friction.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.155
But before that, let me just
show you a quick high-level

00:09:58.155 --> 00:09:59.780
architecture of this solution.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.870
So how does this fit in from
a developer perspective?

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.990
So if you are familiar with
Google Play Services, this is

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.060
part of Google Play Services.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.820
And the way it works is that
your app actually compiles in

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.720
a very thin client library,
which is the Google Play

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.300
Services client library.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.150
And then there is a Google Play
Services APK which runs

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.800
on the device, which essentially
is a window into

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.340
all Google services
on the device.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.430
So your app interacts with this
thin client library and

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.120
gets access to Wallet.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.110
The beauty of this is the Google
Play Services APK has

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.560
an automatic update from Google
Play Store, so you

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.940
don't have to worry about any
changes or answers that you

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.920
make from a merchant
perspective.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.640
And the users keep on getting
the best user experience

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.840
without them having
to do anything

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.470
specific in terms of updating.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.000
So like I said, we have a
demo lined up for you.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.940
Let me just show you a quick
demo just so that you can see

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.470
what I'm talking about here
in [? full glory. ?]

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:02.220
So if you can see my device
now, I have this demo

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.620
application.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.110
This demo application
is selling cameras.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.090
And I just have three
demo cameras here.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.450
So it's a typical mobile
app with an

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.870
mCommerce kind of a store.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.170
So I select a camera, as you
would do in any other merchant

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.760
app, and I add it to my cart.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.820
Now something interesting
happened.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.000
As you can see, there is a Buy
with Google button here.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.500
And the Buy with Google button
is where you actually begin to

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.260
interact with Google Wallet.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.840
So on this page, instead of
clicking Continue Checkout,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.260
which I would do otherwise,
I would

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.220
click on Buy with Google.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.520
And this brings a very
interesting UI, which is

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.400
actually a Google Wallet UI.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.360
So as you can see, I didn't move
out of the app, but this

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.490
UI pops up right
within the app.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.650
And it is actually leading
me into my Google

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.290
Wallet in the cloud.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.440
So it shows me my saved
payment instruments.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.400
I select a MasterCard here.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.550
And it also shows some addresses
that I have.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.680
So I select this address
on file.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.350
And this check box is basically
for using Google

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:03.920
Wallet for future purchases.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.200
And that's going to be a
pre-authorization, where

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.810
actually if you select
this, you don't

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.390
see this pop up again.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.980
So it just assumes your
intention to use Google Wallet

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.310
next time around.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.500
For now, I'll uncheck it
and move to Continue.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.050
And as you can see, I'm right
on to the confirmation page.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.840
At this time, I have gotten my
what you call a mass payment

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.950
instrument, my MasterCard,
right here.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.060
I have my shipping address.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.610
I can, of course, change
any of these.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.950
I have a Change button,
which brings the

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.940
same chooser as before.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.890
But essentially, I'll
not do that.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.930
I'll just confirm the order.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.790
And that's it.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.300
The payment is done.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.630
The payment information has
gone to the merchant.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.345
And as you can see, I didn't
have to enter any of the

00:12:51.345 --> 00:12:53.820
things, my credit card,
address, any of that.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.650
So it's extremely, extremely
simple for the user.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.520
Just a few clicks
and you're done.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:57.945
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:12:57.945 --> 00:12:59.600
Two-click buying experience.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.940
You like the camera?

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.990
Buy with Google--

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.580
NASIR KHAN: It's being
shipped right now.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.820
I'll tell you how it is.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.460
MIHAI IONESCU: And you're out
of a few hundred dollars,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.390
probably close to $1,000 for
a good, quality camera.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.710
NASIR KHAN: Exactly.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.010
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:13.380
Thank you.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.990
Thank you for the demo, Nasir.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.510
And quick question.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.160
So this is an Android
API, specifically

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.770
an Android SDK API.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:26.650
And we already have an Android
in-app billing API, which also

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.780
is a Wallet API.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.190
How do these two APIs compare
to each other?

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.600
NASIR KHAN: That's a
very good question.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.610
So the in-app billing API,
as you know, has been

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:35.410
around for a while.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.390
And that's the API for digital
goods being sold on Android.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.920
Whereas this API is specifically
for physical

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.680
goods and services.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.710
So it's a clear distinction.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.390
They're two different APIs, but
between the two of them,

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.440
they cover the entire
spectrum.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.970
MIHAI IONESCU: So we added
what was missing.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:50.225
NASIR KHAN: Exactly.

00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:53.040
MIHAI IONESCU: We had digital
goods used by thousands of

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.580
developers.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.290
And now services and physical
goods are also taking off in

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.610
the mobile world.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.940
And we have the API for you.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.820
NASIR KHAN: And from the user
perspective, it's the same

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.670
Wallet in the cloud.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.000
So from user, it's
pretty similar.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.995
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, for the
user, they're using the same

00:14:06.995 --> 00:14:08.245
account, the same Wallet.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.030
That's good for the users.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.600
How about the developers
and the merchants?

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.040
How can they use it?

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.030
Where can they get their
hands on the SDK?

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.960
NASIR KHAN: Absolutely.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.150
So as of this time, this
is still a limited

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.080
availability API.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.900
We do have an interest form, as
you can see on the screen.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.640
MIHAI IONESCU: You
can sign up.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.040
NASIR KHAN: It's a URL here,
getinstantbuy.withgoogle.com.

00:14:33.576 --> 00:14:35.120
So it's an interest form.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.716
MIHAI IONESCU: So if
everyone can see

00:14:35.716 --> 00:14:37.190
it, it's on our slides.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.340
NASIR KHAN: Yes, fill
it up, and somebody

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.070
will get back to you.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.220
MIHAI IONESCU: Easy
to remember.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.470
Getinstantbuy.withgoogle.com.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.075
Easy form.

00:14:45.075 --> 00:14:49.420
It will ask you for some
information to get an idea of

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.290
what kind of card processing
you have and what type of

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.450
services and products
you're selling.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.510
And once you sign up, we'll
get in touch with you.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:06.420
So this was our main session
on the Instant Buy API.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.290
And I encourage everyone,
if you didn't see the

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:09.820
session, go see it.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.050
We have a lot more information,
some interesting

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:17.130
demos with some partners,
and you'll learn a

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.800
lot from that session.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.850
So there's another session
that was also very

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.330
interesting.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.710
And that's the "Building
mCommerce Experiences on

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.380
Android." Can you tell us a
little bit about this session?

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:29.600
NASIR KHAN: Yes.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.150
This is a very interesting
session.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.620
This is actually a pretty
deep Android session.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.250
So as you see in this demo that
the Google Wallet team

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.630
has embraced our best practices
and seamlessly given

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.540
them to the user and merchant
for them to use.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.000
This session talks a little
bit about those.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.310
How they did what they did,
and also how merchants can

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.420
make use of those best practices
in their apps to

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.770
provide a seamless, nice
experience for the user.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.720
So this was a bunch of best
practices and tips and tricks.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.840
I've just taken a few of them.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.470
It's a very in-depth,
nice session.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.070
I encourage everybody
to do this as well.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.240
But in terms of key takeaways,
as you can see in mobile, like

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.430
we talk about form filling
is a big problem.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.140
So they could talk about how
they can do real-time

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.270
formatting of forms, how they
can do validation of the form

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.810
right within the device, how
they can auto-advance fields

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.700
so know when the field is filled
up, and you move to the

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.110
next one, making it easy for
the user to navigate.

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.180
Input suggestions for
different things.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.720
And what I really like is
address autocomplete.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.930
I'll have another
slide on that.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.390
Disk-based cache for quick
access of things which are not

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.430
changing so frequently.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:48.400
So they talk about selectively
caching things.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.810
There's a very insightful
discussion about security and

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.550
privacy as well in the talk.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.720
But what I really like, as I
said, is address autocomplete.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.450
It's a beautiful experience if
you happen to use any of these

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.680
apps, button apps, you'll
see if you have

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.820
an address in Wallet.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.069
So you can do that very quickly
because it just

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.769
happens automatically.

00:17:07.769 --> 00:17:09.480
Just start entering it.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.530
And just like as you would have
on Maps, it would get the

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.170
information from Wallet, from
Google Places, and have the

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:18.150
addresses right there,
which you can see.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.450
MIHAI IONESCU: I love
this new feature.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.449
Sometimes I even forget
the address.

00:17:21.449 --> 00:17:23.750
But when I see it poking
out in the

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.888
drop-down, oh, I remember.

00:17:24.888 --> 00:17:28.171
That's the address, yeah.

00:17:28.171 --> 00:17:29.830
NASIR KHAN: Yeah, so that
was the session.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.380
MIHAI IONESCU: Awesome.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.150
So very, very technical session,
but definitely

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.430
everyone will find
it interesting.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.960
And it applies to all kinds of
mCommerce applications, not

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.930
necessarily Wallet.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.300
So have a look at it.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:50.800
But are there any real-world
examples that people can go

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.810
and try and see how the
API works and have a

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.560
feel of the Buy flow?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.060
NASIR KHAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.490
So we had the partner
that we launched.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.430
MIHAI IONESCU: You showed
us the list of partners.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.810
NASIR KHAN: Yeah.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.880
So all of the partners have
done a very good job of

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.900
integrating our API.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.280
MIHAI IONESCU: Shall we
go back to the list?

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.760
NASIR KHAN: Yeah, let's look
at the list one more time.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.020
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.800
Here's the list.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:08.200
NASIR KHAN: Yeah.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.135
So I would recommend all of
you to go ahead, download

00:18:11.135 --> 00:18:14.100
these apps, and play
around with them.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.350
In terms of best practices, like
I said, all of them have

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.500
done a great job.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.870
But you can have a look at
Fancy because the Fancy

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.680
engineer was also co-hosting
the session that I talked

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.420
about, so he was there.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.690
And they talked about some of
the best practices that they

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:30.650
had in their app.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.660
Like, for example, how
do they handle an

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.440
international audience.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.710
How did they handle
internationalization,

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.280
localization, things of that
kind, which are extremely

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.090
important for mobile as well
because if you move to UK, you

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:43.940
have a different kind
of postal code.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.380
So you have to take that
into account and

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.780
things of that kind.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.960
Latency improvements, how the
apps can do well on latency

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.160
reductions.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.700
Fancy has also done a good job
of integrating Wallet and G+.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.690
So that's a really interesting
demo, as you'll see.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.430
[INAUDIBLE] is another
interesting app.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.140
They have what we call a
two-click purchase, a single

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.990
SKU purchase.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.010
So have a look at that.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.030
They are following Android
UI guidelines very, very

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.730
carefully, so it's a
good UI to look at.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.290
Expedia is a fluid
user experience.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.040
It's a very beautiful app.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.805
They load a lot of things
in background.

00:19:20.805 --> 00:19:23.290
The Wallet information they
load in the background.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.350
They have something called swipe
to purchase, which works

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.170
beautifully.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.000
Priceline is, again, a very
nice integration.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.190
They have also done SSO,
Single Sign-On,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.920
so that works nicely.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.000
They have a simplified
checkout with Wallet.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.980
And they are basically, if you
want to look at a standard

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.270
Wallet checkout flow,
Priceline is

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.950
the app to look at.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.335
It's very similar in terms of
the flow through the app that

00:19:44.335 --> 00:19:44.830
I showed you.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.730
So it's basically following
exactly the kind of flow that

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.550
we recommend.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.050
Yeah, so all of these
apps are great.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.000
MIHAI IONESCU: Fantastic.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.680
So we have the API launched.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:59.160
We have some great examples and
partners to inspire from.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.640
We have some great sessions
that go deep into details.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.050
And they introduce some new
additions to the Android

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.220
world, like autocomplete
and all that stuff.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.085
So get ready to implement.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.340
Start selling.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.150
PENG YING: Get ready to sell.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.756
MIHAI IONESCU: Instant Buy,
get ready to sell.

00:20:17.756 --> 00:20:19.620
NASIR KHAN: Get Instant Buy.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.090
MIHAI IONESCU: So remember,
getinstantbuy.withgoogle.com.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.810
Sign up.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:28.120
And documentation is out,
examples are out.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.190
You just need to have
something to sell.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.710
Great.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:34.390
Thank you, Nasir.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.290
Very interesting couple
of sessions.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.680
So now going back to our list,
the second major theme.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.490
And now Peng will take over.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:42.980
PENG YING: Yeah, this
is my turn.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.550
MIHAI IONESCU: And we're going
to talk about Wallet Objects

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.240
and digitizing your entire
Wallet experience.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.310
So can you tell us a little bit
more about Wallet Objects

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.050
platform and what exactly
did we announce at I/O?

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.400
PENG YING: Sure.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.200
So I'm sure some of you are
already familiar with what

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.160
Google Wallet is, we call
it Google Wallet.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.860
And for those of you who aren't,
it's Google's goal--

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.200
well, the idea is that with
Google Wallet, what we want to

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.280
do is we want to enable the
digitization of all the

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.210
physical items that people
typically carry

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.170
within their wallet.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.270
MIHAI IONESCU: So I will show
you now a slide which shows--

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.460
PENG YING: Yeah, there's
a lot of stuff.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.920
MIHAI IONESCU: Lots of stuff
that actually does not fit in

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.880
your wallet.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.290
You don't want to have all that
stuff in your wallet.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.090
You need like five pockets
to keep all that.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:28.850
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:31.250
I wear cargo shorts, and
it works for me.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.325
MIHAI IONESCU: Or [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:37.390
So yes please, digitize.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:41.580
PENG YING: So before, what we
did was we allowed you to save

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.470
payment cards and offers
into your Wallet.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.420
And that was kind
of restrictive.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.190
So at I/O, what we did
was we announced the

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.330
Wallet Objects API.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.660
And this is one step towards
adding additional things and

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.370
being able to save additional
things into Google Wallet.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.560
At I/O, we had two sessions
covering the

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.260
Wallet Objects API.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:07.210
The first session was more of a
general session that covered

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.440
what are the pain points that
consumers typically encounter

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.850
today, and what are solutions
for those pain points.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:19.270
The second session was a
technical deep dive session on

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.730
how to integrate the Google
Wallet Objects API.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:24.760
MIHAI IONESCU: So it sounds
very interesting.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.470
Let's go through them
one by one.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.480
So the first session was
the overall session.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.720
Let's talk about that
one a little bit.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:31.975
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:22:31.975 --> 00:22:38.000
So I think in everyday usage
of loyalty cards or offers,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.290
there's a lot of friction
that occurs.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.120
For example, on average, each
household has something like

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.030
18 loyalty cards.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.510
But I'm pretty sure
that none of us

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.965
carry around that amount.

00:22:50.965 --> 00:22:52.420
MIHAI IONESCU: Yep, they're
stuck in a drawer.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.670
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.790
My cousin gave me a gift
card for Bed, Bath,

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.260
and Beyond for Christmas.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.200
And it's just stuck in
a drawer somewhere.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.040
I go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond,
but the card is never with me.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.410
I think that's a problem that
a lot of people encounter.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.030
And I have a Safeway card and
everything, but all of that

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.510
stuff stays at home.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.310
And sometimes I forget
to enter in stuff.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.210
So I think that's one of the
problems that we're trying to

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.540
solve for consumers.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.350
These things that we probably
want to carry around but we

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.170
don't because it's a hassle.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.965
One thing that everybody
does carry around,

00:23:30.965 --> 00:23:32.440
though, is their phone.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:33.670
It's already a camera.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:34.780
It's already a communication
device.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.510
It's already an MP3 player,
so why not add just add

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.230
a little bit more?

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.520
MIHAI IONESCU: It's
a computer.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.000
PENG YING: Yeah, just add
a little bit more

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.610
functionality to it.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.596
And the solution that we came
up with-- well, the solution

00:23:44.596 --> 00:23:46.860
that we came up with before
was Wallet Objects.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:52.410
And we're going to append
the Wallet Objects API.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:58.600
So with it, developers can
define the objects that users

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.480
can store, and then users can
then save these objects to

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.730
their Google Wallet.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.790
In addition to simplifying
things for the user, we're

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.080
also enabling a bunch of new

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.355
opportunities for the merchant.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.980
We're enabling real-time updates
and geo-fencing for

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:25.090
each of these Wallet Objects.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:28.430
So imagine that I'm shopping in
Union Square or something.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.620
I'm kind of thirsty, and
my phone buzzes.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:36.400
It reminds me that I have $10
saved at a store, let's say

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.490
Starbucks, for example.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.650
Its geo-fencer knows that, hey,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.810
there's a Starbucks around.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.750
Hey, you have $10 saved here.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.970
And it tells me that, reminds
me to go there.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.945
So then I go to Starbucks.

00:24:46.945 --> 00:24:48.285
I get my black coffee.

00:24:48.285 --> 00:24:51.260
I'm not a big sugar and
cream kind of person.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.480
MIHAI IONESCU: And you're
doubly happy.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.790
PENG YING: Yeah, I'm
doubly happy.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.730
MIHAI IONESCU: You get
a coffee, and you

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:56.620
didn't spend any money.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:57.640
You had a coupon.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.510
PENG YING: Yeah, it reminded me
that I had a coupon for it.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:05.180
But let's say that this coffee
is actually my 30th star.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.240
And I think some people are
familiar with the Starbucks

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.190
rewards program.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.130
But after you purchase 30
coffees, it upgrades you to

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.300
the next tier.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.150
And then once I get upgraded
to the next tier, it

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.700
automatically notifies me
within the Google Wallet

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.850
application.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.610
So that kind of engagement
and reminder mechanism is

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:23.120
something that we're trying
to provide as value to the

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.700
merchant and to the consumer.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.040
Also, as a merchant, imagine
that I could have a Save to

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.790
Wallet button for offers on some
sort of ads on my site.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.640
So now, when these things are
redeemed offline, I can kind

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.500
of track my online ad spend
to my offline conversions.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.760
I think that being able to track
that is something that

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.370
could be really valuable
to merchants.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.110
MIHAI IONESCU: It's
absolutely, yeah.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.240
PENG YING: And what we're going
to show right now on the

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:55.000
screen is the consumer
sign-up experience.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.780
Another benefit that we're
providing for merchants and

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.370
consumers is the ability
to instantly sign up.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.850
So all of these consumers
have their information

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.250
stored in the cloud.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.970
Why do they need to refill it in
every time they sign up for

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.150
a new loyalty program?

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.100
MIHAI IONESCU: Again, big
problem in general and in

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.510
particular on mobile devices.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.510
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.000
A lot of pain points, right?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.800
So we're trying to simplify that
by doing something like

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.870
instant sign-up.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.450
Hey, I'm interested in signing
up for this loyalty program.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.780
Hey, use my Google credentials
to fill it out.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.180
And then boom, you're done.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.120
You have your new loyalty card,
and you're now a member

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.410
of that program.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:34.700
MIHAI IONESCU: Nice.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.960
Design it with the consumer
in mind, and then--

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.030
PENG YING: Both parties.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.590
There has to be value
to both parties for

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.060
anything to get adoption.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:47.540
MIHAI IONESCU: So where can
developers start using it?

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.495
Is it available?

00:26:50.495 --> 00:26:55.540
PENG YING: Well, the Wallet
Objects API right now is

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.910
currently private
for partners.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:03.090
But we'll have a URL later that
we're going to show in a

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.340
little bit.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.060
So if you're interested in
signing up for the Wallet

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.102
Objects API, it's at
google.com/walle

00:27:11.102 --> 00:27:12.352
t/business/loyalty.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.810
And I'm currently working on the
docs right now, so we will

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.350
get that out as soon
as possible.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.680
MIHAI IONESCU: Another
easy to remember URL,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.400
wallet/business/loyalty.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.610
PENG YING: You can just pause
the YouTube stream, right?

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:34.102
Yeah--

00:27:34.102 --> 00:27:35.090
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.600
MIHAI IONESCU: Sign up form,
and we can get back to you

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.120
with more information how to get
your hands on the API and

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.850
start putting your loyalty
program or other kind of

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:47.320
digitized information
on there.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.370
PENG YING: So if you're
interested in--

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.880
so for more information about
the Wallet Objects API or the

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.910
Wallet Objects platform and then
how we're envisioning it

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.000
and what pain points we're
trying to solve and the

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.030
general overview of it, check
out the "Introducing Wallet

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.290
Objects" session.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.350
We also have a second session.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.300
MIHAI IONESCU: So definitely we
just give a quick overview

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:16.490
and try to entice you a little
bit, get you more interested.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.150
But the session has a lot of
information and definitely

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:21.610
worth watching.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.200
And then the second session
you mentioned, which is

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.400
"Redefining Loyalty in
the Mobile Age."

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:26.780
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:27.420
So--

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.380
MIHAI IONESCU: Go into
more detail there.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.330
PENG YING: The reason why
everything's loyalty and

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:32.940
offers is because we're
starting off

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.930
with two major verticals.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:36.830
It's kind of the niche
approach, where we're

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:40.210
targeting the main pain points
that users encounter, which

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.030
are loyalty and offers.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:49.790
So the session is about kind of
a technical deep dive, and

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:54.750
how do you integrate Wallet
Objects API for loyalty.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.570
The same API is appable across
almost all the verticals that

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:00.850
Wallet Objects API supports.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:04.840
And at its core, it's
an OAuth REST API.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.790
So how the user uses it is you
would create a Wallet object.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.220
The user then saves this Wallet
object to their wallet.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.285
And then you can get a list of
the Wallet objects that users

00:29:16.285 --> 00:29:17.930
have saved that you own.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:22.330
And then you use the REST API
mechanisms to update it and

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:26.420
modify it and engage with
your consumers.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.945
Everything that you update and
that you modify gets pushed to

00:29:29.945 --> 00:29:32.140
your users in real time.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.770
During the session, we also
talk about the JSON

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.110
representation of
these objects.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:43.200
And if you're interested in
all these nitty gritty

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.660
details, check out the
"Redefining Loyalty in the

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.910
Mobile Age" presentation.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.930
We'll probably also
have a GDL to do a

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.030
technical deep dive later.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.260
Well, when the docs
are done, a little

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.160
bit later this quarter.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.610
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:02.680
We have a lot more stuff to talk
about, so stay tuned to

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.590
this channel.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.180
All right, so great.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.830
We covered the two major themes
at I/O, the Instant Buy

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:15.665
launch, improving the mobile
purchasing experience, and the

00:30:15.665 --> 00:30:21.100
Wallet Objects platform launch,
digitizing your entire

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.980
world and putting it in the
cloud, in your digital wallet.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:25.690
NASIR KHAN: Doing that,
you took a lot of pain

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.750
away from the users.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.000
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes, and making
users happy along the way and

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.660
making it simpler for merchants
to make money and

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:39.150
improve conversion rates
in both cases.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:44.280
So before wrapping up, let's
talk a little bit about the

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.040
Developer Sandbox at I/O, since
we're on the I/O topic.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.780
So we met a lot of developers,
got a lot of great feedback.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.515
Partners showcased their
latest apps.

00:30:54.515 --> 00:30:54.860
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.450
Show them some pictures from--

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.210
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, pictures.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:00.730
All right.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.986
This is a picture [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:01.986 --> 00:31:03.420
PENG YING: That looks
really busy.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.030
MIHAI IONESCU: That was busy.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:06.700
That was the Wallet
Developer Sandbox.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.220
And if you look carefully,
maybe you

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.620
see some of us there.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.710
And some of the partners Nasir
mentioned in the slides were

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.880
also Sandbox partners and
showcased their apps.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.960
And we also had something very
interesting, like a prototype

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.270
interactive store that
you worked on, Peng.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.100
Can you talk a little
bit about it?

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.320
PENG YING: Sure.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.890
So we wanted something kind of
to inspire developers and get

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.420
them to think about things that
they could do with the

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.780
Instant Buy API.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.890
And the best way to do that is
with something that is really

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.560
like, wow, like what kind of
purchase experience can you do

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.110
with this API that allows you
to purchase physical goods

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:52.300
really easily on a
mobile device?

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.510
And we kind of got some
inspiration from Tesco.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:59.720
What we did was we built
a Google concept store.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.190
And with the store, what
you're doing is you're

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:02.060
browsing items.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.790
You can actually show
the next slide.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:07.120
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, it's the
big screen, the vertical

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.060
screen on the right.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.680
And we have another
picture of it.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.980
And yay, this is Nagesh.

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.280
PENG YING: Yeah, this
guy is Nagesh.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.980
He's also on our team.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.060
And then we'll actually
be talking about this.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.410
We'll be deep diving into
what we did next week--

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.930
or not next week, during
the next GDL.

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.380
But for now, I can give you a
quick overview of what it is

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.000
and why it's cool and what we
were hoping to accomplish.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.280
MIHAI IONESCU: What is
he buying there?

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.620
PENG YING: That is an
Android plushie.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.510
MIHAI IONESCU: A
fluffy android.

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:40.190
PENG YING: So the idea is that
it's an interactive display,

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.900
or an interactive touchscreen.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.140
You can have all of your store's
inventory in a single

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.490
interactive display.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.190
The user can pan through it.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.160
And then once they tap
on the item, they

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.720
can find more details.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.890
In the middle is actually
a 360 swivel.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.520
So you get a 360 degree view of
the item that the user is

00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.540
interested in.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.510
And to purchase, what a user
can do is they can take out

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.960
their phone, they can scan the
QR codes, which adds the item

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.580
to their cart on the phone.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.640
And using the Instant
Buy API, they can

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.220
purchase with a few clicks.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.240
Fulfillment wasn't handled in
our concept demo, but you

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.380
could easily handle it with a
same-day delivery service.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.670
So imagine something like oh,
the store is closed, but you

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.970
have this within the
window display.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:29.820
A user could be walking by, like
maybe they see a shirt

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.640
that they like or something
that catches their fancy.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.800
They check it out.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.710
They interact with it.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:39.770
It's like a real kind of
touching experience, in-person

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.510
experience, branded
experience.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.300
They purchase it, and
then it's delivered

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.260
later to their house.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.530
So that's kind of the showcase
that we wanted to make to

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.540
inspire developers and get them
thinking about hey, now

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.270
that purchasing physical goods
on the phone is so simple,

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:58.410
what can we do with it?

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:04.300
So in the next GDL, what we'll
be doing is talking about how

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.390
we built it.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.590
We're also looking to open
source as much of the code as

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.880
we can so that anybody
can build

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.199
these interactive displays.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:14.719
MIHAI IONESCU: A lot of this
looks like the real thing,

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.969
especially with the 3D swivel.

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:19.129
You can see the item
from all angles.

00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:20.170
PENG YING: It's pretty cool.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.940
MIHAI IONESCU: And let's say
you're at Costco, and

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.350
something is not available
there.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:25.745
You just go--

00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.150
PENG YING: Get it delivered
to your house.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.510
MIHAI IONESCU: And yep,
buy it, and that's it.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.040
PENG YING: Or you could put this
at the bus station, or--

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:32.949
NASIR KHAN: Kiosk
at the airport.

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.639
You could just buy things and
pick it up on the way.

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.128
PENG YING: Get it delivered to
your house or something.

00:34:37.128 --> 00:34:39.969
MIHAI IONESCU: You could do it
before visiting the store and

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.199
just pick it up there.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:41.870
Awesome.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.670
Looking forward to
the session.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.260
So that's it.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.300
We did a quick tour and recap
of the Wallet sessions at

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:56.530
Google I/O. And again, thank you
for joining us, and thanks

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.870
to all the developers who
attended Google I/O and

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:02.910
visited the Sandbox, came
and talked with us.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:06.150
We'll be back in a couple of
weeks with some more exciting

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.040
sessions, including the
interactive source session.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.020
So until then, bye.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.465
NASIR KHAN: Bye.

00:35:11.465 --> 00:35:12.715
PENG YING: See you guys.

00:35:27.002 --> 00:36:40.647
