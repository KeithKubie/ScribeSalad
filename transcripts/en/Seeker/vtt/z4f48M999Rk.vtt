00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.780
Catching someone in a lie?

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.220
Not as easy as you'd think!

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:13.340
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you
have friends or partners who are chronic liars

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.530
- then you've come to the right place.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.200
Nonverbal cues are widely considered to be
the most telling indicators of when a person

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.200
is lying.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.240
So what should you look out for?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.289
One of the first signs of a nervous liar is
fidgeting - so pay close attention.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.009
Are they shuffling their feet, or playing
with their hair, or messing with their watch?

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.030
All of these could be potential signs of deceit.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.290
You've probably heard that liars tend to avoid
eye contact, but did you know that dilated

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.230
pupils can also be a sign?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.750
These are caused by increased tension and
concentration, typically experienced when

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.879
someone is lying.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.199
Defensiveness is another telling behavior
- that can manifest in multiple ways.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.140
If someone's voice suddenly gets higher, for
example, that's a pretty good giveaway.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.570
Liars also tend to be uncooperative, and make
more negative statements, using words like

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.789
"sad" and "hate."

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.019
Most of these seem pretty obvious when you
think about it - but modern research suggests

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.260
they may not be entirely accurate.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.400
A study published last month in the journal
Psychological Science claims that humans are

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.470
better at detecting lies when they're doing
so unconsciously, rather than consciously

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.370
trying to decipher certain behaviors.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.200
According to Maria Hartwig, a professor at
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.000
looking at a person's behavior and listening
to their statements - has a lie detection

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.680
accuracy rate of about 54%, which is only
slightly above the rate you'd obtain from

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.680
simply guessing.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.510
The real indicators, she says, are much more
subtle than the nonverbal cues we've been

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.600
taught to rely on.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.630
Clark Freshman is a law professor who runs
a firm that trains lawyers and negotiators

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.750
on proper lie detection techniques.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.770
He says that while there's no surefire method
for detecting liars - there are some advanced

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.780
methods they employ during questioning.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.250
The "unanticipated question approach," for
example, is useful in cases where you suspect

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.050
someone may be trying to cover something up.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.140
This is based on the idea that people in these
situations, will often fabricate stories without

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.780
considering all of the details.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.490
So, if someone commits a crime but their alibi
says they were at a restaurant when it happened

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.880
- ask them questions they wouldn't expect.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.390
Like, where was the restaurant's bathroom
located?

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.610
A person who's telling the truth, will have
no problem answering these details - but a

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.770
liar, might struggle more.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.090
If you already have evidence that someone
has lied, Hartwig says the worst thing you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.730
can do - is to let the liar know you have
evidence.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.550
Instead, ask them general questions, and see
how much information they're willing to volunteer.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.230
People who are telling the truth, tend to
be more forthcoming with information than

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.800
liars, who are naturally evasive.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.190
Freshman also says to look out for microexpressions
- which are subtle facial cues that appear

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.640
for only a split second.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.080
A 2008 study on the topic, showed that people
who are being deceptive about their emotions,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.690
display inconsistent expressions and blink
more often than those telling the truth.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.560
So if you REALLY wanna catch someone in a
lie - try not to focus too much on the obvious

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.560
clues.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.820
It's the subtle ones that are usually the
most telling.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.640
If you know any other tried-and-true methods
for catching a liar with their pants down
