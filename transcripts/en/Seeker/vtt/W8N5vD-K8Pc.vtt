00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:09.200
The environment gets the shaft for sure, but
now studies are starting to show that if one

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.740
person start composting, their neighbors will
too… it’s like… an environmentalism

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.619
arms race!

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.080
Environmentalism isn’t sexy.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.769
We know from other DNews videos that if I
say "Global Warming" some of you will perk

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.400
up but if I say, "Climate Change," you are
out of here faster than radiation through

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.190
an o-zone hole…

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.100
BOOM, Now you’re back!

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.840
"Environmentalist arms-race" has that same
effect, I bet.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.390
Humans evolved to pay attention to things
that affect THEM and climate change is EXTREMELY

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.660
difficult to get people to pay attention to
simply because it’s so huge.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.650
But there is one way to get everyone to pay
attention, buy something flashy that shows

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.970
you care more than they do.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.970
Think about it!

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.710
When people buy things to show off their status,
like a Louis Vuitton bag, the latest game

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.220
console for their house, diamonds for their
ears, necks, or hands, or latest mobile phone

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.160
to flash around… that’s called Conspicuous
Consumption.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.240
It’s a psychological term coined by an economist
in the early 20th century.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.360
We WANT people to think we’re classy, and
we’ll buy things to show off our social

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.500
class.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.530
Conspicuous consumption is tied to another
American idiom: "keeping up with the Joneses."

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.750
The idea being, we don’t want to be left
behind in our social group.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.940
It’s an evolutionary tactic, chimps groom
and make things, they show off and compete.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.159
It’s a normal part of primate life.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.860
The thing is, studies from Cal Berkeley, Universities
of Minnesota and New Mexico and countries

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.310
around the world show there’s also an environmentalist
version of this: Conspicuous Conservation.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.950
This is where people gain status in their
social groups by being MORE environmentally

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.950
conscious.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.240
They buy a hybrid in a land of Hummers, start
recycling in a place where people send everything

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.300
to a landfill…

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.600
It’s the green version of buying a designer
suit, and they’re not mutually exclusive,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.540
they’re inexorably connected.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.380
Many brands know this now too, and design
their environmentally friendly products to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.110
fit with conspicuous consumption psychology.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.760
A study from Cal Berkeley in 2012 found that
the design of the Prius affects its sales.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.989
The Prius is the most successful hybrid, in
terms of sales, in part because it LOOKS like

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.920
a hybrid, they found.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.110
People want you to KNOW you’re environmentally
conscious, it’s a status symbol.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.430
A study in American Psychologist looked at
emotional behaviors around environmentalism,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.680
and its pretty easy for us to get swept into
smaller things like recycling plastic bottles,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.340
but denial of environmental problems — like
climate change — will overwhelm any beneficial

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.819
impacts.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.419
Psychologists are working to discover more
ways to help people feel good about helping

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.590
the Earth, but the question is, even though
we know this is part of our evolution as a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.360
social species, and part of a group mentality,
are we actually helping the environment??

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.311
Some argue that this is just conspicuous consumption
under a different name, which doesn’t help

00:03:02.311 --> 00:03:08.409
anything; while others argue that buying greener
products is good, regardless of motivation.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.409
But what do you think?

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.510
If we end up making the world better in order
to keep up with the Joneses is that as good

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:24.639
as making it better because we wanted to in
the first place?
