00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.490
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen: Good morning, I am
Dan Cohen, Executive Director

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.250 position:56%
of the Digital Public Library of
America, and on behalf of the board,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:39.420 position:56%
the staff, and the DPA community, I
want to welcome you to DPAfest 2016!

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.780
[applause] So this marks DPLA's
third birthday and we're thrilled

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.420
to have you here for two days
of workshops, activities,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.310
conversations, and so much more.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.780
The people in this audience really
make DPLAfest and make DPLA itself.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.810
We have so many people
in the audience to thank,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.330
for what really is a
gigantic, collaborative effort

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.810
to maximize access to
our shared culture.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.790
And we've got a particularly great
lineup this year, with attendees

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.860
from across the country and
indeed around the world.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.790
We have people coming in from
Japan-several people from Japan -

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.690
and Europe and other
places to join us,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.110
and from so many different
institutions and fields

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.570
and disciplines and walks of life.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.650
And really out of this diversity

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.430
and great spirit we can
do great things together.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.870
I'm particularly delighted to
be hosted in these wonderful,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.610
treasured spaces in our nation's
capital: the National Archives,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.880
the Smithsonian, and right here
in the Library of Congress.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.730
This space is really terrific.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.030
It's great to be here.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.140
The DPLAfest program
is bigger than ever

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.380
with headline panels taking
place right here, today,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.560
in the Coolidge Auditorium, as well
as smaller focused presentations

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.710
and workshops happening in
other spaces in the Library

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.530
of Congress throughout the day.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.360
Tomorrow will pick up where we
left off at the National Archives

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.610
and the Smithsonian's Riply Center
for even more presentations,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.540 position:56%
workshops, and engaging discussions.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.920
We've got so much to do that I'll
keep my remarks brief this year

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.230
since we have an incredible lineup
of speakers here in the plenary.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.700
First of all, I just want to thank
the Library of Congress so much

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.920
for graciously hosting us today.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.800
And thanks also to
the National Archives

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.360
and the Smithsonian Institution
for hosting us tomorrow.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.930
In a few moments, I'll
invite the heads

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.610 position:56%
of these distinguished organizations
onstage to say a few words

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.230
to kick off this year's DPLAfest.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.270
And we're also joined here
by our essential funders,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.530
public and private, who
really have enabled all

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.020 position:56%
of the work that we've done to date.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.230 position:56%
I also want to highlight the DPLA
board which is up here in the front.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.260
Maybe, DPLA board if
you could stand.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.820
We have both original
members who have been here

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:02.290
from the start [applause] and
we have some new members as well

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.950
who are joining us to provide
new ideas and new energy.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.380
I'm really thrilled that
they could join us as well.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.680
We also have our staff.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.550
They are here, mostly over here.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.510
You will recognize them
by their yellow lanyards

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.720
and frequently having a DPLA shirt.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.800
Maybe if, staff, if you
could just stand up,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.800
just so people can say hello.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.690
[applause] There they
are, our intrepid staff.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.550
If you need any help or
assistance they are here to help.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.730
Also since I have brutally
overworked them the last few days,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.080
if you want to give them
a high-five or a hug,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.450
they would appreciate that.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.780
Thanks so much to the staff.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.470 position:56%
So without further ado, let me give
you some updates and some milestones

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.580
of where the Digital Public
Library of America is.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.000
So first of all, this is
our biggest fest to date,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.800
and we have over 450 registrants.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.620
And so many more hoping to attend.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.780
We had a very long waitlist;
we're very sorry for those

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.080
who are tuning in from afar.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.070
We'll do our best to
inform you via social media.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.470
I'll give my yearly reminder.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.060 position:56%
We paid a lot for the DPLAfest
hashtag, so please use it liberally.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.990
We're also recording sessions,
including this one and those

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.870
that are taking place
in the auditorium

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.020
and those will be available
online after the fest.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.100
We also have the broadest array of
programming to date at a DPLAfest.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.440
We have 65 sessions.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.000
I want to in particular thank
Kenny Whitebloom, our DPLAfest czar

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.900
who has been able to
put this all together

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.880
with the staff featuring 170
speakers over the two days.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.380
We're really thrilled that since
the inaugural DPLAfest in Boston

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.420 position:56%
in 2013, the fest really has become
an exciting event for so many people

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.460
from so many places, so
many cultural institutions,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.670
places in education and law
and technology and libraries

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.720
and archives and museums and
authors and publishers-all

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.150
of them have made DPLAfest a home
and a place to talk to each other

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.480
and a central part of their year.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.630
Let me know talk about the growth
of DPLA and our national network

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.190
which really is at the
heart of what we do.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.480
Our hub's network provides
access to digitized content

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.390
and it's growing at a furious pace.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:31.060
Here's the map from our launch
year in 2013 and you can see

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.890
that we just had fairly
scant coverage.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.960
And here's where we are right now.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.340 position:56%
We have a footprint now with service
hubs in almost half the states

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.140
and many more in process to join
and we're really looking forward

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.650
to completing this map
in the coming years.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.430
It's something that's really
quickly coming into reach.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.410
Many thanks to our funders and
the efforts of our community

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.800
to support full coverage, so that
really any collection of any size

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.860
in the United States has
a way to join the DPLA

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.950
and to distribute their
content nationally,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.650
and, indeed, internationally.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.210
We really are approaching the point

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.640
where we have a true
national library.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.820
Actually, can I have members of
our hubs stand up in the audience

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.200
and let's thank them
all for their work

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.460
in putting together this
national collection.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.220
[applause] We're also
delighted to announce

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.040
that we now have 1900 contributing
institutions to the DPLA.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.040
An amazing number that's

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.640
up from just 500 contributing
institutions at launch.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.630
And this includes institutions
like the Smithsonian,

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.520 position:56%
really large national
institutions with millions of items,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.970
and it includes in the lower right
the Core Sound Water Fowl Museum

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.080
in North Carolina.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.380
[person in audience shouts] Shout

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.180
out to the Core Water Fowl
Museum fans in the audience.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.990
Yes, I put that slide in for you.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.770
It really is a combination
of heterogeneous institutions

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.470
of all sizes working together.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.370
The diversity of our collection
has also become astonishingly rich

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.380
because of these 1900 institutions.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.400 position:56%
We have millions of books-2.5
million books in the collection now.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.800
We have a million photographs.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.330
We have maps, we have artworks, we
have so many other kinds of items

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.370
that we are adding and our growing
audience is increasingly viewing

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.890
and watching and listening to what
we've been able to put together.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.530
It's really terrific,
however I am sorry to report

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.340
that we recently discovered
we are missing one item type:

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.640
our staff did a census

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:43.100
and unfortunately we do not have
any selfies in the collection,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:52.650
so I'm actually going to
rectify that right now.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.190
[laughter] Okay this is the
participatory part here.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.340
Are you all ready?

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.180
Okay, here we go, we're
going to take a selfie.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:10.410
Actually, it's an "usie"
Okay, here we go.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:19.460
[laughter] [inaudible]
Well done, I'm texting this

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:30.770
to our social manager right now
as we speak and this will go out--

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:36.060
synergy here-- in our new Instagram
account which you can follow online

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.210
and so you can follow it there.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.490
I will try to do this
at the same time.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.940
Okay now that we have satisfied
the exhibitionists in the audience,

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.430
I would like to say that if
you are someone who likes

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.870
to keep more private, you're not
a selfie person, we're delighted

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.720
to let you know that DPLA
is moving to https for those

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.790
who want an encrypted
connection to our site.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.170 position:56%
[applause] We're not 100% there yet.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.770
Most of the site works, we have a
very complicated tech environment

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.720 position:56%
with the DPLA, but, if you want,
you can in fact start browsing DPLA,

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.860
dp.la in https rather
than plain old http.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.540
And the DPLA tech team is working
to iron out any remaining problems

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.840
in the next couple of months.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.670
The API will also be secure.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.880
So, shout out, can I have a round
of applause for the tech team?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:41.970
Tech team, stand up,
also for their work.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.270
Thank you.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.570
[applause] Good dancing there,

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.870
director of technology
Mark Matienzo.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:51.570
Last year we kicked off a new
initiative around education,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.180
exploring the ways DPLA's
rich content can be used

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.480
in the classroom.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.360
With enormously helpful funding
from the Witing foundation,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.540
and our educational advisory
committee, and our staffers,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.930
we've been able to
produce primary source sets

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.900
that can easily be
added to any curriculum.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.890
Earlier this week we
announced that we are now

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.980
up to 100 primary source
sets, all free and open,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.260
gathered from those 1900
institutions, the best material

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.470
from across the country all ready
to be dropped into any syllabus,

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.910
any curriculum, start using them.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.350
If I can get a round of applause?

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.960
I know our educational advisory
committee is scattered throughout

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.260
the audience.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.340
And also Frankie Abbot and Samantha
Gibson, our staffers who worked

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.720
so hard on the primary source sets.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:50.930
If I could get them to stand up
and we can thank them as well.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.230
[applause] I'm also delighted,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.670 position:56%
last year at DPLAfest we announced a
partnership with PBS Learning Media

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.810
which reaches so many teachers
and students every year,

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.840
and I'm delighted that those
same primary source sets are now

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.540
available through PBS'
digital media learning site,

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.070 position:56%
pointing to our primary source sets.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.590
They're all there live

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.680
so that people can find
this wonderful content

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.990
where they're looking for it.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.920
Another major initiative that comes

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.160
to fruition today is
our collaborative work

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.460
around rights statements--

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:25.010
that is clearer ways to
express what you can do

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.330
with these millions
of items in the DPLA.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.590
And I should announce that we
now have over 13 million items,

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.720
as of today, in the DPLA.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.260
[applause] Yes, that's great news.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.970
These are large-scale
digital collections,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.790 position:56%
and one of the things we've found is
that it is hard for those teachers

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.820
and students, and the
general public,

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.620
to understand what they can
do with these materials.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.510
Sometimes the rights
statements are not very clear,

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:54.840
and we knew that the same thing
was true among our partners

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.810
at Europeana, who are here today.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.900
They also are making tens of
millions available and there are,

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.070 position:56%
indeed, collections across the globe

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.600
that make library archiving
museum collections available,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.520
but the right statements are
unclear and we have worked so hard

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.570
over the past two years, thanks
to Knight Foundation funding,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.270
to streamline these
rights statements

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.540
and to make them international
and interoperable.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.840
Super clarity.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.850
And we are delighted that
today, I should also note,

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.430
we worked with Creative Commons
who provided advice and DPLA

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.680
and Europeana have launched
RightsStatements.org.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.140
You can go there right
now, [applause] yes,

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.440
worth a round of applause.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:43.790
Again funded by the Knight
Foundation and in collaboration

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.810
with Creative Commons, Kenisland,
and key stakeholders of Europeana

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.240
and DPLA networks, we received so
much help from members of our hubs.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.410
We've created standardized
rights statements that will,

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.250
for the first time, make it easier
for cultural heritage institutions

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.360
and aggregators to
communicate the copyright status

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.850 position:56%
of cultural heritage objects online.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.700
And really what that means,
at the end of the day,

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.520
is for users of our sites,
it will become so much easier

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.470
to understand how they can use
the objects they discover via

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.480
our platforms.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.360
These right statements will cover
three general categories of rights

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.400
around items held in our
cultural heritage institutions.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.990
I just want to highlight
here, Ryan Janelle,

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.320
who did the creative commons
logo, has done, in fact,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.000
our rights statements logos.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.540
And you will see these across
websites in the coming years--

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.810
they'll be very clearly
identifiable.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.420
These statements in fact talk
about three general categories:

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.000
those that are in copyright will
be very clearly labeled as such,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.730
those that are not will
be labeled as such,

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.070
and those where we are a little
unsure about their status will

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.260 position:56%
at least be clearly labeled as
being within that confusing category

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.700
and leave it to the end user
to decide what to make of that.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.720
There are a variety of
statements that come out of this,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.890
in those three categories, and you
can read all about what they mean

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.110
on rightsstatements.org right now.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.410
It is live.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.870
We have a press release going out.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.510
And we're just delighted about
this work we've been able to do

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.260
in concert with Eureopeana
and friends

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.300
at Creative Commons and other hubs.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:28.030 position:56%
So actually if I could get-- we have
members of Europeana who are here

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.550
who worked with us on that.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.420
Harry and Paul and
others and Antoine

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.180
and also Emily Gore led
this effort from DPLA.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.480
[applause] There's Harry.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:47.030
Eureopeana has been such great
friends of DPLA from the start

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.460
and we're really thrilled
that we could work

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.500
with them on RightsStatements.org.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.800
So you can get ready to
see these marks associated

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.530
with cultural heritage
items internationally.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.030
You'll be able to search
collections so much more easily,

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.520
for those items, for
instance, that can be reused.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.270
And they'll take their place, I
think, in a very complementary

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.540
and supplementary way with
the Creative Common marks,

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.160
which of course can only be applied
of course to items you create

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.370
or recent items that Creative
Commons licenses can be applied to.

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.230
So I'm really thrilled about the
launch of RightsStatements.org.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.280
They're also, for the nerds in
the audience, machine-readable.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.590
They have standard URI's.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.970
So this will all be
connected together on the web.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.990
Finally I want to give a brief
update on a really exciting project

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.710
that recently launched and which
fits into DPLA's mission as I put

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.910
at the start as maximizing
access to our shared culture.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.890 position:56%
The Open E-books Initiative
generally supported by the Institute

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:49.060
of Museum and Library Services
and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.370
and in collaboration, really
a strong collaboration

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.610
with our friends at the
New York Public Library,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.660
as well as First Book
and Baker and Taylor.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.910
And with 250 million
dollars in e-book donations

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.150
from award-winning front-list books

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:07.100
from major publishers has
experienced really just tremendous

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.300
uptake in just its inception.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.600
As we announced earlier,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.420
we went over a million access
codes distributed, there's an app

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.010
that kids can download after
their caregivers apply,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.600
and kids in low-income
areas can access thousands

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.640
of books, completely for free.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.350
And they're, in fact,
reading hundreds of thousands

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.620
of books have already been read.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.940
We're excited that these kids are
getting access to these things.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.470
We see on social media
these wonderful photos

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.840
of kids using these things
in Indiana and Anacostia here

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.880
in the D.C. area and other places.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.790
This has been part of the White
House's ConnectEd Iniative

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.550
and the White House has received
hand-written letters like the one

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.050
in the upper right that
really express thanks.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.350
And really at the end of the day,

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:01.090
it's not about distributing access
codes or the technical platform,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.810
although these are
wonderful, incredible things,

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.110
at the end of the day really
this what we all want, right?

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:11.040
We want kids to read wherever and
whenever, whether it's in paperback

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.580
in the backpack or phone
in the back pocket.

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:18.080
If I could have those in the room
who have worked really overtime

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.380
for the past year and a half

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.440
to launch the Open Ebooks
Initiative, if you could stand up.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.100
I particularly want to
highlight our friends

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.660
in the New York Public
Library, Mika and James,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.240
and at DPLA, Rachel and Michelle.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.000
[applause] Simply amazing work
to get these books in the hands

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.610
of millions of kids
across the United States

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.050
to access these wonderful ebooks.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.800
So lots of great news
in the DPLA community.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.990 position:56%
We've got one more bit of good news.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.960
And here, I'd like to
hand the mic to-this going

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.910
to sound a little biblical-but
we have three

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.750
"David"s coming up on onstage now.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.370
[laughter] And I'd like to start

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.780
with the acting Librarian
of Congress, David Mao.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.720
We're so appreciative, again,
to the Library of Congress

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.550
for hosting DPLAfest and for
working so closely with us

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.560
over these next two days
and we're looking forward

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.870
to further work with them.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.530
And here's David to talk
more about our relationship

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:29.230
and the wonderful work the
Library does online and off.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.450
[applause]

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt;David Mao: Good morning, everyone.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.980
And thank you very much, Dan,
for that wonderful update

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.820
on what DPLA has been doing.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.640
I'm very happy to welcome all of
you to the Library of Congress.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.820
We're very honored to be
cohosting this DPLAfest 2016 along

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.600
with our colleagues at the National
Archives and Records Administration

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.370
and the Smithsonian Institution.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.910
DPLA has come a long way
since it launched in 2013,

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.500
as you heard Dan just mention.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.870
The statistics are amazing.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.230
From a few million to now-- over
13 million I think you said,

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.660
in just a few short years.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.630
Clearly DPLA is well on
its way toward its goal

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.170
of bringing together
libraries, archives, and museums,

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.960
and all of the wonderful content
in all of these historical places

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.610
so that they're freely
available for students,

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.990 position:56%
researchers, and the general public.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:27.220
Now as supporters of America's
archives, libraries, and museums,

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.750
many of you already probably know
much about the Library of Congress:

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.600
that we were established by
an Act of Congress in 1800

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.380
as the first federal
cultural institution here

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.230
in the United States; that
it was our third President,

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.330
Thomas Jefferson's, personal
collection, or at least part of it,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.240
that helped seed the collection
here to develop into the library

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.680 position:56%
as we know it today; but many of you
may not know that today the Library

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.810
of Congress has over 162
million items in its collection

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.330
and multiple, multiple
petabytes of digital content.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:03.160 position:56%
And so we are a very large
institution and we welcome you here.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.830 position:56%
Actually, let me see a show of
hands, to the extent that I can see,

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:10.000
how many of you for you this is
the first time that you've been

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.200
to the Library of Congress?

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.720
Okay, that's pretty good.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.760
Actually I'm pleased with that
result because there weren't

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.880
that many and, I guess with a
room full of library, museum,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.810
and archive lovers,
that's to be expected

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.940
and I welcome you back
to the Library.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.090
But for those of you that
have not been to the Library

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.980
of Congress before, I hope
you'll take this opportunity

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.440
to really explore us, get to know
us better, there's time later

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.160
in the schedule for you to take
a tour of this historic building,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.730
which was first opened in 1897.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.580
The Library was originally
in the Capitol,

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.880
it was a very small library,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.310
and then this building
was created in 1897.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.610
But we have three buildings
here on Capitol Hill,

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.550
a facility up in Ft Meade,
Maryland, 25 miles away.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:56.890
We have a state-of-the-art
facility for audiovisual materials

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:58.530
down in Culpeper, Virginia.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.750
And we have six international
offices, so we are delighted

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.370
that you are here and hope that you
will experience the Library while

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.180
you're here and get to know
us and want to come back.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.310
And for those of you that
have been here before,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.560
certainly please feel free to
explore and see some of the changes

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.530
that have taken place and some
of the exhibits that we have

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.890
up since perhaps the last time
that you were here visiting.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:24.550
So you're visiting the Library
at a very historic time.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.040
In the 200, almost 216
years of existence,

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.080
we've only had 13 librarians
of congress.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.540 position:56%
I think all of you probably know
that the last librarian of congress,

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.700
James Billington, now the
librarian of congress emeritus,

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.370
retired last fall and the President
has nominated Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:50.420
currently the CEO [applause]
Dr. Hayden, the current CEO

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:54.930
of the Pratt Library up in
Baltimore to be the next--

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.430
14th Librarian of Congress.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.800
And so we at the Library of
Congress are just delighted

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.150
that the process is moving forward
and we look forward to the future

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.710
of the Library of Congress.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.700 position:56%
I also want to thank very much David
Ferriero for asking the Library

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.380 position:56%
to join in with both the Smithsonian

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.430
and the National Archives
to cohost this event.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.840
The Library of Congress is not
currently an official partner

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.280
with DPLA, though I should
probably say that over 100,000

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.570
of our digitized book files are
currently available through DPLA

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.580
because of our participation
with the HathiTrust,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.100
but I'm happy to say right now
that we are working very closely

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:38.500
with DPLA looking to bring
closer our collaboration

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.560
and we've started initial
discussions with DPLA

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.120
and we look forward to a happy
announcement soon enough.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.860
But today is just the
first step in terms

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.230
of our continuing collaboration.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:55.140
We're very happy to host DPLAfest
here at the Library and I just want

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.820
to welcome you again and
hope you enjoy the rest

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.120
of your time here at the Library.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.920
Thank you.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.030
[applause]

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:05.770
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen: Thanks so much David.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:11.190
And we're looking forward
to working with you as well.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:18.170
Next up is David Ferriero
of the National Archives.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.470
This is the problem.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.370
Sorry, I'm going to
change your names now.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.450
David Ferriero, who's
really just been a friend

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.490
since the planning phase
of DPLA and, in fact,

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:32.200
they hosted the very first
DPLA plenary meeting in 2011.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.500
I was there.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.740
We now have almost two million
items from the National Archives.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.540
Thanks, David.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:42.970
[applause]

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:43.880
&gt;&gt;David Ferriero: I
believe it's more

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.650
than two million, isn't
it, right Pam?

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:48.950
[audience member: Yes] Okay.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.790
So good morning and
welcome to Washington.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:58.170
When was the last time you were
introduced by three Davids?

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.970
I'm really pleased to be cohosting
this event with our colleagues

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.430
from the Library of
Congress and the Smithsonian.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.220
Thanks to all of you in the room.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.370
I'm very proud of what you have
all accomplished and the fact

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.550
that you have joined
us on this journey.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.930
I was in that room on the
Red Cliff campus in October

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.230
of 2010 when DPLA was born.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.570
And a shout out to Bob Darnton,
our spiritual leader [applause]

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:34.610
who convened us, encouraged
us to be bold,

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.790
to think big, and to be inclusive.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:41.570
In my head the "D" in DPLA
will always be "Darnton."

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.690
Thanks, Bob.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.960
I'm so proud of the role the
National Archives has played

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.020 position:56%
in getting us to where we are today.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.050
Today and tomorrow many of
my staff will be presenting

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.840
on their innovative projects ,
including sessions on making gifts,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.900
developing digital
collections for K through 12,

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.980
as well as "gamifying"
transcription.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.280
We'll host a hackathon.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.680
We'll talk about mobile apps,
APIs, and our work with Wikipedia.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.400
These topics that were foreign

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.030
to our agency just a few short
years ago are now critical

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.800
to our mission today.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.980 position:56%
I'm excited to see our agency moving
forward and leading in these areas.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.970
But what I'm most excited about is
the historic partnership you will

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:26.230
see over the next couple of
days among the Smithsonian,

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.870
the Library of Congress,
and the National Archives.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.410
Our three institutions have
been working together not only

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.780
to host this event, but we've
been exploring further ways

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.820
to work together on a
variety of projects.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.250 position:56%
It just makes sense to work together

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:43.160
since we share similar
missions and common challenges.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.550
We can help each other.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:47.770
For example, our three institutions
are developing a project

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.830
to digitize World War I content

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.870
and increase the creative
reuse of these records.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:55.810
Staff from the National
Archives, the Library of Congress

00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:00.950
and the Smithsonian will introduce
a mobile app at this conference

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.650
as well as discuss opportunities

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.040
and challenges we see
in working together.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.970
The point that is clear
to all of us is

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.330
that collaboration is
the path to the future.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.880
We are all on that
path today with all

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.540
of our institutions working
together to make the vision

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.340
of the Digital Public
Library of America a reality.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.570
Open access to the collections
of major cultural, historical,

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:28.800
and research institutions improves
democracy through education

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.950
and furthers the principles
of open government.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.770
We welcome you here today for
the third annual celebration

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.670
and I look forward to welcoming
you to my house tonight.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.970
[applause]

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:49.590
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen: Could we
have the slides back on?

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.890
Thank you!

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.600
Our final David, last,
but certainly not least.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.150
Secretary of the Smithsonian, David
Skorton, who will say a few words

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.920
and of course Smithsonian was
a founding hub of the DPLA

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.830
and we have eight million
items now-I'm worried

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.700
about getting the numbers
wrong-maybe more?

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.940
From the Smithsonian, David
Skorton, thanks so much.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.860
&gt;&gt;David Skorton: Thank you.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.160
What you may not realize,
even Dan may not know,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.770 position:56%
is that the three Davids were
actually triplets separated at birth

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.800
and our organizations
use us interchangeably.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.360 position:56%
If they're not getting along with
one of us they just swap us out, so.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.780
[laughter] I do want to also
want to welcome you on behalf

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:33.990
of the Smithsonian and my other
partners and I'm very very honered

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:38.480
to be doing this with the other two
Davids and the other supporters.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:41.430
A little tiny bit about
the Smithsonian.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:46.000
It was founded in 1846, so
we're celebrating our 170th year

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.030
and we have a collection-your
collection-of 138 million things.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:56.040
127 million of them are biological
specimens of various kinds

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.940
and the remainder run the
gamut, very very broadly.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.670
We also have 19 museums
and galleries,

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:07.040
the National Zoo, and 20 libraries!

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.340
All right!

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.840 position:56%
And I do want to acknowledge the
work of my predecessor, Wayne Cluff,

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.350
who was secretary and also acting
Smithsonian provost Richard Cure,

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:20.020
many of you who may know, who
were there, as David said,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.330
at the start of the DPLA in 2010.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:28.110 position:56%
And both embraced the Smithsonian
mission or the motto of our founder,

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.600
James Smithson, to found an
institution for the increase

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.280
and diffusion of knowledge.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.420
And the diffusion part is
unbelievably important.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:42.850
And 1.25 million objects are
represented from the Smithsonian

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:47.870
in DPLA and many others, and
we've had over 2 million viewers

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.660
of Smithsonian object on the
DPL site, so far as we can tell.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.110
And I want to acknowledge even
though I don't she was able

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:57.240
to be here today, our
wonderful Smithsonian Librarian,

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.690
Nancy Gwynn, many of you may know.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.220
I was at the Library
of Congress recently,

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.970
thanks to David's gracious
invitation, for a tour

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:08.680
and I was just fascinated.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.500
And among many other amazing things
about the Library of Congress,

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.090
they have a collection
of musical instruments,

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.190
and I'm a failed flutist
and so they allowed me

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:23.610
to briefly play a beautiful
Boehm, 19th century flute.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.210
They heard a couple of notes and
they grabbed it away from me.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:31.120
But afterwards I decided to
go online and search the DPLA

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.600
and I found many many interesting
source photos and documents

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.990
and had a little tiny bit
of first-hand experience.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.420
It's enormously exciting.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.260
It's enormously inspiring.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.350
And it's enormously important.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.830
And I hope that the remainder of
the time you have is useful time.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.450
I hope that you enjoy the numerous
variety of things to do here.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:57.020
That you explore all three of our
institutions, and most importantly

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.560
that you have a chance to talk
with each other and push each other

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.050
to make this incredibly important
project even more robust.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:04.850
Thank you and welcome.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:10.280
[applause]

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.170
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen: Wow, thank you
so much to our three hosts.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:17.780
We're just again delighted
to be here and delighted

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.130
to see their collections in person

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.560
and to have conversations
in their spaces.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.340
Thanks so much again to our hosts.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.170
We also want to thank some
sponsoring organizations

00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:31.190
for their support of DPLAfest:
texthelp, Digital Transitions,

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.440
and the Digital Library Federation.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.250
DLF actually sponsored
travel for some attendees

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.810
through cross-pollinator grants.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.000
And Texthelp and Digital
Transitions, I believe,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.740
will have demo space tomorrow
at the National Archives.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:50.060
Finally I'd like to just give a
sincere thanks to our funders.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:54.680 position:56%
They have provided such important
and continued support or our mission

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.390
and everything you've heard so
far this morning and will hear

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.990
about in the next couple of days.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:03.100
Starting with the Alfred
P. Sloan Foundation, IMLS,

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:08.070
the Knight Foundation, the National
Endowment for the Humanities,

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.460
the Whiting Foundation,
the Mellon Foundation,

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.670
anonymous donor, and others.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.990
They've all really worked
together as a community

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.760
to really enable what
we've done as a community.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:25.070
I'd like to begin with Doron Webber
of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:29.210
who will say a few words
about Sloan and their mission.

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:36.100
[applause]

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.940
&gt;&gt;Doron Weber: Thanks, Dan, it's
really a pleasure to be here

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:42.540
and this is almost what a certain
politician would call "yuge."

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.960
You've really got a lot of
people; it's really wonderful

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.270
to see how far this has come.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.280
The Sloan Foundation, we make
grants in science, technology,

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.910
and economic performance and this
is part of a program that we call

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.540
"Universal Access to Knowledge"
which aims to use advances

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.660
in digital information technology
to make the fruits of scientific

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.710
and cultural knowledge available
for the widest public benefit,

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.170
upholding the highest
standards and values.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:12.600
And before I begin with the
funding of DPLA, in the pre-DPLA,

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.990
it's interesting, our first grant
actually went to the Library

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.930
of Congress, which
is hosting us here.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.060
It was in 2004, and as a funder
you know usually I'm pursued pretty

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.330 position:56%
avidly, but in this instance I had
to almost force the grant upon them,

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:26.630
not because they didn't
want the money,

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.790
but because everyone was talking
about digitization at the time,

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:33.720
but there was fair amount of
resistance to how to do it

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.760
and we managed to get
the grant through.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.420
The Internet Archive,
Brewster Kale, gave us machines

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.500
and the Library started digitizing.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.280
And at the time, you know
they had 34 million books,

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.590
I'm not sure how many you have now,

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.850
and I asked so how many-everyone
was talking digitization-how many

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.150
are digitized?

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.450
And the answer was 5,000.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.300
So we gave them the first,

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.930
I think about a hundred thousand
mass digitization effort.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:57.760
I think they them created
the FedLink system

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.660
which continues to this day.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.820
And so that was the beginning
of the pre-DPLA days.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:09.330
The first grant, which
David alluded to, in 2010,

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:13.040 position:56%
Sloan arguably I think we made
about seven to eight million dollars

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.380
in grants but maybe the most
important was 36,388 dollar grant

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:21.530
to the Radcliffe Institute
with Robert Darnton as the P.I.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.420
and that was to bring
everyone together in one room.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.530 position:56%
There was a lot of talk about
starting a national digital library,

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.450
but we had a lot of people who
wouldn't speak to each other,

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:33.850
there were a lot of
conflicting views.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:38.830
We got everyone together
in one room and we talked

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.680
and then I said the equivalent of
locking the doors here and said,

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.580
"we can't leave until we have one
sentence we can all agree on,"

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.220
so we wrote a sentence
together as a group.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.400
I was at the whiteboard
and people would correct me

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.270
and make contributions.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.750
The sentence, I think I remember
it is, "an open distributed network

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.630
of comprehensive online
resources that would draw

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.780 position:56%
on the nation's living heritage from
libraries, universities, archives,

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.420
and museums to educate,
inform, and empower everyone

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.870
in this current and
future generations."

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:16.070
That was the-remembered that!

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.020
[applause] That was the
founding charter of the DPLA

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.320
and that was what we

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.820
in the foundation would
call the deliverables,

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.810
actually had something
concrete for that grant.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.190
And then of course we started
with the Berkman Center.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.940 position:56%
John Palfried did an incredible job.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.590
We gave them a grant, the creative
secretariat of work communities,

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:37.340
six workstreams, wiki,
a website, a listserv,

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:43.700
we started having meetings, OSI
and NEH, I think, came on board,

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.980
Amsterdam, met with Europeana,
I think in June we gave a grant

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:52.700
to Berkley Law Center to work
on the copyright obstacles.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:59.230 position:56%
In October of 2011, David, we kicked
off the plenary, and actually one

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.890
of the funders not listed, so
Sloan put in 2.5 million dollars,

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:05.810
but the Arcadia Fund matched us,
our good friends Peter Baldwin

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.970
and Elizabeth Rousing and we then
had a two year process with a lot

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:14.040
of meetings, a lot of
workshops, a lot of conversations,

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.440
a digitization prototype-building
pilot and a community-building

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.150
because DPLA at the end
really is about community.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:24.860
And we launched in 2013,
within a month it was named one

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.370
of the top 50 websites
by Time Magazine.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:32.800
Sloan made a grant, I
think in December of 2012

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.800
to find an Executive Director,
we had a national search,

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.710
we were fortunate enough
to find Dan Cohen.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.550
And since then, the
Knight Foundation,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.490
IMLS helped build the hubs,

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.260
I think as Dan showed you I think
half the nation that we're hoping

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.850
to complete by 2017, so there's
been remarkable progress and it's

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:55.550
to be applauded and usually I
play the role of cheerleader,

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.120
but I would just encourage
us to do even more.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.420
I think it would be great.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.300
First we need more funders.

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.840
Gates, you know not
to mention names,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.390
very generously gave a
million dollars but Gates is

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.210
about twenty times
bigger than Sloan,

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.740
so if you take our seven million
and multiply it by twenty,

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.280
that's one hundred and
forty million dollars.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.580
139 more to go, Gates.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.970
And we would like similar
contributions

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.120
from good friend Darren Walker
at the Ford Foundation, others,

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.760
I think, we would like to see them
step up and increase the staffing

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.150
and let DPLA really become, I'd
like it to be like Wikipedia.

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.020
We're still the largest funder
of Wikipedia and I'd like it

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.050
to be a model of what
you can do on the web,

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.840
and we'd like to see DPLA
play that kind of role.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.760
We're also very proud of the
progress on the Open E-books.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.290
Dan is to be applauded.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.210
I think Tony Mark Seer of the New
York Public Library played a really

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.390
critical role and we'd like to
continue you that and build that up

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:53.640
and continue to let DPLA play
that kind of leadership role.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.710
So anyway, thank you very much.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.700
You should all feel proud
of your role in this.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.960
We're living in a kind
of very strange time

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.480
and I think the importance
of knowledge and access

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.240
in a safe environment where values
of transparency and universality

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.620
and rationality and truth are
even more important than ever

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.110
so I commend all of
you for your roles.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.910
Thank you very much.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:23.060
[applause]

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:25.060
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen: Thanks so much, Doron.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.000
The National Endowment for the
Humanities has also been there

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.910
from the start as a key funder.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.430 position:56%
I just also want to give a shout out
to their staff as well who have been

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:36.620 position:56%
so incredibly helpful along the way.

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:41.240
Chairman Bill Adams is here to talk
about NEH and the way that our work

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:44.460
with the National Endowment
for the Humanities has helped

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:55.060
to really promote the common good.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.360
So, Bill. [applause]

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.660
&gt;&gt;William Adams: Thank you,
Dan, and good morning, everyone.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.400
What a great turnout.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.810
What a wonderful audience.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.650
So many wonderful friends
of NEH here.

00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:05.780
It's really great to be here and
to just share a couple of thoughts.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.200
It's hard following
the three Davids,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.430
not least because of the object
envy that I'm experiencing.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:16.430 position:56%
All those millions of objects, of
course NEH doesn't have any objects.

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:19.690
We support a lot of
objects with our work.

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:24.320
As some of you know, this is the
50th anniversary of the signing

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.670
of the act that brought
us into existence.

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:33.170
September 29, 1965 the pen of
Lyndon Johnson creating the NEA

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:34.470
and the NEH.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.960
We haven't collected
objects over that time,

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:44.670
but we've given away 5.3 billion
dollars in about 63,000 grants

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:50.090
to humanities institutions and
scholars all across the country.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.340
So, those are our numbers,
not objects,

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.430
but hugely important
numbers in the grand sweep

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:58.940
of the humanities community
of this country.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:03.500
[applause] Thank you.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.440
We share a lot in common with DPLA
and I'm sure that's what brought us

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:11.000 position:56%
in to this very significant project.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.180 position:56%
The values, first of all sharing
the value of demonstrating the value

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:18.570
to the significance of this
cultural heritage of this country,

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:21.150
a hugely important
value to us at any age

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:24.050
and I know for the DPLA as well.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:28.660
And attached closely to that
providing open public access

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:32.590 position:56%
to those extraordinary riches of the
country which are coming together

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.650
in so many interesting
ways in this project

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:39.830
and stimulating collaboration and
partnerships among organizations

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.180
that either own or have
access to the things

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.090
within that extraordinary
cultural heritage.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.850
And last but not least I think
we all understand the growing

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:52.970
importance of the digital universe
with respect to the humanities

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:57.180
and how much of interest is going
on in the humanities community

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:02.100
because these extraordinary,
wonderful digital technology.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.440
As Dan said, we were among the
first funders of this project

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.760
and we're proud to be
so, having given a grant

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.840
of nearly one million dollars
to help create those first four,

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.460
I believe it was, original hubs.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:18.600
A subsequent grant of $250,000
supporting the extension

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.040
of those hubs.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.560
The present is enormously
impressive and to see the progress

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.260
that has been made since
that first grant is terrific.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.530
13 million objects as you've heard.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:34.710
Extraordinary promise for
educational institutions,

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:38.470
particularly the K through 12
universe which I think needs a lot

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:43.810
of help now, especially in
preserving and extending

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:48.350
to students the humanities
legacy of this country.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:52.080
NEH is working to help
advance the important work

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.290
of this important organization
and initiative.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:41:01.000
In 2015 alone we awarded about 3.5
million dollars to 29 projects,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.890
which will lend all of their
digital content to the DPLA portals

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:10.680
so there is more coming by way
of the other grants we're making.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:13.300
Also, we're experiencing
local organizations

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.030
that we're helping are now
able to share very very local

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:20.810
and specific content some of
it private until very recently

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:24.410
through the DPLA portal
that's becoming part

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.430
of the national cultural
legacy as well.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.190
The other interesting
recent development.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:31.510
Some of you know about
our collaboration

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.170
with the Mellon Foundation
in the Open Book project

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:40.610
where we're digitizing important
humanities texts now out of print

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.710 position:56%
and we're helping presses-university
presses,

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:48.500 position:56%
primarily-bring those items back
into print, not into print actually,

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:53.290
into digital format, all of which
will be available through the DPLA.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:58.730 position:56%
This is going to be about 500
titles now out of print will be free

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:02.650
and open to the public through
the DPLA and other resources.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:06.300
In sum, we're very proud of this
investment and what it's done.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:10.260
We're enormously grateful for all
the hard work that's brought it

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.370 position:56%
to this place and we're very excited
about the porspects for the future,

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:19.260
especially as it affects access
and the implications of that access

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.690
for the educational
world and the work

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:23.680
of humanities education
around the country.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.990
Congratulations and
thank you very much.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:32.620
[applause]

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.790
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen: Thanks, again, to NEH.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:39.230
The Institute of Museum and Library
Services has also played just a

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.820
core, instrumental
role and I just want

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.160
to thank them again
and staffers at IMLS.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.450
Maura Marx is I will
mention not only the Director

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.780
of Library Services at IMLS but
she was in fact the director

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.840
of the DPLA secretariat in its
planning phase and really deserves

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.580
so much credit for everything
we've talked about today.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:13.130
Maura, could you come up and
talk about IMLS and their role?

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:14.430
[applause]

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:15.730
&gt;&gt;Maura Marx: Thank you, Dan.

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.030
It is amazing to be
here with all of you.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:21.760
I'm bringing my laptop not because
my memory is not as good as Doran's

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.710
but so that you could see the
battered DPLA sticker there

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.080
on the front of this laptop.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.610
So as you know, IMLS is the
federal funder of libraries

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:35.360
across the country and we have
been proud to support DPLA

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.950
under our national digital platform
priority from the very beginning.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.560
For us the national digital
platform is a way of thinking

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.010
about digital capacity
in the country.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:49.540
It's a way of thinking about
funding technology and services

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.550
that will enable libraries
to leverage

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:54.620
and benefit the work
of other libraries.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:58.300
That we work towards
interoperability rather than silos

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.120
and that we work towards
the broadest possible access

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.760
for all people.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:07.270
So we have been thrilled to support
DPLA's work in two major areas.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:10.690
The first one is the
hydra-in-a-box project.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.540
Which you know, which is a
community repository project

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:19.000
that will enable lots of smaller
institutions to get into DPLA.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.720
So we're thrilled about that.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.940
And the second is the Open E-books
project which you just heard about.

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.750
The evolution of that.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.390
You know, it started as a project,

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.260
it turned into a presidential
initiative to get e-books

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:37.260
into the hands of economically
disadvantaged kids and it was built

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.860
around software developed

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:43.660
by New York Public
Library and funded by IMLS.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:47.090
We think this e-books
work is so important,

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:51.670 position:56%
not only because of the kids it
serves, but because it involves DPLA

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:55.300
in delivering in-copyright content.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:02.160
DPLA was founded, as we've heard in
October 2010, in part in response

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.400
to unresolved copyright questions.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.480
It was founded on the idea that
the policy and legal environment

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:15.610
in this country had not kept pace
with developments in technology

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:20.810
and in content and that if we had
a community developed blueprint

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:24.660
for a national strategy, we
could create a living, breathing,

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:29.840
all-encompassing digital library
that did not stop at 1923.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.240
So it is awe-inspiring to
stand here today and celebrate

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.920
with you the tremendous progress

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.910
that DPLA has made in
the last five years.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:42.420
1900 institutions-that is
really, that is truly awesome.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.620
To have in sight a DPLA

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:49.390
that encompasses all 50 states
is just truly breathtaking.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.900
It's moving to be here in
the Library of Congress

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.470
as we await confirmation
of a new Librarian

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:58.800
who will surely face new challenges
and opportunities in the discussion

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.000
around copyright and copyright law.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.410
And we're proud to work with
Sloan, with Knight, with NEH,

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:09.470
hopefully with many new funders,
as you continue working towards

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.080
that goal of a truly universal
library that will educate,

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.570
inform and empower all people.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.870
Thank you so much, DPLA.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:27.280
Can't wait for the next two days.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.580
[applause]

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.880
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen: That is a nice
looking battered sticker there.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.270
It's like an old punk
sticker or something.

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.470
Finally, George Martinez
of the Knight Foundation.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:39.000
I mentioned earlier the launch
of the RightsStatements.org,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.100
our new international,
interoperable,

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.010
clear rights statement
around library,

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:44.610
archive, and museum content.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:47.720
Knight has not only funded
that, but funded hubs expansion

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:51.660
and has also funded some
exploratory work that we're doing

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.760
around newspapers, which
we're hoping to tell you more

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.030
about in the coming
months and years.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:07.100
George, if you could come up?

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.400
[applause]

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.700
&gt;&gt;George Martinez: Good
morning, everybody.

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.250
I'm the chief technology
officer at Knight Foundation.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:13.550
I've also had the privilege

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:17.550
of spearheading our universal
access in library work.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.670
Now Knight Foundation is a national
organization with deep local roots

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:25.450
in 26 communities that had
Knight newspapers at the time

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:30.550
of the passing of our last
funder, James Landon Knight.

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:34.160
Along with his older brother, John,
who preferred to be called Jack,

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.690
the brothers took a small
bankrupt newspaper from Akron,

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:41.110
Ohio and turned it into what was
the largest American newspaper

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:43.350
and media in the seventies.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:45.880
They did this by emphasizing
quality journalism,

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.210
smart business practices,
and good old horse trading.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:51.670
And by horse trading I mean,

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.320
I think there was actually
a thoroughbred involved

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.980
in the acquisition of one of
the newspapers in Kentucky.

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:57.930
[laughter] But that's a
story for a different time.

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:01.370
Now Jim ran the money-side
of things out of Miami

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:06.090
and Jack was a consummate newsman,
who, out of office in Akron,

00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.850
was the only publisher
for all of the papers

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:11.080
until his passing in 1981.

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.890
They were what we would call today
fast followers of innovation,

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:16.750
always willing to use
new technologies

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:20.320
that would help them run this
disperse empire that went

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.550
from coast to coast in the US.

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:27.400 position:56%
Telephone, teletype fax, satellites,
you name it, they tried it.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.980
Sometimes they didn't work,

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:32.480
sometimes their ideas were just
a little bit ahead of their time,

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:35.020
but they weren't afraid to try.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:37.500
Now, profits and losses are
the same, wherever you are

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:43.040
in the United States, but Knight
brothers didn't want all their

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.970 position:56%
newspapers to look exactly the same.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:47.310
They didn't want the
Detroit Free Press to look

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:50.000
like the Akron Journal just
because they were all involved

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.980
in the automotive industry

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.670
or that the Philadelphia Inquirer
should mirror the Miami Herald

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.560
because they had a lot of tourism.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.000
Jack emphasized, no
better yet he demanded

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.710
that each paper reflect
unique character and flavor

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:07.890
of their communities
that they were in.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:10.400
From their writings and speeches
we know that they believe

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.610
that democracy thrives
only when the people

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:16.440
in those communities are
informed and engaged.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.630
And this also happens to
be our mission statement,

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.520
creating informed and
engaged communities.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.900
It's because of this
emphasis on creating informed

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.770
and engaged communities that
Knight started funding in the areas

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.930
of universal access and libraries.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:35.080
And, you know, when you look
at it, what institutions

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.420
in our communities today
really says informed

00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.300
and engaged better than
the public library?

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.660
It's the most democratic

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:44.750
and egalitarian institution
we have anywhere.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:48.420
The best description I ever heard
at one of these conferences was

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.550
that libraries are
democracies best kept promise.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:55.280
I think that's true today
and that's been true forever.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.670
So, I gave you this little brief
history of Knight Foundation

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.750
so that you can really
understand why the DPLA

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:05.050
and the grant proposals they
submitted to us resonate

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:07.510
so strongly at Knight Foundation.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:11.110
The original grant for the core
infrastructure and hubs reminded us

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:15.230
of how the Knights successfully
ran their newspaper empire.

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.390
With the hubs leveraging
what was unique to each state

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.380
or regional partner and the core
infrastructure brining it all

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:25.540
together, while creating a useful
platform to access the information

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:30.240
or create new versions of the
content on that information.

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:33.000
Also DPLA has not been
afraid to experiment

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.640
and tackle difficult areas.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.940
Things like digital
rights and copyright,

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.230
issues that Dan alluded to.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:43.940
They've also not hesitated to reach
out and collaborate with colleagues

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.990
in Europe and Australia,
which you will hear more

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:49.320
about during this next two days.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.960
And, near and dear to
our journalistic roots,

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:56.400
is DPLA's exploration of how to
bring born-digital newspapers

00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.400
and content into the fold and make
sure that these aren't unavailable

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:03.190
or lost to future generations.

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:05.910
And finally and selfishly to
me as the relationship manager

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:10.110
for this grant, the success of the
original hubs has created demand

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:13.830 position:56%
to expand into more of this country.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:17.500
So as I look out today and see
all of you in this audience,

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.100
I'm really heartened that
all the new faces here

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:25.410
that I see joining the faces I've
seen before seems to be growing.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:29.520
And, you know, for me as a
funder, I've got the easy part.

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.100
Giving away the money might sound
difficult, but it's not that hard.

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:38.150
[laughter] Doron might
argue with me.

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:40.590
It's you, and the DPLA
staff, and all the folks

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:44.190 position:56%
that have been involved in directing
the work of the DPLA over the years

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:48.260
that really have the difficult
part and are making the impact.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.400
So I encourage you to
continue supporting

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.200
and contributing this
important effort.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.180 position:56%
We're all grateful for everything
you're doing, and I hope to see more

00:51:56.180 --> 00:52:05.880
of you at the next DPLAfest.

00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:07.180
Thank you.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:08.480
[applause]

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.780
&gt;&gt;Dan Cohen: Thank you George,
and the Knight Foundation

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.080
and to all of our funders.

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.380
We have many in the room as well

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.950
and we should thank them
all for their support.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:17.650
Are you ready to fest?

00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:20.660
Here we go.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:24.880
Okay. Before we finish
up, just a few bits

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:27.450
of housekeeping which
will be important.

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:29.880
We have a number of
fabulous panels today.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.410
You can see the chairs here.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:34.130
They will soon be filled
with wonderful people.

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:39.540 position:56%
And so here in the Coolidge
Auditorium all day we will have some

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.120
headline sessions on
the future of libraries,

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.950
authorship in the digital age,
technology trends in libraries,

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:49.750
just to name a few, and we also
of course have smaller sessions

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.480
that you can see at
least electronically

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:56.600
or on the beautifully printed
program in smaller venues.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:01.790
We are really packed to the gills
here, we have over 450 people,

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:04.640
and so we're going to do our
best to accommodate everyone,

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.840
and so rooms will be a little
bit first come, first serve.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:10.790
So if you for some reason are
stacked up or outside the door

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.640 position:56%
in one of the smaller rooms, you
can of course always head back here.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:18.310
There'll be seats here for you to
use and you won't be disappointed

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:20.480
with any of the conversations
in this room.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.750
Now today we're at the
Library of Congress,

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:24.180 position:56%
but we're actually in two buildings.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:28.000
This is the Jefferson building,
as David Mao noticed, mentioned.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.080
You'll also notice in your program
that there are also programs

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.770
in the Madison Building
which is across the street.

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:40.460
Now there is a tunnel between the
two buildings, which is really fun.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.390 position:56%
If you've never been in the tunnel
between the buildings of the Library

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.180
of Congress, I encourage
you to take it.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.750
There will be signage and in
fact we have three Library

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:50.960
of Congress staffers
who will now wave.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.530
Maybe if we could life the
lights just for a second.

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:56.190
So there's one in the back there.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:54:00.550
So there will be Library of
Congress...yeah, there we go.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:03.460
Oh, and down here, yes!

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:08.590
So look for your friendly Library
of Congress staffers to connect you

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:12.500
to the tunnel if you need to get
over to the Madison Building.

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:18.010
Again, all event staffers, I'm
not wearing my badge right now,

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.820
but all DPLA staffers and Library

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.820
of Congress staffers will be
wearing the yellow lanyards,

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:27.630
so look for those lanyards
if you need any help.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:30.490
One note, also about lanyards.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:34.380
We provided red lanyards for those
who do not wish to be photographed,

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.870
so as you can see we have a
professional photographer here.

00:54:37.870 --> 00:54:40.570
Other people may be taking
photographs, so just keep in mind

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.710
if some folks do not
like to be photographed,

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:45.030
they're wearing the red lanyards.

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:50.960
We have box lunches distributed
from the Great Hall here

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.010
in the Jefferson Building
and Madison Hall if you're

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:55.310
over in the Madison Building.

00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:57.510 position:56%
We're going to do our best to divide

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.540
up those lunches in
those two places.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.110
Do your best to be
wherever you want to be

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:04.930
in the afternoon-the
first afternoon session.

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:07.950
If you could pick up a lunch
there that would help us insure

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:11.710
that we have enough people
in both places as well.

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.840
David mentioned it's
a great opportunity

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.490
to tour these wonderful buildings,

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:19.920
to get to know really all
your federal institutions

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.220
over the next two days.

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:25.650
From 12 to 2 today, so over
the lunchtime two hours,

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:30.020
there'll be five different stations
around the Library of Congress,

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.870
here in the building: docent
stories, background information,

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:37.080
architectural details, it's in a
really truly incredible building.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.910
If you've never had a
tour, I encourage you

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:42.650
to build your own here
in the building.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:46.430
The Library of Congress shop is
offering a ten percent discount

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:47.990
at their shop.

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:50.570
I spoke to a Library of
Congress staffer last night.

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:53.520
Evidently their socks
are best sellers.

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.820
So I have not checked out the
Library of Congress socks,

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.710
but I have heard that they are
truly incredible and bring revenue

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:02.300
into the Library of
Congress that they can use

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.410
to digitize more content
that will end up in the DPLA

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:06.890
as part of our partnership.

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:10.470
[laughter] So I encourage
you to sock it up

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:14.390
and get whatever else you
want, again with your lanyard

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:18.110
of any color you'll be able
to get a discount there.

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:19.410
Reception.

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:20.860
We're going to have
an amazing reception

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:26.010
in David Ferriero's home tonight
in the Library of Congress-Library

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.220
of Archives-National
Archives building.

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:32.110
[laughter] At 6:30.

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:33.410
Stay with me.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:34.710
There'll be hor'doeuvres,
there'll be drinks,

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:38.780
there'll be special events,
there's going to be trivia contest,

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:42.410
there'll be tours of the
Amending America exhibition

00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:44.950
and our recovering the
classics popup gallery.

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:48.790
These are wonderful public domain
books that have been reinvisioned,

00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:50.820
covers reinvisioned by artists.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:54.010
Terrific. Okay you need to
be sure, this is important,

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:57.640
to enter via the special
events entrance tonight

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:02.120
on Constitution Avenue
between 9th and 7th street.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:05.470
The special events entrance I
believe is closer to 7th street.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:08.970
Here's the key part: please
don't forget your badge.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:10.270
Bring your badge.

00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:12.650
Wear your badge to
the special event.

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:14.040
Bring your name badge.

00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:19.000 position:56%
No number of Davids will help you
if you do not bring your name badge.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.810
Tomorrow we will once again
be in the National Archives

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:24.440
for the second day and the
Smithsonian Ripley Center.

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.940
Two wonderful places to be for
the second day of the fest.

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:29.900 position:56%
There will not be a kickoff session,

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.380
I'm sorry this is the most
you'll hear from me and,

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:36.200
like there was today, you'll
show up to where you want to go,

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.030
again, check your schedule.

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:41.210 position:56%
Breakfast and lunch again, breakfast
and lunch will be available

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:44.450
at both locations, both the
Smithsonian Ripley Center

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:46.530
and the National Archives.

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:48.630 position:56%
If you want to walk between the two,

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:51.400
it is a beautiful walk
across the mall.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.920
We included a map in your packet,
so you might want to review that.

00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:01.730 position:56%
Finally we'll have a wrap-up session
at the McGowan theatre at 3:15pm

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:03.200
in the National Archives building.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.440
And it's just going to be
a brief wrap-up session,

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.090
we'll talk about some of the
great things that have happened

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:10.770
over the past few days,
some wonderful outcomes.

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:12.980
There's hackathons going
on, there's all kinds

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.790
of wonderful conversations.

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:17.580
Again we hope to see
you all there tomorrow

00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:20.340
at 3:15 tomorrow afternoon
to wrap up.

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:26.050
Finally, once again, there it is,
the wonderful DPLAfest hashtag.

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:29.440
Use it in your favorite
social media app.

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.940 position:56%
We encourage everyone to live tweet.

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.500
For those who are not here,

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:36.050
we're excited to capture the
conversations, the presentations,

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:37.850
and just the fun that we're
all going to have together

00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:39.910
over the next couple of days.

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:41.210
So that's it.

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:43.980
Have a wonderful time
at DPLAfest 2016.

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:45.810
We're so delighted you're here.

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:48.110
And enjoy.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:59:03.360
[applause] This has
been a presentation

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.300
of the Library of Congress.
