00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.210
- I have been working on
the US history content here

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.790
for more than two years now.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.900
And we have a team of experts who've been

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.890
in the classroom for many years,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.570
who have advanced degrees in US history,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.030
who really rigorously write, tape,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.010
and edit each other's work.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.960
And I think it would be kind of,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.770
I would judge it as like
a day's worth of class.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.560
Everything that we've done
on the Khan Academy website

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.550
meets the AP requirements.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.420
So teachers can feel confident

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.460
that when they send their students

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.680
to watch a video or read an article

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.170
or practice with an
exercise on Khan Academy,

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.180
that students are taking away
the key learning objectives

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.440
that they should get for the AP exam.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.800
- [Instructor] It's a frequent
misconception that people

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.530
in this time period thought
that the world was flat.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.090
- We really wanted to make this material

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.940
approachable and fun.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.430
And so throughout, I
think, students will see

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.270
a real enthusiasm for the
material and a sense of humor,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.240
so that it's not just
reading a history textbook.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.073
- [Instructor] So I've brought you here

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:11.320
to talk about the Gilded Age,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.930
which is one of my favorite
eras of American history.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.870
- [Man] Because everything
was great and covered in gold?

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.680
- It's really interacting with some

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.970
of the big questions of history,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.520
and having an opportunity to
explore those with enthusiasm.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.670
- [Instructor] No,
because it is the only era

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.230
of American history I can think of

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.477
that has a sarcastic name.

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:32.310
(man laughs)

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.340
- Because it is fun.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.130
We hope to give students that sense

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.350
that history is not a boring subject.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.440
It's really fun.
