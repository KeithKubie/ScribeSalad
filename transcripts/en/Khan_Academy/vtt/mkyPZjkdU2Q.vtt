00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.670
- [Instructor] So we've already talked

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.790
about the general idea, the
thesis that if the return

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.350
on capital is greater than
the growth of an economy,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.990
that that could lead to inequality,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.520
although we showed a case where,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.740
depending on the circumstances
with the right numbers,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.000
that's not necessarily going to happen.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.270
But what I want to do in this video is

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.510
to think critically a little bit

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.040
about some of the other
data from the book.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.370
And once again, my point right
over here is not to support

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.510
or go against the ideas in the book,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.610
but really just give you tools
for thinking a little bit

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.260
more critically about all of these ideas.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.990
And what's really neat, as I mentioned

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.240
in previous videos, is Piketty makes all

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.810
of his data available, all
of his charts available,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.490
at this website right over there.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.270
Now this is neat,
because this shows us the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930
after tax rate of return
versus growth rate

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.720
at the world level, and
you don't see many charts

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.270
that start at the year zero

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.630
and go over the course of 2,000 years.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.410
And so, you can imagine that the numbers

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.260
back here are estimates, but let's just go

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.540
with them for the sake of argument.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.187
So what it shows here is
that the annual return,

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.320
or rate of growth, so this
is the pure return of capital

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.230
after tax and capital
losses, so after, well,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.760
whatever taxes and any losses in the value

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.080
of the capital or whatever
else, that's that here.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.790
And then this is the growth
rate of world output.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.130
And you see, for most
of at least the last few

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.460
thousand years of human history, and this,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.880
the horizontal axis here
isn't completely at scale.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.850
From here to here is, that's,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.080
from here to here gets us almost, well,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.010
almost 1,500 years, while
from here to here is,

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.990
gets us about 50, gets us about 50 years.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.160
So it's not completely at scale,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.030
but you see that for
most of human history,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.380
the annual rate, the
growth of the economy,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.740
was much smaller than
the return on capital.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.510
And once again, these
are, especially back here,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.200
these are just estimates, especially based

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.310
on feudal times and whatever else.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.540
But on some level, they
could be believable,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.330
because in feudal times,
and when you had kings

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.810
and all of that, you had
a lot of coercive power

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.500
by the feudal lords or the
kings and whoever else.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.785
They could, by force, force
people to kind of work

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:16.470
on their fields or whatever else.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.680
But if we take these numbers,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.780
we then see something interesting happens

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.370
as we go into the early 20th century.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.150
The return, the after tax
rate, the after tax return

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.380
on capital drops below, drops below,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.870
the rate of economic
growth of the economy.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.707
So we see that right over here,

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:37.580
and this is over huge swaths of time.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.470
Even this data point,
this is one data point

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.830
that represents, this represents
37 years right over here.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.450
And then we have another data point

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.490
that represents the next, the next,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.830
what is this, the next
62 years right over that.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.160
And this is kind of the world
that most of us kinda know.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.430
This is modern times right over here,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.240
where the rate of economic growth,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.120
the rate of world output has been larger

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120
than the rate of return
on capital after taxes.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.370
Now, when you first
just look at this chart,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.220
you say, oh my god, look,
they're gonna cross again.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.530
Maybe that means we're
going back to the Gilded Age

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.450
or feudal times or whatever else.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.950
But you have to very,
very, very careful here.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.698
Everything after this point is conjecture.

00:03:22.698 --> 00:03:26.040
This is a model, it might
happen or it might not.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.820
We could see something very different.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.330
So let me make it very,
let me make it very clear.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.810
All of, let me do this in another color,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.810
one that's, so all of this that I'm,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.900
whoops, that's not another color.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.240
All of this that I'm
highlighting in yellow,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.920
this over here is all conjecture.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.460
You could go the other
way, it is possible.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.240
It's completely possible
that you have a reality,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.980
let me get my, where
this continues the trend

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.740
that it's going on, where this,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.910
where world growth kinda does this.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.190
Actually, let me do, and then it goes,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.860
so it goes from here, and maybe
it does something like this.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.400
So it's very important
to realize that this kind

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.100
of intersection right over
here, this is a projection.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.730
And you should look at his assumptions,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.610
you should decide for
yourself on whether you think

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.720
that this projection makes sense.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.490
Because this is what is saying that hey,

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.490
this delta between r and g,
that g is greater than r,

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.160
this makes it look like hey, it's over.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.130
But maybe it's not over,
maybe when we average

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.910
over the next, if we
average over the next,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.380
oh what is this going to be over,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.413
if we average over the next 38 years,

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.510
then maybe we'd get something like this.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.690
And obviously, we're at
just the very beginning

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.830
of this interval, so
there's not a lot to go on.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.120
And that is also assuming,
even if this does happen,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.340
that is still assuming this relationship

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.453
that r greater than g leads to inequality,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.350
which in extreme forms
could eventually lead

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.700
to some form of a Gilded Age
or kind of dynastic wealth,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.340
which could hurt innovation
or which could even hurt,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.340
let me write that down,
dynastic wealth, Gilded Age,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.470
which maybe hurts, hurts,
hurts meritocracy, meritocracy,

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.330
or even potentially
innovation, innovation,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.450
or the economy as a whole if you have less

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.630
of a middle class and people
with purchasing powers.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:32.740
But there's a lot of arrows here,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.670
and you need to decide for
yourself which parts of these,

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.350
which parts of this
connection you agree with

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.410
or disagree with, or
depending on the circumstances

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.153
or the evidence, you are more
inclined to believe or not.
