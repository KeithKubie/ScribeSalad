00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.720
Our initial impulse might be to pick up on
a current event, some detail of the environment

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.150
or a few impressive things about our careers.
But if a date is at heart an audition for

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.210
the emotional capacities required for the
success of a long-term relationship, the real

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.050
purpose of conversation must be to try to
understand the deep self of the other person.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.950
We know we will be doing well if, at a certain
point, our date reflects that they’ve never

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.910
been asked so many psychologically-weighty
questions – and are we perhaps some sort

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.960
of psychotherapist in training…? Such comments
playfully reflect how comparatively surface

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.519
most chat ends up being and how unnerving
and yet delightful it can be to sense that

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:02.350
for once the focus of another’s interest
is firmly on the details of our souls. This

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.979
is some of what we might ask in an attempt
to take the measure of another’s deeper

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.520
self: – What has made you cry in recent
times? We’re not only concerned with what

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.439
goes well for them; we’re accepting of,
and curious about their reversals. We know

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.110
there are painful sides of life for everyone,
we’re not going to insist on levity or deny

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.170
them the right to grieve. We’ll also be
sure to tell them in turn what brings tears

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.259
to our eyes.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.510
– What was difficult in your childhood?
Without anyone meaning for this to happen,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.200
parents inevitably bruise and damage their
children. With a light touch, we’re trying

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.700
to get a sense of their particular take on
the drama of growing up. All of us end up

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.189
a little distorted by our experiences: over-vigilant
or too relaxed; too concerned with money or

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:10.390
overly indifferent to material goods; frightened
of sex or excessively decadent. They won’t

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.599
be unique in having been messed up, we’re
clear on this score, but their disturbances

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.940
will be fascinatingly specific to them. We’re
signalling that understanding their child

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.110
self will be vital to grasping how they behave
and who they are as adults. It will also lay

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.269
down a reserve of compassion at moments when
their adult selves are overwhelmed by the

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:43.830
dynamics of the past. – What do you regret?
Our lives are crucially defined by the roads

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.550
that weren’t taken, by the choices we bungled,
by the situations we ruminate upon in the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.900
early hours. Because there is such a risk
of humiliation in revealing where we messed

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.190
up, if we can be a patient and compassionate
listener, we will be doing something for our

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.459
date that almost no one has ever done for
them – at least outside of a professional

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.870
therapeutic context. We will be gifting them
the honour of feeling heard for their mistakes

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.519
and of being reassured that these are just
an inevitable feature of being human; it will

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.960
be a luxury far greater than being taken to
a fancy restaurant or roof-top bar.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.930
Fourthly – To whom would you like to go back and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.239
apologise? An associated enquiry, this one
focuses on the guilt we accumulate as we stumble

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.099
through our lives. It’s a question that
both leaves room for confession – and offers

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:49.360
atonement. – What would you want someone
to forgive you for? Gently, we’re probing

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.379
at what they know is tricky in their own characters.
We aren’t brutally asking what is wrong

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.879
with them (they’d take offence). We’re
inviting them to admit to one or two ways

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.971
in which they have noticed that they can cause
difficulties for others. We’ll need to have

00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:10.319
some examples of our own follies to confess
to straight after.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.769
– What have your exes not understood about

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.710
you? Their past relationships are the vital
repositories of clues as to the success of

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:28.450
their future ones. We’re wondering how well
they can pinpoint what went wrong and whether

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.480
failure has provided them with an occasion
to learn rather than merely lament or blame.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.150
– What would you ideally want to tell your
mother? And your father? There might be tears

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.670
at the thought. There can be so much buried
sorrow in the history we share with two people

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.670
on earth we tend to love and hate in almost
equal measure – and owe so much to. We will

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.460
listen to what parents were too brittle, too
defensive or too proud to hear. It’ll be

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:09.120
everything that never comes out at family
gatherings, but so badly needs to be aired.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.890
– In what ways do you feel like a bit of
an impostor at work? We’re normalising that

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.880
we all invariably feel like we don’t entirely
measure up to what is expected of us professionally.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.900
We’re providing a refuge for a sense of
incompetence that we take such pains to hide

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.410
from the world in normal circumstances. We’re
inviting our date, at last, to let down their

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.410
guard. Having exchanged these questions, and
others like them, over many hours, we may

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.460
feel something odd starting to happen: we
may sense ourselves falling a little in love.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.050
The process isn’t mysterious. It’s just
that we’re getting to know one another’s

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.970
deeper selves, with all the longings, errors,
terrors, regrets, weaknesses and fears involved.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.750
There is simply nothing more seductive than
this kind of mutual self-revelation, love

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.090
being in large part the gratitude we register
when we feel accepted and seen – as well

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.470
as the compassion we experience when another
person lets down their defences and trusts

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.520
at last that someone is going to be kind to them.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.240
Great dates are made up of great conversations.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.960
