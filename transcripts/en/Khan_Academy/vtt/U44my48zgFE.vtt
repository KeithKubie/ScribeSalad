00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.585
I have a square here divided
into one, two, three, four,

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:08.530
five, six, seven, eight,
nine equal sections.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.110
And we've already seen that
if we were to shade in one

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.790
of these sections, if we were
to select one of these sections,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.000
let's say the middle
one right over here,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.560
this is one out of the
nine equal sections.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.230
So if someone said, what
fraction of the whole

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.180
does this purple
square represent?

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.150
Well, you would say, well, that
represents 1/9 of the whole.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.040
This thing right over
here represents 1/9.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.760
Now what would happen if we
shaded in more than that?

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.820
So let's say we shaded in this
one and this one, let me shade

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.970
it in a little bit better.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.210
And this one and this
one right over here.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.550
Now what fraction of the
whole have we shaded in?

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.640
Well, each of these, we've
already seen, each of these

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.630
represent 1/9.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.890
So that's 1/9, that's 1/9.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.440
When I say 1/9, I
could also say a ninth.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.770
So this is 1/9 or a
ninth, so each of these

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.480
represents a ninth.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.720
But how many of these
ninths do we have shaded in?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.470
Well we have one, two,
three, four shaded in.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.630
So now we have a total
of 4/9 shaded it.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.900
4 of the 9 equal
sections are shaded in.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.460
So 4/9 of the
whole is shaded in.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.550
Now let's make things a
little bit more interesting.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.280
Let's shade in.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.350
So here I have five
equal sections.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.790
Let me write this down.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.110
I have five equal sections.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.250
And let me shade
in five of them.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.200
So one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.100
We already know that each
of these sections, each

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.610
of these situated in
sections represent 1/5.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.980
So 1/5, another way of saying
that is a fifth, is 1/5.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.980
But now how much do
I have shaded in?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.580
Well I have five out of the
five equal sections shaded,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.190
or I have 5/5 shaded in.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.690
And you might be
saying, wait, wait,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.420
if I gave five out of the
five equal sections shaded in,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.350
if I have 5/5 shaded in, I've
got the whole thing shaded in.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.250
And you would be
absolutely right.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.230
5/5 is equal to the whole.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.654
Now what I want you to
do is pause this video

00:02:16.654 --> 00:02:18.070
and write down on
a piece of paper

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.810
or at least think
in your head, what

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.660
fraction of each of these
wholes is shaded in?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.320
So let's go to this first one.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.190
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six equal sections.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.280
And we see that one, two,
three, four are shaded in.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.590
So 4/6 of this
figure is shaded in.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.630
Let's go over here.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.350
We have one, two, three,
four, five equal sections.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.500
And one, two, three,
four are shaded in.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.600
So here, 4/5 of this
circle is shaded in.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.170
Now in this figure, I have two
equal sections and both of them

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.770
are shaded in.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.690
And this we would say two halves
of this figure are shaded in.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.610
And once again, if two
halves are shaded in,

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.050
that means everything
is shaded in,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.619
that this represents a whole.

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.160
Now this one right
over here it might

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.250
be tempting to say, I
have one, two, three,

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.140
four sections and
one, two, three

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.280
have been shaded in so
maybe the red represents

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.940
3/4 of the figure.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.450
But remember, the sections
have to be equal sections.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.989
And this red section
is way bigger.

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.280
It actually looks like it's
bigger than the other three

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.320
combined.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.110
So you do not have four
equal sections here.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.110
So at least based
on how it's drawn,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.690
you can't say that 3/4
is actually filled in.
