7 Movie Plots That Make Absolutely No Sense

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.040
Intro
Plot Holes or unexplained questions are nothing

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.230
new to Hollywood blockbuster, but sometimes,
a movie's logic problems go a lot deeper than

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.610
dangling plot threads.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.160
Sometimes, the movie itself doesn't make sense,
since it's plot holes are so obvious, audiences

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.990
are guaranteed to wonder if the filmmakers
are trying to trick them.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.540
Here are Screen Rant's 7 Movie Plots That
Make Absolutely No Sense.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.590
Frozen
As Disney movies go, the twist of Frozen was

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.210
actually surprising, when the gentlemanly
Prince Hans is revealed as the villain in

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.310
disguise, only wanting to marry Princess Anna
so he could take out the Queen, and rule the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.550
country of Arendelle himself.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.620
There's one problem, though - actually, TWO.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.160
For starters, he decides to charge Queen Elsa
with treason - a challenge, since she can't

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.690
really commit a crime against the state, since
she's the Queen - she is the state.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.360
But his plan to become king makes zero sense:
if Elsa and Anna both died, he wouldn't become

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.630
king, the throne would go to the next living
blood relative.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.690
Furious Seven
The plot of the seventh Furious adventure

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.850
is far-fetched to begin with, but it follows
one simple idea: after the villain, Deckard

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.540
Shaw, kills one of Dom's crew and puts his
sister's family in danger, his team sets out

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.450
to track him down, and stop him for good.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.590
But to find him, they need a sophisticated
program called God's Eye to search for his

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.250
face on every camera in the world.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.960
The team heads off on a dangerous mission
to get the program - but is interrupted by

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.360
Shaw, attacking the team that's trying to
attack him.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.410
You would think the crew would slam on the
brakes having found their man, but they don't.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.560
He stays hot on their heels for the rest of
the movie, with the stars never realizing

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.130
they should just stop moving.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.190
Armageddon
When an asteroid the size of Texas is found

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.220
flying towards Earth, NASA gets creative,
hiring a deep sea drilling crew to fly up

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.260
to the space rock, and drill an explosive
into its core.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.880
It's a nightmare for NASA, having to turn
a group of roughnecks into astronauts in a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.900
matter of days.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.730
But star Ben Affleck asked director Michael
Bay the same question we keep wondering: Why

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.009
wouldn't NASA just get the crew to teach their
astronauts to drill, safely, one an everyday

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.009
rig?

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.260
Bay just told him to shut up, since he'd also
realized the movie doesn't make a lick of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.290
sense.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.290
The Matrix
Morpheus makes it clear that in the world

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.019
of The Matrix, the agents are the greatest
threat, since every person in the system can

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.450
be taken over by them in a second.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.999
It begs the question: when the agents realized
Morpheus was trying to contact Neo, they planted

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.319
a tracker into his stomach.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.450
A tracker they never follow, before or after
it's removed.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.109
They probably should have, since it would've
led them to their enemies' secret hideout.

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.109
Why didn't they?

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.689
It's not like they have other hobbies or a
need to sleep, so the fact that they just

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:41.169
let Neo be recruited - then spend the rest
of the movie trying to kill him and his friends

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:43.430
- is downright cheating on the Wachowskis'
part.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.660
And even with two sequels, there's no explanation
other than it being an old fashioned gaping

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.340
plot hole.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.620
Star Wars
This space Saga all started when a boy named

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.480
Luke Skywalker's learned that he was actually
the son of a great hero, who had fallen to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.809
become one of the galaxy's greatest villains.

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.579
Things get worse when his identity is revealed,
but think for a second: Obi-Wan went to the

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.849
trouble of hiding Luke.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.450
But apparently, made sure that his aunt and
uncle, who Vader had met, would still call

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.680
him by his father's last name.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.120
Oh, and be sure to tell him that his father
was Anakin, the former pilot and adventurer

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.969
he should idolize and escape to become.

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.640
If Luke's aunt and uncle just claim Luke as
their son, he lives his life quietly.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.609
The even dumber fact is that Darth Vader never
even investigates whether someone was claiming

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:29.400
to be Anakin's son - or sensed his own child
when he was just a few feet away.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.450
Looper
We won't even point out the problems or time

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.060
travel contradictions in the one, since it's
all in the name of telling a cool story.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.620
It works, but if you take even a tiny look
at the actual looper system, it makes zero

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.620
sense.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.889
A future crime boss sends his targets into
the past, since they can't be disposed of

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:44.920
in his own time.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.290
But instead of hiring, then eventually killing
a horde of hitmen, why wouldn't he just send

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.359
his enemies a few decades into the past - or
send their bodies?

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.749
If they need to be alive to time travel, poison
them!

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.930
There are hundreds of ways of getting what
he's after, but the movie claims he picked

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.760
the absolute worst one imaginable.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.319
The Terminator
When the robot armies of Skynet realize they've

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.449
lost the war, they send a Terminator back
in time to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.790
mankind's greatest hero, John Connor.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.549
Even though plenty of women by that time are
killed, John's mother lives to train her son

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.120
to become the leader she knows he will be.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.320
But why wouldn't she also tell him to change
his name?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.840
Skynet wouldn't have been able to even try
to kill him or his mother if he used a false

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.840
name.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.850
Erasing the threat before it ever began.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.450
Those are the plot holes so big, they turn
some of our favorite movies into nonsensical

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.450
stories.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.510
But which ones have we missed?
