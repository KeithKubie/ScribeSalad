00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.800
In early August 1914, we
know that Germany declares

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.150
war on Russia, just as
Russia's mobilizing troops

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.754
to get into a war with the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:14.170
Because the Austro-Hungarians
have declared war on Serbia.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.340
And the Russians
apparently, or ostensibly,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.260
or used protection of
Serbia as a pretext

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.570
for getting into war
with the Austrians.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.570
The Germans have an
alliance with the Austrians.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.962
So they feel the need
to fight the Russians.

00:00:26.962 --> 00:00:28.920
And then, because the
Russians have an alliance

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.730
with the French, to
fight the French as well.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.820
The first actual combat
on the Eastern Front

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.580
actually happens with
Russia on the offensive.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.570
And you actually have
two Russian armies.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.880
The Russian First Army and
the Russian Second Army

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.280
attacking the Germans up
here in Eastern Prussia.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.220
And they were going against one
German army, the German Eighth

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.940
Army.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.420
And in theory, it
should have been

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.950
a route of the
German Eighth Army.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.033
They had them outnumbered.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:56.960
You had two Russian
armies coming

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.380
from different directions.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.540
But because of really
bad coordination and, one

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.260
could even argue, bad leadership
and other tactical problems,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.440
it was actually a
route the other way.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.990
So the war, World War
I, on the Eastern Front,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.480
starts very badly
for the Russians.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.424
You actually have a
huge route of them

00:01:13.424 --> 00:01:14.590
at the Battle of Tannenberg.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.510
And Tannenberg's interesting
because it actually

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.060
did not even happen
in Tannenberg.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940
Tannenberg is right around here.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.210
It wasn't far from the
point of the battle.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.570
But there was other cities
that would have been more,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600
the battle could
have been named for.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.200
But since the Germans
won the battle,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.120
they named it
Tannenberg because there

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.640
was an ancient battle in
medieval times in the 1400s

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.140
where the Slavic,
some Slavic peoples

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.460
were able to route
German Teutonic knights.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760
We're talking about medieval
battles with knights.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.920
And in order to redeem that,
they labeled this other war

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.120
where it was Germans
against Slavic people.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.900
They said, oh, this is our
second battle for Tannenberg.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.120
So it helped bring out
more German patriotism.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.700
But this was a major, major,
major route for the Russians.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.320
The Second Army, in particular,
got completely decimated.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.560
The Second Army, the
Russian Second Army

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.270
went into the battle-- I've
seen estimates of 150,000

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.720
to 180,000 troops.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.030
Roughly half were killed.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.970
And only about 10,000 escaped
the Battle of Tannenberg.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.800
And it was such a humiliating
defeat for the Russian Second

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.300
Army.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.960
But that the general of the
Russian Second Army, General

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.420
Samsonov-- and I'm
sure once again,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.410
I'm mispronouncing everything--
General Samsonov actually

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.206
shot himself.

00:02:37.206 --> 00:02:38.080
He committed suicide.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.950
He was so humiliated and so
embarrassed by that defeat.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.660
So the war did not begin
well for the Russians.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.240
But by the end of
1914, they were

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.110
able to get back into gear.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.970
And they stayed
on the offensive.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.310
And they did have
some victories up here

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.020
in Galicia which,
at the time, was

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.100
part of northeastern Hungary.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.160
And so they were
actually able to capture

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.610
a good bit of territory
right over here.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.880
Now, as we enter into
1915, and we've already

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.490
covered this on the videos
on the Western Front.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.850
We know that the Western Front
was entering into a stalemate.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.050
The Schlieffen Plan did not
happen as quickly as possible.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.230
But the defenders
had a huge advantage.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.140
So that gave the
Germans an opportunity

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.800
to bring some troops back
to the Eastern Front,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.500
to bring troops back
to the Eastern Front.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.320
They also got better
at coordinating

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.040
with the Austro-Hungarians.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.644
And so you have 1915, you
have the Central Powers

00:03:33.644 --> 00:03:34.685
go back on the offensive.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.750
And they're essentially
able to drive

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.750
the Russians out
of Russian Poland

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.090
roughly to this border that
I have drawn right over here,

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.020
roughly to this border, give
or take, right over here.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.610
When we talk about Russian
Poland, the modern state

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.390
of Poland, I'm making
this video now in 2013.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.140
The modern state of
Poland was essentially

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.350
split between what
you see on this map

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.970
between the Russian Empire
and the German Empire.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.019
The modern state of Poland
is roughly this region right

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:18.570
over here.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.153
And so you see, it's
almost completely

00:04:20.153 --> 00:04:25.580
split, almost like a yin and
yang symbol between these two

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.560
empires.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.750
But by, but through
1915, the Russians

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.750
were pushed out of Russian
Poland roughly to this border.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.180
And essentially, to a large
degree, it was because Russia,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.850
even though they had this
huge army, this huge manpower,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.784
they had bad
communication lines.

00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:44.450
And actually had bad
technical supplies.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.990
Russian industry
wasn't able to keep up

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.980
with the demand of
the war and wasn't

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.130
able to supply the munitions
in proper quantities

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.080
and the arms in proper
quantities to their troops.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.951
As you enter into 1916,
the Russians, once again,

00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:59.450
were able to get
their footing back.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.240
As you can see, it's starting
to become a little bit of a back

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.790
and forth.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.770
So Russian industry,
I guess you could say,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.830
picks back up in 1916.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.560
And it essentially puts the
Russians more on the offensive.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.630
They were driven out
of Russian Poland.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.090
But now by 1916, they're able
to keep the Central Powers

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.790
a little bit more
on the defensive.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.510
But the boundaries
of the front roughly

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.270
stay in line with this
line right over here.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.020
And by the end of
1916, you actually

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.010
have the Romanians joining on
the side of the Triple Entente,

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.900
on the sides of the
Russians, in order

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.000
to fight the Central
Powers as well.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.750
Now, this might look
like it's starting

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.160
to look better for the Russians.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.630
The Russians, their industry
is finally picking up.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.340
They're starting to put the
Central Powers a little bit

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.667
more on the defensive.

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:53.250
But the entire time
that we're talking

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.560
about this battle, the economic
situation in the Russian Empire

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.900
is deteriorating dramatically.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:07.970
By the time you get into
1917, the Russian economy

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.470
is really falling apart.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.070
You have food shortages.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.520
You have riots.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.790
Food shortages.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.770
You have riots.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.560
And in February of 1917, you
have the February Revolution.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.400
You essentially, the overthrow
of the Romanov Dynasty.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.340
It's been in power
for 300 years.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.340
But you have Tsar Nicholas II.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.070
So this is in February.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:39.420
And then in early March,
you have Tsar Nicholas II

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.230
abdicates the throne.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.970
And this is the
gentleman right here.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.700
And we'll do more
detailed videos

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.360
about the entire
Russian Revolution

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.420
and what happens to his
family and all of the rest.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.272
And you have an interim
government that takes place.

00:06:52.272 --> 00:06:53.730
And this is actually
a little, this

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.240
is an interesting
fact of history.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.160
This interim government all of
a sudden becomes a democracy.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.840
This is February 1917.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.570
Remember, the United
States has not

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.140
entered the war at this point.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.970
But you might also remember
that in April, the United States

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.790
uses the idea of fighting
on the side of democracy

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.080
as a justification
for entering the war.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.140
Which is very nice,
because by April,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.200
all of the major powers
on the side of the,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.950
I guess you would say,
the Triple Entente,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.260
they were all democracies.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.590
You're talking about, now,
the interim government

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.370
for the Russians.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.440
You have the French.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.500
And you have the British Empire.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.420
Obviously, it's a democracy
only for those who are voting.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.040
And actually the United
States was the first country

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.440
to recognize the
interim government

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.540
after the overthrow
of Tsar Nicholas II.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.030
But we're not just
done with 1917.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.210
1917 is one of those huge years
in the history of the world

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.790
and especially in the
history of Russia.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.930
The situation continues
to deteriorate.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.960
And it starts to deteriorate,
as well, for the army.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.470
The morale and the
troops breakdown.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.930
You start having, the Bolsheviks
start to create unrest.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.500
By the end of 1917, now we're
talking about September 1917.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.330
So that's maybe
right around here.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.440
You have the Central Powers.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.330
Germany's able to capture
Riga, which is a major city

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.220
right over here on the Baltic.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.420
Which brings the Central
Powers very, very

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.620
close to the Russian capital.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.670
It contributes to the ongoing
unrest that's going on.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:38.159
And so in November 7,
you have coup d'etat

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.640
of that ostensibly democratic
interim government,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.799
provisional government.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.480
And you have the
communists take power.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.420
You have the
Bolsheviks take power

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.880
under the leadership of
Vladimir Lenin right over here.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.020
So November 7, 1917, very
famous date in history.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.070
You have the Bolsheviks.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.702
So this is Lenin leading
the Bolsheviks into power.

00:08:58.702 --> 00:09:00.410
Now, they were in no
interest to continue

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.080
fighting this
battle with Germany.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.390
They had their own civil
war to worry about.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.700
They were trying to
consolidate power in Russia.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.260
So in December, they
essentially get into,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.740
start to negotiate an armistice
with the Central Powers.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.186
And they did not have a lot of
leverage in this negotiation

00:09:17.186 --> 00:09:18.560
because they
weren't, they really

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.080
did not want to be in this war.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:26.400
And so by March
of 1918, you have

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.360
the treaty-- this between
Russia and the Central Powers--

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.050
the Treaty of Brest--
and I'm sure I'm

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.010
mispronouncing
everything-- Brest-Litovsk.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.214
The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,
in which the Russians,

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:43.130
because they were so
desperate, the Bolsheviks

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.770
were so desperate
in order to get,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.260
to focus on the
internal civil war that

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.870
had emerged in Russia, in
order to consolidate power,

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.680
they gave over a huge
amount of territory

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.910
to the Central Powers.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:58.310
And essentially a large
part of European Russia

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:04.950
that is not predominantly--
of Russian ethnicity

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.070
went over to the Central Powers.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.340
Now this treaty is important
because it essentially

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.630
was the end of World
War I for the Russians.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.550
It essentially was the
end of the Eastern Front.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.250
And it allowed the
Germans to then refocus

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.760
on the Western Front, which
allowed the Germans to start

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.770
bringing troops back over
to the Western Front.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.580
And they were actually able to
do quite an aggressive Spring

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.180
Offensive on the Western Front.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.406
And if it wasn't for
the US at the time,

00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:33.780
now being able to reinforce
the Western Front-- remember,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.750
they declared war in
mid-1917-- it's not clear

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.080
that the German offensive
might not have been successful

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.420
in the spring of 1918.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.290
So the importance
of Brest-Litovsk

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.480
is it was the end of
the Eastern Front.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.180
It allowed the Germans to do an
offensive on the Western Front.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.750
And it was a very
strong offensive.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.810
But with the help
of the Americans,

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.870
it was not a successful one.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.500
But the actual territorial
gains for the Central Power

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.030
of Brest-Litovsk-- I'm sure
I'm mispronouncing it--

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.630
were not that significant.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.600
Because in November
1918-- and here

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.990
I'm probably falling off
my timeline a little bit.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.570
But right over here
in November 1918,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.720
this is maybe 19-- this
is 1919 right over here.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.020
You have the Central
Powers essentially saying,

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.070
oh my God, we're not going
to be able to win this war.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.220
And you have the,
essentially, what

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.230
was for a long time
known as Armistice Day.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.100
The 11th the day
of the 11th month--

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.390
or the 11th hour
of the 11th month--

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.770
or the 11th hour of the
11th day of the 11th month,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:37.950
you have an armistice.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.210
And you have the end of World
War I with the Allies winning.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.830
And so the Allies
got to say what

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.140
happened to this
territory right over here.
