00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.060
Street songs in Paris in the year 1749

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.130
and 1749 was a critical political year,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.680
the government fell, why did it fall,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.530
well the answer, according to all contemporaries

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.340
is because of songs, chanson.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.560
Frere Blanche, that's what did the job.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.950
The songs became a kind of sung newspaper

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.770
full of information and commentary

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.230
at a time when there were no real newspapers,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.700
in the modern sense of the word, in Paris

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.020
and at a time when

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.180
certainly over half of the population was illiterate.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.790
so songs, in other words, were perfect 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.150
as a means of communication

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.760
of oral communication.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.500
People would invent

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.130
new words to old tunes

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.480
people would add a new verse to the old verses

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.320
as the politics developed

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.860
so because everyone kept these tunes in their heads

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.620
they were easy to remember.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.880
Music is a kind of pneumonic device

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.500
and therefore

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.310
new verses to the old tunes

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.180
spread like wild fire through the streets of Paris.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.190
Singers were arrested and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.570
and the government tried to repress

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.700
some of the more disrespectful songs

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.350
or some of the more downright seditious songs.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.650
Most oral communication of course 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.799
disappeared into the air 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.760
but the songs were recorded in these 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.690
song books, or chanson livret

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.150
and fortunately they can be studied.
