this this process so the first thing you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
this this process so the first thing you
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.310

might say hey Jesus how is it you know

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
might say hey Jesus how is it you know
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.260
might say hey Jesus how is it you know
this looks like a line integral but you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
this looks like a line integral but you
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.630
this looks like a line integral but you
have a DX and dy I don't see a dot d R

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

that we can write dr/dt as being equal

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
that we can write dr/dt as being equal
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.899
that we can write dr/dt as being equal
to DX DT times i plus dy/dt times J

we've seen this multiple times and we've

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
we've seen this multiple times and we've
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.069
we've seen this multiple times and we've
seen multiple times we want to get the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
seen multiple times we want to get the
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.859

differential dr we could just multiply

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
differential dr we could just multiply
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050
differential dr we could just multiply
everything times DT and normally I just

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
everything times DT and normally I just
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.940
everything times DT and normally I just
put a DT here and a DT there and get rid

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
put a DT here and a DT there and get rid
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.020
put a DT here and a DT there and get rid
of this DT but if you multiply

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
of this DT but if you multiply
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.209
of this DT but if you multiply
everything times DT if you view this as

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
everything times DT if you view this as
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.819
everything times DT if you view this as
the differentials as actual numbers you

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829
the differentials as actual numbers you
 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.650
the differentials as actual numbers you
can multiply and normally you can treat

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
can multiply and normally you can treat
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.080
can multiply and normally you can treat
them like that then you just get rid of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
them like that then you just get rid of
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.440
them like that then you just get rid of
all of the dt so dr

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450
all of the dt so dr
 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.680
all of the dt so dr

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690
you could imagine is equal to DX times
 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.400

vector J so put that aside and you might

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
vector J so put that aside and you might
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.479
vector J so put that aside and you might
already see a pattern here so if we

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489
already see a pattern here so if we
 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.820
already see a pattern here so if we
define if we define our vector field f f

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
define if we define our vector field f f
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.910

question is f is f conservative so is f

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990
question is f is f conservative so is f
 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.879
question is f is f conservative so is f
is f equal to the gradient of some

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889
is f equal to the gradient of some
 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.750

this the case so let's zoom it is and

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580
this the case so let's zoom it is and
 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.690
this the case so let's zoom it is and
see if we can solve for we can solve for

see if we can solve for we can solve for
 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.450
see if we can solve for we can solve for
a scalar field whose gradient really is

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460
a scalar field whose gradient really is
 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.159
a scalar field whose gradient really is
f then we know that f is conservative

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169
f then we know that f is conservative
 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.620
f then we know that f is conservative
and then if F is conservative and this

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630
and then if F is conservative and this
 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.000
and then if F is conservative and this

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010
is the whole reason we want to do it
 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.330
is the whole reason we want to do it
that means that any closed loop any line

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.700
that means that any closed loop any line
integral over a closed curve of F is

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710
integral over a closed curve of F is
 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.190
integral over a closed curve of F is

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.730
to mess with the cosine of T's and the
sine of T's and all of that and actually

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740
sine of T's and all of that and actually
 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.719

we don't even have to take anti
 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.670
we don't even have to take anti

scalar field is equal to the partial of

scalar field is equal to the partial of
 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.750
scalar field is equal to the partial of

times J so that's why I'm just pattern

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889
times J so that's why I'm just pattern
 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.740

matching I'm just saying well gee if if
this is the gradient of that then this

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070
this is the gradient of that then this
 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.490
this is the gradient of that then this
must be that which I wrote down right

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500
must be that which I wrote down right
 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.469
must be that which I wrote down right
here and this must be that which I wrote

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479
here and this must be that which I wrote
 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.629
here and this must be that which I wrote
down here so let's see if I can find an

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639
down here so let's see if I can find an
 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.460
down here so let's see if I can find an
F that satisfies both of these

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470
F that satisfies both of these
 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.070
F that satisfies both of these
constraints so we can just take the

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080
constraints so we can just take the
 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.920
constraints so we can just take the
antiderivative with respect to X on both

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930
antiderivative with respect to X on both
 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.690
antiderivative with respect to X on both
sides and if we take the antiderivative

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700
sides and if we take the antiderivative
 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.610
sides and if we take the antiderivative
with respect to X on both sides remember

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620
with respect to X on both sides remember
 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.530
with respect to X on both sides remember
you just treat Y like a

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540
you just treat Y like a
 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.420
you just treat Y like a
or y-squared like a constant is just a

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430
or y-squared like a constant is just a
 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.940
or y-squared like a constant is just a
number so then we could say that F is

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950
number so then we could say that F is
 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.000
number so then we could say that F is
equal to the antiderivative of x squared

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010
equal to the antiderivative of x squared
 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.430
equal to the antiderivative of x squared
is X to the third over three X to the

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440
is X to the third over three X to the
 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.250
is X to the third over three X to the
third over 3 and then the antiderivative

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260
third over 3 and then the antiderivative
 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.650
third over 3 and then the antiderivative
of Y squared remember with respect to X

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660
of Y squared remember with respect to X
 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.150
of Y squared remember with respect to X
so you just treat like a number that

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160
so you just treat like a number that
 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.040
so you just treat like a number that
could just be the number K or this could

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050
could just be the number K or this could
 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.360
could just be the number K or this could
be the number five so there's just going

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370
be the number five so there's just going
 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.590
be the number five so there's just going
to be that times X so plus X times y

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600
to be that times X so plus X times y
 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.230
to be that times X so plus X times y
squared and then there could be some

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240
squared and then there could be some
 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.440
squared and then there could be some
function of Y here so plus some I don't

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450
function of Y here so plus some I don't
 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.410
function of Y here so plus some I don't
know I'll call it you know G of Y

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420
know I'll call it you know G of Y
 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.790
know I'll call it you know G of Y
because there could have been some

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800
because there could have been some
 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.470
because there could have been some
function of Y here when you take if it's

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480
function of Y here when you take if it's
 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.060
function of Y here when you take if it's
a pure function of Y when you take the

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070
a pure function of Y when you take the
 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.590
a pure function of Y when you take the
derivative or the partial with respect

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600
derivative or the partial with respect
 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.750
derivative or the partial with respect
to X this would have disappeared so it

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:23.760
to X this would have disappeared so it
 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.550
to X this would have disappeared so it
would reappear when we take the

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560
would reappear when we take the
 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.860
would reappear when we take the
antiderivative and let me just to be

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870
antiderivative and let me just to be
 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.700
antiderivative and let me just to be
just to be clear let me make it clear

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710
just to be clear let me make it clear
 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:35.990
just to be clear let me make it clear
that F F is going to be a function of x

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000
that F F is going to be a function of x
 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.140
that F F is going to be a function of x
and y so this we just took the I guess

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.150
and y so this we just took the I guess
 

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.220
and y so this we just took the I guess
you could say the antiderivative this

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.230
you could say the antiderivative this
 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.480
you could say the antiderivative this
right 2x let's see if we take the

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.490
right 2x let's see if we take the
 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.100
right 2x let's see if we take the
antiderivative respect to Y and then we

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110
antiderivative respect to Y and then we
 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.250
antiderivative respect to Y and then we
can reconcile the two so based on this f

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260
can reconcile the two so based on this f
 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.230
can reconcile the two so based on this f
of XY f of XY is going to have to look

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240
of XY f of XY is going to have to look
 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.760
of XY f of XY is going to have to look
like so let's take the antiderivative

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:52.770
like so let's take the antiderivative
 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.700
like so let's take the antiderivative
with respect to Y here so remember you

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:55.710
with respect to Y here so remember you
 

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.620
with respect to Y here so remember you
just treat X like it's just some number

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:57.630
just treat X like it's just some number
 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.210
just treat X like it's just some number
it could be a K it could be an M it

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220
it could be a K it could be an M it
 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.910
it could be a K it could be an M it
could be a 5 it's just some number so if

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:01.920
could be a 5 it's just some number so if
 

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.710
could be a 5 it's just some number so if
X is just some the antiderivative to Y

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720
X is just some the antiderivative to Y
 

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.080
X is just some the antiderivative to Y
is y squared and if X is just a number

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.090
is y squared and if X is just a number
 

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:07.580
is y squared and if X is just a number
there the antiderivative this with

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:07.590
there the antiderivative this with
 

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.670
there the antiderivative this with
respect to Y is just going to be X Y

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680
respect to Y is just going to be X Y
 

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.980
respect to Y is just going to be X Y
squared don't believe me take the

X like a constant you'll get 2 times XY

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:17.550
X like a constant you'll get 2 times XY
 

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.000
X like a constant you'll get 2 times XY
and then you with no exponent there and

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.010
and then you with no exponent there and
 

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.410
and then you with no exponent there and
of course we took the antiderivative

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:21.420
of course we took the antiderivative
 

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.950
of course we took the antiderivative
with respect to X there might be some

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960
with respect to X there might be some
 

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.590
with respect to X there might be some
function of X here we were just basing

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:27.600
function of X here we were just basing
 

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.080
function of X here we were just basing
it off of that information now given

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.090
it off of that information now given
 

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.930
it off of that information now given
that we this information says f of XY is

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940
that we this information says f of XY is
 

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.770
that we this information says f of XY is
going to have to look something like

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:33.780
going to have to look something like
 

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.469
going to have to look something like
this this information tells us F of XY

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479
this this information tells us F of XY
 

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.430
this this information tells us F of XY
is going to have to look something like

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440
is going to have to look something like
 

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.500
is going to have to look something like
that let's see if there is an f of XY

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:39.510
that let's see if there is an f of XY
 

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.620
that let's see if there is an f of XY
that looks like both of them essentially

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:41.630
that looks like both of them essentially
 

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.560
that looks like both of them essentially
so let's see we have on this one we have

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:45.570
so let's see we have on this one we have
 

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.710
so let's see we have on this one we have
XY squared here we have an XY squared

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720
XY squared here we have an XY squared
 

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.440
XY squared here we have an XY squared
there so good that looks good and then

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:51.450
there so good that looks good and then
 

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.000
there so good that looks good and then
over here we have an F of

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.010
over here we have an F of
 

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.770
over here we have an F of
we have something that's a pure function

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:54.780
we have something that's a pure function
 

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.010
we have something that's a pure function
of X and here we have something that is

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.020
of X and here we have something that is
 

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.350
of X and here we have something that is
a pure function of X so these two things

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360
a pure function of X so these two things
 

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.690
a pure function of X so these two things
could be the same thing and then here we

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:02.700
could be the same thing and then here we
 

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.150
could be the same thing and then here we
have a pure function of Y that might be

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160
have a pure function of Y that might be
 

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.890
have a pure function of Y that might be
there but it didn't really show up

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:06.900
there but it didn't really show up
 

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.320
there but it didn't really show up
anywhere over here so we could just say

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:09.330
anywhere over here so we could just say
 

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.360
anywhere over here so we could just say
hey that probably that's that's going to

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:11.370
hey that probably that's that's going to
 

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.480
hey that probably that's that's going to
be zero zero is a pure function of Y you

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:14.490
be zero zero is a pure function of Y you
 

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.740
be zero zero is a pure function of Y you
could have something called G of Y is

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:15.750
could have something called G of Y is
 

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.820
could have something called G of Y is
equal to zero and then we get that F

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:18.830
equal to zero and then we get that F
 

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:24.200
equal to zero and then we get that F
capital f of X Y is equal to X to the
