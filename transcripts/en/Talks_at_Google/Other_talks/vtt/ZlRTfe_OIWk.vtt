00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Forest is going
to talk to us about

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.990
fakes and forgeries
in Southeast Asia.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.570
So help me welcome
him to Google.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.710
FORREST MCGILL: Hi, everybody.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.380
Can you still hear all right
in the back and everything?

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.100
Good.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.750
Thank you for coming.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.550
It's fun for me to be
a Google today.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.060
I've never been here before
and it's wonderful.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.310
The problems of fakes in
Southeast Asian art are very

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.310
longstanding and complicated.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.550
And one of the points of course
that comes up right

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.150
away is why would anybody be
bothering to fake Southeast

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.400
Asian artwork?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.080
And it has to do with the
market, of course.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.220
Southeast Asian artworks, great
ones, can bring hundreds

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.510
of thousands of dollars
or even more.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.300
So if you're an artisan in
Southeast Asia, if you can

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.900
produce high-quality fakes and
sell them to dealers in

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.100
Zurich, and London, and New York
as the real thing, then

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.140
you'll make more money in one
month than you might make in

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.800
years otherwise.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.700
The problem is very
longstanding.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.640
I'm just showing you the names
of these two articles that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.330
were published in 1943, already
talking about fakes.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.550
So the problem is
not a new one.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.310
Here in 1943, there's already
this recognition of the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.910
problem of imitations,
fakes essentially.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.940
And here's an illustration from
one of these articles in

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.260
1943 showing a series
of heads.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.620
And according to the author,
this is the genuine one and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.790
the other three in each
instance are fake.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.910
And I think I could probably
have figured this out after

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.150
being in this field
for something like

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.780
going on 50 years now.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.250
I think I could have
figured it out.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.780
But the rest of the time today
is talking about how we get at

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.180
these issues.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.050
This is at the Asian Art
Museum a few years ago.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.020
We had an exhibition on fakes.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.060
Museums used to get rid of their
fakes or put them in the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.250
lowest level of the basement.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.970
We get ours out pretty often
because we find that the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.220
public is interested in them.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.880
And we're interested
in them too.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.690
And as you'll see in the course
of the talk today,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.500
things that were thought to be
fake have sometimes come back

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.980
from the dead and turned out not
to be fake and vice versa.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.220
And some things remain for
decades as uncertain.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.270
We can't decide.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.090
No amount of scholarship, no
amount of technical analysis

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.750
has decided the issue
in some instances.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.410
If you had to vote in this
instance, how would you vote?

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.450
If I said one is for sure almost
a thousand years old

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.360
and the other one is made 30
years ago, how would you vote?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.420
Right-hand side is the
fake, who votes for

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.370
the right-hand side?

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.700
You.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.060
Left-hand side is the fake?

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.890
Well, maybe I won't tell you.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.340
Maybe I'll make you come back
to the Asian Art Museum and

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.590
find out one of these days.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.320
We have a good online database
with pictures and a lot of

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.460
information about
our artworks.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.420
And you can access it through
our general website.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.580
And these things and lots
of others are on there.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.300
And the fakes are
on there too.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.150
And they're registered
as a forgery usually.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.020
Usually, it will say forgery of
the head of a Buddha image

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.050
or something like that.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.570
So if you're interested,
you can find out.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.500
And I think maybe I won't tell
you the answer in this

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.020
instance or at least
not right now.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.830
Why did the market for
these fakes develop?

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.800
Well, it developed for the same
reason that the market

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.360
for Southeast Asian artworks
in general, especially

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.279
sculpture, developed at all.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.440
And that was in part because
of the early world's fair.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.820
Here's in 1889.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.980
The world's fairs in Paris,
you know France was the

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.360
colonial power that
ruled Cambodia,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.110
and Laos, and Vietnam.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.620
Holland ruled Indonesia.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.790
Britain ruled Burma.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.790
So at the big worlds' fairs
and the big colonial

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.640
exposition, the colonial home
countries featured the

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.810
artworks of their colonies
to show their pride and

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.980
so on, and so on.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.930
And in a whole succession of
worlds' fairs, there were

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.460
great Cambodian, ancient
Cambodian sculptures and other

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.420
works of art shown, and ones
from Indonesia, and ones from

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.360
Thailand, and ones from Burma.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.970
And there was a lot of interest
from 1889 on.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.210
There was a lot of interest in
Europe and eventually in

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.810
America too in Southeast
Asian art.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.540
Well-to-do people wanted for
their library or their living

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.050
room the right kind of ancient
head or the right kind of

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.120
ancient sculpture to decorate
their homes with.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.980
If you go to Southeast Asia
today, and maybe some of you

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.170
have been to these places,
this is Bali.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.860
There are stone carving
workshops in Bali, in

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.690
Thailand, in Java, in other
parts of Southeast Asia that

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.700
are producing sculptures like
these for restaurants, for

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.000
gardens, for hotels.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.400
And that means that the movement
of the stone, the

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.130
quarrying and the movement of
the stone is still very much a

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.330
going concern.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.500
And the skills of carving
the stone are

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.380
very much still alive.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.860
These are living traditions.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:25.520
So if you're a stone worker, you
can get the stone and make

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.530
Buddha images or images of
Hindu deities or other

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.730
sculptures to sell to hotels,
or restaurants, or gardens,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.610
people for their garden.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.620
But if you're really good at it
and if you're unscrupulous,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.300
you use the same skills, the
same materials, to make things

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.120
that eventually enter the
market as ancient

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.170
when they're not.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.910
This is in Bangkok.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.400
On the right-hand side
here is Bangkok.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.090
And in Bangkok, if you go to the
right parts of town, there

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.840
are a lot of religious
paraphernalia

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.370
stores, just as--

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.000
well, I live in the Inner
Sunset in San Francisco.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.030
And there's a store that sells
Russian Orthodox things,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.000
things that are needed for
Russian Orthodox Church

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.100
services, and so on.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.260
So you can go in and buy a
chalice, or the right kind of

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.010
crucifix, and so
on, and so on.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.080
Well, there are religious
paraphernalia stores where you

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.470
can go and buy bronze and stone
Buddha images for the

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.700
temple back in your town.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.340
And they're not fake.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.370
They're made in the traditional
ways and they're

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.150
often made in the traditional
style.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.060
But obviously, they're not
intended as forgeries.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.180
They're just something that you
can go buy and take back

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.380
and donate to your
local temple.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.020
And the factories for making
bronze images are still very

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.610
much there.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.390
So exactly the same kinds of
techniques that have been

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.720
being used for over a thousand
years are still being used,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.110
the same material.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.270
And if you go to Thailand, or
Java, or Bali, or Burma for

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.230
that matter, Cambodia, you can
go and visit bronze casting

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.980
workshops like this and see
things being made today in

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.910
exactly the same techniques and
with the same materials

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.770
that they always have.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.470
So I wanted to show you some
sculptures that from the

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.990
museum point of view are
clearly not old.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.010
When we see these nowadays, we
can say this isn't a problem.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:23.940
We don't need to think
about it anymore.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.990
They're clearly not old.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.310
And of course, it begs the
question of how do we know?

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:37.370
And sometimes it isn't a problem
to figure it out.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.210
I have 20-something goddaughter
who's quite a

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.080
fashion maven.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.700
And she can tell a real designer
handbag from a

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:54.330
knock-off handbag, a knock-off
copy of a designer handbag.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.690
She can tell very readily.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:00.500
She's looked at plenty of
handbags and she knows a real

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.970
one from a knock-off.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.150
And there's lots in the area of
Southeast Asian are where

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.950
somebody who has been looking
at these things for decades

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.780
and seen lots of real ones and
studied lots of real ones, you

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.590
just get familiar enough.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.630
I was thinking at lunch,
are there knock-offs of

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.620
Google Glass yet?

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.580
Can you buy cheap imitations?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.720
Obviously if you can, then you
all, who know this stuff very

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.400
well, can tell the imitations
from the real thing easily.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.810
So there are a lot of instances

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.770
where it's not so hard.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.530
This one has a lot of stylistic

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.120
features that aren't right.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.740
The color is strange
and so on.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.370
Then here's one that also you
would say, if you've been in

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.726
the field for a while or looked
at a lot of these for a

00:09:51.726 --> 00:09:57.370
while, you'd say right
off it must be fake.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.870
And it's partly because we know
in this instance exactly

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.970
what it's copying.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.140
The center and right-hand
pictures are probably the most

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.150
famous Buddha image
in Thailand.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.250
And so this small one in the
Asian Art Museum collection,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:19.320
this small forgery, is just a
copy of this one, which is

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.420
very large.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.360
And the one that we have
in the Asian Art Museum

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.570
collection may not even have
started out life as a forgery.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.510
It may have started out life
just as a copy, a modern copy

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.360
that you could go and buy in the
way that you might go to a

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.820
souvenir store and
buy a miniature

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.630
Statue of Liberty something.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.910
So it may not have been
intended to deceive

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.710
originally.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.290
But then it gets into the market
and dealers don't know

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.870
or collectors don't know.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.150
And so something new
can turn into

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:56.200
"supposedly" something old.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.910
Then this is a stone relief from
Cambodia in the museum's

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.570
collection.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.560
And it was made 50 years
ago, or something

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.060
like that is my guess.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.170
And again, here's what it's
clearly basing itself on.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.250
This is a thousand year old
stone relief that's now in a

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.010
museum in Paris.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.870
But if you look at the features
one by one, the

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.830
hairdo of this figure, the way
the club is held, and so on,

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.290
and so, it becomes clear that
this is based on this, or

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.300
something very close to it.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.360
Another thing about this one
that clues us in that it's a

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.690
forgery, again if you know the
material a bit, there simply

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:45.240
were not temples that had small
reliefs like this in

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.190
such a nice little frame.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.330
There aren't any.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.300
These would have come out
of temples anyway.

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.590
There aren't any temples that
had sculptures of this type in

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.000
a nice little frame
of this size.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.200
So it was made for the market.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.890
And it was made in this--
well, this one is huge.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:10.780
The one on your left was made in
this size and with the nice

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.770
little frame around it because
that's how someone would have

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.300
wanted it in their
living room.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.745
So the artisans were responding
to what they take

00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:23.530
to be the wishes
of the market.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:29.920
Now, there's two technical tests
that we use all the time

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.010
at the museum-- and other
museums use them too--

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.070
for helping to determine what's
old and what's new.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.570
Alloy composition testing,
that's straightforward.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.000
Bronze is an alloy of
copper and tin.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.200
And by analyzing it, you can
find out what the percentages

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.260
are and you can check whether
it's got the right kind of

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.110
alloy composition.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:58.680
Thermoluminescence is a
technique that's just been

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.950
developed in the last
40 years or so.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.670
And as best I understand it,
here's what happens.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.150
When there's crystalline
minerals--

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.970
and clay is one, the clay that
we use for ceramics, and

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.820
bricks, and dishes, and so on.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.120
When a crystalline mineral
like that is in the

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.940
atmosphere, it's absorbing
radiation from the atmosphere

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.440
and the surroundings.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.520
When it's fired, so you take
this clay and make it into

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.110
something and you put it in the
kiln and fire it, all of

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.700
the energy that has been
absorbed, all the radiation

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.590
that's been absorbed,
is obliterated.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.020
And so it's set back to 0.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.040
And then it starts collecting
radiation, collecting energy

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.280
again from the moment
that it's fired.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.475
So it's up at this level.

00:13:50.475 --> 00:13:52.090
It goes down to 0.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.220
And then it starts building
up again,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.310
collecting this radiation.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.060
So if you study the radiation
and test it against known

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.720
things, you can make a scale to
figure out, or to at least

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.420
estimate, how old a crystalline
material is.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.340
And we use it for bronze images
like this all the time.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.760
So in this instance, the alloy
is completely atypical.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.550
And I'll show you
why in a minute.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.560
And the TL test, the
thermoluminescence test, gives

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.520
a date of less than 100 years.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.340
So we already thought it was
a fake on other grounds.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.780
But the tests confirmed it.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:39.710
Now I hope you're thinking to
yourself, why does a test that

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:45.220
works on crystalline minerals
like clay, what good does that

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.250
do us in looking at something
that's bronze?

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.320
Anybody know actually, what--

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.145
yes?

00:14:53.145 --> 00:14:57.030
AUDIENCE: Well, aren't the
bronze castings fired in clay?

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.780
FORREST MCGILL: Well, yes.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.680
Yes.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.430
You're on the right track.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.930
There fired in clay.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.175
And they've got a clay
core inside.

00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:05.880
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:13.000
FORREST MCGILL: So to cast a
bronze like this, you make a

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.560
general model out of clay.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.080
And then you put wax over
the whole thing.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.220
And you model and carve all
the details in the wax.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.860
Then you put clay over the whole
thing again and fire it.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.680
And when you fire it,
of course the wax

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.040
melts and runs out.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.620
So you're left with the space
where the wax used to be.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.920
And where the wax used to be,
you pour molten bronze in.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.200
That means that the core, that
original clay model that you

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.210
started out with,
is still inside.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.100
And that's why we can use
thermoluminescence testing on

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:55.960
bronze because most Southeast
Asian bronzes still have the

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.170
original fired clay
core inside.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.000
So we're not testing the bronze,
we're testing the core

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.780
that's inside it.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:12.020
So for this image, here's
its alloy distribution.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.810
And you can see it's got a whole
bunch of zinc in it,

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.440
which shouldn't be there.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:23.350
This is a typical element
distribution in the alloy.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.460
This is a typical one for
an ancient bronze.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:32.640
So this big chunk of zinc and
the big chunk of lead suggest

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.900
to us that this is a modern
alloy, rather

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.150
than an ancient alloy.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:46.530
Now, another category of things
that seemed suspicious

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.400
for one reason or another and
then get vindicated or further

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.680
study shows that there wasn't
a problem with them.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:03.060
Here's a stone sculpture,
fragment of a stone sculpture

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.310
about this big.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.400
Hiram Woodward is the great
specialist in Cambodian

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.869
sculpture in the Western
world these days.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.790
He's the specialist who knows.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.480
And he's studied all the
products of the most

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:25.410
provincial workshops way out
in rural Northwestern

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.200
Cambodia, and Northeastern
Thailand, and so on.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.880
So if Woodward studies the piece
and says it looks like a

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.700
fake, but it isn't.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.230
It's actually perfectly
all right.

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:41.220
We can take that, at least
tentatively, as the solution

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.930
to the problem for the time
being, pending further study.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:54.540
I should say that for stone the
technical dating aspect is

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.790
much more challenging.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.460
There's not tests that will tell
you when a piece of stone

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.590
was carved.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.530
You can get the date of the
stone, you know 5 million

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:07.710
years or whatever.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.420
But the date of the stone
doesn't tell you anything

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.310
about the date of when the
sculpture was made.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.010
There are some analyses that
can be done on the surface.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.530
Because if a piece of stone has
been buried for a thousand

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.140
years or it's been exposed to
the elements for a thousand

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.630
years, things happen on the
surface that you can detect by

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.900
taking little thin slivers of
a sample and looking at it

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.870
under the microscope.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:43.910
But the fakers have found ways
to duplicate those effects.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.880
In Southeast Asia, if you're a
clever faker, you carve things

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.620
out of stone and it is said
that you bury them

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.400
under the pig pen.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.170
Apparently, this is a good
place to bury them.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.190
You bury them under the pig pen
and leave them for your

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:01.530
children or your grandchildren
to dig up and sell.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:05.030
After 40 years under the pig
pen, they've gotten the kind

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:12.510
of surface that they need to
fool people in the market.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.600
Apparently, you can bake them
in various ways and fake

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.560
changes to the surface
by baking them.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.080
And one of the things that
our conservation

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.390
scientists at the museum--

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.540
and conservation scientists
everywhere-- one of the things

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.350
they worry about is every time
they publish a paper, all the

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:37.860
fakers read it and figure out
a way to get around the new

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.910
testing methods that they've
come up with.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.205
So it's very complicated
and challenging.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.820
This is a little Cambodian
bronze.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.520
In real life, it's about
six inches tall.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.090
And it was acquired before
I came to the museum.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.830
And when I first saw it, I
was very skeptical of it.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:01.910
I thought that the style of the
female dancer and these

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:08.180
little tiny figures below the
central female dancer were--

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.250
I couldn't account for them.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.100
And I'd never seen
anything like it.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.440
And I searched, and searched,
and searched, trying to find a

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.690
piece of this size and this
orientation, with this kind of

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:20.530
frame around it, and so on.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.120
And I absolutely couldn't
find one.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.560
And I was very skeptical.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.640
And we never put it on view
because I thought that it was

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.840
probably a fake.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:35.070
But then we did an alloy
examination and the alloy

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.030
comes out fine.

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.050
This is what it should
look like.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:43.080
And then eventually
I found a picture.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.820
In a archaeological book
published in Thailand, I found

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.810
a picture of a quite similar
piece that came out of an

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.930
archaeological context.

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:57.690
So finding this picture with
a similar frame, a similar

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.910
dancing figure-- this one
is male of course

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.030
and this one is female.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:07.650
But anyway, it made me feel
much more comfortable that

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:12.360
something like this could
have existed.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.410
And we would show it
at the museum now.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.090
I feel confident enough that
it's genuine and old, that we

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.100
would display

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:25.680
So finding the comparable
is very important too.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.720
For some kinds of things, a
standard Buddha image, there

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.430
may be millions of
comparables, so--

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.680
millions is too many, but
hundreds of comparables.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.560
But for an unusual piece like
this, just to find one

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:44.345
undoubtedly genuine comparable
is very helpful.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:50.550
Then there's a whole category
of things for us where we've

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.380
never been able to--

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.570
well, where we've gotten the
questions involved care of.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:03.910
This head of a Buddha image from
central Thailand, when I

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.990
first came to the museum and
saw it, I thought it was

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.340
almost too good to be true.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.490
It's so beautiful.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.940
It's in such good condition,
that I was very concerned.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.860
But we did the tests on it.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.540
We got typical alloy.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.450
And the thermoluminescence test
gave the right kind of

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:21.830
dating range.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:27.356
Notice though that the test
typically gives a span of 200

00:22:27.356 --> 00:22:31.040
or 250 years.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.750
If you're trying to figure out
whether something was made in

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.960
1500 or 1600, the test doesn't
do you any good.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.680
It's not exact enough
for that.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.660
But if the question is was it
made in 1950 or 1550, then the

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.740
test is plenty good enough
to be helpful.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.780
This Buddha image came from the
collection of Doris Duke,

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.450
in her day one of the richest
people in the

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.030
world, in the 1950s.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:08.830
Her family were among the
founders of Duke University.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:13.230
Her ancestors had owned the
American Tobacco Company, a

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.840
very, very, very wealthy
heiress.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.340
And Doris Duke collected
Southeast Asian art.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.480
And eventually after her death,
a large part of her

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.310
collection was given to
the Asian Art Museum.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:29.030
And I had picked out this object
from her collection to

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.030
take for the museum, thinking
that there was a pretty good

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.620
chance that it was genuine.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.620
And that even if it wasn't,
since it was coming to us as a

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.830
gift, there was no reason
not to take it.

00:23:43.394 --> 00:23:45.240
If there was any chance
that it was

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.210
genuine, was worth taking.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:52.870
And we did the tests on it
and got good results.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.610
And also just getting it into
the museum, and getting it

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.440
cleaned up, and getting
a chance to look at it

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.460
carefully, and getting new
photography made, it's amazing

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:05.810
how much better things look
after they've been put at the

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.800
right height on display, and
photographed beautifully, and

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.090
had good lighting.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.850
It makes an enormous
difference.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:23.510
Now, this is a glazed clay,
low-relief sculpture.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:29.870
In real life, it's about almost
two feet tall and very

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.560
challenging.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.380
There are a series of these that
are in museums and that

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:41.440
have been appearing in the
market over the last probably

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.420
generation and a half.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.810
And they're very puzzling.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.470
We have three.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.670
I'll show you our three
in a minute.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.670
And all three of ours have had
thermoluminescence tests and

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.680
they've all been inconclusive.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.390
And some other museums have done
thermoluminescence tests

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:07.600
on their ones of these, this
exact same type, supposedly

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:13.010
from this exact place and this
exact period in Central Burma.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.160
And the thermoluminescence
tests have often been

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.280
inconclusive.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.690
And inconclusive means
inconclusive.

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:22.660
It doesn't tell you anything.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.640
It just means that for one
reason or another, the test

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.130
won't work.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.880
And one of the problems--

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.180
this doesn't apply to Burma--
but for instance in Indonesia,

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.210
when you try to do
thermoluminescence tests on

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:42.300
Indonesian clay objects or
bronzes that have clay cores,

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:47.210
you often get no result at all
because of all the volcanic

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.880
activity and the
volcanic soil.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:56.060
All the volcanic activity has
messed up the accumulation and

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.950
loss and reaccumulation
of radiation.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:03.120
So for Indonesian things, often
you can't get a good

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.290
test result.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:11.120
On grounds of style, and on
reading the inscription up at

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.340
the top and so on, this one has
always thought probably to

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.250
be genuine.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.490
The temple that it came from,
the temple site that it came

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.630
from is still there in Burma.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.450
It's fallen completely
into ruins.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.460
It was brick and it collapsed
100 years ago.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:34.930
Very little was left, except
piles of collapsed bricks and

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:40.070
some of these glazed
ceramic sculptures.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:45.810
And they were removed by
whoever, 100 years ago.

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.490
And then made it into
museums in Burma.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.570
Made it into the West for the
Western market, made it into

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.970
museums and so on.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:59.860
Here's another one, supposedly
from exactly the same site,

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.170
also glazed ceramic.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.630
And in this instance,
we retested.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.020
And the second time we
did the test, we

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.680
got a credible result.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.880
But we still don't feel
too secure about it.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.330
If the first test was
inconclusive, and a second

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:25.550
test got a kind of result that
would make us happy, it still

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.520
leaves us uncertain.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.600
Because if you test it the third
time, who knows what

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.560
result you would
get yet again.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.460
And here's the third one
in our collection.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.820
All of these are these wonderful
sort of whimsical

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.820
demons getting overcome
by the Buddha's power.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.730
And this one had an inconclusive
TL test.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.440
So what do we do?

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:57.340
Well, going back to the first
one, a scholar who lives in

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.780
the Bay Area, who's a specialist
in ancient Burmese

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:04.120
material, has spent a lot of
time at the site where these

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.740
were originally installed, the
temple in Central Burma where

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.520
they were originally
installed.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.570
And he picked up at the
site this fragment.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.030
And you can see that this
fragment is just like this.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.140
It's a skirt, and legs,
and a foot.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.390
So we brought this into our lab
and compared this side by

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:30.270
side with this, and this one
having come from the site.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.900
And our conservation scientist
then felt quite confident in

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.530
saying that the materials of
this, the glazing of this, the

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.870
weathering of this is quite
uniform, quite consistent with

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.590
this piece that came from
the site itself.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.890
And so we feel vindicated in
thinking that this one is

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.990
genuinely old.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.350
Then of course you hit
the books again.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.260
And one of the things that's
very important to

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.870
archaeologists and art
historians is old photographs.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:08.090
So this is a book published in
1892 filled with photographs

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:10.370
taken before 1892 obviously.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:19.980
And this is a bunch of these
glazed, fired clay panels with

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.780
demons and other figures
in them.

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.730
Here they are piled
up at the site.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:28.150
And our two don't turn up.

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.470
But this one of ours
is clearly in the

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.090
same ballpark as these.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:36.510
And this one of ours
is clearly in the

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.260
same ballpark as these.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:43.210
So finding this photograph
again helped us to feel

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:48.410
confident that ours were
genuinely old and that they

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:49.950
came from this site.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.280
Then there's a whole series of
problems about things that

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:06.820
live somewhere between old and
new or genuine and fake.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:11.070
Here's an instance where a
perfectly good body has a new

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.960
head put on it.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.250
And this is not uncommon
at all.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.340
And it's a point of
pride for me--

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.280
I don't often get these and
I'm going to show you a

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.120
horrible mistake that I
made in a few minutes.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.080
But it's a point of pride
for me that--

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.240
when I first saw this,
I said to myself, the

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.560
body's got to be OK.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.930
The head's got to be new.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:36.580
And when we did a lot of
testing, X-raying, the TL test

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.130
on both the body and the head,
this idea was confirmed, that

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.460
a new head has been made
and put on a body.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.410
Because obviously, a body with
no head will bring much less

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.680
money on the market,
than a body with a

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.700
nice head like this.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.230
We may pull the head off
one of these days and

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.350
just display the body.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.780
But for now, we're keeping it
like this because it's an

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:06.820
interesting model for people to
look at of a part genuine,

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.990
part new object.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:11.100
Here's another instance
where the head and the

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.850
body don't go together.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:14.880
But they're both old.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.520
So a genuine old head was put on
a genuine old body that it

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.770
didn't belong to.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:31.230
Or this one, this is a glazed
ceramic elephant.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.360
In real life, it's about--

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.610
again almost--

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.340
between a foot and
2 feet tall.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:43.030
And when you see it like this,
it all looks fine.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.750
And we very much hoped that
it would be fine.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.220
I wanted it to be fine because
I wanted to use it in an

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.860
exhibition.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.210
But when our conservation
scientist gave it a good look,

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.520
they found that it has
lots of repair.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.810
So all of the areas on here
marked in red are repair.

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:09.040
So the figures by the legs, and
the figure on the back,

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.030
and the part of this little
stand that has the vase in it

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.560
on the elephant's back, all
made new and added.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.800
And you certainly can't tell it
when you look at the thing.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.920
And this is part
of the problem.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:32.680
The ability of the restorer to
add missing pieces that looked

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.620
just right, and to dirty them
up, and antique them so that

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.930
you're not at all immediately
aware that there's very

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.360
substantial areas
of repair here.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.390
They're very skillful at that.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.740
Here's an X-ray of
the upper part.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:54.020
And so you can see for instance
the join here, where

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.360
the lower part of this
body may be real.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.260
The upper part is new.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:05.570
The little vase on the back of
the elephant is genuine and

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.820
old, but it may not go
with this elephant.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:14.620
Everything between it and the
elephant's back is new.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.870
And so we don't know whether
that was just lost, but the

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.190
original little vase still was
there and was able to be put

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:23.680
back or whether a new
little vase--

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.540
not a new, an old, different
little vase was

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.360
added to this elephant.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.800
Then we work on this
stuff all the time.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.010
And we've got a number of
questions that we've never

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.940
been able to answer.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:48.600
This metal Buddha image from
Burma was acquired by the

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.480
museum, again years ago,
before my time.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.280
And if it's genuine and
old, it's a very rare

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.930
and important piece.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:04.820
Here's a Buddha image in Burma
of undoubted authenticity,

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.540
undoubted age, that this
one is related to.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:14.260
And it could be related because
they were both made in

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.650
the year 1200.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:19.760
Or they could be related because
this one is simply a

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.760
copy or a forgery of a piece
rather like that.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:30.060
One of the challenges with
this one is that it's a

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:35.040
strange alloy of copper,
zinc, and nickel.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.170
But this alloy was used
in Southern China.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.210
It may have been used in
Burma in the old days.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:45.750
So even though it's a very
strange alloy, we

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.949
haven't been able to--

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:52.909
well, what we have found is that
this strange alloy does

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:56.909
occur sometimes in areas not
too far away from Burma.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:01.460
So the strange alloy doesn't
in itself disprove the

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.830
authenticity of the piece.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.470
Then this one is another
one from the Doris Duke

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:08.080
collection.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.030
And it seemed to me clear that
the head and the body don't go

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:12.820
together in this instance.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:19.040
We've now tested them both and
both the head and the body

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.660
seem to be new from the
thermoluminescence test.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.620
But I'm still not convinced.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:29.475
I still have a notion that
the body is old and

00:35:29.475 --> 00:35:31.760
that the head is new.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:38.060
And there's still a possibility
of how the test

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.900
results could be in this
instance confusing the issue.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:49.100
Because if the head was
essentially welded on to an

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:55.240
old body, the heat from the
welding may have reset the

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.480
radiation accumulation
in the body.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:04.550
So there are scenarios where
a repair to a genuinely old

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:09.840
object completely messes up the
thermoluminescence reading

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.990
and so you get a
false negative.

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.610
This one remained unresolved
though.

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:17.860
This is the back of it.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.780
This is what a TL test
report looks like.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.060
We send them to Oxford
in England.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.490
That's the big lab.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.060
And you get back this
thing saying, less

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.460
than 100 years ago.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.875
Not consistent with the supposed
date of manufacture.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:45.590
Now, a last example.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:51.240
This painting, which is in real
life not much bigger than

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.345
a regular sheet of paper,
it's painted on cloth.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.520
And it's really beautifully
painted.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.900
And I was very excited when it
came to the museum as a gift

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:14.020
because there are plenty of big
paintings on cloth from

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.450
Thailand, from the
19th century.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:20.990
But we've never found one
made before about 1800.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.210
And they must have existed.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:26.500
And in the tropical climate
of Thailand, things don't

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.530
survive very well.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.860
But it seemed like that since
there are plenty from the 19th

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:35.910
century, there must be
some from earlier.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:41.510
And I got in touch with Henry
Ginsberg, who at that time was

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.060
a curator at the British
Library in London.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.410
He's a specialist in the
painting of Thailand.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.520
He died a few years ago.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.540
But this was when he was
still very active.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.050
And he was also extremely
excited about this painting.

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.565
And we thought we had made
a real discovery.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.330
This is a manuscript from
the 18th century.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:09.580
And look at the picture.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.030
I'm sorry, it's gotten
washed out.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:14.220
Look at the picture in the
upper left-hand corner.

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:18.200
And you can see that it's very
similar to the one we were

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.050
just looking at.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:25.940
Or this is the one from the
manuscript, the one above and

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.250
the one below.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:32.310
So you can see how this painting
combines the figures

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:37.260
from the manuscript painting
above and the landscape with

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:42.230
the prancing deer from the
manuscript illustration that's

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.860
immediately below it.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.720
And the inscription
also is related.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.900
And Henry Ginsberg at that
British Library was a

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:53.660
specialist in ancient
Thai script and

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.430
ancient Thai language.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:01.610
And he confirmed that the
inscriptions on this painting

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:07.180
were absolutely authentic for
the 18th century or perhaps

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.050
even a little earlier.

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.700
So we were very, very
excited about this.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:17.240
Because we felt that we had
finally found a fragment of

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.990
the tradition of painting on
cloth that existed strongly in

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.680
the 19th century, that
no one had ever

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.280
found an example earlier.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:33.320
And then to make it even more
exciting, we found a exactly

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:36.010
parallel painting in another
museum collection.

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:40.840
This is at LACMA, the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.610
in Los Angeles.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.830
And they have this painting, in
fact exactly the same size

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.540
as the one from the
Asian Art Museum.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.040
I've just blow it up here.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.950
But they're exactly
the same size.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.620
They're both painted on cloth.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.580
They both relate back to
that manuscript that

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.680
I was showing you.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.190
That manuscript is at Harvard.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.470
And both of these
relate to it.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:09.790
So we felt that we must have
found a painting workshop in

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.310
the 18th century or perhaps even
earlier in Thailand that

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.840
produced both illustrated
manuscripts and big

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.090
paintings on cloth.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:28.120
And our theory was that the two
paintings, the one above

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:35.120
my hand here, the one on the
right half of the screen and

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.800
the one from the Asian Art
Museum, were two fragments of

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.440
a much larger painting
like this.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.040
These are two scenes, the Los
Angeles painting and our

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.730
painting, are two scenes
from the previous

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.750
lives of the Buddha.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.940
And in Thailand, there are a
number of paintings, like this

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.020
one in the Asian Art Museum
collection, that show the last

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:02.030
10 lives of the Buddha, one
episode each, stacked up, two

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:04.690
over two, over two, making 10.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:08.670
And so our theory was that the
painting in Los Angeles and

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:13.080
the painting at the Asian Art
Museum were both cut out of a

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.400
large painting like this.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.550
And originally, there would
have been 10 scenes put

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.830
together in a very large
cloth painting, that

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:23.080
later got cut up.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:30.690
Well, then we had an intern--

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.770
I understand that you've
got a lot of interns at

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:33.600
Google right now.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.750
We had an intern--

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:35.920
don't ever get interns.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.980
They'll mess up everything.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.710
We had an intern who got
suspicious of this painting.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:48.160
And she insisted on taking
a sample of the paint and

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:58.995
sending it off to a conservation
center and having

00:41:58.995 --> 00:42:00.410
it analyzed.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:04.210
And they sent back the results,
saying that the paint

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.560
included a pigment called
titanium white, which was

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.950
invented in 1924.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.260
And therefore, the painting
could not have been painted

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.120
before 1924 because titanium
white didn't

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:20.260
exist before 1924.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:24.390
We eventually sent the painting
itself to this lab.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:29.090
And they wrote back and said
microscopic examination showed

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.440
that at some time during its
short history, the painting

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.610
has been pulled over the edge of
a board to induce cracking

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:43.010
and losses in order to suggest
greater age, thus making it a

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:44.760
forgery rather than a copy.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.070
So it was intended to deceive.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:55.060
Somebody had done that with it,
to make it crack and to

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.080
create some paint losses.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.760
And so I wrote this to Henry
Ginsberg and said that I

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.550
didn't believe it.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.630
And Henry Ginsberg wrote back.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:14.510
Before he died, he was the
greatest specialist in Thai

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.440
painting in the world.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:21.370
He wrote back and said, if the
banner, the painting that

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:26.240
we're imagining these two came
from or the Harvard manuscript

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.060
turn out to be forgeries, I
think I'll have to consider a

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.130
new career, possibly in
accounting or auto mechanics.

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.940
I hope it's not too
late to retrain.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:40.680
So he was ready to, at least
in his joke, to abandon his

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:42.940
career for having been
mistaken about this.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.170
What I didn't mention was the
Henry and I had published this

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:50.010
painting as the long lost
early painting.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:54.500
We'd published it in a very
noticeable place.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.890
And then it turned out that
we were completely wrong,

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:58.060
completely wrong.

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.990
We had been taken in by an
out-and-out forgery.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.410
And so this is what we
eventually found out.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.760
Henry Ginsberg tracked
this track this down.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:11.970
A very good Thai painter
was at Harvard for a

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.640
period in the 1960s.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.340
He saw the genuine manuscript
at Harvard and he made

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:21.050
forgeries based on the
manuscript at Harvard.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:24.960
He needed some extra cash.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.480
So he made some forgeries.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.710
And we even know his name now.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.540
He's dead too, unfortunately.

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:33.360
I wish he were still alive
so we could get

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.210
the rest of the story.

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:41.000
But it's an example of people
who have been immersed in the

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.310
field for decades, and decades,
and decades being

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:50.680
completely taken in, in part
because of their wish to--

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.530
I should say our wish
to discover

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:56.040
something that was lost.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:02.840
But we were completely taken in
and learned a sad lesson.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.230
And then of course, we had to
write to our colleagues at the

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.800
Los Angeles County Museum of
Art and say oh, by the way,

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.030
you know that great painting
that we told you about in your

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.430
collection that with so much
more valuable than you thought

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.860
it was, well, it turns
out it's a forgery.

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:22.820
So with that humiliation, I'll
stop and see if you have any

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.374
questions or comments?

00:45:24.374 --> 00:45:26.544
AUDIENCE: Could we go back
to your [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:26.544 --> 00:45:28.370
FORREST MCGILL: Do you want to
know or do you want to guess?

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.110
FORREST MCGILL: OK.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.320
Yeah.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.730
Well, as best we can figure out,
this is the authentic one

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.550
and this the fake.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:43.730
But it's not absolutely certain
on either side.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:47.440
This could be a very,
very good fake.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.940
And there's some outside
possibility

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.820
that this one is genuine.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.750
It's facial features
are kind of funny.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.020
This motif right there in the
middle of its crown is only

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.520
found on fakes that were made
in the 1920s and 1930s.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.490
One of the reasons why the
Asian Art Museum wants to

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:11.040
publish its fakes is of course
any time any museum or any

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.910
collector finds a fake and
publishes it, then we can

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.990
compare against the fakes.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:21.990
And enough of the confirmed
fakes of the 1920s, and '30s,

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:26.680
and early '40s, enough of them
have been seen or published

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.900
that we're able to recognize
certain features like this

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.300
funny little motif right there,
that seem to only turn

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.740
up in the fakes.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.240
So that's very helpful.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.010
AUDIENCE: With the
cross-example, does that take

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:50.120
on its own value as a result of
it's ability to appear as

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.730
if it's authentic and the fact
that a paper has published

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:56.280
about it and then you're able
to trace to the person?

00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:00.027
So now it has its own value
as well, right?

00:47:00.027 --> 00:47:01.280
FORREST MCGILL: Yes.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.472
It's not the great historical
discovery that we hoped.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:13.630
But the person who made
it was an artist.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:17.840
So it's an interesting aspect of
his career, that he's been

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:22.140
shown to have had this little
sideline in making sort of

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.250
learned forgeries.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.570
And it's quite wonderful
painting.

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:31.760
I mean I still like
it quite a lot.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.510
So, yeah.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:36.860
AUDIENCE: And then with the
bodies that are ancient and

00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.740
the head put on that's
only 100 years

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.990
old, what is the value?

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:47.770
Is it still highly valuable
based on the body?

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.910
And is there like a--

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:54.140
not like a chart, or a price
chart, but how do you

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.850
delineate what the value of
all of these things are?

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.590
FORREST MCGILL: Well in that
instance, the value would be

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:02.010
the value of the body.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:05.730
And the head is just an extra.

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:08.810
And if somebody bought it,
they'd decide whether to leave

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:10.100
the head on or not.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.800
And they might put it in their
living room and keep the head

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.690
as a kind of conversation
piece, or to test their

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:22.770
friends, or whatever, or
they might take it off.

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:24.640
AUDIENCE: So you've been
referencing sort of-- you just

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.610
said like '20s, '30s
early '40s.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.710
So basically this is when there
becomes awareness of the

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.040
notion that there's a
market for fakes.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:33.470
And then has this died
out or increased?

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.230
FORREST MCGILL: Oh, the
market is flooded.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:44.510
If you go to a dealer or if you
look at the big New York

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:53.430
and London auctions, in all
likelihood 50%, maybe 75%, is

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.100
very, very, very questionable.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.600
AUDIENCE: And the techniques
get presumably better than

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.590
where they are?

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:00.170
FORREST MCGILL: Absolutely.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:05.590
And as I mentioned, as
conservators find better

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:13.540
tests, then the fakers figure
out ways to simulate the right

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.570
test results.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:18.920
So yeah, the fakes are getting
better and better.

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:25.060
And truly, I mean for a really
great piece of Cambodian stone

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:34.420
sculpture that would sell for
$2 million, it's worth a lot

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:38.730
of time and effort
for a faker to--

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.230
I mean even if they
spend two years

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.980
working on it, it would--

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.360
I mean to make a million
dollars in--

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.540
AUDIENCE: So do you just
not buy things?

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.505
I mean if you've got a three out
of four chance that what

00:49:49.505 --> 00:49:53.790
you would potentially buy would
be fake, do you get to

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.970
these tasks before you buy?

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:59.640
I mean like how does a museum
create a collection?

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.220
FORREST MCGILL: Well, right, how
do we create a collection?

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:08.130
We don't much buy this kind of
material any more and neither

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:09.140
do other museums.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:16.100
Because the issues of smuggling,
and looting, and

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.930
stealing from countries
in Asia is too great.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:25.080
And the Asian Art Museum follows
the UNESCO treaty,

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:29.750
which is that we have to have
clear documentation that the

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:33.980
object was out of its country
of origin before 1970.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:39.860
And that doesn't mean a letter
from your aunt in Switzerland

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:41.530
saying yes, I had this.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:46.040
I mean there has to be a
really credible paper

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.500
trail to show that.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:51.510
Collectors do buy things.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:58.180
If they're smart, they insist
on very thorough analysis

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.260
ahead of time.

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:03.300
But as I hope you've seen,
sometimes no amount of

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:06.350
analysis can ultimately
answer the question.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:11.470
So there's always a
degree of risk.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:16.060
And that's true with-- you know
Jackson Pollock, a New

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:19.880
York artist of the 1940s,
apparently there are numbers

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.750
of fakes of Jackson Pollack's
out there now.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.460
And certainly if you were going
out to buy a Rembrandt

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.050
or something, you'd have to be
very, very, very cautious

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:34.910
about fakes and about the
potential of getting an old

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:39.290
painting, a genuine old painting
that's had a lot of

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:40.640
repair or a lot of

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:43.070
over-painting, or a lot of doctoring.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:48.230
So if you're a cautious
collector, you have to be very

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:53.450
aware of that and do your best
to check all that out before

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:54.770
you get into it.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:56.310
AUDIENCE: So I was curious
for your perspective.

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:59.510
There's was an article recently
about a flurry of new

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.290
museums in China, many hundreds
in a very short

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:03.200
period of time.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.230
And they singled out a
particular museum that had

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:08.950
recently seen a scandal
about the provenance.

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:12.220
Of the 40,000 exhibits, 40 were
deemed to be accurate

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.090
potentially, something
on that scale.

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:17.780
So if you're trying to build
museums or trying to educate

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.120
your population and share
cultural icons, how can you do

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.700
that in a scalable way in light
of the cost, and the

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.270
time, and the expertise that
has to be built over many,

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.990
many years?

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:33.470
What would be your system or
an ideal system short of a

00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:35.720
UNESCO treaty approach?

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.970
FORREST MCGILL: Right.

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:48.590
One good thing is if there's
an archaeological dig and

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:53.820
interesting artifacts are
recovered, in some countries

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.690
they're all very thoroughly
photographed, very thoroughly

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:57.520
documented.

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.930
And then a hundred are sent off
to this provincial museum

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:03.230
and a hundred are sent off to
another provincial museum.

00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:06.890
And that's good way to do
it because A, they're of

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:08.540
undoubted authenticity.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:11.190
And B, they've all been recorded
and inventoried

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.110
before they're dispersed.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:16.870
So you don't lose any of the
information about what was

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:18.260
together in the first place.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:25.740
More and more, museums are
borrowing from each other.

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.350
And that's a good
way to do it.

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.440
We just recently had
a visitor from the

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.945
Portland, Oregon museum.

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:40.380
They want to have their first
gallery of Indian and

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.790
Southeast Asian art.

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:44.460
And we have a lot of very, very
good pieces that are in

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:45.100
our storage.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.010
They're more than
we can display.

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.820
So they're asking
us to consider a

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.930
five-year renewable loan.

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:55.050
And we're inclined to do that.

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:56.090
So that's another thing.

00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:00.590
I mean a lot of museums have
thousands or tens of thousands

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:02.170
of objects in storage.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:05.340
And if they're good and if other
museums want them, then

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:09.570
let's get them out of the
basement and send them around.

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:12.190
AUDIENCE: So in the first
example that you showed with a

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:19.480
head and a body, you said that
you were very clear that the

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.830
head was fake and the
body was genuine.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:25.290
When I looked at it, it did
not seem very clear to me.

00:54:25.290 --> 00:54:29.180
So I was wondering what was
the instant tell for you?

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.400
FORREST MCGILL: Right,
well, one--

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.620
FORREST MCGILL: Sorry.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:34.780
Sure.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.910
One of the things that the
people in the field always

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:40.460
look at is necks.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.540
Because heads have often gotten
broken off at some

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:45.970
point and reattached.

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:49.770
Even the real head gets broken
off and reattached.

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.020
So we're always looking
at necks.

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.250
You may not be able to
see it in this slide.

00:54:57.250 --> 00:55:01.570
But if we had this object here
in the room, you'd be able to

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:05.610
see with your own eyes that
there's something funny at the

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:10.520
neck that suggests that either
a genuine head has been stuck

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:13.050
back on or some other head
has been struck back on.

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:18.510
So when you see that practically
glue mark--

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:20.400
I mean it isn't glue marks,
but you know what I mean.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.560
You see something suspicious
at the neck,

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.950
it raises your suspicion.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.880
And then they're a little
bit different color.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:38.540
The corrosion on the surface of
the head and the body is a

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.760
little bit different.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.950
Now, in itself doesn't
prove anything.

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:47.630
Because sometimes a head has
been broken off early on and

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.830
has been in different
conditions.

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:54.190
The body was more exposed to the
weather and the head was

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:55.940
buried deeper or something
like that.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:00.160
So a difference in color or
corrosion wouldn't necessarily

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.850
prove that it's a problem.

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:05.160
But it's another little thing
to make you suspicious.

00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:11.070
And then all the decoration on
the necklace here, it's like

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:13.390
little wire decoration.

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:15.860
And the crown has some
of that on it too,

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:16.900
but it's quite different.

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:19.230
And you would be able to see it
with your own eyes, if we

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:21.440
had the object here
to look at.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.660
If I pointed it out to you and
I said, look at how different

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:28.860
the way these kind of wire
decorations are put on here

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:32.340
from how they are on here,
you'd be able to see it.

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.940
AUDIENCE: You touched on this
briefly during your

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.120
presentation, but I'm wondering
if you'd expound on

00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.770
it a little bit more, the idea
of there are fakes and then

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:40.890
there are also replicas?

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:44.180
And so if you look at like a
Greek statuary, what we see in

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.180
museums is actually
Roman copies.

00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.970
And your some museums will
display replicas right

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:50.670
alongside the genuine article.

00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:55.320
So what is the role in museums
for displaying like the real

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.540
deal versus teaching
people about the

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.730
culture and the object?

00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:03.850
FORREST MCGILL: Very,
very good question.

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.890
I mean we try to be careful
with our language.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:14.050
So forgery means it's a copy
that was intended to deceive.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:18.850
If we say "copy," that means
we're not sure that it was

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.810
intended to deceive.

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:25.970
The Roman copies of ancient
Greek statues, the ancient

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:27.720
Greek statues don't survive.

00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:30.830
So the Roman copies are all
that we've got and they're

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:31.850
2,00 years old.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:35.490
So everybody thinks they're
worth looking at anyway.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:47.240
And for a lot of the stuff we've
been looking at today,

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:51.780
as far as we know there weren't
copies made until the

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:52.790
20th century.

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:57.286
So sometimes there were copies
made in the 20th century.

00:57:57.286 --> 00:58:01.010
You know if you're a pious
Buddhist and you see a

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:05.050
photograph of a Buddha image
that strikes you as very

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:08.630
beautiful, you go to your local
workshop and say could

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:11.970
you make one that looks like
this because I want it for my

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:16.690
home shrine or I want it to be
able to donate to my temple?

00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:19.380
So that's a possibility.

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.030
It's more complicated for
instance in China operation.

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:27.430
Where, as you may know, with
"old master" Chinese painting,

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:30.330
there's old, old, old
traditions of

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:32.960
both copying and forgery.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:39.720
So a young artist would make
copies not intended to deceive

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:44.400
of older paintings as an
exercise, to learn the

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.760
technique and to master
the skill.

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.910
And those certainly are
shown in museums.

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:56.630
If it's artist B's copy of a
work by artist A, and even

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.550
artist B's copy is 500 years
old that's, very

00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:03.130
interesting in itself.

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:08.110
The problem is that sometimes
artist B's copy, which might

00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:12.020
have an inscription on it that
says I so and so made this

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:18.540
copy in 1520, somebody cuts off
the inscription and either

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:20.850
lets it go without an
inscription or adds a new

00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:25.840
inscription, trying to make it,
after the fact, into an

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.870
original rather than a copy.

00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:36.880
So things that started out life
as non-fooling copies, if

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:43.570
they fall into unscrupulous
hands, get repackaged as the

00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:46.250
genuine article.

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.970
We try our best at the museum.

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:52.590
But if you had been really
watching what goes on in our

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:55.320
galleries over the last 10
years, you would have seen the

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.650
labels in some instances
going up and down.

00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:02.140
And you would have seen things
disappear because we thought

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.840
they were genuine and then we
got serious doubts about them

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.260
and we took them off view.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:13.390
And as I say, in our online
database we try do to stay

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:19.770
abreast of our latest research
and to tell the frank truth as

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:23.270
best we know it because we think
it's interesting and

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:26.070
useful to everybody.

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:27.320
Thanks a lot.
