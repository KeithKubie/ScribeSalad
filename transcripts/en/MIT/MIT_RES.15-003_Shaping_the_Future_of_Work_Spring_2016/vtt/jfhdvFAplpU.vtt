00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.850
My name is Lee Dyer.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.320
I've been teaching human
resource management

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.770
at Cornell University
for 45 years.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.610
I've seen a lot of
change in that time,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.060
but none more profound or more
important than the changes that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.250
lie ahead.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.480
Over the next few years
major transformations

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.460
will be taking place
in the nature of work.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.270
And it will be up to each of us
to decide how these will unfold

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.840
and to make sure that they work
out the way we want them to be.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.830
As this figure shows,
HR professionals

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.330
will be right square in
the middle of things.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.860
Ultimately it is the
human resource strategies

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.620
that organizations enact
which play a major role

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.510
in determining how
many jobs are created,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.250
as well as the
quality of these jobs.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.400
But of course, HR professionals
don't operate in a vacuum.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.530
The number of forces,
global competition,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.280
the emerging technological
developments,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.090
societal pressures, and
labor market conditions

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.860
influence firms'
business strategies,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
and in turn, their human
resource strategies.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.580
And there are a number of key
players in the process as well.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.310
These include labor
organizations of various types,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.620
public policy makers
who make and enforce

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.490
the rules of the
game, and educators

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.010
who are responsible for helping
folks develop the skills they

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.630
need to succeed.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.980
The challenge for
HR professionals

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.840
is to understand the
environmental forces at work

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.630
and to work with the key players
to develop desired results.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.370
And of course, this
means doing all

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.910
they can to be sure that
their organizations have

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.100
enough high quality people to
do the work that needs doing.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.200
But it also means
striving to ensure

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.410
that everyone who wants to
work is able to get a job.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.560
And not just any job.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.400
But one that provides both
a decent standard of living

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.820
and a sense of personal
fulfillment and accomplishment.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.570
This is where our
course comes in.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.040
You will learn how the
important external forces--

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.620
globalization,
technology, and so forth--

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.240
have changed over time and are
expected to change in the years

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.260
ahead.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.460
You also will learn
what can be expected

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.470
of key players in the process--

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.970
labor organizations, public
policy makers, and so forth--

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.520
in the coming years,
and how you can

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.140
work with them to forge
mutually acceptable agreements

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.690
on key issues.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.770
In short, if you are or
are aspiring to be an HR

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.000
professional or a manager,
completion of this course

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.800
will help position
you to influence

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.500
the nature of the changes
that will be taking

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.950
place in the years ahead, both
in the US and around the world.
