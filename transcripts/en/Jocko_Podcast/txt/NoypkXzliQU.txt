Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko, how do you give feedback to someone without everyone taking it personal? I try to give criticism regarding their work or actions while not attacking their character, but unfortunately many feel that it's personal. Yeah, welcome to the world. People don't like crisen criticism and I almost put a no one in the world like skepticism. Okay, so there might be 1e-05% of the world that's really like open and ready for feedback. Right? But most people, even when they, even when they tell you they want feedback, they don't want it. They don't want it. Like, let me, let me give an example. If you echo Charles, yes. We're like you. You made a video and it took you an hour. Don't even don't even, right. You know what I'm saying? Like you could come to me and say, Hey, what do you think? And I was like, well, you know, I think you framed this up wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:55          How w what's your reaction to that? I mean, there's no possible way that you're stoked on that. They're just now, luckily, you know, we know each other. You can detach and be like, all right, let me do. He's, he doesn't, he's not pointing this out to me for no reason, whatever. But what I'm saying is even when you're saying, Hey, what do you think of this? And I criticize something that you work so hard on, there's no one in the world that's happy about that even when they ask for it. So you have to flank people. That's what you have to do. Now he's asking specifically, how do you do this? So here's some things. What one of the things that I do when I want to give someone criticism, I don't give them criticism. What I do is I ask them questions about whatever it is.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Now this is interesting. I'm not even talking about pointed questions. I'm not even talking about like hard questions. I'm Tom. I'm not saying like, why did you do that? Yeah, I'm talking about, hey, why did you do it that way? Like there's a big difference between like, Hey, well why did you do it that way? I mean like instead of saying, Hey, echo, that frame is, doesn't look good. Hey, why'd you frame that up like that? Right? So now I'm getting you to think about it, right? But I'm not going to say, do, how are you going to make that work? You know, I'm going to say, well, hey dude, do you think are gonna be able to make that work?

Speaker 1:          02:08          If you did something and it doesn't go well, I'm not going to say, you know, did you actually think that was a good idea? Instead, I'm going to say, I said again, it's not pointed question. I'm going to say, well, hey, did that unfold the way you thought it was going to unfold? And now you're going to get to answer the question. Now you're going to be the, you're going to be the person that uncovers the fault. It's going to be you, not me. And that makes it so much more palatable to everyone when they're able to say, oh yeah, you know, I saw this over here. And most of the time the person knows the truth. Most of the time the person knows that that thing's not framed up right. They know that their idea wasn't that great. So you don't need to punch him in the face with it cause that's actually gonna make them get defensive.

Speaker 1:          02:51          So you flank them, you ask them the questions, you talk about it, you discuss the subject. And what you do is you guide them, you guide them to a mirror, you guide them to a mirror. And then I think you just have a look in that mirror. You set them up. So they have to look in that mirror so that they can see the problems themselves. And once they see the problems themselves, they can start to correct them. Now sometimes you, sometimes it's your ego that wants, even once they see the problem themselves, do people want them to take credit for showing that? And it's late. You gotta you gotta check your ego. You got to make sure that your ego isn't saying, I want to prove to this person that I know how to frame this up better than you've got to put that all in check. You got to just let, you've got to let them have it.

Speaker 1:          03:38          So in it now, are there situations where you can give really good frank feedback? Yes there is, but you have to have a good relationship with that person or really good, really good relationship with that person. And then usually one of the best ways to, to make this happen is that the feedback, the negative feedback is going both ways. Meaning I want to get negative feedback about my performance from that person so that there's some equity in what's being said amongst us. Right. So I might be low, you know, I might say, hey echo, hey man, I, you know, I did this, uh, I answered this core question on Qa. Did you think that was a good answer? Because I think, you know, I think could've been better. And then you say, yeah, you know, you dragged on and talk too long and whatever, you give me some critique and then I go, oh yeah, hey.

Speaker 1:          04:23          And by the way, the lighting on that didn't look good. Right? And so now we have a little mutual criticism and it's all good. It makes a little bit more palatable to you cause I made the thing. And so that's sometimes works. But what's interesting is even when you do that, some people just don't even freaking care and and they even after they just tear you apart and then you throw a little little like little nick on their shoulder, on their arm, you give him a little nick about something that wasn't great, they still get from [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          04:52          So you have to be really, you have to have a really great relationship with that person to be able to have just that straight, straight feedback. But build the relationships, ask them questions, let them find their own fault if you can, and be their guide. Let them to provide them to that mirror, guide them to their faults. Now of course there are some people that won't even find their own faults, no matter how you guide them into how hard you try and twist them to look in the mirror, you have to let them know you actually have to come out and say what's going on? You have to be more direct. Now, luckily, if a person is the type of person that fails to see their own faults, they begin to fail, right? Because they're making mistakes. That's why their faults, right? They're making mistakes.

Speaker 1:          05:41          And when they see that, oh wait, when you see that and you see that their project is failing, or you see that there are people are revolting against them, or you see that they're missing deadline after deadline, they know that too. And then what you're doing is you're coming to them basically as like a concerned friend that really wants to help them win. And, and pointing out some of these obvious failures that they might not be aware of and you still gotta be gentle about this. But when you come to them, you can come to them as a friend, as a, as a person that really wants them to win. And you can come out out of there looking like the good guy trying to help them get there, their self back on track. So those are some of the, some of the basic strategies that I used to help people do a little course correction if people need a little criticism so that they can, uh, improve their game for themselves, for the team, et Cetera.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Very good, tough businessman. My input people are, people aren't, people aren't people don't like criticism. Yeah. Here to tell you. Yeah. They like praise. You know how, and you know the other side of this coin, if you're a person, which you are and you don't like criticism, which you don't, if you can open your mind to the criticism man, you're going to be so you're going to get so much better about everything that you do. If you can just listen to people without getting ego crazy and thinking about this and just listen, just listen. Nod your head, listen to what they have to say. They're trying to help you. Right. We assume that they're trying to help us. Yeah. Well listen to, I know. Oh yeah. Are there times when they're not? Absolutely. Yeah. Cause you can go in with the assumption that this person just tried to cut me down.

Speaker 1:          07:30          Well then that's not going to get you anywhere. Yeah. Or if you're, if you make the assumption, you know what, I'm going to listen to what this person has to say. What's wrong with that? Yeah. Even if it's an assumption and we're not supposed to assume, if I assume you're getting a one, I'm gonna assume that echoes giving me criticism right now because he wants me to do better and I'm going to take them as as face value as I can. Yeah. That he is trying to help me get better. Boom. Yeah. And yeah, that's actually really correct. If you start at that point, that's your default, right? That, hey, this is to help. Now I might look at your criticism and I analyze it from a detached perspective and I got, I think actually echo is just trying to drag me in the wrong direction because he's jealous and I might get to that point. Yeah. And it'll be more way more obvious. It'll be way more often. If you started at that other place where it's like, okay, it's here, but if you're just default all, he just wants to try to look like he knows a thing or he just wants to, you know, make, if you start out at their place to be, yeah. You can't even kind of discern, you know, if that really is happening or not, not the place to let the police do.
