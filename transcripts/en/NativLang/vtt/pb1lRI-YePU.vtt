Did you know that bees are out there talking to each other right now?

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.070
<v 1>Mm.</v>

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.270
<v 0>The honeybee performs a waggle rotation dance to share information about the</v>

4
00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:13.030
location and distance of a nearby point of interest.

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.970
Let's say you're stuck in a beehive and you're friendly,

6
00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.820
busy beef goes up foraging on her journey.

7
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:21.350
She finds a flower full of powdery Pauline.

8
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.570
She heads back to tell you and the rest of the hive where this flower is,

9
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.400
how distance and direction my friend, she makes a waggle run,

10
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.360
shaking it back and forth real fast while she kind of walks in the straight

11
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.250
line. When she gets to the end,

12
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:40.180
she turns to the left circles back around to the start. Waggle run again.

13
00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:43.390
Now turn to the right back to the start while I go run again.

14
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.570
Turn to the left. You get the idea.

15
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.400
Do we really need like a whole electronic waggle B dance mix?

16
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.990
What's really cool is that the length of this waggle run varies and it varies in

17
00:00:55.991 --> 00:00:59.050
a way that's precisely related to be traveled time,

18
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.420
be travel distance closer to the destination, the shorter the waggle. In fact,

19
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.680
with every second,

20
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.310
a waggle run lasts that B telling you to travel one kilometer. So what?

21
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.070
We have kilometers in miles and bees have Wagga waggles. Okay,

22
00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:18.460
one kilometer ready to go. But go where?

23
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.240
Like a compass up is this bs point of reference,

24
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840
which is the sun up means towards the Sun.

25
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.190
The angle of the waggle run tells you where to keep the sun in your sky while

26
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:34.330
you travel. Combine that angle with your distance and you're ready to go.

27
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.190
Other Info might be it actually hiding in this shake and rotate routine like

28
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.930
familiarity, experience.

29
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.520
Bees might pay particular attention to the smell of familiar flower coming off

30
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:46.690
the dance, or for instance,

31
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.540
or maybe danger with the dancers circling around to do fewer wagon rides.

32
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:54.820
If the destination is dangerous. Target,

33
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.430
if we compare other bees in other parts of the world,

34
00:01:57.431 --> 00:02:01.720
we even find waggle dialects and the possibility of social learning.

35
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.970
That's a lot to take in.

36
00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:08.140
A little be click to buzz on over to animal communication.

37
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.510
And don't forget to subscribe for language.
