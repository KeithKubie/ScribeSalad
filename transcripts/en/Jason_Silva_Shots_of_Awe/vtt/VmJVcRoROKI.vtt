What up, guys?

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.980
Jason Silva here.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.700
And welcome to Shots of Awe
on the TestTube Network.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.270
Shots of Awe is a series
of interviews building

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.960
on my recent work, "My Shots
of Philosophical Espresso."

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.610
Shots of Awe offers a
series of reflections

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.932
on my current thinking
on the human condition,

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:16.390
the ways in which
we use technology

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.690
to transcend all previous
limits, the nature

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.890
of creativity, the nature of
what it means to be alive,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.279
the role of philosophy
in everyday life.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.445
Think of them as inspired
nuggets of techno rapture.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.510
And we're going to have
new episodes every week.
