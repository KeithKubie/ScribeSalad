00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.577
All right, so this green box, here,

six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.936
11, 12, 13, 14.

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:16.863
Well, that's not 12 whales.

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:18.070

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.417

so that's not 12.

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:24.711

but let's just make sure.

nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:33.395
All right, this one has 12 whales in it.

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:34.788
Let's check our answer.

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:36.181
