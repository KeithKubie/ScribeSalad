00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.330
- [Instructor] Hello.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.990
In this video, we're going
to think about techniques

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.660
for subtracting three-digit numbers.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.983
So let's say we wanted to figure
out what 357 minus 156 is.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.390
Pause this video,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.250
and see if you can
somehow figure this out.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.270
And you don't have to be able to

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.900
because we're going to walk,
work through it together,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.250
but it doesn't hurt to try a little bit.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.770
All right, now let's do it together.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.690
And one way to think about it is

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.420
what if we were to break up the 156

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.560
into its different place values?

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.580
So we view it as 100 and 50

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.770
and six.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.940
So then this could be rewritten as 357

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.400
minus 100,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.480
minus 100,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.630
minus 50,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.420
minus 50, that's five 10s right there,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.200
and then minus six.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.210
Now does this help us?

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.020
Pause this video, and see if you can

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.933
figure out what this would be.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.780
Well, many of you
probably said, all right,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.900
if I have three hundreds and 57

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.230
and if I were to take away 100,

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.303
well, then I'm going to be left with 257.

00:01:05.873 --> 00:01:08.933
And then if I take 50 away from that,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.530
250 away from 257,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.820
well, I have five 10s here,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.960
and I'm gonna take away five 10s,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.520
so I'm gonna be left with zero 10s.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.573
I'm gonna be left with 207.

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:25.230
And then if I took 207 and
I subtracted six from that,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.840
so 207 minus six,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.690
that, of course, is
going to be equal to 201.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.300
I just took away those six ones,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.750
and I had seven ones on top
of the two hundreds before,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.510
to get us to 201.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.310
So this is one very good technique

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.190
for being able to subtract numbers,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.380
and it doesn't just apply
to three-digit numbers.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.430
You could do this with many-digit numbers.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.170
But there's other things
that you could be doing.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.950
You could, for example,
try to adjust the numbers

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.820
to make the subtraction easier.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.590
For example, you could say,
hey, wouldn't it be nice

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.710
if instead of subtracting 156,
I only had to subtract 150?

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.300
And there is a way that you could do that.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.470
As long as whatever you add or subtract

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.500
to one of these numbers
you do to the other,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.580
then the difference will be the same.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.420
So there is a situation where
you subtract six from both

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.300
of these numbers before you
try to find the difference.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.340
So then let me write this out.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.100
So let's say you wanted to subtract six

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.223
from both.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.350
What would this be?

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.670
Well, 357 minus six,
well, we're just going

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.580
to take six ones away
from the seven ones here,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.080
so it's going to be 351

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.280
minus 156

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.500
minus six.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.580
Well, that just gets us to 150.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.720
And this might be, for many of y'all,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.590
a little bit more
straightforward to compute.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.670
You might realize, all right,
if I have three hundreds

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.090
and I take away one of those
hundreds, I get two hundreds.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.050
If I have five 10s and if
I take away those five 10s,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.950
I'm going to be left with zero 10s.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.570
And if I have one one and
if I take away no ones,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.980
I'm still gonna have one one.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.950
Or you could say, look,
300 minus a hundred is 200,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.060
51 minus 50 is just one.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.480
So that was pretty helpful.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.910
Another technique is to,
instead of going to 150,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.610
you might say, well, what
if I wanted to subtract 160?

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.530
Well, in that situation,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.010
you could add four to
both of these numbers.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.080
Add four

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.513
to both.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.500
What would happen then?

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.750
Pause this video, and
try to figure that out.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.010
Well, what's 357 plus four?

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.210
357 plus three gets us to 360,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.790
plus another one gets us to 361.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.081
And if I add four to 156, that is 160.

00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:38.470
And since I added four to both,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.280
I added the same amount to both,

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.230
the difference is going to be the same.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.960
And so if you look through this,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.880
300 minus 100 is two hundreds left.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.210
And then 61 minus 60, that gets us to,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.720
that gets us to 201.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.840
And what I just kind of
did in my head, if I wanted

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.480
to write it out, we could say
this is the same thing as 361

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.680
minus 100,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.470
minus 100.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.040
And I could break it out
completely, like I did up here,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.280
or I could break it out partially.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.910
I could just break out the hundreds place

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.170
and then break out the 60,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.370
so minus 60.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.290
I guess you could view
that as I broke out the 10s

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.190
and I didn't write the ones.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.580
But you can see 361 minus
a hundred would be 261,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.590
and then you take 60 away from that.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.833
Once again, you would be left with 201.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.730
So the big takeaway here is
there's many different ways

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.760
to approach subtraction with
however many digits you have,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.300
and this just gets you a
glimpse of different methods.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.480
And some will be more convenient
in different situations

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.893
depending on what numbers
you are dealing with.
