00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.340
Hi, I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.720
This is the first episode in a
miniseries designed to show

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.520
you how to get started with the
Google Maps SDK for iOS.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.660
In this episode, we'll look at
what you need to do to prepare

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.370
to develop your first
map application.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.940
We'll go over downloading the
SDK, registering for an API

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.940
key, and making sure that you
have the right development

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.780
environment.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.600
In step one, download the latest
version of the SDK from

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.401
developers.google.com.

00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:39.710
This will be linked off
this page, which you

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.960
can click on now.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.190
Once you have downloaded the
SDK, extract the archive and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.110
put it in a folder where
you'll remember it.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.250
For instance, you might have a
dedicated development folder.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.860
Next, you'll need an API key for
use with your application.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.010
The key allows your
application to use

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.540
the Google Maps SDK.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.910
Without it, map data won't
download to your application.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.530
To register for an API key, go
to the Google API console.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.650
You can access it by clicking
on this link.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.210
In the API console, either
select an existing project or

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.330
create a new one.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.570
To create a new one, pull down
the project list and select

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.630
Create and give the
project a name.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.990
Once you've selected a project,
select Services and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.170
scroll down to the Google
Maps SDK for iOS.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.770
Make sure that it
is turned on.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.580
Next, click on API Access.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.620
Scroll down and press
Create New iOS Key.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.480
Enter the bundle identifier
you want to

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.280
associate with this key.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.180
Bundle identifiers help
you identify your

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.630
application to iOS.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.340
If you want to know more about
bundle identifiers, check out

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.085
this link from Apple's
documentation.

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:59.340
To follow along with the
rest of this video, add

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.680
com.example.SDKDemos to your
bundle identifiers.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310
You can also always come back
and add more bundle

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.789
identifiers later.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.920
Finally, let's test
everything out.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.570
There are different development
environments that

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.530
people used to code Objective-C
for iOS.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.390
In this case, we'll
assume that you're

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.190
using Xcode on a Mac.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.460
Make sure you have the latest
version of Xcode and the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.570
latest iOS SDK.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.360
If you need to get that set
up, check out this Getting

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.910
Started Guide from Apple.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.690
Once you're set up, navigate to
the folder with the Google

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.300
Maps SDK for iOS that you
downloaded earlier.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.280
In that folder, you'll find
another folder called Google

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.400
Maps SDK Demos.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.460
Navigate to that folder.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.490
In that folder, you'll see our
Google Maps SDK Demos Xcode

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.810
Project File.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.540
Double-click on it to
open the project.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.650
Select the SDKDemoAPIKey.h
file.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.330
Go to the API console
and find your key.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.380
Copy that and paste it into
this API key string.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.430
This will allow all the demos
in your application to use

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.850
your API key.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.590
Select a simulator
and click Run.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.040
If you choose an iPad simulator,
you should see a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.740
map with a Samples button
in the top left.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.680
If you choose an iPhone
simulator, you should see a

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.900
table of sample options.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.860
Select one of the samples
to see a map.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.960
If the app runs but you don't
see a map, go back and check

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.615
to make sure your key was
set up correctly.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.420
If everything's working,
explore the samples.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.110
This should give you
a good idea of the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.490
capabilities of the SDK.
