00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.230
So with regards to AB testing
I know that startups and

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.520
websites will often do this.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.730
How do you know when to AB test and
when not to?

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.720
I don't have a baseline number for
you in terms of traffic for your app or

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.760
your website.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.690
But my advice to new founders is always,
when you're just getting started,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:21.909
don't waste your time.

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.810
I think AB testing is
extremely powerful,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.950
it's a great way to look at large groups
of customers or visitors at once.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.920
It's awesome.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.468
But when you're just getting started,

00:00:32.468 --> 00:00:34.160
you don't have large
groups of customers.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.300
You've got a trickle at best.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.790
And your job at that point as
a founder is to understand

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.920
those customers the best
you possibly can.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.430
And there's no substitute
in that situation for

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.130
sitting down in front of somebody and
having a conversation, watching them

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.830
use your product, understanding
where you're falling short.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.580
And so
I always advise founders at that stage,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.733
spend your time picking up the phone,
rather than setting up AB testing.

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.530
Wait for AB testing when you've
got a bit of traction and

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.080
you want to start making data
driven decisions that way.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.260
&gt;&gt; So really, essentially it's important
to be close to your user at all times.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
&gt;&gt; I couldn't say that
enough as a founder.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.950
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.180
tell me a little bit more about
how you go about AB testing and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.520
sort of you know what's your
decision behind running the AB test?

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.350
What do you make sure
you want to AB test?

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.360
What should you avoid AB testing?

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.860
&gt;&gt; So first of all there
are a set of features which have

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.540
contradictory kind of
appeal to the user base.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.740
So for example, a lot of people on lock
screen wouldn't want to have the time

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.250
and weather on the right side, but
they want to have it on the left side.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.665
Or they want to have a quick
access to the left and

00:01:41.665 --> 00:01:44.245
the unlock button on the right.

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:46.135
So all these things
have to be AB tested,

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:48.455
we have to understand
how the user behaves.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:53.500
And not just that, for example,
we wanted to disable this home button.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.450
And make sure that the lock
screen has a complete

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.670
pattern protection lock kind of thing.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.000
But we did not do it because
in our AB testing results,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.780
we found out that a lot of people did
not want the home button to be disabled.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.360
&gt;&gt; Oh.
&gt;&gt; So how

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.508
do we disable it without knowing?

00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:12.710
We would have spent a lot of
resource wasting building it and

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.430
which not many people
would appreciate our user.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.060
&gt;&gt; Wow.
Yeah.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.780
&gt;&gt; So, that way we go
through all the AB testing.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.340
&gt;&gt; So, in that case it sounds like you
avoided going down a path that you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.300
didn't want to go.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.650
&gt;&gt; Great.
