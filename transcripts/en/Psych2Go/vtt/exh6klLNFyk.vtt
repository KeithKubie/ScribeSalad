00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.280
So we guess you like someone, which is either great or absolutely terrible. We have no clue.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.800
However, you might be wondering, what are the things that make us attracted to each other? What roles do our brains play?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.800
Well, lucky for you, us at Psych2Go got a list of nine comprehensive facts about attraction.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.720
First off, you've got to sound and smell like you're bigger and better than you are. You fake your smell and sound until you make it.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.240
Studies from the University of Wroclaw -
 thank you, Poland - held a study about the effects of one's sound and smells into attraction.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.700
You can tell a lot about someone from their voice, age, gender, weight, dominance, emotional state, and personality.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.500
So, if you sound more attractive, or even more confident, you'll come off that way.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.600
Then you have scent, where an androgen steroid, called androstadienone, comes into play.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.820
This steroid has an odorless chemical compound which people can smell on each other, which naturally leads to attraction.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.280
This actually occurs in body odor.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.240
Deodorant still recommended.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.880
Secondly, womens' attraction changes throughout menstrual cycle.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.920
According to several studies, women are attracted to different things depending on where they are in their menstrual cycles.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.220
For example, when they're fertile, women like more masculine features, and vice versa when a woman is not ovulating.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.860
Thirdly, men don't value intelligence as much as women,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.900
which I think is pretty self-explanatory, but the stats explain that women are more likely to date less-than-average looking men with higher intelligence.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.020
However, average women with intelligence being deemed attractive by men, is at a 40%.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.660
Four: a study that delved into speed dating found that people who were the most narcissistic, scored higher in attractiveness.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.080
So pretty much, because narcissists care so much about their appearance, that translates to them being more attractive.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.020
So, number five is really shallow.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.540
To stop people from cheating on you, date people in your 'league', or settle for people who are traditionally less attractive than you are.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.860
Which, again, SUPER shallow,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.520
but studies from Harvard showed, that people who felt more attractive than their partners felt less satisfied, and felt like they needed more and cheated more.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.400
Number six: opposites attract.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.840
A study found that people are attracted to a different genetic blueprint than their own,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.820
which lies in our HLA complex, which is crucial to our immune system.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.660
So, supposedly, we can sense each others' HLA complexes through smell, and opposing complexes lead to sexual attraction.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:52.280
Number seven: a study found that beards are hot, and women think a full beard is hubby material, while a little bit of stubble is great for one night stands.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.180
Over to eight: it's better to be weird in pick-up lines.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:05.240
A unique metaphor like, 'your smile is a sea of flowers', is better than 'you're pretty', because it shows that you have some creativity and intelligence.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.120
Finally, women are attracted to people who are like their brothers,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.720
which is pretty much an offshoot of us being attracted to people who remind us of our parents.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.480
So that's all from us at Psych2Go and our nine facts on attraction and psychology.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.380
'Til next time!

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.360
Still, wear some deoderant.
