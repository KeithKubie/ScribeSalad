00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Welcome to Authors at Google
in Cambridge. Today it's my great pleasure

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.560
to introduce one of our great
local mystery writers, a neighbor of mine

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.124
in Newton, Mass., Bill Landay. Bill is the
author of three best-selling books: Mission

00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:19.449
Flats; The Strangler; and a huge runaway best-seller
in 2012, Defending Jacob.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:27.800
He used to be an assistant District Attorney
in Middlesex County District Attorney's office

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.760
and he's gone from torturing
defendants --verbally anyway-- to torturing

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.760
readers.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.530
I know there's at least one other reader here
today who's read this book. I sent Bill an

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.690
email after I finished reading saying,
"This book destroyed me. I am devastated.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.180
[laughter] It is going to take me a long time
to get over this book." Our fellow reader

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.660
there will agree with me.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.550
It's a gripping thriller about a murder committed
in a suburb of Boston, a lot like Newton,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.129
Mass. Actually it is Newton; murder's
committed about a mile from where I live.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:13.189
All the difference in the book is who the
suspect is and the relationships in the family

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.939
of the suspect. It is an extraordinary book,
if you haven't read it, you are missing a

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.849
great experience. It is my pleasure to
introduce the author, Bill Landay.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:23.849
[Applause]

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:31.590
&gt;&gt;Bill Landay: Thank you. We've already been
chatting before so we'll just continue chatting,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.549
I guess. I was a D.A. in Middlesex
and spent most of that time right down the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.389
road at the courthouse here in Cambridge.
So it's very funny to be here because Kendall

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:53.569
Square for most of my life was a ruin. It
was awful. There was a lot of these blocks

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.770
had just be razed, and they were empty lots
and they sat there for decades like that.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.509
And it was--it was strange--in fact there
was, I remember a rumor that went around that

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.739
the empty lots, and again it was blocks and
blocks and blocks of empty lots --and there

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.780
was a story that went around that Kendall
Square was where the Space Center was going

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.290
to be under
Kennedy. This was going to be Mission Control,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.370
and instead of "Houston, we have a problem,"
it was going to be "Cambridge, we have

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.010
a problem," and then Kennedy was assassinated
and L.B.J. came in and the Kennedy family

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.079
hadn't been kind to Johnson and so he moved
the space center to Houston and that's why

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.019
those lots sat there for twenty years and
it was a story that really was too good to

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.170
check, but
I couldn't resist checking it and it's totally

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.480
not true.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.480
[laughter]

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.650
There was apparently some Congressman from
Houston in the fifties and that's why all

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.980
that money was pulled down there and the Space
Center was going there to begin with anyway.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.060
But it's just amazing the Kendall Square has
become what it is now. So it's funny to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.299
be here and good to be here.

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:07.250
Anyway, as Jonathon said, I was a D.A. before
I was a writer. Really, I had never--I had

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.469
never really written anything before and I
got to the age of thirty and had my mid-life

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:19.530
crisis early and thought instead of chasing
the secretary around the desk or buying a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:28.079
sports car, I would try and publish a novel.
Which seemed like an easy enough thing to

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.510
do, I mean, I think everybody who's a
reader and has been a book person has made

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.790
that mistake of thinking that writing is only
incrementally more difficult than reading

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.930
so if I can read a page in a minute then maybe
I could type one in four or five. And so you

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.989
do the math, three hundred pages times
five minutes and that's how long it takes

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.040
to write a novel, and I figured I was a smart
guy so that's how it would go for me.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.739
Shockingly that is not how it works.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:03.950
Well, so I was a prosecutor, I was working
on writing on nights and weekends. I didn't

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.220
actually start here in Cambridge, I started
out in Lowell. Middlesex County extends kind

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.549
of Northwest from here. And at the time, Lowell
was the busiest court in the county

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.449
and it was a really colorful court to be in,
too. You know, if you wanted to try cases,

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.009
it was great; if you wanted to collect
stories, it was a great place to be, also.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.611
I remember my-, very early on there in Lowell
District Court, which is where all of the

00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:39.550
arrests would come in for the weekend, I
remember one of the arrests was an addict

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.860
and a drunk and the story about him was he
was the only guy who ever knocked down Sugar

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.900
Ray Leonard, and he had since become a drunk
and whenever he went to a bar everybody wanted

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.449
to fight the guy who had knocked down
Sugar Ray Leonard. So whenever he went out,

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.870
he would get into these fights and would get
arrested because everyone wanted to test

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.240
him. You know, cut to twenty years later,
and, you know, Christian Bale is playing that

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.080
character and you know these stories that
were

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.460
all around me, it turns out, were every bit
as good and as colorful as they seemed to

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.800
be at the time.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.960
There was another guy who came into Lowell
District Court, and this one I did not actually

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:30.520
see. He was a guy who, they said he was
a man who didn't have a mouth. He had tried

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.680
to commit suicide by, I presume, by shooting
up through the bottom of his mouth and he

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.440
flinched and blew off his jawbone and somehow
the reconstructive surgery had left him without

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.830
a mouth, but no one could really
describe to me what the man without a mouth

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.750
actually looked like and I never got to see
him. Because I was sent out for a trial.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.759
You start off in the first session, which
is the main courtroom, and you're sent out

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.850
for trials to the outlying courtroom and so
I

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:04.889
missed him. So that was always in my head
though and I wound up using that guy in my

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:11.449
first book. There's a guy who tries to
commit suicide that way and winds up with

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:18.259
prosthetic jaw and that's how my first book
begins and that's kind of how all writers

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.830
work, I assume, is that you sort of--. You
gather these chestnuts as you go through your

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:29.389
life and you embroider them in one way or
another. And that's one reason I'm actually

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.129
kind of glad that I didn't start writing until
later in life because I had these

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.169
experiences that I could draw on.

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:45.680
So by the time that I got Defending Jacob,
you know, this was my third book and I had

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.430
been--. I had written a couple of crime novels
and a funny thing happens. You write a couple

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.500
of crime novels and people start calling you
a crime novelist but it never had been

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.340
my goal to be a crime novelist. I, you know,
when I look in the mirror I just see a novelist

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.349
and I was writing about crime because
they were great stories.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:08.000
And that's, you know, that's really what you're
looking for is the best stories to tell, but

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.560
by that time I had moved on from the
D.A.'s office, I was probably ten years out

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.849
of the D.A.'s office by the time this began.
And so my life wasn't about crime

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.110
anymore. I remember in fact when I first left
the D.A.'s office it seemed very strange to

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.970
me that people don't think about crime.
People don't expect to be robbed and raped

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:35.919
and beaten. When I left, everybody that I
had met throughout the day was a victim or

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.819
a cop
or a witness, and so it seemed like this was

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:41.439
just an every day reality.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:45.060
But most people don't think about crime, and
rightly so. Statistically you're just not

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:51.479
gonna be affected for the most part. And so
now I was off living in the suburbs among

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:57.629
people who truly didn't think about crime
very much and yet, you know, we all consume

00:07:57.629 --> 00:08:04.469
these crime stories. It's very funny when
you think about it, that this is, this probably

00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:08.259
our most durable genre, crime stories and
love stories.

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:12.610
But right now, at this particular moment,
it's all crime stories. You can't turn on

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.229
the T.V. without having a C.S.I. rerun or
a

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:23.560
Law and Order rerun. Novel, mystery and suspense
is the dominant genre in literature right

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:33.690
now. So it's funny though that, we
consume these stories in such quantity because

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:39.010
we, the audience, including we, the audience,
right here are very clearly an

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:47.000
audience of non-criminals and, I presume.
And, you know, what is it that we're seeing

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.200
in theses stories? Because a lot times I go
to these readings and it's an audience, a

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.880
traditional mystery audience looks like it's
all older women who are knitting while

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.750
I'm reading to them. It's clear they wouldn't
steal a pencil from CVS, you know?

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.750
[laughter]

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:08.190
And yet they're reading these books, they're
seeing something in them, something is resonating

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:13.830
with them. And so by the time I started
Defending Jacob, this was one of the things

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:21.370
that I was thinking about. Why do we read
about crime? What does it tell us about

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:28.760
ourselves? Why was I writing about crime?
How did I get here? So I've heard a couple

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.640
of theories about this and I started looking
into it because when I think through a problem,

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.590
when any storyteller thinks through a problem,
we think it through as a story.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:44.720
And that's how Defending Jacob kind of began,
but that doesn't mean we go and--we don't

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.010
go and research the thing directly also.
One of the the more interesting formulations

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:58.650
that I saw about this questions is that 'good
men--bad men do what good men dream."

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:06.740
So that this was all sort of a way of us fantasizing
these internal desires or instincts that we

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.470
might have but that we'll never
act on. And you know there's probably something

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:15.100
to that, I don't know if I've found that completely
convincing, but maybe there's

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.890
something to it. Maybe there's something to
it.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:24.630
Another, another idea that I thought sort
of struck closer to home was it's a way of

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:31.330
being exposed to danger without really being
exposed to danger. So that when we close the

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:38.830
book or turn off the TV or leave the movie
theater, we feel--. It's almost a kind of

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:46.880
relief. We say, "as bad as my day is, ordinary
as my life is, I didn't run into Hannibal

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.070
Lecter today. That's good. That makes me
feel good about where I am." And that's sort

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.830
of a,-that sort of rings true to me as well.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:03.260
So, when it came time to write this book,
I had this sort of history as a prosecutor

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:09.640
and I'd had my newer life. By then I was
married. I have two kids, they're now eleven

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.770
and eight. This was three years ago so they
were, well, -you do the math. I'll screw up

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.411
the
math, probably. So I had these two sort of

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:26.950
threads of looking at human behavior, in the
courtroom and through criminal law and when

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.810
you become a parent you look really start
to look at, think about these questions of

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.830
criminal behav-- of human behavior in a more
personal way

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:40.461
because you want to be a good parent. You
want to do right by your kids and you want

00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:43.010
to put them in a position to succeed. You
want your

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:49.100
kids to be good people. So you start thinking
about these questions of nature and nurture

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:59.300
and how to raise a human being and so
these were really personal questions as well

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.810
by that point.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:07.570
So what you have in the story is prosecutor
who combines these two perspectives. He is

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:13.370
a prosecutor. He's a more senior level
prosecutor than I ever was, you would have

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:20.310
to stick about around ten year longer than
I did to become what Andy Barber is. And what

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:25.380
Andy Barber is sort of the master trial lawyer
in this office. He is the guy who tries every

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:31.730
murder; he's the top gun, but he's
also a dad. And he has a teenage son and the

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:42.760
son is sort of shadowy and reticent and very
hard to read. And so Andy is seeing

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:48.450
human behavior from those same two perspectives
and they're brought together when his son,

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:52.460
Jacob, is accused of murdering a classmate.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:58.950
So that's how it begins and it turns out,
as I got into the writing of it and I was

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.820
really well into the writing of it, by the
time

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:07.990
this was developing. It was an interesting
moment to be thinking about what makes people

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:13.370
do the things they do because now that
we've decoded the human genome and we can

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:19.490
start looking at various physical causes for
why we might be what we are, why we

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:28.000
might behave the way that we do. We now have
the tools to begin to study this. And what

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.500
came up that was interesting is there are
genetic markers that are linked to certain

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.790
predispositions. Which shouldn't be surprising
at all to us, because we all know that

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:47.750
all kinds of talent runs in families and wouldn't
be the least bit surprising to us if a great

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.790
athlete father had a great athlete
for child; or a great musician had a great

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.220
musician for a child.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:01.440
These sorts of things that we admire in people
we routinely ascribe to hard wiring. But when

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:07.100
it comes to the less admirable
qualities, violence, criminality, we tend

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:13.750
to, we tend to hold the thumb on the scale
for nurture instead of nature. And that may

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:20.320
be that we just like to think that we can
all be whatever we want to be and all of our

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.920
parents have told us this. "You can be anything.
You want to play major league baseball, you

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.140
can. You want to be President, you can." And
we know deep down that this isn't true.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:38.190
You can't be a concert pianist if you don't
have a talent for music but no mom would ever

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:46.430
tell that to her child. And yet, we
like to, we like to believe that we are made

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:52.280
of infinite possibility and we like to not
think about the limitations of our hard

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.880
wiring.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:01.160
In this case, there is a genetic mutation
that Jacob Barber carries that has been statistically

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.650
linked with a predisposition to
violence. The science in this book is true,

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:11.240
overwhelmingly. I fudged as little as possible
only to make the story work in small

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.690
details, but there is talk in the book about
a 'murder gene' or a 'warrior gene' and this

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:23.220
is a genetic mutation that has been
correlated with a predisposition to violence

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.421
and that is all true. And in fact it has begun
to find it's way into the courts. The

00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:29.870
science is good.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:37.250
There was a very interesting case--just to
digress a little bit--it involved a guy named

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:44.630
Jeffrey Landrigan who grew up as an orphan
in Oklahoma. Didn't know either parent, was

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:51.740
raised by foster parents. At around age twenty,
he was living in a trailer park and he

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:57.160
hanging around with friends and they were
drinking. A fist fight erupted, Landrigan

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.510
produced a knife and killed the guy he was
fighting with. He's convicted of murder in

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:07.760
Oklahoma. In prison in Oklahoma, he tries
to kill a fellow inmate and is convicted again

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.570
of attempted murder. Second consecutive life
sentence. He escapes from prison in Oklahoma,

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:16.490
makes his way all the way to Arizona where
he

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:21.740
commits a third murder. A truly gruesome murder
and he is given the death penalty.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:27.290
He's on death row in Arizona and a fellow
inmate says, "You know, I happen to be from

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:32.000
Oklahoma and I've done time there and there's
an old man there who looks exactly like you."

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.860
And that's how Jeffrey Landrigan found his
father and it turned out both he and his

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:40.830
father have this genetic mutation, the exact
same genetic mutation that Jacob Barber carries,

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:50.510
the MAOA chromosome. He appeals, based
on that, in order to reduce his death penalty

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.130
sentence to life.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:59.840
As we discuss in the book, when this evidence
tends to come up in book it's never to say

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:06.000
"I’m not guilty, let me off completely."
It's always to reduce the level of culpability

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.069
that the defendant is accused of. And that
case made it all the way to the Supreme

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:18.779
Court. I think it was in 2009, Clarence Thomas
wrote the decision, so you know which way

00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:25.289
it's going. And you know he didn't really
consider the scientific evidence and that's

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:30.710
fine, as we discuss in the book, the courts
purposefully lag behind the science because

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.620
you don't want to especially convict somebody
but you don't want to decide either way based

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:39.830
on a cutting edge scientific theory
that's later disproved.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:45.620
So that's kind of the way our system works,
but as we all know, this is a fast moving

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.179
science and as it develops, it's going to
be

00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:56.290
harder and harder to exclude this sort of
evidence from the courts. It's a very interesting

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:00.440
moment to be looking at this
nature/nurture question because, which we've

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:07.190
all looked at since seventh grade. But Mark
Twain or Charles Dickens or anyone else

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:13.500
whose written about this couldn't really look
at the nature side. We can.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:20.870
And that's a new wrinkle on this, and honestly
it's an interesting way to look at it and

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:27.760
I had never seen it treated in a book
before. For some reason, I think that book,

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.730
I think that novelists are a little afraid
of being on the cutting edge, too. Because

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:39.270
what seems like a live issue isn't going all
that novel five years from now and you're

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:46.370
trying to write for all eternity. You're
trying to write hundred year books, and so

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:52.639
we tend to stay away from those sorts of theories
except in fantasy or sci-fi.

00:18:52.639 --> 00:18:57.530
We also tend to, we don't write about the
Internet a lot. I find the Internet is weirdly

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:03.919
absent from modern novels. It may just be
that we don't know how to treat it or it may

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:09.090
be that it's evolving so fast that we're afraid
to write about it because your book

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.230
become anachronistic almost before you can
finish it.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:17.629
In fact, in this book there's some discussion
of Facebook, and this teenage boy's online

00:19:17.629 --> 00:19:22.820
life and I had to explain in the book,
because it took me so damn long to write the

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:29.779
book, that Facebook looked different then
than what it is now. And at the time that

00:19:29.779 --> 00:19:35.610
Jacob Barber's on Facebook, your aunt and
uncle and your mom and dad weren't on Facebook

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.529
and it was a place where kids could
congregate and that's obviously not true now.

00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:45.580
And so it's very hard to capture the Internet
because it moves so fast and you're trying.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.320
You don't want to get caught up in that,
you want to talk about the essentials of human

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.830
behavior. So the result of that, I think,
is that novelist shy away from talking

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:02.341
about the Internet even though it's a--obviously
a massive presence in modern life. To the

00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:07.260
extent that novelists write about the
way we live now, that's this gaping hole in

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.559
our work. All of which have nothing to do
with Defending Jacob.

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:13.039
[Laughter]
A good digression.

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:17.220
Anyway, that's where Defending Jacob started.
It is weird that it happens in Newton where

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:23.530
Jonathon and I live. I'm doing my part to
depress real estate values in Newton. But

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:28.460
the park is real; the schools are real. You
know my kids go to school in Newton and the

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:32.240
descriptions of the schools are completely
accurate.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:37.830
And this was another sort of thing that I
wanted to address in this, when we're talking

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:45.909
about we audience of non-criminals that
consume these crime stories what is it that

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:51.710
we're thinking about when we make that act
of projection, we project ourselves into a

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.840
story like this, is it purely a fantasy?

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.499
Because clearly the old ladies who were knitting
while they read these stories, or while they

00:20:59.499 --> 00:21:03.769
watch Law and Order, they're not
thinking that this is going to be a story

00:21:03.769 --> 00:21:11.080
that involves them personally. To them, and
to most people perhaps, crime happens elsewhere.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.640
It
happens to different people, to a different

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:18.789
kind of people. It's not something that I
am likely to be involved in. That's every

00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:25.120
audience member's conceit. And you know, I
wanted to close that up. I wanted to write

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:31.990
a story where the audience couldn't really
distance themselves from this family. Where

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:38.590
this was sort of an ordinary family and there
was nothing exotic about them, and this

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:43.320
is, this is you. This is you to the extent
that the 'you' is anybody.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:50.130
It's sort of hard to say what a typical audience
member looks like so it's hard to write a

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:55.100
novel about an 'everyman.' So when I
designed an 'everyman,' I designed an audience,

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:59.929
I designed a character that looked like me.
The Barbers' home in Newton looks

00:21:59.929 --> 00:22:07.210
suspiciously like my own. Andy Barber has
suspicious similarities to me, and that's

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:13.411
sort of how it works. You know, you make that
active projection with yourself first. You

00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:20.150
imagine yourself into the story and you bring
the audience along with you. So that's how

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.330
that, how that sort of began.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:28.870
And happy to take questions and talk about
the book. Have you all read the book? Or anybody

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:29.870
read the book?

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:30.870
Nobody?

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:31.870
Okay.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:32.870
Two?

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:35.670
All right, it's one of those books I should
say where you have to be careful talking about

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:43.740
it because to give away too much really [laughter]
impacts what the readers experience of the

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.980
book. I sort of think that is one reason that
the book--. We were talking earlier why this

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:57.080
book has taken off the way it has. It's been
an incredible ride, it's been an outrageous

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.950
success. The day it published, it hit
number one at Barnes and Noble before lunch.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:11.330
This is on the pub day. It's been really fun
and we're trying to dissect why that

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:16.299
might be, and I think one reason that it might
be is that it's sort of aimed at a mainstream

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:23.070
audience but I come from a background
of writing suspense and it's plotted suspensefully.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:33.059
And I find when I read mainstream fiction
a lot, you know maybe it's that I'm Internet

00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:41.840
addled and my attention span is as limited
as everyone else's now, I find that books

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.590
are feeling a little long. And I think they
do need to get a little shorter and they need

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:54.340
to take more seriously the implicit promise
that the novel is an entertainment first.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.779
That you give me eight to ten hours of your
time, and I'll give you a reason to keep turning

00:23:58.779 --> 00:24:06.000
the pages. That's the basic bargain that the
writer and reader make and I don't

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.369
know that a lot of mainstream novels follow
through on that. I think that this book is

00:24:14.369 --> 00:24:21.360
plotted suspensefully and written in a more
dense and literate tone and so it sort of

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:26.289
falls between the stools a little bit but
to people who are used to sort of book club

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:33.299
books, mainstream literary fiction, it feels
faster. It feels more taut and suspenseful

00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:35.539
and that's worked in my favor. [chuckles]

00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:41.570
I can't say that I calculated that but it's
helped so I'll take it. I've got bills to

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:42.990
pay, too.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.990
[laughter]

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:49.530
So, yeah, to the people who read it, you know,
any questions you have that don't give away

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:50.530
too much.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.080
&gt;&gt;Female #1: [inaudible] Yeah.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.220
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: All right, yeah, I know it's
hard, but I've toured for this book. I can

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.890
talk for hours and say absolutely nothing
so--

00:24:58.890 --> 00:24:59.890
[laughter]

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:00.890
It's an acquired skill.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.090
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I will say that I read it on
vacation and I was totally a wreck afterwards.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.090
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: Oh good!

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.179
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I was like augh---

00:25:06.179 --> 00:25:08.559
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: You mean that in a good way,
right?

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:10.279
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Yeah.

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:11.990
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: Yeah.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.990
[laughter]

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.220
Yeah, it's one of those books, I think, because
it's sort of--. You know it's about family;

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:24.259
it's about parents and children and about
how well can parents know their kids; how

00:25:24.259 --> 00:25:31.909
well can a husband know a wife. It's about
a family of three that all keep secrets from

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:37.299
each other and that all has trouble communicating
with each other. And the idea that you can't

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:43.190
really know even the people who are
closest to you is poignant and is hard. And

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:49.170
yet, it's a cliché, you know, we're all born
alone and we all die alone, and there's a

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:54.080
limit to how much we can connect, you know?

00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:02.480
And that's kind of what this book touches
on and so it's an intimate feeling. But that's

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.940
sort of--. To me, that's the power of books
too. That we're sort of, we are all alone

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:13.360
in the end. We go through life alone no matter
how close we are to the people around us.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:21.950
Books alone, novels alone, give you the ability
to step into someone else's consciousness.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:26.779
All other art forms, movies, theater,
whatever it is, you are always looking at

00:26:26.779 --> 00:26:31.409
the character from the outside. You're sitting
there passive and you're watching them, and

00:26:31.409 --> 00:26:37.490
that mimics our experience of life. You can't
know what it's like to be me; I can't know

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:42.249
what it's like to be you and that's kind
of as far as we can go.

00:26:42.249 --> 00:26:47.990
But in a book, you can transcend that. You
can slip into Andy Barber's thoughts and for

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.080
three hundred pages, you can get some
indication, some sense of what it would be

00:26:52.080 --> 00:27:00.720
like to be him. And that is the power of books,
and that's why I'm actually optimistic

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:06.249
about this. I don't think, despite all the
panic, books aren't going away. This is a

00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:07.249
very very powerful medium.

00:27:07.249 --> 00:27:08.249
Yeah. Anyway.

00:27:08.249 --> 00:27:09.249
[soft laughter]

00:27:09.249 --> 00:27:11.190
&gt;&gt;Female #3: One of the things that I appreciated
after I started reading it was, typically

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:15.669
I think we, in some kind of
crime or mystery involving the legal system,

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:22.029
for example Law and Order and any of the other
iterations of that, you have this team

00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:28.759
of people who are obviously very united, working
against the lone bad guy or the lone bad guy

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:44.999
group. But it was, like you said, you
can't ever really know anyone that intimately

00:27:44.999 --> 00:27:47.489
and everyone is still their own person.

00:27:47.489 --> 00:27:53.629
And you see that between the three members
of the family. They're all very distinct in

00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:59.450
kind of their journeys through what happens.
It's not, I mean, yes, it's united in that

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:07.629
they all are defending Jacob, but they all
have like these internal struggles and these

00:28:07.629 --> 00:28:12.710
different dynamics happening just very personally
for them at that time that don't transcend

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.179
the entire family. And it's not like you're
seeing this

00:28:14.179 --> 00:28:21.691
like happy, "oh, there's going to be a good
ending and resolution because they're all

00:28:21.691 --> 00:28:26.149
in this together." It's not like that.

00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:27.149
And that was interesting and I think much
more realistic to me as a reader because that's

00:28:27.149 --> 00:28:28.149
how it is. You fight with your own
family and you feel that way. You know, you

00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:32.990
are not always on the same page for the same
reason, you might be moving in the same

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:46.220
direction for a number of different reasons,
but it's not just like good versus bad, you've

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.809
got all these different positions of the
chess pieces.

00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:53.720
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: Yeah, and I that's--. You know,
we've all had that experience, we're not going

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.899
to have children or siblings that are
accused of murder. We're not going to know

00:28:57.899 --> 00:29:04.179
what that's like, but we all do know that
feeling of someone in your family doing

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:08.309
something you're not proud of. We've all argued
with a brother or sister, or with our mother

00:29:08.309 --> 00:29:15.380
or whatever it is and just known
what it's like to not be proud of a family

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.429
member; to be ashamed of a family member,
whatever it is.

00:29:18.429 --> 00:29:24.460
You know, that conflict is difficult and it's
particularly difficult where you think the

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:32.710
person has genuinely done something wrong.
I mean, in this case, if you were in Andy

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:37.840
Barber's position or the mother, Laurie Barber's
position, imagine that you did have a

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:44.529
child who was dangerous. You have an obligation
as a parent to support your child obviously

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:49.549
and to be loyal to them, but you also
have an obligation as citizen to all of your

00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:56.590
neighbors to keep them safe as much as you
can. To uphold the law. And if you don't

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:02.279
live up to that obligation and your child
does do damage, to the extent that you could

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:10.519
have minimized that danger, you do have some
kind of moral debt there. And so these parents

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:15.369
are both torn in different ways and for different
reasons how about how to reconcile

00:30:15.369 --> 00:30:20.789
that conflicting obligation. How far do you
go?

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:30.179
When you become a parent, it's--. It becomes
a live issue when it's just arguing with the

00:30:30.179 --> 00:30:35.620
sibling or whatever it is. Because your
kid goes off to school and you know, when

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:41.369
he's catching the fly ball or bringing home
all "As" , or he's in the school play, it's

00:30:41.369 --> 00:30:47.899
very easy to be proud and yet it is routine
that there are arguments in school that your

00:30:47.899 --> 00:30:53.179
kid will say the mean thing. Will be the
bully, whatever it is in a given situation,

00:30:53.179 --> 00:30:58.169
and how do you as a parent respond to that,
you know?

00:30:58.169 --> 00:31:04.610
When my kids were born, I thought my obligation
was to be their champion and to back them.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:08.409
And you quickly realize that you can't
do that. You can't be on their side every

00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:14.279
time because you will realize that they often
misbehave. They often do something wrong

00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:25.169
and you need to teach as well. And so there's
a conflict there and, to some extent, the

00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:30.960
position of the Barbers as parents is just
is just the position of every parent. It's

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.950
just writ really, really large. You know most
people won't be pushed to those kind of

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.750
extremes, but--

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.750
Yeah?

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:48.239
&gt;&gt;Female #4: I wonder if this is partly the
time we're in that [inaudible] living in Newton,

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.590
I always glance at
the police report.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.590
Bob Landay: Mmm hmm.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.590
&gt;&gt;Female Speaker 4: [unintelligible]

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:54.320
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: Do you? [Bob laughs] I never
look at that.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.190
&gt;&gt;Female #4: We have seen maybe two of the
children the kids went to high school with

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.340
turn up in a domestic situation at
home where it turned into a domestic violence

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:07.831
situation and somebody was frightened enough
to call the cops--

00:32:07.831 --> 00:32:08.831
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: Mmm hmm.

00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:11.529
&gt;&gt;Female #4:--and then the whole town sees
it. And we knew them; they were all good people,

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:12.529
and--

00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:13.840
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: Right, right.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:19.990
&gt;&gt;Female #4: --seemingly to be happy people
and took good care of--

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:22.320
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: And still may be good people--

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.320
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Oh, yeah.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.970
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: I mean, good people do bad things;
bad people do good things; good families produce

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:34.970
bad kids; bad families produce
good kids and it's just a complicated thing.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:43.659
And that's why it's hard in thrillers, in
the ordinary run of the mill because the temptation

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:50.289
is to flatten these characters. And if
you make your villain into a monster, then

00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:57.350
it becomes very easy to plot because it's
very easy to go after a monster. But I didn't

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:02.809
want that; I didn't want Jacob to be a monster.
I didn't want this to be The Bad Seed, or

00:33:02.809 --> 00:33:06.679
The Omen, you know, where Damien has the
beady black eyes and you know, the minute

00:33:06.679 --> 00:33:13.139
you look at those beady black eyes, that this
is the monster.

00:33:13.139 --> 00:33:21.059
So you know, we do know these people and it's
interesting when--. I was talking with a defense

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:26.789
lawyer the other day because when
you're a prosecutor, it’s--. You know you

00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:29.499
have all this expertise, but your expertise
is only in criminal law.

00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:30.499
[audience chuckles]

00:33:30.499 --> 00:33:35.009
So if you're going to leave the office and
not be a career prosecutor, the only place

00:33:35.009 --> 00:33:42.049
you can go is to criminal defense. A lot of
D. D.A.s get into it because you want to wear

00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:47.730
the white hat and you, at least, feel like
that is what you are doing. And to some extent

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:54.049
you are. But you quickly realize that it becomes
more complicated than that. And so I was talking

00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:58.700
to this defense lawyer and we were
talking about just this: "Do you feel, when

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.940
you defend somebody--. Say you defended a
rapist and he gets out and he

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:09.730
re-offends." Serial rapists are run of the
mill, you know. And I asked him, “Would

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:15.620
you feel any culpability, would you feel any
guilt?" And he said, "No, not at all." And

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:20.420
he said, "When you get to know these people,
you start seeing them as people and you

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.040
don't say 'Well, he's a rapist,'--you say,
'He's Joe and he comes from this or that background

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.669
and he has this or that
psychological difficulty' and that makes it

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:35.000
very easy to defend him." And from the prosecution
side, you're always on the other side of the

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.160
courtroom and you never get that opportunity
to humanize these people.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:48.790
So it's a difficult thing and again back to
this question, what makes people do what they

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:56.620
do? What makes us what we are? What makes
us? What is this experience of being us?

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:02.660
And we've all ourselves done things that we're
not proud of. We all have our little secrets,

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:10.350
our secret shames. To begin to
understand yourself is to accept that there

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:16.730
are these parts of you that are--. I don't
know if I'd say beyond your control but very

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:23.540
very complicated and where your motivations,
well, can't even be called motivations properly.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:29.430
You might be what you are and there's
only so much you can decide to do or not do.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.910
It's a scary thought.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:34.470
Yeah?

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:44.670
&gt;&gt;Female #5: Having done this, as a writer,
what unfinished business do you have for the

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.670
next book?

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.670
[Bob laughs]

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:48.780
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: This is it, I've answered my
questions. I can just kick back and retire

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.780
now.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.150
&gt;&gt;Female #5: This would be great. If it works--

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:58.610
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: It would be great. You know
it's funny, I don't--. First of all when I

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:03.890
was writing this, I never had this sense that
this is the book, this is the big break out.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:11.950
This is the sum of all my business as a writer.
I just thought it was the third book.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:16.640
I thought it was incrementally better; maybe
incrementally more interesting. Or at least

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:22.870
aimed at a broader market then what came before.
But then I hope that I should always be improving;

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:27.040
that I should always be getting incrementally
better. So when this book

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:35.230
exploded, it came as a surprise to me and
I still think of it as having nothing to with,

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:42.290
– your job, your growth as a artist. I don't
mean to be too highfalutin' about this, but

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:48.000
you're always improving along a much longer
arc in trying to get better and better and

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.840
that's some books sell a lot and some sell
a little. Has nothing to do with that steady

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.820
arc of improvement. So I kind of feel that
this is one data point here and that's here;

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.070
the sales might be up here, but the book is
where it is and, you know, I hope to keep

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:07.160
going.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.260
The next book gets, and I hesitate to talk
about the next book because everything always

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:17.650
changes so what I tell you now, by the time
I get back to my car, could be out of date.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:18.650
[laughter]

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:28.930
So, it's about this question of evil. What
makes people to do--? What enables people

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:37.270
to do the things that they do? We talk about
evil as if it's this free floating force.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:42.890
We talk about it as a noun when it's really
an adjective. It's part of all of our

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:51.610
capability and that's kind of what I wanted
to continue exploring. This sort of, the idea

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:57.410
of Jacob Barber as sort one embodiment
of what our capabilities are is interesting,

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:02.370
and it's interesting because of his background
and his particular characteristics, but

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:10.710
the idea that this is some shadowy unknowable
boy with all of these influences, physical

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:16.770
and social, that drive him to be the things
that they are, removes him in a way from the

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:25.340
ordinary. And I want to, I wonder what would
happen if the ordinary, if the Barber

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:31.540
really brushed up against someone who was
evil and who truly was capable of this and

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.580
what would that mean? And what would they,
as

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.320
lawyers, as in Andy Barber, how would they
react to that?

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.030
And that's kind of the idea. I can't really
get into specifics, not because I'm being

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.410
cagey, but because I really don't know them.
[laughter]

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:51.671
And this is the great frustration of this
year is that it's been--. As much as a fun

00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:58.850
ride that it's been being out there with
Defending Jacob, it's distracting. And it's

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:05.440
distracting out of proportion to the actual
time doing it. I was having this discussion

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:13.280
with another writer the other day about why
this throws your writing so off the rails.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.590
And the common question that I get is, "Now
do you feel all this pressure to write a book

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:25.030
that's another hit?" And I kind of don't because
I feel like I'm my own harshest

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:31.951
critic by far and so the idea that somebody's
going to say mean things about my book, is

00:39:31.951 --> 00:39:38.010
I promise you, they could not say meaner
things than I say to myself.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:46.240
So you do want to improve though and that's
kind of where it's at. But it's been hard

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.600
having the book take off because when you
come to events like this, I stand in front

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:58.040
of you now and I'm the public face of an author
and you know you all look at me in a

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:04.390
certain way as the guy who has written this
book. And I have these pat answers, practiced

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:11.280
answers because I've had these conversations
before and so it's very--. It's one thing

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:18.480
to stand up here to be this, the public thing,
that an author is, but eventually you go back

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.530
to
your desk and the way I heard it described

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:30.430
by this other author was, "You're never quite
as alone at your desk as you were before."

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:38.480
That's because this public thing that I have
to be when I'm out publicizing the book is

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.960
the opposite of what you're trying to be
when you're at your desk. And you’re just

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:51.540
trying to channel these other people and trying
to be this, as open and as transparent as

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:59.750
you can be. You're trying to disappear and
that's hard to get back to. And the more you

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:06.120
do this, the more you stand up here
like the author, capitol "A", it becomes very

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:15.410
hard to be that mass of insecurities and sensitivity
that you need to be in order to do

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:22.350
this. Or at least for me. I've always wondered
about these public sort of celebrity authors,

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:28.350
you know, the Norman Mailer types,
who can be this celebrity author and then

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:35.010
immediately go to their desk and just become
the novelist again. I don't seem that

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:42.710
ability to throw the switch and yet I can't
go back to sort of being the guy who lived

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:46.510
in his mother's basement and was writing
books that nobody read, you know?

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:50.450
So not that it was so great to live in your
mom's basement--

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.450
[laughter]

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:55.820
But it's complicated. It's complicated. I
certainly haven't got it figured out.

00:41:55.820 --> 00:42:00.120
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Did you actually live in your mom's
basement?

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.120
[Bob laughs]

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:06.270
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: Not only did I live in my mom's
basement, when I got serious about this, I

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.430
used to--. I was at the D.A.'s office and
I

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:11.970
was working, working. I was doing it nights
and weekends and that's really hard to do,

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.660
especially with that job because it's not
like--. That's not a clock punching kind of

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:20.150
job, I mean, you're in or you're out. So eventually
what I would do is I would take a

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:24.560
leave from there and I would pull up my retirement
money and I would live on that. And I would

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.890
work and work and work until the
book either died, or the money ran out and

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.360
then I'd go back and I'd start trying cases
again.

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:35.050
And then as I got more serious about it, I
left there. I bartended over at Flat Top Johnny's

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:40.380
across the way. And that is what I would do
at night, and I would write during the day.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.840
You should all go to Flat Top Johnny's by
the way. Have you all been? Great place,

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:51.160
that's the end of my plug for Flat Top Johnny's
but I do love it there. And when that wasn't

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:59.110
enough, yeah, I--. And this was at age
thirty-six, seven, eight, you know, I'm a

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:05.020
grown man moving into my mom's basement. It's
not good. When I got married, when I met

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:08.760
the woman who is now my wife, the mother of
my children, I was this thirty-something year

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.470
old guy living in his mom's basement.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:17.650
It's even worse, I would go to cut out distractions,
she had this walk-in clos--like sweater closet,

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:20.780
and I would run an extension
cord from the nearest outlet and I would sit

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:26.300
in this closet typing on my laptop. And so
I was this shut in, you know? [chuckles]

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:31.460
That's kind of what I was doing, and I was
churning out manuscript after manuscript and,

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:37.990
yeah, so you know the idea that you from
that, from your mom's sweater closet with

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:47.980
an extension cord under the door to this,
is phenomenal. Though it seems to have happened

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:54.630
very fast, and yet, when I look at the arc
of it, I go back long before that first published

00:43:54.630 --> 00:44:01.400
book and I go back to ten years before to
this weird guy in his mom's basement. So for

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.930
me, it's all part of a much longer story.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:03.930
Yeah?

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:09.650
&gt;&gt;Female #6: I know you talk with other writers.
Can you talk a little bit about writer's groups

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.950
or whatever, did they--

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.490
&gt;&gt;Bob Landay: I don't know about writer groups,
honestly. I've never been in a writer's group.

00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:24.380
I've never taken a class, any of that stuff.
Which may be why it's taken me so long to

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:27.300
get this together. [laughs softly]

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:36.210
So the writers that I meet, I meet through
events. Book events, conventions, publicity

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:42.870
things, book store readings, whatever it is.
And I'm always really excited to meet them.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:48.440
I feel like--. Writers are like cats, you
know, they're not truly social animals. So

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:55.200
we're off doing this job which requires complete
solitude and yet when you come together and

00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:01.910
you realize, "Oh my God, there's someone else
out there, in his mom's sweater closet writing--".

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:13.510
That is a huge comfort. So I'm always excited
to meet other authors and it's a great thing

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:18.820
to realize there are other people who feel
as you do. There is a whole writer's scene

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:25.820
out there and I'm just not part of it and
I--. It's not that I choose to be or choose

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:33.570
not to be, it's just not my personality so
–. I'm kind of a secretive, shy person.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:34.570
So--

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:43.870
That's it. Alright. Thank you all for coming
and it's been fun. All right.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:44.480
[Applause]
