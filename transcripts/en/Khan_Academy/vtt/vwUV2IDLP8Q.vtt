00:00:01.023 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] Hey everyone,

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.834
so in the next couple of videos,

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:04.153
I'm going to be talking about a different

00:00:04.153 --> 00:00:06.310
sort of optimization problem,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.268
something called a Constrained
Optimization problem,

00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:12.460
and an example of this is
something where you might see,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.709
you might be asked to maximize

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.153
some kind of multi-variable function,

00:00:18.153 --> 00:00:20.292
and let's just say it was the function

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:23.875
f of x,y is equal to x squared, times y.

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:27.975
But that's not all you're asked to do,

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.021
you're subject to a certain constraint

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:31.283
where you're only allowed values of

00:00:31.283 --> 00:00:33.366
x and y on a certain set,

00:00:35.087 --> 00:00:36.996
and I'm just going to say,

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:39.477
the set of all values of x and y,

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:43.644
such that, x squared plus
y squared, equals one.

00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:47.245
And this is something you might

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:49.491
recognize as the unit circle,

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:52.987
this particular constraint
that I've put on here,

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:55.763
this is the unit circle.

00:00:55.763 --> 00:00:58.210
So one way that you might think
about a problem like this,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.468
you know, you're maximizing a
certain two-variable function,

00:01:01.468 --> 00:01:03.705
is to first think of the
graph of that function.

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:05.110
That's what I have pictured here,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.461
is the graph of f of x,y,
equals x squared, times y.

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:11.834
And now this constraint,
x squared plus y squared,

00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:14.873
is basically just a
subset of the x,y plane.

00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:16.563
So if we look at it head on here,

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:18.285
and we look at the x,y plane,

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:20.009
this circle represents all of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.176
the points x,y, such that, this holds.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:25.480
And what I've actually drawn here

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.113
isn't the circle on the x,y plane,

00:01:27.113 --> 00:01:30.287
but I've projected it up onto the graph.

00:01:30.287 --> 00:01:32.450
So this is showing you
basically the values

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.502
where this constraint holds,

00:01:34.502 --> 00:01:37.969
and also what they look like when graphed.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.177
So the way you can think
about a problem like this,

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:42.320
is that you're looking on this circle,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.781
this kind of projected
circle onto the graph,

00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:46.661
and looking for the highest points.

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:47.878
And you might notice kind of here,

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:50.679
there's sort of a peak
on that wiggly circle,

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.268
and over here there's another one,

00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:53.801
and then the low points would be,

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:57.219
you know, around that
point and around over here.

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:58.480
Now this is good,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.869
and I think this a nice way to

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.993
sort of wrap your head around
what this problem is asking,

00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:05.591
but there's actually a
better way to visualize it,

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.814
in terms of finding the actual solution,

00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:11.244
and that's to look only in the x,y plane,

00:02:11.244 --> 00:02:12.973
rather than trying to graph things,

00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:16.253
and just limit our perspective
to the input space.

00:02:16.253 --> 00:02:18.494
So what I have here are the contour lines

00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:21.613
for f of x,y equals x
squared plus y squared.

00:02:21.613 --> 00:02:22.623
And if you're unfamiliar with

00:02:22.623 --> 00:02:24.589
contour lines or a contour map,

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:25.729
I have a video on that,

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.139
you can go back and take a look,

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.722
it's going to be pretty crucial

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:31.783
for the next couple videos
to have a feel for that.

00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:34.057
But basically, each one
of these lines represents

00:02:34.057 --> 00:02:36.421
a certain constant value for f.

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:37.875
So for example, one of them,

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:41.858
one of them might represent
all of the values of x and y,

00:02:41.858 --> 00:02:45.912
where f of x,y is equal to, you know, two,

00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:47.675
right, so if you looked
at all of the values

00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:49.266
of x and y where this is true,

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.661
you'd find yourself on one of these lines,

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:53.838
and each line represents
a different possible value

00:02:53.838 --> 00:02:57.171
for what this constant here actually is.

00:02:58.275 --> 00:02:59.108
So what I'm going to do here,

00:02:59.108 --> 00:03:00.671
is I'm actually going to just zoom in

00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.085
on one particular contour line, right.

00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:05.683
So this here is something
that I'm going to vary,

00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:07.358
where I'm going to be able to change

00:03:07.358 --> 00:03:10.328
what the constant we're
setting f equal to is,

00:03:10.328 --> 00:03:13.053
and look at how the contour
line changes as a result.

00:03:13.053 --> 00:03:16.040
So for example, if I
put it around here-ish,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.650
what you're looking at
is the contour line,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.067
the contour line for f of x,y equals 0.1.

00:03:24.202 --> 00:03:26.816
So all of the values on
these two blue lines here

00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:30.733
tell you what values
of x and y satisfy 0.1.

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.708
But on the other hand, I
could also shift this guy up,

00:03:34.708 --> 00:03:36.170
and maybe I'll shift it up,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.442
I'm going to set to where that

00:03:37.442 --> 00:03:39.929
constant is actually equal to one,

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.607
so that would be kind of an alternative,

00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:44.090
we'll just kind of separate over here.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.173
That would be the line where f of x,y

00:03:48.647 --> 00:03:51.303
is set equal to one, itself.

00:03:51.303 --> 00:03:52.921
And the main thing I
want to highlight here,

00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:56.094
is that at some values, like 0.1,

00:03:56.094 --> 00:03:59.004
this contour line
intersects with the circle,

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:00.898
it intersects with our constraint.

00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:04.914
And let's just thing
about what that means,

00:04:04.914 --> 00:04:06.855
if there's a point, x and y,

00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:08.484
on that intersection there,

00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:12.031
that basically gives us a
pair of numbers, x and y,

00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:14.782
such that, this is true,

00:04:14.782 --> 00:04:17.499
that fact that f of x,y equals 0.1,

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:21.666
and also that x squared
plus y squared equals one.

00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:23.910
So it means this is something that

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.098
actually exists and is possible.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.625
And in fact, we can see
that there is four different

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.883
pairs of numbers where that's true,

00:04:29.883 --> 00:04:30.884
where they intersect here,

00:04:30.884 --> 00:04:32.510
where they intersect over here,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.382
and then the other two,

00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:35.428
kind of symmetrically on that side.

00:04:35.428 --> 00:04:37.599
But on the other hand, if
we look as this other world,

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.766
where we shift up to the
line f of x,y equals one,

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:45.841
this never intersects with the constraint.

00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:48.008
So what that means is x,y,

00:04:50.683 --> 00:04:53.751
the pairs of numbers
that satisfy this guy,

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.684
are off the constraint,

00:04:55.684 --> 00:04:57.918
they're off of that circle,

00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:00.918
x squared plus y squared equals one.

00:05:02.212 --> 00:05:03.201
So what that tells us,

00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:05.749
as we try to maximize this function,

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.344
subject to this constraint,

00:05:07.344 --> 00:05:10.030
is that we can never get as high as one.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.700
0.1 would be achievable, and in fact,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.684
if we kind of go back to
that, and we look at 0.1,

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:19.121
if I upped that value,

00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.168
and you know, changed
it to the line where,

00:05:21.168 --> 00:05:24.665
instead what you're looking at is 0.2,

00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:25.498
that's also possible,

00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:27.462
because it intersects with the circle.

00:05:27.462 --> 00:05:29.000
And in fact, you could
play around with it,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.204
and increase it a little bit more,

00:05:31.204 --> 00:05:33.790
and if I go to 0.3, instead,

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.460
and I go over here and I say,
0.3, that's also possible.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.979
And what we're basically trying to do

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.775
is find the maximum value
that we can put here,

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.538
the maximum value so that if we look at

00:05:44.538 --> 00:05:48.430
the line that represents f
of x,y equals that value,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.055
it still intersects with the circle.

00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:54.545
And the key here, the key observation,

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:56.347
is that that maximum value happens

00:05:56.347 --> 00:05:58.680
when these guys are tangent.

00:06:00.065 --> 00:06:00.898
And in the next video,

00:06:00.898 --> 00:06:02.187
I'll start going into the details

00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:03.998
of how we can use that observation,

00:06:03.998 --> 00:06:06.810
this notion of tangency,
to solve the problem,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.956
to find the actual value of x and y

00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:11.929
that maximizes this,
subject to the constraint.

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:13.817
But in the interim, I kind
of want you to mull on that,

00:06:13.817 --> 00:06:15.951
and think a little bit about
how you might use that.

00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.067
What does tangency mean here?

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:19.918
How can you take advantage
of certain other notions

00:06:19.918 --> 00:06:22.084
that we've learned about
in multi-variable calculus,

00:06:22.084 --> 00:06:23.885
like, hint, hint, the gradient,

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:25.851
to actually solve something like this.

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:28.326
So with that, I will see you next video.
