create a client ID so let's start doing

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349
create a client ID so let's start doing
 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.070
create a client ID so let's start doing
that now if you've created any client

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
that now if you've created any client
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.019
that now if you've created any client
IDs before for any other Google services

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
IDs before for any other Google services
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.420
IDs before for any other Google services
in the past you know that thing to do is

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
in the past you know that thing to do is
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.570
in the past you know that thing to do is
you go to code google com / AP I /

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
you go to code google com / AP I /
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.330
you go to code google com / AP I /
console and you know you create a new

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
console and you know you create a new
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.040

project here call it screencast example

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
project here call it screencast example
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.250

because I'm really creative and maybe we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
because I'm really creative and maybe we
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470
because I'm really creative and maybe we
turn on some services like the calendar

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
turn on some services like the calendar
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.010
turn on some services like the calendar
API and we'll accept terms of service

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020
API and we'll accept terms of service
 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.459
API and we'll accept terms of service
and then we go to the API access section

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469
and then we go to the API access section
 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.910
and then we go to the API access section
and we create knoweth to client ID we'd

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
and we create knoweth to client ID we'd
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.240
and we create knoweth to client ID we'd
add a product name my calendar project

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250
 
 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.040
 
and we might create one for a web

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
and we might create one for a web
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.260
and we might create one for a web
application where we would create a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
application where we would create a
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.799
application where we would create a
client ID to find a redirect URI or

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
client ID to find a redirect URI or
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.509
client ID to find a redirect URI or
maybe an installed application where you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
maybe an installed application where you
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.770
maybe an installed application where you
could set up something for an iOS device

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780
could set up something for an iOS device
 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:18.770
could set up something for an iOS device
like this and look at that we got a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
like this and look at that we got a
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.749
like this and look at that we got a
client ID and everything is good right

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
client ID and everything is good right
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.719
client ID and everything is good right
wrong this is not the way you would set

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
wrong this is not the way you would set
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.719
wrong this is not the way you would set
up a client ID using the games API so if

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729

in game services you're enabling a bunch

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
in game services you're enabling a bunch
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.819
in game services you're enabling a bunch
of features such as leaderboards and

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
of features such as leaderboards and
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.190

client ID and so we're going to create

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
client ID and so we're going to create
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.010
client ID and so we're going to create
rof 2 point 0 client ID through the

let's look at that to get to the Google
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.490
let's look at that to get to the Google
Play Developer console you're going to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500

use google api is in my game would be

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
use google api is in my game would be
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.250
use google api is in my game would be
useful if say you had created api's in

now that we've gotten our very first
 

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.690
now that we've gotten our very first
client ID let's make use of it and

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:28.700
client ID let's make use of it and
 

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.430
client ID let's make use of it and
really add that sign-in button and we're

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440
really add that sign-in button and we're
 

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:40.180
really add that sign-in button and we're
going to do that in the next lesson

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:40.190
 
 

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.840
