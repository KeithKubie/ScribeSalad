SPEAKER: In this
video, we'll talk

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.110
about what happens when a
user decides to activate

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.760
a subscription in your app.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.160
When your app starts,
call startConnection

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.750
in the Google Play
billing library.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.030
Once the connection
is complete, you

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.760
will also need to call
queryPurchases in order

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.020
to handle existing purchases.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.380
Make sure to override
onPurchasesUpdated in order

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.810
to handle any future
purchases that complete

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.010
while your app is open.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.170
Once the connection
is properly set up,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.050
launch the billing flow in the
Google Play Billing Library

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.170
to start the new
subscription purchase.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.090
After the user
completes the purchase,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.540
Google Play will send a
purchase token and order ID back

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.940
to your app via
onPurchasedUpdated.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.130
The purchase token represents
the user's active entitlement

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.110
to a product or service
your app provides,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.110
and the order ID serves as
a receipt for the user's

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.520
transaction with Google.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.580
Before the user's
subscription can be activated,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.470
your app sends
this purchase token

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.210
to your server for
verification and registration.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.150
Once your server receives
the purchase token,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.620
it will first send
the token to be

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.060
verified by Google through
Google Play Developer API.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.750
The API call will
either succeed or fail.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.470
If it fails, then the
token is not valid.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.020
If it succeeds, that
means the token is valid,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.750
and you should keep track of
the information in the response.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.630
This purchase information is
then stored on the server,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.060
and the server lets the app
know that the subscription is

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.690
activated.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.380
You can now grant the user
the appropriate access

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.875
to your product or services.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.060
