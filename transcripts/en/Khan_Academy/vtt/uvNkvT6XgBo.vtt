00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:01.606
- [Voiceover] All right, part c.

00:00:01.606 --> 00:00:04.924
What time t, where zero
is less than or equal to t

00:00:04.924 --> 00:00:06.248
is less than or equal to eight,

00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:09.267
is the amount of water
in the pipe at a minimum?

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:12.041
Justify your answer.

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.059
All right, well, let's define a function w

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.242
that represents the amount
of water in the pipe

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:18.349
at anytime, t, and then
we could figure out how

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.665
to figure out the minimum
value for w over that interval.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:24.454
So let's just say w of t.

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:26.254
So that's the amount of water in the pipe

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:28.487
at any given time, t.

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:33.363
It's going to be equal to, well,
we start with 30 cubic feet

00:00:33.363 --> 00:00:35.152
of water in the pipe that t equals zero

00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:37.091
that tells us that right up here.

00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:38.837
So we start with that much.

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:42.333
And then we are going to add
or take away some amount.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.795
So then it's going to be plus.

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:48.614
We're going to sum up
from time zero to time t.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.217
Remember this is the function of t.

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:53.711
Well, let's sum up our net inflow

00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:56.718
times little small changes in time.

00:00:56.718 --> 00:00:58.692
We will sum up all those
small changes in time

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.094
from zero to t and that will
give us our aggregate inflow

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:03.858
or aggregate net inflow.

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:05.879
So what is our net inflow?

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:08.456
Well, you have the function R which says

00:01:08.456 --> 00:01:10.894
the rate which the water is
entering and your function d

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:13.274
which is the rate which water is exiting.

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:15.429
Instead of using t as our variable,

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.421
I'm going to use x since t is
already one of our variable,

00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.186
is one of our boundaries of integration.

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:23.487
We can use any variable we want.

00:01:23.487 --> 00:01:25.519
It's really just a bit
of a placeholder variable

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.761
for the integration.

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.059
So our net inflow is

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:32.013
R, I'll say R of x

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:35.055
minus D of x

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:36.478
and then dx.

00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:38.777
Once again, this is
our net rate of inflow.

00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:40.390
This is our inflow minus our outflow

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.641
so our net rate of inflow
times small changes,

00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:46.230
we could view this as
time although it's x,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.761
and then we sum up from zero to time

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.444
is equal to t.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:53.359
So this is how much water
we are going to have

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.316
in the pipe at any time t.

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:01.880
So let's now think about at what point

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.887
does w hit a minimum in the central.

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:06.141
And there's three possibilities

00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.928
where w could hit a minimum point.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.983
It could hit a minimum
at right at the beginning

00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:13.548
at each at w of zero.

00:02:13.548 --> 00:02:15.162
It could hit it at the end of our interval

00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:17.681
at w of eight at t equals eight

00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:19.469
or it could be some place in between

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.407
where w is at a local maximum point.

00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:25.483
In which case, the derivative
of w will be equal to zero.

00:02:25.483 --> 00:02:28.363
So let's first evaluate
w at the end points.

00:02:28.363 --> 00:02:30.986
So w of zero.

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:31.729
Oh, we know that.

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:33.668
That's the boundary of a zero to zero

00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:35.422
that they gave it to us in the problem

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:38.730
is the initial state is
we have 30 cubic feet

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.363
of water in the pipe already.

00:02:41.363 --> 00:02:44.405
And now, what is w of eight?

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:46.390
Well, this is going to be 30

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.409
plus the definite integral
from zero to eight

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.948
of R of x minus D of x,

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:56.793
minus D of x, dx.

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:58.825
And lucky for us, we're
allowed to use a calculator

00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:01.924
so let's use a calculator
to evaluate this.

00:03:01.924 --> 00:03:04.270
And so, let me get my calculator out.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.247
Let me go see the
definition of R of x, D of x

00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:10.115
right over here so I can type them in.

00:03:10.115 --> 00:03:11.032
And what I'm gonna do

00:03:11.032 --> 00:03:13.324
and there's a bunch of ways
of more advance you get

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:15.973
with a calculator that
might save you some time

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:17.299
in front of the AP test.

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.103
I'm actually gonna define a function

00:03:19.103 --> 00:03:23.619
that is R of x minus D of x.

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:25.326
So everywhere I see t,
I'm gonna substitute it.

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:26.708
I'm gonna use x instead.

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:28.493
And then I could use that later on

00:03:28.493 --> 00:03:31.883
to integrate it or to
solve it in some way.

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:32.719
So let's do that.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.913
So y1 is gonna be 20

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:37.641
times sine

00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:40.938
of x squared

00:03:40.938 --> 00:03:43.794
divided by 35,

00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:45.501
close parenthesis,

00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:47.603
minus open parenthesis.

00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:51.759
You have negative 0.04

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:54.534
times t to the third power

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.819
or sorry, so I'll write times x,

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.301
x to the third power

00:04:02.301 --> 00:04:05.923
plus 0.4

00:04:05.923 --> 00:04:10.660
times x squared

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.235
plus 0.96

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:19.414
times x.

00:04:19.414 --> 00:04:22.607
And then I can close these parentheses.

00:04:22.607 --> 00:04:24.290
So does that make sense?

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.125
20 times sine of x squared

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.667
divided by 35 minus negative 0.04

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.885
x to the third plus 0.4

00:04:30.885 --> 00:04:35.250
x squared plus 0.96 times x.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.248
All right, there you go.

00:04:36.248 --> 00:04:38.733
I have defined y1.

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:42.193
And now I can use that to
evaluate different things.

00:04:42.193 --> 00:04:45.653
So let me now go back here.

00:04:45.653 --> 00:04:47.278
And so let me evaluate
what this is going to be.

00:04:47.278 --> 00:04:51.353
This is going to be 30
plus the definitive role

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:52.874
of the math functions.

00:04:52.874 --> 00:04:54.313
You scroll down a little bit.

00:04:54.313 --> 00:04:56.855
You have, this is the function
for definite integral,

00:04:56.855 --> 00:04:58.678
function integral.

00:04:59.588 --> 00:05:01.592
The function is y1

00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:03.183
and I can go to vars.

00:05:03.183 --> 00:05:04.217
I'm gonna get my y vars.

00:05:04.217 --> 00:05:05.784
It's gonna be a function variable.

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:08.385
So y1 is what I select.

00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:10.695
I could have typed it in but
this will hopefully save time

00:05:10.695 --> 00:05:12.286
and I can reuse y1.

00:05:12.286 --> 00:05:16.280
And my variable integration is x.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.475
I'm going from zero to eight.

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:20.459
From my lower bound is zero.

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:23.582
My upper bound is eight.

00:05:23.582 --> 00:05:25.475
Let's see, did I type everything in?

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:26.578
All right.

00:05:26.578 --> 00:05:28.458
And I'm gonna munch a little bit.

00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:29.236
And there you have it.

00:05:29.236 --> 00:05:33.764
It's approximately 48.544

00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:37.154
cubic feet of water at t equals eight.

00:05:37.154 --> 00:05:38.060
So let me write that,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.858
48.544.

00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:43.122
So this is

00:05:43.122 --> 00:05:45.389
approximately

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.839
48.544 cubic feet.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.178
And now let's see if
there's any point in between

00:05:52.178 --> 00:05:55.185
where w hits a local maximum point

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:56.879
or a local minimum point I should say.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.259
I think I said a local maximum earlier on.

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.198
I should say a local minimum point.

00:06:01.198 --> 00:06:04.042
And so if it's at a local
or maximum point really,

00:06:04.042 --> 00:06:06.422
the derivative of w is going to be zero.

00:06:06.422 --> 00:06:10.602
So let's see, at what t do
we get a zero derivative?

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:13.458
So w prime of t.

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:16.434
Well, the derivative or a
constant with respect to t is zero

00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:18.892
and the derivative of
this with respect to t

00:06:18.892 --> 00:06:22.189
and this comes from the
fundamental theorem of calculus,

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.928
this is going to be R of t

00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:28.122
minus D of t.

00:06:28.122 --> 00:06:29.527
Well, once again, this is a function.

00:06:29.527 --> 00:06:31.013
We have t as the upper bound.

00:06:31.013 --> 00:06:33.045
And so we have whatever
here that we are integrating

00:06:33.045 --> 00:06:35.727
but it is now going to be a function of t.

00:06:35.727 --> 00:06:38.443
And so in order for this
to be equal to zero,

00:06:38.443 --> 00:06:39.790
we have to figure out when does

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.809
R of t minus D of t equals zero.

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:44.469
And lucky for us, we've already typed in

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.017
R of t minus D of t.

00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:50.417
We defined that as y sub
one on our calculator.

00:06:50.417 --> 00:06:52.437
So let's go back here.

00:06:52.437 --> 00:06:54.620
And now I can use the Solver.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.932
So go to math

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:57.507
and then let's see if I scroll up.

00:06:57.507 --> 00:06:59.655
Let's see or this is, I get to the Solver.

00:06:59.655 --> 00:07:00.714
I could have scrolled down as well.

00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:02.476
It's right below definite integral.

00:07:02.476 --> 00:07:03.897
So I go to the Solver.

00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:06.521
And I say the equation zero equals,

00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:08.312
and I could just go to y1.

00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:10.727
So go to my y variables, function.

00:07:10.727 --> 00:07:12.689
I select y1.

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.684
So in my equation is equal to y1.

00:07:15.684 --> 00:07:18.355
And I press Enter.

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:20.735
And now I could put an initial guess

00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:24.334
for what x value is going
to solve that equation.

00:07:24.334 --> 00:07:27.526
Usually a t value but I'm
using x as a variable here.

00:07:27.526 --> 00:07:30.626
And now I do alpha and
I quickly solve here.

00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:33.285
So a little blue you see
right above the Enter.

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:36.986
And it gets to,

00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:38.386
well, zero is one of them.

00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:41.692
Let's see if I can get another one.

00:07:41.692 --> 00:07:43.318
So let's see if I can get,

00:07:43.318 --> 00:07:46.812
let's see if I started two, alpha,

00:07:46.812 --> 00:07:50.018
solve, what it munch on that a little bit.

00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:52.932
Okay, so this is actually
within the interval.

00:07:52.932 --> 00:07:55.646
So approximately

00:07:55.646 --> 00:08:00.646
3.272.

00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:04.099
So t is approximately

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:07.829
3.272.

00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:09.952
That's where we have a local minimum point

00:08:09.952 --> 00:08:12.142
but now we have to evaluate w there.

00:08:12.142 --> 00:08:13.692
So we have to evaluate w

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:17.753
at 3.272

00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:20.036
to figure out if it's truly lower

00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:21.801
than w zero.

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.262
W of eight is higher than w of zero.

00:08:24.262 --> 00:08:26.085
So, how do we do that?

00:08:26.085 --> 00:08:28.918
Well, luckily, we can go back.

00:08:28.918 --> 00:08:31.728
So second quit.

00:08:31.728 --> 00:08:34.386
And that should be stored
into the variable x.

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:35.594
Yep, it's right there.

00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:38.276
So then we can say, well, let's calculate.

00:08:38.276 --> 00:08:40.412
We wanna calculate the function evaluated

00:08:40.412 --> 00:08:43.013
when t is 3.272.

00:08:43.013 --> 00:08:47.843
So our function is 30

00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:49.990
plus the definite integral.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.808
Go to the math.

00:08:51.808 --> 00:08:54.503
So definite integral.

00:08:54.503 --> 00:08:56.887
Once again, we have y1.

00:08:56.887 --> 00:09:00.701
So let me go to my y
variables, function, y1.

00:09:00.701 --> 00:09:04.625
We already defined that
as R of x minus D of x.

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:08.212
Our variable of integration is x.

00:09:08.212 --> 00:09:11.743
Our lower bound is zero

00:09:11.743 --> 00:09:13.793
and our upper bound

00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:18.011
is 3.272

00:09:18.011 --> 00:09:20.263
we've restored in the variable x.

00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:21.703
So we can actually,
it's a little confusing.

00:09:21.703 --> 00:09:23.352
This is saying what's
our variable integration.

00:09:23.352 --> 00:09:24.733
This is the actual variable.

00:09:24.733 --> 00:09:27.195
This is actual value for upper bound.

00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:31.538
And so let's munch on it a little bit

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:35.318
and we get 27.965.

00:09:35.318 --> 00:09:39.382
So this is approximately equal to

00:09:39.382 --> 00:09:43.236
27.965.

00:09:43.236 --> 00:09:45.082
So now we're ready to answer.

00:09:45.082 --> 00:09:47.277
At what time t is the amount of water

00:09:47.277 --> 00:09:48.914
in the pipe at a minimum?

00:09:48.914 --> 00:09:51.792
We can see that at time

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.871
3.272,

00:09:53.871 --> 00:09:55.424
we have less water in the pipe

00:09:55.424 --> 00:09:57.201
than either right when we started

00:09:57.201 --> 00:09:59.267
or right at the end of our interval

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:00.625
at t equals eight.

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:02.239
So, at what time t?

00:10:02.239 --> 00:10:06.349
We say t is equal to 3.272.

00:10:06.349 --> 00:10:10.668
We could write w of 3.272

00:10:10.668 --> 00:10:13.327
is less than w of zero

00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:15.992
which is less than w of eight.

00:10:15.992 --> 00:10:19.126
So this indeed just by knowing
the derivative of the zero,

00:10:19.126 --> 00:10:20.670
it could be a minimum or maximum.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.853
But the fact that it's lower
than both of the end points,

00:10:22.853 --> 00:10:26.620
this tells us that,
hey, this is a minimum,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.493
minimum point

00:10:30.493 --> 00:10:31.944
right over there

00:10:31.944 --> 00:10:34.995
or we could say that t equals 3.272

00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:38.757
is where we hit out minimum value.
