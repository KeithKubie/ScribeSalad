00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.580
There's been a lot of talk very
recently, or definitely

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.940
over the last several years,
about the idea of intelligent

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.970
design and how it compares
to evolution.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.580
And my goal in this video
isn't to enter into that

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.950
discussion, or it's actually
turned into an argument in

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.505
most circles, but really to make
my best attempt to kind

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:25.710
of reconcile the notions.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.110
So the idea behind intelligent
design is really that there

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.250
are some things that we see in
our world that are just so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.560
amazing that it seems hard to
believe that it could be the

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.390
product of a set of
random processes.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.130
And the example that tends to
be given is the human eye,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.630
which truly is an awe-inspiring
device.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.200
You can call it an organ
or a machine.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.820
Whatever you want to call
it, it does all of

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.680
these amazing things.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.900
It can focus at different
lengths.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.740
It brings the light into focus
at just the right spot, and

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.420
then you have your retinal
nerves and you have two eyes

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.260
so can see in stereoscopic
vision.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.850
You can see in colors, and then
you can adjust to light

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.500
and dark, so the human eye
truly is awe inspiring.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.020
And the argument tends to go
that, look, how can this be

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.460
created from random processes?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.510
And the goal of this isn't to
trace the evolution of the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.050
eye, but I'll do a little side
note here that evolution is--

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.140
and natural selection, and
I like the word natural

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.680
selection more because
it's not talking

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.920
about an active process.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.710
Natural selection is acting over
eons and eons of time,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.370
and we do see evidence in our
world of a progression of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.460
different types of eyes.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.940
In fact, all evidence shows
that the human eye is not

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.970
perfect, and that there
is variation.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.230
I mean, we all know some of us
are nearsighted, some are

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.900
farsighted.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.620
We have astigmatisms. It
degenerates over time.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.750
People generate cataracts, so
there's a whole set of things

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480
that can go wrong with
the human eye.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.070
I'm not using that as a
rebuttal, but I'm just showing

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.850
you that there is variation,
even in what I believe is

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.320
truly an amazing piece
of biology.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.490
And even if you go outside of
the human world, there's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.139
obviously a huge spectrum
of eyes.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:13.570
You have fish at the bottom of
the ocean that have eyes that

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.410
are really just light sensors,
that barely can maybe tell

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.780
you-- and some insects are like
this-- whether there's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.760
some light or some heat
around, nothing

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.950
really more than that.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.850
And at the other end of the
spectrum, far better than

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.930
humans, you have certain birds
and a certain type of

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.650
nocturnal creatures where they
can see in the dark.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.330
You know, maybe you have a
certain-- actually, all cats

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.080
have this reflective material in
their eye that allows them

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.570
much better night vision, so in
that way they're superior

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.710
to humans, and they can see just
as good as humans during

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.090
the daytime.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.070
You have certain birds who can
see with far more visual

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.750
clarity at far better distances
than humans can, so

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.490
there is no perfect eye.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.750
So I'll go into a little bit
of a theological argument

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.800
here, and for those of you who
watch my videos, you know that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.380
I'm one to stray away from
theological arguments,

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.640
although I might eventually do
a whole philosophy playlist,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.520
but I want to be very careful
not to offend anyone's

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.330
sensibilities, because
that truly, truly,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.100
truly is not my intention.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.440
But the whole point I want to
make is that, look, if you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.310
believe in a God, and I won't
take sides on that argument in

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.030
this video right here, it's to
some degree, I would say,

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.640
almost disparaging of an
all-powerful being to say that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.850
this human eye, it kind of gives
too much importance to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.100
us as individuals.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.430
I always think that religion--
and actually science.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.530
Or actually everything.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.480
I mean, we should be humble in
our lives, and there should be

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.950
the realization that we, as
humans, really-- this isn't

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.050
perfection, and to imply that
this is the best that a

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.220
perfect entity or an
all-powerful entity could

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.330
produce I think is a little
actually disparaging of it.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.960
I'll give you another example.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.600
I give you another example, and
I'll put my engineering

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.460
hat on here.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.670
And once again, I want
to be very clear.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.950
My goal isn't in this video to
say, oh, you know, look, hey,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.130
evolution, random processes,
that by itself, there is no

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.850
God, and you just have
to live with it.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.820
No, that's not my point.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.160
I'm actually making the opposite
argument, that a

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.370
belief in God would not point
to a God who-- a belief in a

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.300
universal, all-powerful God
would not point to a God who

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.510
designs the particular, who
designs each particular.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.640
And even more, the imperfections
that we see

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.790
around us would-- and especially
because we see

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.420
variation and they're being
selected for it.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.950
I mean, we can't just
focus on the eye.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.160
We would have to focus on
viruses and cancers, and it

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.460
would have to speak to a God
that is designing one off

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.990
every version of every sequence
of DNA that we see,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.790
because if someone talks about
designing an eye, we know that

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.220
the eye is the byproduct of DNA,
and we know the DNA is a

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.950
sequence of base pairs, you
know, ATG, C, A, and, you

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.240
know, billions and
billions of them.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.970
And so when we talk about
design, we would be talking

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.550
literally about designing
the sequence.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.490
And we even know that a lot of
the sequence, there's some

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.230
noise in there.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.210
We know that a lot of it comes
from primitive viruses deep in

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.890
our past.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.800
So the argument I'm making here
is that in order to give

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:30.380
credit to the all powerful, at
least to my mind, a system

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:44.410
that comes from very simple and
elegant basic ideas like

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.050
natural selection and
variations, that in our DNA,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.350
we call those mutations, in
the laws of physics and

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.090
chemistry, and those, from that
simple and elegant basic

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.350
ideas, for complexity
to emerge.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.540
So this is one idea and this
is what really evolution

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.700
speaks to, that, look, our
universe is this profound

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.560
world, this profound
environment, where from these

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.750
very basic, simple, beautiful
ideas, we have this complexity

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.730
in the structure that is truly,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.060
truly, truly awe inspiring.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.030
This is, in my mind, what
evolution speaks to.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.070
And in my mind, even as an
engineer, this speaks to a

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.930
higher form of design.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.165
This speak to a more
profound design.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.330
So this whole video, the whole
argument, is that if one does

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.210
believe in a God, and, you know,
I'm not going to take

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.860
sides in that in this video,
and a God that speaks to

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.060
beauty and elegance and is
infinitely powerful, then this

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.670
idea of the laws of physics
and chemistry and natural

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.910
selection, which is really-- I
mean, you know, when I talked

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.800
about natural selection in the
last video, it was really-- I

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.900
think you would find it was
a bit of common sense.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:14.290
That this is a very profound
design and it speaks to the

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.160
art of the designer as opposed
to designing each of these

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.150
entities one off.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.100
And what's even more profound
about the design

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.970
is that it's adaptive.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.070
If there's environmental
stress, then the other

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.420
variations survive
more frequently.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.930
And so it's never changing,
that perfection, that no

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.140
instance can ever be pointed to
and say this is the highest

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.830
point that this design
can reach.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.480
That is always-- I don't want
to say getting better.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.650
It's always getting more suited
to its environment as

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.840
it changes, and that to
me is a better design.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.250
Now, just following
up on that, and I

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.970
want to be very clear.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.460
This whole idea is to kind of
raise the standard of what we

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.230
expect out of design.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.290
It's to kind of show other
points or other places in the

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.310
scientific or mathematical world
where this does emerge.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.900
And the best example I see
of that is with fractals.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.850
A lot of you-all might have
seen-- this is the Mandelbrot

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.610
set, a very famous
set of fractals.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.230
It's immensely complex.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.580
In fact, you can keep zooming
in on the Mandelbrot set at

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.370
any point, and when you zoom it
out, it becomes infinitely

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.940
complex, and you can explore
it indefinitely.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.870
But the beauty of it, the true
beauty of it, is all of this

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:34.360
can be described by one
equation, one almost

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:40.409
shockingly simple equation, and
that's this: The next z is

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:45.340
equal to the z before
it squared plus 1.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.080
And you're like you know, Sal,
you started talking about

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.070
intelligent design and evolution
and all of that.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.500
Why are you all of a sudden
breaking into fractals?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.340
And the point I'm trying to make
here is that if I had two

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.280
designers and one set out to
go and paint this exact

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.710
particular fractal and say,
oh, you know, I'm going to

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.620
make this brown and I'm going
to make this blue and I'm

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.950
going to make this a circle
with other circles, you'd

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.430
think this is an amazing
painter.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.590
For example, if you were to go
to someone 300 years ago and

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.920
you were to show them this, they
would say that this is

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.380
the finest design that anyone
might have ever been able to

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.780
devise, because it's so
infinitely complex.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.150
But now we know that this can
be completely described by

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.880
this simple equation,
literally.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.020
For those of you are interested,
all they're doing,

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.170
this is a complex plane, and
they're starting at zero--

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.890
excuse me, not plus 1, plus c.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.020
Let me make that very clear.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.170
This is the equation plus c.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.990
So for every point on the
complex plane, you put that

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.850
point in for c, and then you
start with zero, and you keep

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.360
doing this.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.860
So you say zero squared plus
that number, that complex

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.100
number, is equal to that.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.230
Then you put that in here, and
then you do that number

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.290
squared plus that complex
number, and you do it again.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.050
You do it over and
over and over.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.110
So turns out that some numbers
don't go to infinity and those

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.520
numbers are in black.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.860
They're considered part
of the Mandelbrot set.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.790
And then the numbers that do go
to infinity, as you iterate

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.130
on this formula, you color it
based on how fast it goes to

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.800
infinity, and it creates this
infinitely beautiful and

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.640
complex pattern.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.190
Now, if you were to say what is
a more profound design, and

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.640
you can ask any engineer this,
in my mind, this is the most

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.840
profound design.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.610
Because it's simple and elegant,
but it describes

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.100
something of infinite
complexity.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.580
It's not just focused on the
particular, it's focused on

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.000
kind of the metalevel.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.280
It's focused on creating just
the idea of which this is just

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.270
an example.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:55.680
So anyway, this is probably my
video where I steer most away

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.690
from the science of it all and
maybe I focus a little bit

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.260
more on the slightly

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.610
metaphysical or the awe inspiring.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.290
But my whole point here is to
really throw out my little

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.440
idea of how you can reconcile
these notions.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:13.350
That evolution, the randomness
of it, does not speak to a

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.280
Godless universe, although
I'm not going to

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.290
take sides on that.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.930
It speaks to a more profound
God, in my mind.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:27.170
So anyway, forgive me for taking
my liberties, and I

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.710
want to make it very clear, I
don't want to offend anyone's

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.910
sensibilities, but I really
just wanted to throw

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.700
this idea out there.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.440
See you in the next video.
