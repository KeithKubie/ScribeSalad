00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.750
WHEN PINBALL WAS ILLEGAL

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:16.280
In May of 1976 in New York City, Roger Sharpe
watched nervously as city council members

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.000
piled into a Manhattan courtroom.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.790
Reporters and camera operators had already
begun setting up, eagerly anticipating the

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.830
proceedings ahead.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.320
Roger, a young magazine writer for GQ and
the New York Times among others, did not expect

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.900
this kind of attention.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.579
He knew lots of people, from bowling-alley-hanging
teens to the Music &amp; Amusement Association,

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.609
were depending on him, but didn’t realize
the whole country would be watching.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.510
Roger had been selected for this particular
task not only for his knowledge and expertise,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.809
but for his legendary hand-eye coordination.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.940
He was there to prove that this was a game
of skill, not chance.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.359
He was there to overturn the ban.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.170
He was there to save the game of pinball.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.969
On January 16th, 1920, the 18th amendment
officially went into effect, making the production,

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.830
transportation, and sale of alcohol illegal
in the United States.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.940
With that act of moral legislating, gambling
became the next target.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.000
Coin-operated machines, usually associated
with slot machines and betting horses, came

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.300
under scrutiny.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.670
Pinball machines, with their recently-fitted
coin mechanisms, became bright, and easy examples

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.530
of “games of chance.”

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.590
Politicians took to their pulpit to denounce
pinball.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.560
Police raided parlors, bowling alleys, and
bars that housed these machines.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.210
Politicians, literally wielding hammers, smashed
these games to smithereens in a public show

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.250
to illustrate that they too were “moral.”

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.780
On January 21st, 1942, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia
officially banned pinball in New York City

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.270
and many other American cities soon followed
suit.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.950
Despite this ban, pinball designers continued
to operate.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.890
While pinball was officially banned publicly,
it was still legal to own machines for private

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.500
use (not to mention rouge arcades and bars
who placed pinball machines in dark corners

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.420
in opposition to the bans).

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.120
Companies like Gottlieb, Bally’s, and Williams
proceeded to develop new innovations for their

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.640
games, like double flippers, free balls, and
electronic games.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.340
In fact, many localities regarded “free
balls” different than “free games” and

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.620
allowed pinball machines that had this feature
to be used at public locations.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.260
In addition, the artwork on the machines became
more elaborate and intricate, attracting new

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.010
visually-impressed fans.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.310
Even in the shadow of the ban, the pinball
industry had found a way to survive.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.520
Which brings us back to the May morning in
1976 with Mr. Sharpe waiting patiently to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.740
enter the courtroom.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.069
He had been hired by the Music &amp; Amusement
Association (MAA, for short) to be their star

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.690
witness in their pursuit to overturn the ban
on pinball in New York City.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.599
Roger Sharpe, besides being a writer on the
subject matter, was also a superb player himself,

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.130
widely considered to be the best in country.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.380
He had been provided with two machines to
prove his case, with one being a backup in

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.650
the event that the first machine broke.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.810
While the MAA had been granted this hearing
due to one committee member’s sponsored

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.480
bill to overturn the ban, the other committee
members were known to be against lifting the

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.660
ban on pinball.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.610
The the MAA, the bill, and Mr. Sharpe were
underdogs in this fight.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.380
Upon entering the courtroom, Sharpe began
eloquently to argue why the ban should be

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.300
overturned, stating that while in the past,
it may have been associated with gambling,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.069
this was no longer the case.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.150
It was a game that tested your patience, hand
eye coordination, and reflexes.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.720
Quite simply, it was a game of skill, not
chance.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.680
As expected, Mr. Sharpe was asked to prove
this assertion.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.040
Thus, he began to play one of the machines
in the pinball game of his life.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.520
But he was soon stopped by one particularly
grumpy councilman.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.090
Afraid that the “pinballers” had tampered
with the machine, he demanded that Mr. Sharpe

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.319
use the backup.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.360
Sharpe agreed, but this added another degree
of difficulty.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.580
You see, Mr. Sharpe was extremely familiar
with the first machine, having practiced on

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.140
it a great deal in preparation for this hearing.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.360
He was not nearly as experienced the backup
machine.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.730
Nonetheless, he agreed and began playing on
the backup.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.280
Despite playing well with the weight of a
giant silver ball on him, the grumpy council

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.350
member was not impressed.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.150
With the ban on the verge of not being overturned,
Sharpe pulled a move that has become pinball

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.150
legend.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.770
Reminiscent of another New York sporting legend,
he declared that if he could make the ball

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.210
go through the middle lane on his next turn,
then he would have proven that pinball is

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.830
a game of skill- essentially, he was calling
his shot, and staking the future of pinball

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.830
on it.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.500
Pulling back the plunger, he let that silver
ball fly.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.200
Upon contact with a flipper, the ball zoomed
up and down, through the middle lane.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.080
Just as Sharpe had said it would.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.730
He had become the Babe Ruth of pinball and,
with that, proved that there was indeed skill

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:02.750
to the game of pinball.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:14.250
The council immediately overturned the ban
on pinball.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:29.499
By playing a “mean pinball,”
