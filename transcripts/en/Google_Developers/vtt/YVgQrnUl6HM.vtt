LOUIS GRAY: The most epic films
are made into trilogies,

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.940
and that's no different here
at Google Developers Live.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.586
I'm excited to host Googler
Brian Fitzpatrick, or as I

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:18.300
call him, Fitz, a world champion
for users and data

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.070
for a series of shows starting
this Tuesday at 3:00 PM

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.040
Pacific, when we sit down and
talk about the human element

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.460
of business and office
politics, tackling

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.580
organizational manipulation.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.490
On Wednesday, we'll be back
at the same time, 3:00 PM,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.810
talking about the data
liberation front, fighting the

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.190
good fight to help you own your
data, and if you'd like,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.770
to get it out of Google if
you decide to leave.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.700
Fitz and I also believe
transparency is a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.980
core value at Google.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.480
That's the topic of the finale
this Thursday at 10:30 AM,

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.530
taking a deep dive into the
Google Transparency Report,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.260
showing our users how global
politics can sometimes get in

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.730
the way of you getting
to our sites.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.290
Fitz is no typical engineer, and
these are no typical GDL

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.510
events, so make sure
you don't miss out.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.210
Subscribe to Google Developers
on YouTube, or add these

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.110
events to your calendar at
developers.google.com/live.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.460
This has been Louis Gray from
Google Developers Live, and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.336
I'll see you in the studio.
