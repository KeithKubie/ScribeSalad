00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.990
As we've already talked
about, as we exit the 1800s

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.640
and we get into the early 1900s
and we approach World War I,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.610
the various powers
of Europe were really

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.697
on this race for empire.

00:00:10.697 --> 00:00:12.155
It was a part of
national prestige.

00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:15.160
And it helped build
national wealth.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.350
But of the major powers,
Germany and Italy

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.847
were relatively new
as unified states.

00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:23.180
The British Empire-- they had
been building their empire

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.710
for hundreds of years.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.415
The Germans, on the
other hand, even

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:28.790
though they have a very old
culture going back hundreds--

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.130
or you could argue thousands--
of years, as a unified state,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.030
they only existed since 1871.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.020
And that's only after
the Franco-Prussian War,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.740
which allowed the Prussians
to unify all of Germany.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.355
And the Italians only became
fully unified in 1870, also due

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:46.990
to the Franco-Prussian War.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.210
Because the French had
to focus on the Germans,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.830
had to focus on
the Prussians, they

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.740
couldn't protect the
Papal States anymore.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.860
And so that allowed the Italians
to unify it under their a rule.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.250
So by the time we get to 1914,
the beginning of World War

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.560
I, these two powers, they were
also on their race for empire.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.859
But they were only about
43 or 44 years old.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.400
And so they hadn't
been able to build

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.920
as extensive of an
empire as France

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.840
and, especially, as extensive
of an empire as Great Britain.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.920
But this map right
over here shows how far

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280
their actual empires did extend.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.500
Italy had control
of Libya, Eritrea,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.310
and parts of what's
today Somalia.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.950
And Germany had
control-- it also

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.530
had holdings in Africa,
possessions in Africa.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.650
Togoland, which is
modern-day Togo;

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.140
Cameroon, which makes
up-- modern-day Cameroon

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.040
is part of German
Southwest Africa.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.800
That's now known as Namibia.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.690
German East Africa, which is now
Tanzania, Rwanda, and Burundi.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.790
And Germany also had holdings in
the Pacific and even in China.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.030
These are the Pacific Islands
that Germany had possession of.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.510
It had German New Guinea.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.380
And it even had control
of the town of Tsingtao.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.560
And that actually is culturally
interesting for those

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.560
of you watching
this video in 2013.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.090
Tsingtao is now a very
popular Chinese brand of beer.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.250
One of the more-- I
think it's the number

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.820
two in the market Chinese beer.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.750
And it's associated with China.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.780
But it was actually started
by German settlers in Tsingtao

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.520
in 1903.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.930
So actually its roots
are with the Germans,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.210
who obviously have a long
tradition of producing beers.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.490
And so Tsingtao-- you could
argue it's a Chinese beer.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.090
It's produced in China.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.524
But it had its roots in
German imperial rule.
