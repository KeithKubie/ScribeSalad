Adriene: Jacob, you're a teacher, so on behalf
of students everywhere, Pop Quiz on you! What

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.580
was the average price of a new car in 1950?
What was the tuition at Harvard in 1900? What

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.870
was is the highest grossing movie of all time?

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.280
Jacob: Sharknado?
Adriene: Yeah.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.460
Jacob: Really?
Adriene: No.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:25.160
[Theme Music]

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.619
Adriene: When it 
comes to inflation, most people think prices
go up over time. Ok, I get it. Who cares?

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.680
Well, you do. A lot. Let's say you got a two
percent raise at your job. But while you're

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.370
raking in your extra two percent, prices rise
by five percent. Guess what. That means you

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.410
didn't get a real raise. Sorry. After adjusting
for inflation, you're actually losing three

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.140
percent of your purchasing power.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.879
Well, let's take a look at Stan. Hello, Stan.
Purchasing power tells him how much physical

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.610
stuff, like pizza, haircuts, and Neutral Milk
Hotel tickets he can actually consume. If

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.110
prices go down, he can consume more stuff.
His purchasing power has increased. Or if

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.969
prices go up, he has to consume less. His
purchasing power has decreased. A rise in

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.200
prices is effectively the exact same thing
as a cut in wages, and vice versa.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.639
The first thing we need to know is how economists
measure inflation, or the overall price levels

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:22.469
in a countries. Using that measure they can
do things like adjust prices from the past

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.810
into today's dollars, and give us a reading
on how fast prices are rising.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.479
Second, we're going to look at inflation and
talk about what leads one country to have

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.939
inflation while another has falling prices.
Finally, we're going to look at bubbles, which

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.040
happen when the price of just one good soars, as a
result of collective delusions and irrational exuberance.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.700
Jacob: We all know that prices tend to go
up over time. The average movie ticket in

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.329
the U.S. today is $8.00. In 1939, when Gone
With The Wind was released, it was 23 cents.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.609
So to compare box office sales between different
years, we have to adjust for inflation. But

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.459
how do we do that? I mean, the prices for
some things are rising quickly, like college

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.090
tuition and health care. And for other things
it's rising slowly, like for cars and food.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.139
But, prices for stuff like electronics, are even
dropping. Stan, how much are DVD players again?

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.950
So when they're adjusting for inflation, economists
first pick out a list of goods that represents

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.700
what an average consumer buys in a year. Say,
twelve months of rent, three hundred gallons

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.799
of gasoline, fifty loaves of bread, twenty
burritos, and seven movie tickets. That kind

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.900
of thing. It's called a consumer basket. They
add up the price of this year's basket, and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.060
do the same thing next year, and the year
after that. So eventually you have a long

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.409
list of basket costs for a bunch of different
years.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.239
Then, you pick a base year. It can be any
year you want. You divide the basket cost

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.459
of each year, by the basket cost in the base
year and multiply it times 100. That gives

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.739
you something called the consumer price index.
The CPI shows how prices have changed between

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.890
different years, and it's by far the most
commonly used measure of inflation.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.019
Adriene: To determine, the highest grossing
movie of all time, we have to adjust for inflation.

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.159
Gone with the Wind, Avatar, and Star Wars
were all made in different years, with different

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.430
ticket prices. The CPI allows us to adjust
for inflation by leveling the playing field

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.379
and putting all the earnings in the same base
year prices. You'll hear economists using

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.370
the words "nominal" and "real" a lot.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.040
"Real" means that a price from the past has
been adjusted for inflation. "Nominal" means

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.379
a price from the past that hasn't been adjusted
for inflation. So the highest "nominal" box

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.840
office receipts list is quite different. Avatar,
Titanic, Avengers, Jurassic World. Of course,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.010
most of these movies are more recent, since
ticket prices are higher today. But the point

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.950
is, when economists make historical comparisons,
they always use "real" values.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.400
It's worth noting that the CPI isn't perfect.
Since we have to keep the market basket constant

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.870
over time, a traditional CPI won't adjust
for either new products on increases in product

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.409
quality. So a market basket from the 1950s
might include a black and white TV that gets

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.140
like, a few channels and weighs like, a "billion"
pounds. It's nothing like your 40-inch flat screen.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.400
Government economists use adjustment factors
to simultaneously account for technological

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.870
progress and keep two different years comparable.
But, it's very complicated. Economists can

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.510
also use the Consumer Price Index to calculate
the rate of inflation, how quickly the price

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.549
level is rising from year to year.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.620
Here's the rate of inflation over time, and
as you can see, prices grew slowly in the

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.549
'50s and '60s, sped up during the '70s and
'80s, and when back to growing slowly. On

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.009
the other hand, here's the rate of inflation
in Japan. For the past 25 years, prices in

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.720
Japan have actually been falling slightly.
Economists call that deflation. And here's

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.930
the rate of inflation in Venezuela. The past
several years have seen prices rising very

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.610
fast there. At the end of 2014, the inflation
rate was nearly 70%. But what causes inflation?

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.280
Let's go find out in the Thought Bubble.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.620
Jacob: So let's assume we gave John $10 million
U.S. dollars. Is he rich? Well, not if you're

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.970
stuck on a desert island. Being rich isn't
about how much money you have. It's about

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.240
how much purchasing power you have. Let's
put John back into society so he can start

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.720
buying stuff. If other people also have a
lot of money, they're going to bid up the

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.110
prices of goods and services. That last slice
of pizza is $2.00, but Hank might offer $3.00.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.530
John might counter-offer $10.00. Actually
this might be a bad example since John and

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.599
Hank would probably share the pizza. They're
brothers.

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.150
The point is that if people have a lot of
money and they want to buy more stuff, they're

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.419
going to bid up the prices of things, causing
inflation. This is actually called Demand

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.979
Pull Inflation. In the language of economists,
it's "too much money, chasing too few goods."

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.960
Now a nother cause of inflation is the decrease
of availability of an important productive

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.259
resource, like oil or something. An oil shortage,
would increase the price of gasoline, increasing

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.300
the cost of delivering flour, and cheese,
and pepperoni. This would increase the cost

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.240
of producing pizza. And therefore decrease
the number of pizzas that can be produced.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.200
Economists call this Supply Shock, and it
causes something called Cost Push Inflation.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.099
So, to keep it simple, inflation is caused
by either consumers bidding up the prices

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.930
of stuff, or producers rising prices and producing
less, because there's an increase in production

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.729
cost. Either way, inflation is the result
of having more money than goods and services.

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.909
Adriene: Thanks Thought Bubble. So, who's
got inflation today? Venezuela. In the 1950s

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.740
and 60s and 70s, Venezuela had one of the
strongest economies in Latin America with

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.520
stable inflation. It's also a country with
huge amounts of oil. But this is Case Number

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.009
478 that natural resources don't equal economic
bliss.

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:15.789
Economic mis-management and political instability
have reduce oil exports from Venezuela. The

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:20.210
government's tried to keep the economy growing
by printing more money, but that's only resulted

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.550
in soaring prices. It's a bad scene.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.250
But prices go up all the time without necessarily
causing inflation. Let's look at the prices

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.430
of chocolate over the past few months. and
the price of housing ten years ago. Lots of

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.199
inflation, right? Well, no.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.389
Jacob: In the case of chocolate, we have a
straight forward supply and demand story.

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.949
As China and other nations develop, their
consumers are spending more on treats, like

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.690
chocolate. Also, dark chocolate has become
more popular world-wide. Now both of these

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.030
trends have increased demands for the coca
beans, which is used to produce chocolate.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.389
Now at the same time, disease and drought
have limited harvests and decreased supply.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:55.990
Higher demand and lower supply means higher
prices for chocolate.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.500
Now on the other hand, it's hard to explain
the rise in home prices with just supply and

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.550
demand. The population didn't suddenly skyrocket
or get that much richer, and it's not like

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.460
there was a shortage in building materials.
Between 2001 and 2006, home prices diverged from

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.860
these fundamentals, in what economists call "a bubble."
In the early 2000s, low interest rates and deceitful

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.720
lending practices encouraged more people to buy
homes. That raised demand and increased the price.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.979
But then people saw prices increase and assumed
it would continue forever. So they liquidated

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:25.770
their beanie baby portfolios and bought houses
in hopes of making a huge profit. This is

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.570
called speculation. More buyers are pulled
into the market and prices rose faster and

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:35.139
faster. In fact, average home prices in the
U.S. doubled between 2000 and 2006, and nearly

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:37.150
tripled in cities like Los Angeles and Las
Vegas.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.319
There were even more dramatic spikes in home
prices in countries like Ireland and Spain.

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:44.789
News stories about rising real estate prices,
along with easy credit, convinced even more

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:47.729
people that buying a home was a one way ticket
to riches.

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:51.009
Adriene: At the time, there were plenty of
people pointing out that rising home prices

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:57.600
were unsustainable. In fact, in 2005 the Economist
magazine called the global rise in home prices the

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.300
biggest bubble in history. And economists like Robert
Shiller and Nouriel Roubini were predicting a crash.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.139
But those warnings couldn't compete with your
brother-in-law bragging about how much he

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:11.139
just made flipping a home. Or banks pushing
NINJA loans, so more and more people got into

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:17.270
the act. Wait, Stan. There were ninja bankers?
That's amazing! Oh, NINJA stands for No Interest,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.150
No Jobs, and No Assets. That's not so amazing.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.380
The problem with a bubble is that depends
on an ever increasing supply of buyers,

00:08:24.389 --> 00:08:28.039
each person is betting that they'll be
able to sell at a higher price to the next

00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:31.579
person. But eventually, you run out of buyers
and the bubble bursts.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.020
Bubbles aren't a new thing. In the late 1990s
there was a stock market bubble for companies

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:40.980
involved in this brand new computer thingy,
called the internet. Investors poured billions

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.350
of dollars into internet stocks, and they
got in on the ground floor of pets.com or

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:51.420
boo.com. It turns out these companies had
only one floor, and it a deep, deep basement.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.830
The stock market collapsed in early 2000.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.830
Perhaps the granddaddy of all bubbles was
Dutch tulip mania in the 1630s. Tulip gardens

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:04.090
became a social fad among the emerging class
of wealthy merchants, driving up their price.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.620
More and more people got in on the tulip action,
making quick fortunes. And that brought in

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:13.420
even more people, desperate to get their hands
on a tulip bulb. At the height of the mania,

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:20.760
people were willing to exchange twelve acres of land,
or ten years worth of salary for a single tulip bulb.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:27.900
While a tulip bubble sounds incredibly beautiful,
incredibly lovely; just floating petals, red and

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:35.040
pink and yellow -- Sorry. What am I talking about? The
bubble burst and tulip bulbs are now less than a dollar.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.540
Understanding inflation is not just academic.
This affects you. Someday you might have to

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:46.690
ask your boss for a raise. Knowing some economics
can help you negotiate a real raise, adjusted

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.450
for inflation. Thanks for watching. See you
