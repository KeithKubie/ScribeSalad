00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.570
So now we know how to find the right bucket. Let's

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.440
look at how to define the add procedure. So we are going to

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.990
first define add, we'll make hashtable add, that takes a hashtable,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.880
a word and a value. And first we'll define a simple version

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.040
of that, that says we are going to add the new entry

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.430
to the bucket even if it already exists. So we'll find the

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.610
right bucket. And we'll add the new entry at the end. So

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.922
your goal is to define a procedure, we'll call it hash table_add.

00:00:25.922 --> 00:00:29.230
Takes three inputs: a hash table, a key, which is the

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.085
word, and a value, and it adds that key to the

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.340
hashtable, making sure to put it in the correct bucket with

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.904
the associated value that was passed in as the third input.
