(staccato synth music)

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.490
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.690
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.310
of International Studies.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.830
Our distinguished guest
today is Daniel Kahneman,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.910
who is the Eugene Higgins
Professor of Psychology

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.740
at Princeton University
and professor of psychology

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.650
in public affairs at the
Woodrow Wilson School

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.080
of Public and International Affairs.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.920
In 2002 he received the
Nobel Prize in Economics

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.270
for his work with Amos
Tversky on human judgment

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.630
and decision making.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.150
A former professor of
psychology at Berkeley,

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.020
he is the Hitchcock
Professor in the spring 2007.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.320
Professor Kahneman,
welcome back to Berkeley.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.153
- Thank you.

00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:13.010
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.530
- I was born in Tel Aviv,
which was then Palestine,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520
and I was raised in
France until the age of 12

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.691
when we went back to Palestine.

00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:24.830
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.983
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.740
- Well, you know, I grew up
in a Jewish environment, and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.770
I think my mother had
more to do with shaping

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.160
my view of the world in
some ways than my father.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.060
My father was a researcher but my mother

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.190
certainly influenced my development.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.420
She was very interested
in people, and I lived

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.973
in a world that consisted
of people and words, really.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.690
I was never very interested
in nature or in animals,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.440
but people and words I
was really fascinated by

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.980
from an early age.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.980
- And you were in Europe,
in France, during the war.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.430
I would imagine that experience really had

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.740
an impact on your thinking, or did it?

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.460
Well, you know, undoubtedly it shaped me.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.840
I don't know what I would have been

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.000
without that experience, but certainly

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.440
I went through a lot of experiences

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.900
that more fortunate children don't have,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.010
and I was luckier than
most of the children

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.760
of my generation in
that place in the world.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.680
- You describe in your
official autobiography,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.290
The Nobel Laureate, an incident

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.520
where you were coming home once.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.130
Would you mind retelling that story?

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.880
'Cause it's quite fascinating.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.653
- Well, must have been
the fall of '41, I think,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.400
where there was a curfew for Jews.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.830
We were all supposed to
be wearing a yellow star.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.033
And there was a curfew,
which I think was 6 p.m.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.983
And I was in first grade,
was first or second grade.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.903
And I'd gone to play with a
friend, and I was going home,

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:13.300
and I missed the curfew; I was late.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.060
And so I turned my sweater
inside out and walked home

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.680
and as I was coming close,
I remember the street

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.530
was deserted, and there
was this German soldier

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.700
walking towards me and he
was wearing the black uniform

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.120
and I knew that that was not good.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.920
That was the uniform
of the SS, and we were

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.550
walking towards each other,
as we were coming close

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.350
he sort of beckoned me,
and of course I went there

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.100
and he picked me up and hugged me.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.610
And I remember being terrified, you know,

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.620
that he would see the star
of David inside my sweater,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.780
and then he put me down
and took out his wallet

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.553
and showed me a picture of a
boy, and gave me some money.

00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:10.580
And yeah, that's a
formative memory in a way

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.610
because of what it meant about
the complexity of things.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.930
I mean, I remember being
very fascinated at the time

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.440
by this and by stories
of Hitler liking flowers

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.440
and kissing babies, and
the complexity of evil was

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.770
much on my mind at a seven-
or eight-year-old, I think.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.810
- And I guess the, in
retrospect, the expectation

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.690
about what somebody like that would do

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.160
if he were rational and
following the orders

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.673
of his organization.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.317
- No, it was ...

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.490
It was more the complexity of the moment

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.190
and the basic humanity of
the fellow who was clearly

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.010
quite capable of being
inhumane at other times,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.173
and I think I already knew this,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.760
but was a father and a
lonely father and with a boy

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.583
and I reminded him of the boy,
and I knew that immediately.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.920
- After the war, you and your
mother emigrated to Israel.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.753
- Indeed.

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:23.860
- Yes, and any memories
from that experience

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.790
of having that chance to
go to Israel and be there

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.470
during that very formative
period in Israel?

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.880
- Well that was, for me, it was of course

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.153
an enormous change because I was lucky.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.230
I was held up a year.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.230
I had been quite Jewish
and feeble in athletics,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.320
and a bit precocious
intellectually and so on,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.700
and in Israel everything was different.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.520
I had basically a normal
adolescence, and I was

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.930
very grateful for that.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.733
The period, of course, was
a very exciting period.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.870
We went there in '46;
actually I think we arrived

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.760
the day that the famous bombing
of the King David Hotel,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.050
which was an important
event in that story.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.050
Then in '48 there was the war and in '51

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.120
I started my studies, and in '54 I myself

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.230
went into the army, so it was
all quite compressed in time.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.440
- And you were educated
at Hebrew University?

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.273
- Yes, indeed.

00:06:33.273 --> 00:06:34.960
- Right, and what was your major?

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.313
- Psychology and my minor was mathematics.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.360
- And then you went into
the army and really became

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.520
a researcher there; talk
a little about that.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.670
- Well, yeah, first
actually, I spent a year,

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.860
which probably in many ways
was at least as important.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.463
I spent a year as a platoon commander.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.610
Those things change you.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.813
And then I was a psychologist.

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:09.720
And it was a period where there was

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.010
no psychology department.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.440
The professor of
psychology had been killed

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.840
in the 1948 war and there was nothing.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.520
And the head of the research unit

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.703
in the psychological
research unit was a chemist.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.090
It was completely self-taught.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.030
But the place was full of brilliant people

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.350
and there was a lot of
very good work being done.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.600
And I was, as it were, the
best-trained psychologist.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.180
I had a BA, which I'd proudly acquired in,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.180
I think, two years, and I was
the best-trained psychologist

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.120
there and I did a number
of things that had

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.810
a big influence on my
development later, so

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.190
one of the things I did do
that I'm still quite proud of

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.300
actually is I set up
an interviewing system

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.170
for the Israeli army to interview

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.500
recruits for combat units, and that,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.760
it turns out, I learned
in 2002, that interview

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.513
is still in place 50 years later.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.780
So they have barely changed it, in fact.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.910
So I had many experiences
that were formative

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.790
in terms of my subsequent
research on judgment.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.230
- Let's talk about that interview.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:25.230
The problem before you
was to match the skillset

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.010
with the requirements of the job.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.380
Talk a little about that
and your thought processes.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.100
Here you are, a young
person with only a BA

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.310
and yet you're putting in place a formula

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.143
that works.

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:43.920
- Well, it turns out, and
that's a bit of history

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:50.080
of my field in psychology that in 1954

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.530
Paul Meehl, a very famous psychologist

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.133
who died just a few years ago,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.020
published a very important book in which

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.480
he showed that clinicians
are much less good

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.780
at what they're doing
than they think they are

00:09:03.855 --> 00:09:07.800
and that their ability to
predict, forecast events

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.790
and psychological behavior in the future

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.320
is really quite limited.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.350
And I must have read that book because

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.420
what I did to set up the
interview system was ...

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.390
I have no memory of reading the book

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.680
but I must have read it, 'cause what I did

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.580
was completely compatible
with what he advised.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.920
And I created, I don't think I could do it

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.960
much better today.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.273
I set up an interview
where people are asked ...

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.790
That didn't leave a lot of
room for clinical intuition

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.260
on part of the interviewer.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.233
The interviewer went through
a script and found out

00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:46.640
what the person had done
as a civilian basically.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.490
And it turns out that when
you use that information

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.310
to produce ratings on various traits,

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.950
and you get ratings that are
predictive and are useful

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.050
on whether somebody is responsible,

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.293
appreciates manliness or
things like that, is sociable.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.857
And in addition it turned
out and that was important

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.450
to me years later, it
turned out that when people

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.090
had acquired that information, then their

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.040
clinical judgment was in fact good.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.650
Whereas if they were trying
to form a clinical impression,

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.710
they couldn't do it.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.490
Now these observations
that I made at that time

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.080
became really quite
essential to my research

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.980
about 15 years later,
and they were central

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.310
to the work that ultimately led

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:38.760
to the Nobel Prize and so on.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.063
So I'd started quite early
and by accident, of course.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.990
- I'm interested in exploring with you

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.990
the skills that make for a psychologist,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.450
in other words, this interface between

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:03.030
skillset and the requirements
of the discipline.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.750
Talk a little about that
because I think students

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.750
often want to know,
well, what does it take

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.610
to do that?

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.943
I wanna do that.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.030
- I think you must enjoy observing things

00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:23.340
and that must be true
for also people who do

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:27.090
zoology or biology must
enjoy observing other things.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.450
I like observing people, and
probably for a psychologist

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:34.780
it also helps a lot to
examine yourself, so I think

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.750
many of the best ideas that I've had

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.130
have come from examining events in my life

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.173
and examining how I respond
to events in my life.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.003
So that's been a source of ideas,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.820
inspiration is too big
a word, but certainly

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.050
a source of ideas.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.050
Then what you learn in
the course of a career is

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.740
you learn not to ask
questions that are so vague

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.910
that there are no answers to them.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.630
So you look for questions
that can be answered.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.280
But you look for questions
that have a twist to them,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.163
that are somehow interesting.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.653
And I've been lucky;
I've had a few of those.

00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:34.754
I think of research as a
conversation, and it really

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.810
is very much like a conversation.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.483
Nobody, no single person dominates it,

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.150
but what does happen is when
you interject something,

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.630
when you contribute
something to a conversation,

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.240
you want to be understood,
you want to be heard,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.150
you would like people to pay attention,

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.990
you would like it to have some influence

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.000
on the way the conversation goes.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.660
You don't control it, but thinking

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.660
in conversational terms
and trying to say something

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.900
that is interesting as a criterion,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.503
not merely publishable
but actually interesting.

00:13:13.341 --> 00:13:16.953
That's been part of what moved me.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:23.300
- As I listen to you talk I
have this sense of kind of

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.090
there is an element of humanity
in your research design.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.836
In other words, I think
the Jewish expression

00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:33.272
(speaking foreign language)

00:13:33.272 --> 00:13:36.530
that part of what you've done in your work

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.290
is to find simple questions that then

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.963
really open up the
conversation; is that fair?

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:46.950
- I think it's fair.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.950
I think, though, that I
was drawn to a particular

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.898
kind of research, but
actually I was inspired

00:13:56.898 --> 00:14:01.193
by research that I read
as a very young professor.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.550
I read work by somebody
who was a very famous

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.650
psychologist, Walter Mischel,
and I read his thesis,

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.530
I think it must have been
1964, and in his thesis,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.173
he had asked children a single question.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.293
I think he had two questions, but one was,

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.730
there is that fairy or
magician who can make of you

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.200
whatever you want to be;
what do you want to be?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.200
And then if they said a
profession or some trait

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.310
that has to do with achievement,

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.340
it was scored one, otherwise zero.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.870
He would give them two lollipops,

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.560
a large one and a small
one, and he would say,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.860
you can have this one
now or that one tomorrow.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.740
And now it turned out that
the answers of children

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.433
to those two questions
predicted everything in sight.

00:14:53.518 --> 00:14:55.540
And I was enormously impressed by that.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.360
And I called that the
psychology of single questions.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.110
And it turned out to be an ideal for me

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.370
of doing research about single questions,

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.680
of having single examples,
and a few years later

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.260
I was fortunate enough to be able to do

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.020
the psychology of single questions,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.350
and I have largely kept to that,

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.513
kept to very simple points,
making very simple points.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:27.030
- An important theme in your
work is your collaboration

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.100
with Amos Tversky, and
you've talked quite a bit

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.260
about that in your
autobiography for the Nobel.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.970
It was very fascinating
and I'd like to talk

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:42.970
a little about that
because it was a friendship

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.980
in which the conversation had great depth

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:53.230
between the two of you and
then really impacted the field.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.043
Talk a little about the
elements of that relationship.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.760
- I think we're both very lucky in a way

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.163
but I certainly consider
myself extraordinarily lucky.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.770
We were close enough so
we understood each other

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.800
very well, and we also
had complementary skills,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.320
so I'm more intuitive than he was.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.260
He was really renowned for his clarity

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.130
and just incredible
clarity and the ability

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.040
to see the big picture, and I'm more

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.450
of an intellectual fumbler,

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.360
but I dig fairly deep, and I also have

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.100
wild flights of fancy.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:40.880
And the combination of those two,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.990
of his characteristics and mine,

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.630
and the fact that we
just got along very well

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.840
and had enormous respect for each other,

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.963
and that we enjoyed each other's company.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.390
I think we knew it; we had
jointly we sort of had a mind

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.410
that was better than our separate minds.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.350
And our joint mind was very, very good.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.690
I'm not embarrassed to say that.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.140
It was much better than mine.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.200
So we did very good
work that way, and there

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.420
was something in the dynamic
that is especially interesting,

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:18.420
I think, to me, which is that
when you think on your own

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.200
as a scientist, as a
researcher, it sometimes

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.090
takes years before you
understand what you're saying,

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.490
so you first say something, you write it,

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.410
it can be published, and only years later,

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.750
you say, oh, I really said that.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.290
It was there, it was in my mind.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.800
Now when there are two of you conversing

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.243
that process is short-circuited.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.840
Really, it's quite
dramatic, so I would say

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.390
vague things, and Amos would hear them,

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:53.160
and he would see what I
meant much more clearly

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.440
than I had when I said it.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.916
And I think that was
really part of the secret

00:17:57.916 --> 00:18:02.670
of our success, was that
together, through that process

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.990
of understanding each other
better than the speaker

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:10.990
had understood himself, we
could make a lot of progress.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.600
We also had infinite patience,

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.293
and we enjoyed spending
six hours a day together.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.860
- And I think at one
point you say that you

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.300
would have a thought and he
could finish it, basically?

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.327
- Well, when you spend six
hours a day with someone

00:18:29.327 --> 00:18:32.350
for a number of years, we
knew each other's jokes

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.480
and of course we could
finish each other's thoughts,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.593
but we kept surprising each other.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.323
So we became very efficient, I think.

00:18:45.218 --> 00:18:46.940
- You've used the term a conversation.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.310
This is a subset of that.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.010
Now, before we talk about the research

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:56.570
that you got the prize
for, there's an intriguing

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.240
element in your story, which
is you're a psychologist,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.680
and you won the prize for economics,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.530
and I guess what's of interest is,

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.800
what are your thoughts about the fact

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.770
that you were working in one discipline

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.970
and were recognized, but then disciplines

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.300
always have boundaries that
wanna limit the conversation,

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:22.310
but then the power of what you were saying

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.990
not only affected psychology
but also economics.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.940
That was kind of unique in a way.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.283
Tell us all about that.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.270
- The first place, the element of luck

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.700
was considerable in that development.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.943
It really didn't have to be that way.

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.443
And there was luck at several stages.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:49.500
There was something that
Amos and I did together

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.630
which had something to
do with the psychology

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.390
of single questions,
which caused many people

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.037
to pay attention to our work.

00:19:58.037 --> 00:20:01.890
And that was that we would
publish our questions

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.940
that basically explored flaws in humans'

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.103
intuitive thinking.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.860
But our questions were very simple

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.820
and each one made a
point, and they were part

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.740
of the articles we published.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.140
And that turned out to be quite important

00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:21.150
to what happened to us
because the readers,

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.400
would read this and
then, the errors were not

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.000
the errors of somebody else,
you know, some subjects.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.720
They knew, they could
recognize in themselves

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.663
that, oh yes, this is
the way my mind works.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.070
This was almost part of our rhetoric,

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:43.180
not of the substance, but the
rhetoric was very effective,

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.310
so we had some economists paying attention

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.900
to our work early on.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.110
Then when we worked on
the decision making,

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.380
which was the second thing we did together

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.690
we published the theory
paper in Econometric,

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:59.150
which is the prestigious
theory journal in economics.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.583
Now we were not intending to
influence economics at all.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.963
It was just the best journal
for the kind of articles.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.430
Now if we had published
exactly the same article

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.220
in Psychological Review,
I would not have got

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.730
the Nobel Prize, so that
was a trivial detail.

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.570
If we'd had a hostile
referee in Econometric

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.320
we would have gone to Psych Review.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.320
But the big event that caused the prize

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.030
is that some economists were interested,

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:35.160
particularly someone who
is now my closest friend,

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.040
Richard Thaler, who is an economist.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.040
He became interested in our work.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.140
And he is the one who
both taught me personally

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.300
economics and brought
these ideas into economics,

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.290
where they are behavioral finance.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.200
So it's because of the work of economists

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.150
that I got the prize.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:57.840
I didn't get the prize for
work that Amos and I did

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.863
just because it was very good work.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.980
We got the prize, or I got the prize,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.643
because he couldn't share in it,

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.230
because it had had impact on economics,

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.990
but the impact was because
people in economics

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.700
saw it was relevant,
and they were a minority

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.500
of people and they did brilliant work.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.720
- Does this tell us
anything about new ideas

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.020
in disciplines, a general proposition

00:22:27.044 --> 00:22:29.180
that innovation maybe
sometimes has to come

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.243
from outside?

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.110
- What I learned, and
that was something I knew.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.760
Remember, we were approached
Amos Tversky and I

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.500
were approached by the person who is now

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.580
the president of the
Russell Sage Foundation,

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.530
Eric Warner, very early in the 1980s,

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.710
almost 25 years ago, and he asked us

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.760
what could be done, exactly 25 years ago,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.510
he asked us what could be done to bring

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.100
psychology and economics together.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.000
And I remember something I told him then.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.040
I said this was not a
project on which we could

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.823
spend a lot of money, honestly.

00:23:07.821 --> 00:23:11.290
And I told him that there
was absolutely no point

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.113
encouraging psychologists
to influence economics.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.880
But that if there were
economists who were interested,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.660
we should support them.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.430
And indeed two years
later, Richard Thaler,

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.570
whose name I mentioned, came to spend

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.450
a year with me in Vancouver,
and we had a glorious year,

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.470
and we published a number
of articles together,

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.190
some of them quite important, actually.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.740
And that was the beginning
of behavioral economics.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.400
- Looking back, what comments
would you like to make

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.410
about creativity, if any?

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:47.830
In other words, from what
we've just talked about,

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.430
is there some point to be made that would

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.580
help us understand?

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.150
We've talked about collaboration,

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.500
we've talked about research design,

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:02.500
and then this funny set of information

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.890
or thinking passing from
one discipline to another?

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.560
- People have very
different tastes, you know.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.030
Intellectually, they have different tastes

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.373
and there are different
skillsets and so on.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.510
I know where my ideas
come from and pretty much

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.130
what characterizes them.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.223
They're very simple.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.410
And I tend to see simple things,

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.210
and sometimes I see some simple thing

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.820
that other people haven't seen before

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.703
but I don't see very complicated things.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.790
And other people are better
at seeing complicated things.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.940
So there are different
kinds of creativity,

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.260
and together with Tversky, we had a range

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.381
of possibilities because he was creative

00:24:56.381 --> 00:24:57.831
in different ways than I was.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.373
- Let's talk a little
now about your research.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.850
And I know that that prize
is built on a whole body

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.450
of research, but I
think it would be useful

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.870
for our understanding, our audience

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.800
to understand, the very simple ideas,

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.670
if I can use your words,
that had such power

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:19.830
and such impact.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:24.347
In your lecture you said,
"The mind is a system

00:25:24.347 --> 00:25:27.320
"of jumps to conclusions,"
and you're looking

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.750
at one piece of that.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:33.750
- Well yes, what we studied
was intuitive thinking

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.790
in the domain of judgment
under uncertainty.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.900
This is how we started.

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.080
That is, how do people
assess the probabilities

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.570
of events and how do they
forecast the future intuitively?

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:49.160
And our idea was that
people use heuristics,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.660
which are basically shortcuts,

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.960
and in my lecture, it's a
phrase I coined this week,

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.570
but I'm going to use it.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.630
I did speak of the mind as a machine

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.353
for jumping to conclusions.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.620
And we figured out some of
the ways that this is done.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.260
I think the most important
one that we studied

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.870
in the first years of
our work was something

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.360
that I now call substitution,

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.970
that is, you're asked
a difficult question.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.020
You cannot answer it, but
another answer comes to mind.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.040
And it's an answer to a related question

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.940
which is simpler, and
without being aware of it,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.390
you substitute the answer
for the simple question

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.310
in place of the answer
to the complicated one.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.530
And this is how laypeople and non-experts

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.830
come up with intuitions
about very complicated

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.870
problems that baffle experts.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.410
Some of these intuitions are good;

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.070
others are not so good,
but that's the machinery.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.810
So that was the first part
of our work on judgment

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:50.410
was basically developing that idea

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.030
and fleshing it out.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.410
- And as your thinking about these issues

00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.950
has developed over time,
you're really focusing

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:04.950
on perception, intuition,
and cognition, right?

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.827
Well, perception, emotion, and cognition.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.470
- The period when we were
working was the heyday

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.100
of what is called the cognitive
revolution, so at the time

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.960
psychologists were all
engaged in exploring

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.070
the mysteries of cognition,
and we were no exception.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:31.940
And one novel aspect of
what we were doing was that

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.920
we imported the notion of
illusion from deception

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.930
into cognition, and so
we showed that people

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.340
make errors of intuitive
thinking that have

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.290
many of the characteristics of illusions.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:48.230
That was because I was teaching
perception at the time.

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:52.160
This was what filled my
mind, and so the analogy

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.930
of visual perception
and how it helps inform

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.530
how we think about intuition,
that's been very important

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.620
to my thinking all the way through.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:04.120
And I have explored
this idea in particular

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.783
over the last five or six years.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.510
- Now talk a little about what you call

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.800
System One intuition.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.800
In other words, people realize they do

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.900
the sorts of things you're describing,

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.890
but it's your description, the description

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:26.470
that has developed is
really an important balance

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.210
when one just focuses on
what you call System Two,

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:30.623
which is rationality.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.080
- This is something

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.010
that has become explicit

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:41.050
in my mind only recently.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.720
One of the things you learn is that

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.760
some ideas are taken for granted.

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.990
So for example, when we
worked we took rationality,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.160
that people are able to
compute correct answers

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.910
to problems, that did not need explaining.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.300
So we were not looking at that.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.813
We were looking at mistakes.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:04.870
But when the field accepted
the notion of mistakes,

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.200
then it became a
challenge that people were

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.520
sometimes able to figure things out

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.280
and to do it correctly,
and the resolution of that,

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.250
which I think is becoming widespread,

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.130
it's not original to me.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.720
This is just generally
accepted in psychology

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.810
is that there are those two
families of mental processes;

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.730
I call them, along with others,

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.030
it's not my term either,
System One and System Two,

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.340
one of which is the
intuitive, rapid, associative,

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.450
uncontrolled, automatic kind of thing,

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.600
and the other one is rule governed,

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.790
that's the way that you
fill your income tax form,

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.400
or compute 17ths then 24, or read a map.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.170
And so we're able to think in this way,

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.930
but most of the time
we run on the software

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:53.340
of System One, that is, automatically

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.430
and with little thought, and by and large,

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.613
with remarkable success and accuracy.

00:29:58.485 --> 00:30:01.760
- In an interview somewhere
which I read with you,

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.190
you said with fear,
probability does not matter

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.580
as much; the more emotional event,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.970
the less sensible people are.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.970
- Well, this is a development
of the last 10 or 15 years,

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:20.310
so the cognitive revolution
is now over, and what is

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:25.310
happening in the field is
that emotion is now being ...

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:31.190
So the views of decision
making have changed,

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.500
and in a way, they're going
back to what was common

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.790
60, 70, 80 years ago, that is, to the idea

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.720
that there are very important conflicts

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.313
between reason and passion.

00:30:44.602 --> 00:30:47.090
Nobody was thinking along
those lines 20 years ago

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.173
but many people are thinking
along those lines today,

00:30:51.628 --> 00:30:56.120
and so the idea that one of the operations

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.010
of System One that is
one of the attributes

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.083
that are constantly being
evaluated by System One,

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.190
is the emotional significance of events.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:09.490
So we're continuously
evaluating whether things

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.123
are good or bad, or safe,
or threatening and so on.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.000
And our emotional responses guide us,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.710
and our emotional
responses guide the ideas

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.953
that come to our minds.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.720
- Well, in one thing that I read possibly

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.360
in the autobiography,
the issue arose that,

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:31.670
very important to your work, is the way

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.500
one defines a problem, and I guess

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.870
that is the problem you're researching,

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:43.870
so that in the area of
risk and loss, for example,

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:49.050
your thinking as I understand it, sort of

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.890
opened up our understanding of how

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.820
people perceive risk and loss in economic

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.770
decision making, because previously

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:00.363
the focus had been just
on wealth, that is,

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.820
the entire fortune that was at stake.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.360
- Well, again, it's a
very simple idea, but

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.470
it is true that, I think, for 300 years

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:22.060
the focus in the analysis
of financial decisions,

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.130
decisions about money,
has been about wealth.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:28.980
So people have talked about
the utility of wealth,

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.640
which is, what is the
psychological response to wealth?

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.040
And that people evaluate
different prospects

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.750
and opportunities by
evaluating them in terms of

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.823
what is called finite states of wealth.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.710
Now, when I started studying this field

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.190
under the tutelage,
actually, of Amos Tversky,

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:51.530
who had studied it.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.063
It was not my specialty.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.930
I was struck by the absurdity of it.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.810
And I was struck by the
fact that this is not

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.770
the way that people think about risk.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.230
They think about risk in
terms of gains and losses.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:06.360
You don't know what wealth you have.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.800
Now it turns out that
that is a very fundamental

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.170
reorganization of the field.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.990
A few think that outcomes are in terms of

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.680
gains and losses and
nothing to the final states,

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.130
so it opened up a whole agenda that people

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.533
are still working out.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.990
- What I hear you saying, and I don't mean

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:28.010
to repeat myself, but
that by kind of narrowing

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:32.890
the focus, by having an intuition about

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.700
the way people are or the way you are,

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.940
as you said, that this is really central

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.113
to what's going on in your work.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.520
- There are similar stages
to this, so this idea

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.403
of gains and losses, and
that people evaluate changes,

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.230
that I distinctly remember
how I had that idea,

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:01.190
so I was reading a chapter in a book that

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.860
Amos Tversky was one of
the authors of that book,

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:08.110
and it was a chapter on how
people analyze decisions.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:10.660
Many important philosophers
had been analyzing

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:15.660
the so-called utility function
for money, and I noticed

00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.500
that they never asked people about wealth.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.380
They said, what about a
gamble in which you could

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.760
win that amount with a certain probability

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.293
or get that amount for sure.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.890
They didn't do losses much,
but it was all about changes.

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:33.690
And I came back to Amos and I said, hey,

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:34.913
what's going on here?

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:38.440
They're asking questions about this

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:41.333
and then they're plotting a
function in terms of that.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.600
That is psychologically very
implausible, so you need

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.990
to be able to pay attention to this.

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:51.900
And then you need to
realize that it's important.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:55.450
So on the very day, it
was obvious that we would

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:59.050
never look at wealth
again, that we were going

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:01.670
to do something that is
psychologically realistic.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.790
Of course he was immediately convinced.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.220
Somebody else had had that idea before,

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.290
but they hadn't followed
through with it and we did,

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:11.990
so you need a very simple idea, and then

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:14.410
you need to see that it's important.

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.270
Then you need to follow through, and it's

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.053
a combination of tools.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:24.800
- I'm curious because people
listening to your lecture

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.610
or listening to you now, the question is,

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:32.610
does your research offer
insights to individuals

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.443
with regard to how they might
change their own behavior?

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.470
- Well, yes, potentially it does,

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.833
but they're not insights
that are very easy to use.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:50.730
You can be aware of mistakes
you make, and it's very

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.410
difficult to learn to avoid
them because System One

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.013
operates automatically.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.410
Occasionally, when a
decision is very important

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:04.010
then you can stop to think,
and you have to recognize that

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.433
you can stop to think.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.080
And then there is still the extra stage

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.400
which is a very painful
and difficult stage of,

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.970
even if your analysis
tells you to do something

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:21.390
when you don't want to do it, to impose

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.610
the discipline of
rationality on your desires

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:26.320
is extremely difficult.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.630
I've just lived something like this

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.050
in deciding whether or
not to write a book, and

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.680
I just want to do it.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.460
When I analyze the pros
and cons, it's absurd

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.900
for me to do this, but I'm
going to do it, I think.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.310
So it's very difficult
to impose discipline

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.143
on yourself.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:51.200
- In your lecture you
talked about individuals,

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.200
a fireman, a nurse,
who essentially develop

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.540
an intuition that is
critical to their career,

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.160
and their being able to see things.

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.860
Talk a little about that,
because you are approaching

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:10.340
the question of how a person develops

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.967
over time and kind of
masters their intuition.

00:37:16.697 --> 00:37:17.990
- One of the important developments

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:21.193
in recent years in my life has been,

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.900
I try to understand controversy,

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.900
and I try to reduce controversy.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:31.400
So we have, Tversky and
I, we made our reputation

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.313
by finding flaws in what people do.

00:37:35.617 --> 00:37:37.070
It was the method we used.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.280
It's not that we ever thought
that people are stupid,

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.830
but this is what we were doing.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.510
Now, many people have
responded to that by saying

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.400
that we're drawing a distorted
picture of human nature,

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.750
and one of the people
who responded to that,

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:55.870
his name is Gary Klein, and he is the guru

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.713
of a movement that is called
natural decision making,

00:37:59.573 --> 00:38:01.823
and they're very much
interested in intuition

00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:05.790
and deliberately skeptical
about the kind of work

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.350
that we've done, and so I approached him

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.320
because I liked his work, actually.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.110
And we've been
collaborating on an article,

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:16.310
so I was citing, in my lecture, examples

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:20.780
from his work in professional intuitions.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:25.410
That as a fireman, a captain
of a firefighting company,

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.360
on the roof is suddenly
yelling to his company,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.853
let's get out of here!

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.170
Just before the house explodes,

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.100
and then it turns out he wasn't aware

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.130
of where he was doing it,
but his feet were warm.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.690
And that was the cue
that triggered the sense

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.580
that something very dangerous is going on

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:45.713
just underneath him.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.330
That's a beautiful example
of the perfect intuition.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:52.830
And that's the kind of
thing that has been feeding

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.480
people who think that all our discussions

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.320
of biases and mistakes
are overstated, so it sets

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.420
a very interesting problem that Gary Klein

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.350
and I have been trying
to sort out together.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.510
When do intuitions develop
and when don't they?

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.090
Which experts can you
trust, and which experts

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:13.090
shouldn't you trust?

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.430
- In my notes for your lecture you said

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:21.200
that skills are acquired in an environment

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.290
of feedback and opportunity for learning

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:25.420
in a social network,

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.230
so that would help us understand

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:32.293
what makes it possible for
the fireman to be that way.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.230
- They think about situations a lot,

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:37.640
and they think, they
talk about things a lot,

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.430
so they develop models of
various kinds of fires.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.460
They don't have to experience.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.450
We are really capable
of learning a great deal

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.163
from simulated experience.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:52.360
Even athletes can learn
from simulating things

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.840
in their mind, and they do.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.983
They practice a lot at night
without doing anything.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.340
So this is one piece of
machinery that we dispose of.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.563
It would not help you in certain domains.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.140
It's not something that
a CIA analyst can do

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.850
because the system that they deal with

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:14.330
are fundamentally more complicated.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.350
- Which raises the interesting question

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.900
of how groups can learn
from their own experience,

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.900
and so your work is
related to decision making

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.510
in the marketplace, and in
a minute we'll talk about

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.700
your article on foreign
policy, and in those cases,

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.590
what is the difference
when you have institutions

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:39.310
and groups that would like to correct

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.920
these kinds of errors?

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.870
- Well, in the first place,

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.920
my main observation would be that groups,

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.093
by and large, do not correct errors.

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.110
That's a recurrent observation.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:55.660
There is a lot of lip
service paid in organizations

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.980
about improving the
quality of our intelligence

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.433
and the quality of our decision making.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:03.460
But I think it's mainly lip service

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:08.320
because imposing a discipline
on decision making,

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.970
as I illustrated by my
example in the book,

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:14.160
I don't want to imposed
discipline on my decision making.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.930
And so the leaders of organizations,

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.913
both civilian and
governmental and commercial,

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:24.160
they don't like to be
second-guessed, and so

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.343
by and large, it's the rare leader,

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.080
and there are very salient examples,

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.973
like the Bay of Pigs, I
mean after the Bay of Pigs.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.590
Well, it's mainly actually
not the Bay of Pigs;

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.890
it's the Cuban missile
crisis is the example

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:48.580
that people think about,
as where somebody really,

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:52.110
the President Kennedy developed this team,

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:55.560
a deliberating team that
was superbly efficient

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.937
in allowing dissent and in allowing ideas

00:41:57.937 --> 00:42:01.720
and in slowing down the
process of decision making

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.990
to a rate that was
appropriate to the complexity

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:05.140
of the situation.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.133
That's very rare.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.650
- And in some domains,
for example, politics,

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.940
the whole name of the game
becomes not to do what

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:17.310
the other party did and how they learned.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:21.840
Now, recently you had an
article in Foreign Policy

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.740
which in a way, applying your
analysis to foreign policy

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:32.150
decision making is
pessimistic in the sense that

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:37.150
it suggests that hawks
have a structural advantage

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.190
in the sense that the choices
that they lean toward,

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:47.190
whatever the issue,
basically fall into many

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.930
of the categories that you've identified

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.820
in individual decision making.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.270
- Yeah, I think that's right.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.580
I think it's significant.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.810
I think it's probably true.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:03.580
I didn't expect to see
this but when I made

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.130
a list of the biases of human thinking

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.140
and decision making, it turned out that

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.910
in a situation of conflict, when conflict

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:17.910
is about to develop or
arise, then these biases

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:23.780
very consistently, I thought,
favor hawks over doves,

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.730
so that the claims of
hawks will resonate with

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.350
emotions and beliefs
and things that people

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:32.010
want to believe more
than the claims of doves,

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.650
and that was the point of that article.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.800
- And in fact, there's an optimistic bias.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.280
Well, we have all of this
military hardware; let's do

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.060
an illusion of control,
and we can go in there

00:43:45.041 --> 00:43:48.710
and by defeating the adversary,
we can then take control.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:52.200
- Clearly, it's very
clear whenever you look

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.410
at a serious conflict
or a war that there was

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.480
enormous optimism, usually on both sides.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:04.970
It's not only on the losing
side that was optimistic.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.603
The winning side didn't
appreciate the costs.

00:44:08.994 --> 00:44:11.090
And that, I think, is regularly true.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:13.390
It's very difficult to think of a conflict

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.770
in which anybody had
any idea, when it began,

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.993
how bad it was going to be for both sides.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.370
Now, of course, it is the case that

00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:29.870
when conflict breaks out
that there has been optimism,

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:33.510
but almost by definition, you
get optimists on both sides

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.263
of every conflict, and
when conflict arises,

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:42.860
pessimism becomes
disloyalty, so that doubting

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:46.200
our ability to achieve
victory, it would take

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.230
a very, very strong
national leader to be able

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.370
to sustain some doubter
in his inner circle,

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:55.300
when he himself wants to move forward.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:00.300
- And unfortunately, in
terms of where we are now

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.543
it's difficult to cut losses.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:08.430
I know that if one has a mutual
fund that has not done well,

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:13.320
one doesn't wanna move it
for fear that you will lose

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.350
even more by rationally moving it.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:21.350
- Well, people in general don't
like cutting their losses.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.130
And they're willing to
gamble on in the hope

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.340
of recovering their losses, and that is

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:30.780
a very well-known
characteristic of individual

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.590
decision making, and in
national decision making

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:37.350
it's exacerbated, because
the national leaders

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.363
who have led a country to close to defeat,

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:47.720
for them there is really
nothing further to be lost

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.870
by putting more at risk, and so there is

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.620
a real divergence of interest
between national leaders

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:59.780
and their communities when
the time to cut losses arrives

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:04.470
because cutting losses
is very rarely beneficial

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:06.530
to the decision maker.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:10.430
- I would be interested
in your reflections

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:15.430
on human nature, actually,
because you've actually

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.660
devoted a whole career
to looking at the quirks

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:23.072
of our personalities, the blind spots

00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:25.653
in our rational thinking.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.080
Did you start with the same view?

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.730
Had you ended up in the same
place that you started with?

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:35.203
You started, you said, with complexity.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:42.730
This choice, this
interaction with this soldier

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:47.440
in the streets of Paris,
you did was complexity.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.710
Is that where you still
are and has anything

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.760
come out of your research
that has informed

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.763
whatever view of human nature you had?

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.960
- Again, they're very
different intellectual styles,

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.960
so there are some people
who summarize their world

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.610
and can summarize it in one big idea.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:14.410
That's not the way my mind works.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:18.240
So I think there is some coherence

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.813
in my view of the way
people work, but I have

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:27.947
built things one brick at
a time, and I don't think

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.310
I have a simple summary.

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:35.330
I can, in general, find
pretty good arguments

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:37.840
to reject any simple
idea about human nature,

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.470
but it's not that I have
a simple idea of my own

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.500
to substitute for it, so in that sense,

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.770
yes, complexity is my message.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:48.673
- Now if students were
to watch this program,

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:54.250
do you have any advice for
them about how they should

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.730
prepare for their future if, for example,

00:47:56.730 --> 00:48:00.133
they wanna go into the
field of psychology?

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:10.840
- My main advice would be to look at

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:16.030
the natural traps that await
anybody who does research.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:20.520
And one of the real traps
is to get trapped by

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.890
a research program that is
fundamentally uninteresting.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:28.460
And also, a reluctance to cut your losses,

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.470
so that when you've done
something that is not

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.480
very interesting, wasting
time trying to publish it

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.520
is almost always a big mistake,
so at least in my judgment.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.890
So looking for things that are worth doing

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:45.460
and discarding things that
don't work, and knowing

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.930
that, if you're reasonably
good at what you're doing

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:50.980
and otherwise you shouldn't
be in that profession,

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.760
but if you're reasonably good at it,

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.250
then ideas are a dime a dozen.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:56.660
You get lots of ideas.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.180
You need some ideas that work
and that keep you excited,

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.710
and that you can do something with.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:04.430
So not getting stuck on
an idea that doesn't work

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:07.000
but looking for other ideas.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.070
That would be my general advice.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.940
That has been how I've operated.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:16.940
- Yeah, at the end of your
autobiography you go back

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.100
to your relationship with Amos Tversky,

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.520
and you quote him, and
I thought that these

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.140
were both very interesting comments.

00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:29.177
You say, "But the other side of freedom

00:49:29.177 --> 00:49:32.727
"is the ability to find
joy in what one does

00:49:32.727 --> 00:49:35.720
"and the ability to adapt creatively

00:49:37.129 --> 00:49:38.310
"to the inevitable."

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:43.310
And then you go on to tell
us that he often said,

00:49:43.557 --> 00:49:48.000
"Let us take what the terrain gives."

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.380
- Well, this was a graveside eulogy

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.673
forward his scheming when he died in 1996.

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:59.290
So adapting to the
inevitable, I was commenting

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.960
on how he managed his death,

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.310
which was really exemplary.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.840
He really did quite extraordinary things

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:08.403
in managing his dying.

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:13.790
Let's take what the terrain
gives was the expression

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:17.333
of his wisdom as a researcher
in his latter years.

00:50:18.678 --> 00:50:20.823
And it's the idea that
you cannot really define

00:50:20.823 --> 00:50:25.100
in advance the problem
that you're going to solve.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.340
If you decide that I'm
going to solve this problem

00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:29.240
you are not going to do it.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:32.400
What you do is you are in that area

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.550
and you do the best you can.

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:35.253
You take what the terrain gives,

00:50:36.463 --> 00:50:38.607
and you adapt to what it
is that you can find out,

00:50:38.607 --> 00:50:42.220
and you don't try to force
your ideas on nature.

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:45.453
You're guided by what is achievable.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.810
It's very good advice for some people,

00:50:51.810 --> 00:50:54.440
but it was very good advice for him,

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.070
better than for me, for example, but yeah,

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:58.813
that was his intellectual style.

00:51:01.116 --> 00:51:03.360
- In the final question,
you mentioned that

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.950
you might do another book.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:09.600
Is there a piece of research, a set agenda

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.363
that you still wanna pursue in that space?

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.600
- I've been working for
the last 10, 12 years

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.810
on issues of well-being and experience,

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:22.040
and measuring experience, and the book

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.730
that I'm thinking about
is actually a trade book.

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:26.650
I don't know if it will happen at my age.

00:51:26.650 --> 00:51:30.670
You never know, but it would really cover

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:33.500
the main topics that
I've worked on because

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:37.630
I've given a lot of public lectures,

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:40.870
and I like talking to lay audiences, and

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:43.410
in general I like thinking simply about

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.040
the things they do, and
so I thought it would be

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:49.010
a good opportunity to put things together.

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:51.080
So I think I'm going to try to do this.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:55.760
- Do your insights about intuition apply,

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.670
are they a useful
foundation for understanding

00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:59.923
what makes us happy?

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.413
Or is it a separate ...

00:52:02.413 --> 00:52:05.450
- No, I think it's a separate ...

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:08.220
There is a lot in common
because there are certain

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.180
mistakes that we make
and anticipate what will

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:15.730
and will not make us
happy, and these mistakes

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:18.560
really are very well
understood by the notion

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.683
of substitution that I mentioned earlier.

00:52:23.275 --> 00:52:26.630
We make highly predictable
errors in thinking

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:29.180
about our future, about
what makes us happy,

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.450
about what makes other people happy.

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:33.890
- On that note, Professor
Kahneman, I wanna thank you

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.640
very much for coming back to Berkeley

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.379
and for appearing on our program.

00:52:37.379 --> 00:52:38.212
Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:52:38.212 --> 00:52:40.680
- Thank you very much, and
thank you for joining us

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:42.853
for this Conversation with History.
