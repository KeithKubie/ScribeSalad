00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's suppose we have a fair coin and we flipped it four times.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'd like you to tell me what is the probability that there is exactly one head

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
divided by the probability that only the very first flip is a head.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please enter your answer here.
