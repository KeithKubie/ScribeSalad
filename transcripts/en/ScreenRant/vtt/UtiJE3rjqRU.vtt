00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.330
\

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.940
For certain characters within the Marvel Cinematic
Universe, fans may be hard-pressed to imagine

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.309
any other actor in that role-- especially
since most performers in Marvel Studios' shared

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.340
universe have played their character in one
or two — or more — films.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.590
But, as is the case in the casting process
on any feature, there were multiple people

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.869
up for key roles.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.590
For both Captain America and Iron Man, other
actors were eventually beat out by Chris Evans

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.869
and Robert Downey Jr.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.650
In honor of those who lost out to the MCU's
Avengers roster, here are Screen Rant's 10

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.300
Marvel movie castings you didn't know almost
happened.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.229
John Krasinski as Peter Quill

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.760
Before Marvel officially cast Chris Evans,
The Office's John Krasinski was a frontrunner

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.940
for Captain America.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.750
Then, a few years later, the comedy actor
was on the shortlist for another MCU role,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.140
this time as Peter Quill a.k.a. Star-Lord
in James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.370
But, although the part eventually went to
fellow sitcom star Chris Pratt, Krasinski

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.269
wasn't even the second choice for Star-Lord.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.439
That honor belongs to Glenn Howerton of It's
Always Sunny in Philadelphia fame.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.299
It's clear, at least, that Gunn had a very
specific type of actor in mind for the part

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.040
of Star-Lord, though it may be difficult to
imagine anyone other than Chris Pratt in the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.040
film.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040
Josh Hartnett as Loki

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.780
Before Kenneth Branagh's Thor went into production,
there were plenty of rumors surrounding both

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.050
the key role and the part of his brother Loki,
the God of Mischief.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.530
Before the role eventually went to Tom Hiddleston
—&nbsp;who also screen-tested for the lead as

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.700
Thor — Loki was rumored to be played by
Josh Hartnett.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.840
However, shortly after Chris Hemsworth locked
down the role of Thor, Hiddleston was cast

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.250
as Loki, leaving us to wonder what could have
been if the God of Mischief had been played

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.290
by Hartnett.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.159
Emily Blunt as Black Widow

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.680
Before Scarlett Johansson signed on to Iron
Man 2 as Natasha Romanoff, the role belonged

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.890
to Emily Blunt.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.740
However, contractual obligations to 20th Century
Fox caused the actress to drop out and star

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.170
in Gulliver's Travels.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.229
Johansson landed the role in Iron Man 2 as
well as all following appearances of Black

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.430
Widow in the MCU.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.321
Later, Blunt was rumored to be up for the
role of Peggy Carter in Captain America: The

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:06.390
First Avenger, but reportedly passed because
she didn't want a part that was simply a love

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.160
interest - the role has since been played
by Hayley Atwell in multiple movies and her

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.510
own TV series on ABC.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.920
Liam Hemsworth as Thor

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.760
Although Chris Hemsworth auditioned for the
lead in Kenneth Branagh's Thor, he wasn't

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.100
chosen for the shortlist of five actors, and
originally wasn't even given a call-back.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.240
His brother Liam, however, was among the final
five actors whittled down to play Thor.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.160
But, when Branagh decided none of the five
actors were quite right for the part, Chris's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.310
manager pushed his name forward - and he was
eventually chosen as the God of Thunder.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.819
Olivia Wilde as Gamora

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.810
The alien assassin Gamora was played by Zoe
Saldana in Guardians of the Galaxy, but before

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.400
she was cast in the role, Marvel Studios reportedly
offered it to Olivia Wilde.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.310
The actress was one of the final contenders
along with Gina Carano and Adrianne Palicki

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.370
— both of whom went on to star in other
Marvel Comics properties.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.440
According to the report, Wilde passed on the
role as Gamora in favor of another project,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.480
paving the way for Saldana to star in one
of Marvel's most popular films.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.849
Jason Momoa as Drax the Destroyer

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.220
Although WWE star Dave Bautista portrayed
Drax the Destroyer in the final Guardians

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.970
of the Galaxy film, the overly-literal alien
was almost played by Jason Momoa.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.980
Marvel even went as far as to commission concept
art of Momoa as Drax, but the actor ended

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.849
up turning down the part in fear of being
typecast after his roles in Game of Thrones

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.160
and Conan the Barbarian.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.500
However, both the actors and audiences won
out in the end since Bautista nearly stole

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.151
the show as Drax, and Momoa landed a different
superhero role in the DC Extended Universe

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:31.550
as Aquaman.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.160
Sam Rockwell as Iron Man

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.209
A number of big name actors were considered
for Jon Favreau's Iron Man, a film that would

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.660
launch the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we
know it.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.379
Tom Cruise is the most notable name to have
been in talks for the role, but Sam Rockwell

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.550
was also on the shortlist to play Iron Man.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.860
However, Rockwell was beat out by Robert Downey
Jr., who has since gone on to be one of the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.270
most recognizable faces of the MCU.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.920
Rockwell did of course appear in Iron Man
2, playing Tony's rival Justin Hammer.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.770
Joaquin Phoenix as The Hulk

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.790
Similar to Spider-Man, The Hulk is a Marvel
Comics character who has been portrayed by

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.190
a number of different actors in the past two
decades.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.910
Eric Bana starred in Ang Lee's Hulk, while
Edward Norton wore the iconic purple shorts

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.940
in The Incredible Hulk and was then replaced
by Mark Ruffalo for The Avengers.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.910
But, even more actors have been attached to
the role of the Hulk in his many incarnations,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.220
including Jeff Goldblum, Tom Cruise, and Joaquin
Phoenix.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.949
According to rumors, Phoenix was Marvel's
top choice to play the Hulk in The Avengers,

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.069
but Ruffalo joined the cast instead.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:31.150
Years later, Phoenix was reportedly in talks
for the lead in Marvel's Doctor Strange, but

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.400
again the studio went in another direction,
casting Benedict Cumberbatch as the Sorcerer

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400
Supreme.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.139
Rachel McAdams as Pepper Potts

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.810
Before joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe
in Doctor Strange, Rachel McAdams was previously

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.309
up for another key role: that of Pepper Potts
in Iron Man.

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:49.870
She was offered the part in Jon Favreau's
film but turned it down in favor of other

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.870
projects.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.770
Instead, Gwyneth Paltrow co-starred alongside
Robert Downey Jr. in Iron Man, as well as

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.850
its two sequels.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.219
Now, McAdams will join the mystical side of
the MCU as a currently undisclosed character

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.479
alongside Benedict Cumberbatch in Doctor Strange.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.379
Channing Tatum as Captain America
Chris Evans has publicly stated time and time

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.950
again that he was hesitant to join the burgeoning
Marvel Cinematic Universe as Steve Rodgers

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.930
- and it was his friends Robert Downey Jr
and Mark Ruffalo who eventually persuaded

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:15.930
him to take the role.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.910
But, before Evans threw his hat into the ring,
a number of other actors were considered for

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.680
the role, including Friday Night Lights' Scott
Porter, Twilight's Kellan Lutz, and even dancer-turned-actor

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.720
Channing Tatum.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.020
Though fans may wonder what Captain America:
The First Avenger would have looked like with

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.300
Tatum in the lead role, the role of Steve
Rogers eventually went to Evans.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.439
Johnny Depp as Doctor Strange

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.279
Before Benedict Cumberbatch joined the cast
of Marvel's mystical origin film as the Sorcerer

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.919
Supreme, a number of actors were rumored for
the role, including Joaquin Phoenix and frequent

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.849
Tim Burton collaborator Johnny Depp.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.110
However, Phoenix is more a fan of crafting
independent films than starring in big superhero

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.240
blockbusters - especially if those comic book
flicks come with signing contracts for multiple

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.240
movies.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.150
Depp, for his part, was already locked into
Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean, continuing

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.889
on as the fan favorite scoundrel Captain Jack
Sparrow.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.119
So, Stephen Strange will instead be portrayed
by Cumberbatch as he joins the MCU in Doctor

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:08.119
Strange.

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:11.129
It may be hard to imagine what these Marvel
movies would have looked like if someone else

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.139
had been cast in the lead roles, but are there
any actors you would have preferred to play

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.090
Captain America or Iron Man?
