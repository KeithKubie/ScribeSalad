it's it's unbelievable the degree to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330
it's it's unbelievable the degree to
 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.329
it's it's unbelievable the degree to
which our sanity depends on a

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339
which our sanity depends on a
 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.579
which our sanity depends on a
functioning sociological structure and

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589
functioning sociological structure and
 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.089
functioning sociological structure and
here's why well first of all you kind of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099
here's why well first of all you kind of
 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.919
here's why well first of all you kind of
need to know what to do every day you

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
need to know what to do every day you
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.450
need to know what to do every day you
have to have a routine because you're an

a dog or a cat dogs are really good
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.660
a dog or a cat dogs are really good
example this dogs like routine they like

example this dogs like routine they like
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.400
example this dogs like routine they like
to be walked the number of times a day

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
to be walked the number of times a day
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.840
to be walked the number of times a day
that they're supposed to be walked and

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
that they're supposed to be walked and
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.820
that they're supposed to be walked and
they get quite sick very rapidly if you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
they get quite sick very rapidly if you
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.910
they get quite sick very rapidly if you
don't if you don't routinize they're

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
don't if you don't routinize they're
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.009
don't if you don't routinize they're
they're days children are exactly the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
they're days children are exactly the
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.290
they're days children are exactly the
same way now you can overdo it right but

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
same way now you can overdo it right but
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.940
same way now you can overdo it right but
still you know you need to know

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
still you know you need to know
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.889
still you know you need to know
approximately when you should get up to

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
approximately when you should get up to
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.350
approximately when you should get up to
be approximately the same every day you

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
be approximately the same every day you
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880
be approximately the same every day you
need to know approximately you're going

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

to know who you're going to eat with you
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.610
to know who you're going to eat with you
need to know where to buy your food it's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
need to know where to buy your food it's
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.119

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.400
like 80% of your life 70% of your life
something like that consists of those

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
something like that consists of those
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.860
something like that consists of those
things that you do every single day that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
things that you do every single day that
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290
things that you do every single day that
you repeat and those are often the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
you repeat and those are often the
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970
you repeat and those are often the
things that people think about as the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
things that people think about as the
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.740
things that people think about as the
trivial elements of their life but one

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
trivial elements of their life but one
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.720
trivial elements of their life but one
of the things I would like to point out

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
of the things I would like to point out
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.840
of the things I would like to point out
to you if you do the mathematics I did

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
to you if you do the mathematics I did
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.160
to you if you do the mathematics I did
this with a client of mine who was

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
this with a client of mine who was
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.770
this with a client of mine who was
having a hard time putting his child to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
having a hard time putting his child to
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.510
having a hard time putting his child to
bed they were having a fight every night

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
bed they were having a fight every night
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.450
bed they were having a fight every night
and I knew by that time the studies

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
and I knew by that time the studies
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.240
and I knew by that time the studies
indicate that most parents only spend 20

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
indicate that most parents only spend 20
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190
indicate that most parents only spend 20
minutes per day of one-on-one time with

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200
minutes per day of one-on-one time with
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.490
minutes per day of one-on-one time with
their child now the reason for that is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
their child now the reason for that is
 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.080
their child now the reason for that is
that people are busy and it's actually

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
that people are busy and it's actually
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.330
that people are busy and it's actually
not that easy to parse out 20 minutes of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
not that easy to parse out 20 minutes of
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.310
not that easy to parse out 20 minutes of
one-on-one time it's a lot bloody more

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320
one-on-one time it's a lot bloody more
 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.859
one-on-one time it's a lot bloody more
time than you think but that's all there

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
time than you think but that's all there
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.770
time than you think but that's all there
is 20 minutes he is spending like 40

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
is 20 minutes he is spending like 40
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.210
is 20 minutes he is spending like 40
minutes a day fighting with this kid

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220
minutes a day fighting with this kid
 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.370
minutes a day fighting with this kid
trying to get the kid to go to bed and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
trying to get the kid to go to bed and
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.980
trying to get the kid to go to bed and
that's not very entertaining you know

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
that's not very entertaining you know
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.810
that's not very entertaining you know
you think why is just having a scrap

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
you think why is just having a scrap
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.520
you think why is just having a scrap
with the kid about going to bed but it's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
with the kid about going to bed but it's
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.010
with the kid about going to bed but it's
no no no no no if it happens every day

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
no no no no no if it happens every day
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.429
no no no no no if it happens every day
it's a catastrophe so you do the math so

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
it's a catastrophe so you do the math so
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.350
it's a catastrophe so you do the math so
we'll say five hours a week for the sake

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
we'll say five hours a week for the sake
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030
we'll say five hours a week for the sake
of argument just to keep it simple it's

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
of argument just to keep it simple it's
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.649
of argument just to keep it simple it's
20 hours a month it's 240 hours a year

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
20 hours a month it's 240 hours a year
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.740
20 hours a month it's 240 hours a year
that's six 40-hour work weeks that guy

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
that's six 40-hour work weeks that guy
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300
that's six 40-hour work weeks that guy
was basically spending a month and a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
was basically spending a month and a
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.740
was basically spending a month and a
half of work weeks doing absolutely

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
half of work weeks doing absolutely
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.459
half of work weeks doing absolutely
nothing but having a wretched time

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469
nothing but having a wretched time
 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.109
nothing but having a wretched time

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
fighting with his son trying to get him
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.999
fighting with his son trying to get him
to go to bed

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009
to go to bed
 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.589
to go to bed
horrible right that's just way too much

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599
horrible right that's just way too much
 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.430
horrible right that's just way too much
time

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
time
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.770
time
spend doing something like that if you

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780
spend doing something like that if you
 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.790
spend doing something like that if you
want to actually have a positive

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
want to actually have a positive
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.440
want to actually have a positive
relationship with someone because it's

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450
relationship with someone because it's
 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.270
relationship with someone because it's
just too it's just too punishing and so

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280
just too it's just too punishing and so
 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.710
just too it's just too punishing and so
well so you need a structure you need

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
well so you need a structure you need
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.570
well so you need a structure you need
predictability and you need more of it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
predictability and you need more of it
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.380
predictability and you need more of it
than you think

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
than you think
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.080
than you think
just to keep you sane now if you're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090
just to keep you sane now if you're
 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.080
just to keep you sane now if you're
lucky and maybe a bit odd you can

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
lucky and maybe a bit odd you can
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.010
lucky and maybe a bit odd you can
deviate 5% from the norm or 10% from the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
deviate 5% from the norm or 10% from the
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.170
deviate 5% from the norm or 10% from the
norm or something like that carefully

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
norm or something like that carefully
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.540
norm or something like that carefully
and cautiously as long as the rest of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
and cautiously as long as the rest of
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.190
and cautiously as long as the rest of
you is all well ordered in a normative

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
you is all well ordered in a normative
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.840
you is all well ordered in a normative
manner you might be able to get away

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850
manner you might be able to get away
 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.040
manner you might be able to get away
with that and you might be able to

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050
with that and you might be able to
 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.110
with that and you might be able to
sustain it across time and people might

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
sustain it across time and people might
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.000
sustain it across time and people might
be able to tolerate you if you do it or

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
be able to tolerate you if you do it or
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.590
be able to tolerate you if you do it or
maybe you'll get really lucky and you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600
maybe you'll get really lucky and you
 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.540
maybe you'll get really lucky and you
happen to be creative but reasonably

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
happen to be creative but reasonably
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.650
happen to be creative but reasonably
well put together and people will

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
well put together and people will
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.770
well put together and people will
actually be happy that there's something

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780
actually be happy that there's something
 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.540
actually be happy that there's something
idiosyncratic and unique about you but

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550
idiosyncratic and unique about you but
 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.400
idiosyncratic and unique about you but
even under those circumstances mostly

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
even under those circumstances mostly
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.430
even under those circumstances mostly
what you want is to have a routine it's

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
what you want is to have a routine it's
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.770
what you want is to have a routine it's
discipline its predictable and bloody

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
discipline its predictable and bloody
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.770
discipline its predictable and bloody
well stick to it you're going to be way

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780
well stick to it you're going to be way
 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.660
well stick to it you're going to be way
healthier and happier and saner if you

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
healthier and happier and saner if you
 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.860
healthier and happier and saner if you
do that and then the other thing that

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
