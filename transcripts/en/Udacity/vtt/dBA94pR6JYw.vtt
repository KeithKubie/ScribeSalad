00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Suppose we live in a discrete world like this, and this is a world we'll be programming.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's for simplicity assume that the world is divided into little grid cells.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Our initial location is over here facing north or up.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the vehicle and the little arrow over here indicates where it's facing.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll call this "Start."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We wish to get to this area over here, presumably facing to the left side.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's assume at each time step I can either move forward or I can turn the vehicle.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm going to call these actions.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Each of those costs me exactly 1 unit of cost.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Then what's the total cost I have to endure to move from start to goal?

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is a number. Please put a number in here.
