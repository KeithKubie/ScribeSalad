hey good afternoon today we're talking
 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.200
hey good afternoon today we're talking
about hey these work here by the way so

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
about hey these work here by the way so
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.359
about hey these work here by the way so
if you want to cool off I'm not going to

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
if you want to cool off I'm not going to
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.730
if you want to cool off I'm not going to
stand there it's too noisy we're going

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
stand there it's too noisy we're going
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.650
stand there it's too noisy we're going
to talk about unusual infectious agents

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
to talk about unusual infectious agents
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.750
to talk about unusual infectious agents
these don't fit in anywhere but they are

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
these don't fit in anywhere but they are
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.750
these don't fit in anywhere but they are
really interesting and some of them not

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
really interesting and some of them not
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.609
really interesting and some of them not
might not even be viruses one of them

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
might not even be viruses one of them
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679
might not even be viruses one of them
for sure is not a virus as you will see

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
for sure is not a virus as you will see
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.770
for sure is not a virus as you will see
but it's really really interesting and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
but it's really really interesting and
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.340
but it's really really interesting and
the first one the first ones are called

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
the first one the first ones are called
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.020
the first one the first ones are called
viral phages okay and the first viral

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
viral phages okay and the first viral
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.410
viral phages okay and the first viral
phage to be discovered what's called

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
phage to be discovered what's called
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.970
phage to be discovered what's called
Sputnik and this was a viral phage of an

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
Sputnik and this was a viral phage of an
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.600
Sputnik and this was a viral phage of an
of Mimi virus which is another virus so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
of Mimi virus which is another virus so
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.170
of Mimi virus which is another virus so
the name means virus eater phage

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180
the name means virus eater phage
 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.580
the name means virus eater phage
bacteriophage the phage in is Greek to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
bacteriophage the phage in is Greek to
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.439
bacteriophage the phage in is Greek to
eat and so these viral phages as you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
eat and so these viral phages as you
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.119
eat and so these viral phages as you
will see interfere they don't actually

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
will see interfere they don't actually
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.090
will see interfere they don't actually
eat other viruses but they interfere

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
eat other viruses but they interfere
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.800
eat other viruses but they interfere
with their multiplication hence the name

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810
with their multiplication hence the name
 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.719
with their multiplication hence the name
so there is a very large virus that we

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
so there is a very large virus that we
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820
so there is a very large virus that we
talked about in this course called Mimi

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
talked about in this course called Mimi
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.560
talked about in this course called Mimi

Mimi virus infects amoeba and the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
Mimi virus infects amoeba and the
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.700
Mimi virus infects amoeba and the
sputnik viral phage will only replicate

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
sputnik viral phage will only replicate
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.420
sputnik viral phage will only replicate
in amoeba that have been also infected

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
in amoeba that have been also infected
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.390
in amoeba that have been also infected
with the Mimi virus all right they will

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
with the Mimi virus all right they will
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.120
with the Mimi virus all right they will
not replicate on their own you can make

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130
not replicate on their own you can make
 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.550
not replicate on their own you can make
purified preparations of Sputnik if you

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
purified preparations of Sputnik if you
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.069
purified preparations of Sputnik if you
try to infect an amoeba sell it doesn't

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
try to infect an amoeba sell it doesn't
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.240
try to infect an amoeba sell it doesn't
replicate it has to be Co infecting with

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250
replicate it has to be Co infecting with
 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.670
replicate it has to be Co infecting with
the Mimi virus so it needs to replicate

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
the Mimi virus so it needs to replicate
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.139
the Mimi virus so it needs to replicate
the same style and in so doing it

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
the same style and in so doing it
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.420
the same style and in so doing it
reduces the yield of Mimi virus by

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
reduces the yield of Mimi virus by
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.780
reduces the yield of Mimi virus by
seventy percent so that's where the name

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
seventy percent so that's where the name
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.649
seventy percent so that's where the name
viral phage comes from and this is a

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
viral phage comes from and this is a
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.190
viral phage comes from and this is a
picture of what's going on here

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200
 
 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.069
 
now when Mimi viruses infect a me be

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079
now when Mimi viruses infect a me be
 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.089
now when Mimi viruses infect a me be
they replicate in the cytoplasm and they

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099
they replicate in the cytoplasm and they
 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.640
they replicate in the cytoplasm and they
set up these factories so MV f stands

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
set up these factories so MV f stands
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.789
set up these factories so MV f stands
for Mimi viral factory so don't even go

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799
for Mimi viral factory so don't even go
 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.649
for Mimi viral factory so don't even go
near the nucleus they encode everything

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659
near the nucleus they encode everything
 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.360
near the nucleus they encode everything
they need and they set up these big

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
they need and they set up these big
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.369
they need and they set up these big
cytoplasmic factories so this is a a

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379
cytoplasmic factories so this is a a
 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.869
cytoplasmic factories so this is a a

right here this dark staining material

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069
right here this dark staining material
 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.920
right here this dark staining material
and here are some Mimi virions here the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930
and here are some Mimi virions here the
 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.559
and here are some Mimi virions here the
big ones these are mature Mimi very ons

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569
big ones these are mature Mimi very ons
 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.770
big ones these are mature Mimi very ons
very unusual they have this these long

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
very unusual they have this these long
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.990
very unusual they have this these long
projections coming out from the capsid

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000
projections coming out from the capsid
 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.330
projections coming out from the capsid
which you could just see there and this

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340
which you could just see there and this
 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.589
which you could just see there and this
is the factory where they're made and

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599
is the factory where they're made and
 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.390
is the factory where they're made and
you can see within the factory of this

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400
you can see within the factory of this
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.940
you can see within the factory of this
they're smaller particles right there

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
they're smaller particles right there
 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.729
they're smaller particles right there
those are the Sputnik viral phages so

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739
those are the Sputnik viral phages so
 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.899
those are the Sputnik viral phages so
they're actually multiplying right

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909
they're actually multiplying right
 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.509
they're actually multiplying right
within the factory set up by the Mimi

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519
within the factory set up by the Mimi
 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.500
within the factory set up by the Mimi
virus so they need gene products

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510
virus so they need gene products
 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.289
virus so they need gene products
produced by the Mimi virus so they

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299
produced by the Mimi virus so they
 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.300
produced by the Mimi virus so they
replicate right in that factory and they

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310
replicate right in that factory and they
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.740
replicate right in that factory and they
interfere with the multiplication of

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
interfere with the multiplication of
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.599
interfere with the multiplication of
Mimi we don't know how and we don't know

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609
Mimi we don't know how and we don't know
 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.129
Mimi we don't know how and we don't know
what specific gene products are needed

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139
what specific gene products are needed
 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.080
what specific gene products are needed
if here you can see a mimi virus that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
if here you can see a mimi virus that
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.289
if here you can see a mimi virus that
has actually sputnik's within it so for

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299
has actually sputnik's within it so for
 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.349
has actually sputnik's within it so for
some reason these have been encapsulated

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359
some reason these have been encapsulated
 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.240
some reason these have been encapsulated
not every particle of sputnik is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250
not every particle of sputnik is
 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.640
not every particle of sputnik is
encapsulated in a mimi virus so this

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650
encapsulated in a mimi virus so this
 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.390
encapsulated in a mimi virus so this
doesn't appear to be obligatory but the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400
doesn't appear to be obligatory but the
 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.750
doesn't appear to be obligatory but the
replication interferes with the proper

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
replication interferes with the proper
 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.849
replication interferes with the proper
assembly of Mimi virus so here are some

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859
assembly of Mimi virus so here are some
 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.580
assembly of Mimi virus so here are some
examples of Mimi virions that are

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590
examples of Mimi virions that are
 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.939
examples of Mimi virions that are
morphologically aberrant so here for

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949
morphologically aberrant so here for
 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:52.460
morphologically aberrant so here for
example is one the normal Mimi virus

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470
example is one the normal Mimi virus
 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.990
example is one the normal Mimi virus
would have these nice projections here

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000
would have these nice projections here
 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.750
would have these nice projections here
this got layers and layers of what looks

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760
this got layers and layers of what looks
 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.030
this got layers and layers of what looks
like membranes piled up on one side and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040
like membranes piled up on one side and
 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.920
like membranes piled up on one side and
here's see another one like this and

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
here's see another one like this and
 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.089
here's see another one like this and
here's just another so these are effects

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099
here's just another so these are effects
 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.619
here's just another so these are effects
morphological aberrations of Mimi virus

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629
morphological aberrations of Mimi virus
 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.099
morphological aberrations of Mimi virus
caused by a co infection with Sputnik

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109
caused by a co infection with Sputnik
 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.539
caused by a co infection with Sputnik
all right so this was discovered a few

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549
all right so this was discovered a few
 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.960
all right so this was discovered a few
years ago and it might it wasn't clear

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
years ago and it might it wasn't clear
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.149
years ago and it might it wasn't clear
whether it was a general occurrence or

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159
whether it was a general occurrence or
 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.930
whether it was a general occurrence or
curiosity and now not too long ago just

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940
curiosity and now not too long ago just
 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.310
curiosity and now not too long ago just
a month or two ago a new

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320
a month or two ago a new
 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.110
a month or two ago a new
viral phage was discovered it's called

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120
viral phage was discovered it's called
 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.510
viral phage was discovered it's called
maimie virus and ma stands for maverick

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520
maimie virus and ma stands for maverick
 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.210

these are doing is that they may be

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:44.460
these are doing is that they may be
 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.250
these are doing is that they may be
exchanging genes among viruses it may be

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.260
exchanging genes among viruses it may be
 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.650
exchanging genes among viruses it may be
responsible for dean exchange in by

year the algae bloom and then the

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:30.870
year the algae bloom and then the
 

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.140
year the algae bloom and then the
viruses kill the algae and they release

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.150
viruses kill the algae and they release
 

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.210
viruses kill the algae and they release
carbon so they do a carbon cycle and

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:35.220
carbon so they do a carbon cycle and
 

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.490
carbon so they do a carbon cycle and
there are their alternate cycles of

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.100
equation for the oscillation of the of
the algae populations what you see is

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:48.110
the algae populations what you see is
 

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.130
the algae populations what you see is
that the viral phage lets the algae live

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.140
that the viral phage lets the algae live
 

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.590
that the viral phage lets the algae live
longer so they have more extensive

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600
longer so they have more extensive
 

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.750
longer so they have more extensive
blooms and they're less acceptable to

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760
blooms and they're less acceptable to
 

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.590
blooms and they're less acceptable to
killing by the fica da virus so this is

00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600
killing by the fica da virus so this is
 

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.750
killing by the fica da virus so this is
all modeling mathematical modeling but

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760
all modeling mathematical modeling but
 

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.210
all modeling mathematical modeling but
the idea would be that these viral

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:04.220
the idea would be that these viral
 

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.460
the idea would be that these viral
phages could regulate the carbon cycles

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:06.470
phages could regulate the carbon cycles
 

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.440
phages could regulate the carbon cycles
especially in places like Antarctic when

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.450
especially in places like Antarctic when
 

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.420
especially in places like Antarctic when
you don't have Sun all the time and it's

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:10.430
you don't have Sun all the time and it's
 

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.670
you don't have Sun all the time and it's
very difficult to make an algal bloom

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680
very difficult to make an algal bloom
 

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.430
very difficult to make an algal bloom
these viruses may have evolved to help

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440
these viruses may have evolved to help
 

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.980
these viruses may have evolved to help
the algae grow so that's a very

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:17.990
the algae grow so that's a very
 

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.110
the algae grow so that's a very
interesting idea it may be that since we

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120
interesting idea it may be that since we
 

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.940
interesting idea it may be that since we
find these in other aquatic environments

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:21.950
find these in other aquatic environments
 

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.970
find these in other aquatic environments
they're also involved in cycles there as

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:24.980
they're also involved in cycles there as
 

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.770
they're also involved in cycles there as
well because we know that viruses play

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:26.780
well because we know that viruses play
 

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.660
well because we know that viruses play
important roles in many of the cycles

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:28.670
important roles in many of the cycles
 

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.850
important roles in many of the cycles
for example the carbon cycle in the

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:30.860
for example the carbon cycle in the
 

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.370
for example the carbon cycle in the
ocean so these may be modulators of that

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:33.380
ocean so these may be modulators of that
 

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.690
ocean so these may be modulators of that
so they're very interesting so they're

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:34.700
so they're very interesting so they're
 

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.240
so they're very interesting so they're
relatively new and by this time next

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.250
relatively new and by this time next
 

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.040
relatively new and by this time next
year we'll have even more information on

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.050
year we'll have even more information on
 

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.660
year we'll have even more information on
them alright so that's viral phages yes

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:43.670
them alright so that's viral phages yes
 

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:50.680
them alright so that's viral phages yes
ah good question I mean maybe you have

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:50.690
ah good question I mean maybe you have
 

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.660
ah good question I mean maybe you have
virus ages in you maybe we all do why

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:52.670
virus ages in you maybe we all do why
 

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.030
virus ages in you maybe we all do why
not now that we have the sequence we can

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040
not now that we have the sequence we can
 

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.830
not now that we have the sequence we can
look for signatures in all the databases

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:56.840
look for signatures in all the databases
 

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.160
look for signatures in all the databases
but I don't see why there wouldn't be

00:09:59.160 --> 00:09:59.170
but I don't see why there wouldn't be
 

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.690
but I don't see why there wouldn't be
viral phages of other viruses as well

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:01.700
viral phages of other viruses as well
 

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.970
viral phages of other viruses as well
sure me so far they've only been

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:03.980
sure me so far they've only been
 

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.880
sure me so far they've only been
discovered in these big DNA viruses so

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:06.890
discovered in these big DNA viruses so
 

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.740
discovered in these big DNA viruses so
one idea is that maybe those are the

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:08.750
one idea is that maybe those are the
 

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.300
one idea is that maybe those are the
only ones that can sustain them but

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.310
only ones that can sustain them but
 

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.700
only ones that can sustain them but
we'll see yeah they have their own

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:15.710
we'll see yeah they have their own
 

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.810
we'll see yeah they have their own
genome so the viral phage has its own

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:18.820
genome so the viral phage has its own
 

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.870
genome so the viral phage has its own
genome and encode it's about 20 kb in

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880
genome and encode it's about 20 kb in
 

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.450
genome and encode it's about 20 kb in
size and it has if it has some genes

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:25.460
size and it has if it has some genes
 

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.440
size and it has if it has some genes
that have high homology with the virus

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:28.450
that have high homology with the virus
 

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.490
that have high homology with the virus
okay and then a lot of the other genes

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:30.500
okay and then a lot of the other genes
 

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.380
okay and then a lot of the other genes
are unique so it's got its own genome

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:32.390
are unique so it's got its own genome
 

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.600
are unique so it's got its own genome
and it but it just can't replicate

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:34.610
and it but it just can't replicate
 

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.240
and it but it just can't replicate
without Co infecting a cell that also

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:37.250
without Co infecting a cell that also
 

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.900
without Co infecting a cell that also
have the other virus in it so this is

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:40.910
have the other virus in it so this is
 

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.460
have the other virus in it so this is
new this year we didn't have this in

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:42.470
new this year we didn't have this in
 

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.620
new this year we didn't have this in
last year's class so just since one year

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:44.630
last year's class so just since one year
 

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.670
last year's class so just since one year
all this has been learned okay so that's

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:48.680
all this has been learned okay so that's
 

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.820
all this has been learned okay so that's
a viral phage all right the rest of the

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:50.830
a viral phage all right the rest of the
 

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.630
a viral phage all right the rest of the
time we're going to talk about some

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640
time we're going to talk about some
 

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.780
time we're going to talk about some
other very unusual agents and they

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:55.790
other very unusual agents and they
 

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:56.510
other very unusual agents and they
really

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:56.520
really
 

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.610
really
pants start to answer these questions

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620
pants start to answer these questions
 

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.310
pants start to answer these questions
what is the minimum genome size needed

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320
what is the minimum genome size needed
 

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.100
what is the minimum genome size needed
to sustain an infectious agent it's the

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.110
to sustain an infectious agent it's the
 

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.900
to sustain an infectious agent it's the
smallest you know and could an

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:05.910
smallest you know and could an
 

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.600
smallest you know and could an
infectious agent exist without any

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:08.610
infectious agent exist without any
 

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:10.970
infectious agent exist without any
genome so the agents will talk about are

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980
genome so the agents will talk about are
 

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.360

satellites and prions and these don't
 

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.160
satellites and prions and these don't
fit into our taxonomic scheme for

I just checked the sub viral RNA

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240
I just checked the sub viral RNA
 

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.680
I just checked the sub viral RNA

RNA as you see it's a circular RNA that

00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919
RNA as you see it's a circular RNA that
 

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:15.039
RNA as you see it's a circular RNA that
base pairs and folds into a rod so if

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:15.049
base pairs and folds into a rod so if
 

00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:16.949
base pairs and folds into a rod so if
you do natured this it would be a circle

00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959
you do natured this it would be a circle
 

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:19.750
you do natured this it would be a circle
and it's been extensively studied as an

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760
and it's been extensively studied as an
 

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.639
and it's been extensively studied as an
agricultural pathogen it has very

00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:21.649
agricultural pathogen it has very
 

00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:24.670
agricultural pathogen it has very
distinct regions it has left and right

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:24.680
distinct regions it has left and right
 

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.700
distinct regions it has left and right
and I which form a loop it has a region

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:27.710
and I which form a loop it has a region
 

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.800
and I which form a loop it has a region
that's been involved in pathogenesis if

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:29.810
that's been involved in pathogenesis if
 

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.500
that's been involved in pathogenesis if
you mutate this region if you change the

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:32.510
you mutate this region if you change the
 

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.650
you mutate this region if you change the
basis you influence the pathogenicity so

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:35.660
basis you influence the pathogenicity so
 

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.310
basis you influence the pathogenicity so
this viroid when put into potatoes makes

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320
this viroid when put into potatoes makes
 

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.500
this viroid when put into potatoes makes
them unedible basically you can't sell

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:41.510
them unedible basically you can't sell
 

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.850
them unedible basically you can't sell
them so that's what we mean by

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:42.860
them so that's what we mean by
 

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.610
them so that's what we mean by
pathogenesis and then there's a central

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:45.620
pathogenesis and then there's a central
 

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.670
pathogenesis and then there's a central
conserved region as well so how do they

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:48.680
conserved region as well so how do they
 

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.460
conserved region as well so how do they
replicate here's what happens when the

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:51.470
replicate here's what happens when the
 

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.760
replicate here's what happens when the
viroid gets into a cell it is copied by

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:54.770
viroid gets into a cell it is copied by
 

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.670
viroid gets into a cell it is copied by
host RNA polymerase to the same host

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:57.680
host RNA polymerase to the same host
 

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.070
host RNA polymerase to the same host
enzyme that would make messenger RNA

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080
enzyme that would make messenger RNA
 

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.220
enzyme that would make messenger RNA
from our DNA genome so it makes concat

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:03.230
from our DNA genome so it makes concat
 

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.650
from our DNA genome so it makes concat
immers which means it has multiple unit

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:05.660
immers which means it has multiple unit
 

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.050
immers which means it has multiple unit
lengths of the viroid within a longer

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:08.060
lengths of the viroid within a longer
 

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.270
lengths of the viroid within a longer
molecule and those concatenate are then

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.280
molecule and those concatenate are then
 

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.960
molecule and those concatenate are then
cleaved to form unit length viroids in

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:13.970
cleaved to form unit length viroids in
 

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.670
cleaved to form unit length viroids in
some cases by the ribozyme that's

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:15.680
some cases by the ribozyme that's
 

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.550
some cases by the ribozyme that's
actually encoded in the viroid RNA so

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:18.560
actually encoded in the viroid RNA so
 

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.040
actually encoded in the viroid RNA so
again the ribozyme is a sequence it's a

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:21.050
again the ribozyme is a sequence it's a
 

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.840
again the ribozyme is a sequence it's a
structured RNA that has the ability to

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:22.850
structured RNA that has the ability to
 

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:25.780
structured RNA that has the ability to
cleave itself all right so these are

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:25.790
cleave itself all right so these are
 

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.090
cleave itself all right so these are
embedded in many viroids so you can go

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.100
embedded in many viroids so you can go
 

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.970
embedded in many viroids so you can go
from having a concatenate replicated

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:30.980
from having a concatenate replicated

they can code nothing of their own so
 

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:07.340
they can code nothing of their own so
they can't you can't go wrong with a

it's a rather short sequence you can
 

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.870
it's a rather short sequence you can
transport it to almost any RNA and it

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880
transport it to almost any RNA and it
 

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.760
transport it to almost any RNA and it
will cleave itself in a different

then those that don't have it appear to
 

00:19:51.179 --> 00:19:53.510
then those that don't have it appear to
use nuclear enzymes to cleave there can

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520
use nuclear enzymes to cleave there can
 

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.630

how these replicate so I just don't want

00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919
how these replicate so I just don't want
 

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:03.680
how these replicate so I just don't want
you to think that the plus strand is a

you to think that the plus strand is a
 

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:07.909
you to think that the plus strand is a

they can Kadim are then cleaved by a
 

00:21:21.369 --> 00:21:24.449
they can Kadim are then cleaved by a
nuclear ler nuclease most likely so

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:24.459
nuclear ler nuclease most likely so
 

00:21:24.459 --> 00:21:27.209
nuclear ler nuclease most likely so
there's no ribozyme in these particular

00:21:27.209 --> 00:21:27.219
there's no ribozyme in these particular
 

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:30.149
there's no ribozyme in these particular
vo roids there then exported out of the

00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159
vo roids there then exported out of the
 

00:21:30.159 --> 00:21:31.679
vo roids there then exported out of the
nucleus and then it can move to the next

00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:31.689
nucleus and then it can move to the next
 

00:21:31.689 --> 00:21:35.339
nucleus and then it can move to the next
cell the way material moves among plant

00:21:35.339 --> 00:21:35.349

cells all right so the key is

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:37.739
cells all right so the key is
 

00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:40.769

everything's done by the host in this

00:21:40.769 --> 00:21:40.779
everything's done by the host in this
 

00:21:40.779 --> 00:21:43.289
everything's done by the host in this
case copying of the genome and the

00:21:43.289 --> 00:21:43.299
case copying of the genome and the
 

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:45.569
case copying of the genome and the
cleavage and that's how these replicate

00:21:45.569 --> 00:21:45.579
cleavage and that's how these replicate
 

00:21:45.579 --> 00:21:46.859
cleavage and that's how these replicate
and that's it you don't need to make any

00:21:46.859 --> 00:21:46.869
and that's it you don't need to make any
 

00:21:46.869 --> 00:21:48.599
and that's it you don't need to make any
proteins you just take advantage of the

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:48.609
proteins you just take advantage of the
 

00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:51.449
proteins you just take advantage of the
host so you can see that if if this is

00:21:51.449 --> 00:21:51.459
host so you can see that if if this is
 

00:21:51.459 --> 00:21:53.609
host so you can see that if if this is
possible then it evolves and that's what

00:21:53.609 --> 00:21:53.619
possible then it evolves and that's what
 

00:21:53.619 --> 00:21:57.419
possible then it evolves and that's what
happens in the case of ribozyme here's

00:21:57.419 --> 00:21:57.429
happens in the case of ribozyme here's
 

00:21:57.429 --> 00:21:59.939
happens in the case of ribozyme here's
the other family of I roads this is what

00:21:59.939 --> 00:21:59.949
the other family of I roads this is what
 

00:21:59.949 --> 00:22:01.859
the other family of I roads this is what
happens in the case of viroids in the

00:22:01.859 --> 00:22:01.869
happens in the case of viroids in the
 

00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:04.499
happens in the case of viroids in the
other family of vines these are the ones

other family of vines these are the ones
 

00:22:04.509 --> 00:22:06.689
other family of vines these are the ones
that have hammerhead ribozymes that's

00:22:06.689 --> 00:22:06.699
that have hammerhead ribozymes that's
 

00:22:06.699 --> 00:22:08.759
that have hammerhead ribozymes that's
why we're drawing it like this again

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:08.769
why we're drawing it like this again
 

00:22:08.769 --> 00:22:10.619
why we're drawing it like this again
these get into cells they go into the

00:22:10.619 --> 00:22:10.629
these get into cells they go into the
 

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.869
these get into cells they go into the
chloroplast not the nucleus as in the

00:22:12.869 --> 00:22:12.879
chloroplast not the nucleus as in the
 

00:22:12.879 --> 00:22:15.019
chloroplast not the nucleus as in the
other case they go in the chloroplast

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:15.029
other case they go in the chloroplast
 

00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:19.199
other case they go in the chloroplast
they are copied again by the cellular

00:22:19.199 --> 00:22:19.209
they are copied again by the cellular
 

00:22:19.209 --> 00:22:22.499
they are copied again by the cellular
RNA polymerase 2 and in this case the

00:22:22.499 --> 00:22:22.509
RNA polymerase 2 and in this case the
 

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:28.889
RNA polymerase 2 and in this case the
concatenation of the viroid itself and

00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:28.899
concatenation of the viroid itself and
 

00:22:28.899 --> 00:22:31.199
concatenation of the viroid itself and
then these are copied again to form plus

00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:31.209
then these are copied again to form plus
 

00:22:31.209 --> 00:22:33.689
then these are copied again to form plus
strands which then get exported from the

00:22:33.689 --> 00:22:33.699
strands which then get exported from the
 

00:22:33.699 --> 00:22:35.489
strands which then get exported from the
chloroplast and spread from cell to cell

00:22:35.489 --> 00:22:35.499
chloroplast and spread from cell to cell
 

00:22:35.499 --> 00:22:38.009
chloroplast and spread from cell to cell
so you just need to have one viroid get

00:22:38.009 --> 00:22:38.019
so you just need to have one viroid get
 

00:22:38.019 --> 00:22:40.439
so you just need to have one viroid get
into us into a plant and once it's there

00:22:40.439 --> 00:22:40.449
into us into a plant and once it's there
 

00:22:40.449 --> 00:22:42.719
into us into a plant and once it's there
will spread systemically throughout the

00:22:42.719 --> 00:22:42.729
will spread systemically throughout the
 

00:22:42.729 --> 00:22:45.869
will spread systemically throughout the
whole plant from cell to cell alright so

00:22:45.869 --> 00:22:45.879
whole plant from cell to cell alright so
 

00:22:45.879 --> 00:22:47.369
whole plant from cell to cell alright so
this is different because you make

00:22:47.369 --> 00:22:47.379
this is different because you make
 

00:22:47.379 --> 00:22:51.269
this is different because you make
initially unit length genomes and then

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279
initially unit length genomes and then
 

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:53.099
initially unit length genomes and then
you copy them again where is the other

00:22:53.099 --> 00:22:53.109
you copy them again where is the other
 

00:22:53.109 --> 00:22:55.919
you copy them again where is the other
scatta gee you making cat immers copy

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:55.929
scatta gee you making cat immers copy
 

00:22:55.929 --> 00:22:59.489
scatta gee you making cat immers copy
them and then cut them again all done by

00:22:59.489 --> 00:22:59.499
them and then cut them again all done by
 

00:22:59.499 --> 00:23:06.550
them and then cut them again all done by
host RNA polymerase yeah

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:06.560
 
 

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.890
 
not all viroids not all viroids code for

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900
not all viroids not all viroids code for
 

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:16.700
not all viroids not all viroids code for
ribozymes both strands and both strands

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:16.710
ribozymes both strands and both strands
 

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.500
ribozymes both strands and both strands
in this case it's on both strands yeah

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:18.510
in this case it's on both strands yeah
 

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.330
in this case it's on both strands yeah
because that you making Kadim ears and

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340
because that you making Kadim ears and
 

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.470
because that you making Kadim ears and
they get cleaved and then you make

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480
they get cleaved and then you make
 

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.420
they get cleaved and then you make
another concatenated they cleave

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:23.430
another concatenated they cleave
 

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:29.480
another concatenated they cleave
themselves also yeah so this is an

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:29.490
themselves also yeah so this is an
 

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.390
themselves also yeah so this is an
example of peach latent mosaic very and

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400
example of peach latent mosaic very and
 

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.800
example of peach latent mosaic very and
just to show you where the ribosome

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:36.810
just to show you where the ribosome
 

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.380
just to show you where the ribosome
ribozyme sequences are located here's

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:39.390
ribozyme sequences are located here's
 

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.780
ribozyme sequences are located here's
the entire viroid you can see it's

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:41.790
the entire viroid you can see it's
 

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.940
the entire viroid you can see it's
extensively folded here are the cut

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:43.950
extensively folded here are the cut
 

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.600
extensively folded here are the cut
sites here and here for the two

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:47.610
sites here and here for the two
 

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:49.910
sites here and here for the two
different strands so here's the ribozyme

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:49.920
different strands so here's the ribozyme
 

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.190
different strands so here's the ribozyme
for the top strand and here's the

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200
for the top strand and here's the
 

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.410
for the top strand and here's the
ribozyme for the bottom strand so just

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:54.420
ribozyme for the bottom strand so just
 

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:56.660
ribozyme for the bottom strand so just
to show you how these fold and the

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:56.670
to show you how these fold and the
 

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.330
to show you how these fold and the
cutting this folded RNA has catalytic

00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340
cutting this folded RNA has catalytic
 

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.700
cutting this folded RNA has catalytic
activity and it cuts either here or

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:01.710
activity and it cuts either here or
 

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.030
activity and it cuts either here or
right here and that allows the concat

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:05.040
right here and that allows the concat
 

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.150
right here and that allows the concat
immers to become individual genomes so

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:11.160
immers to become individual genomes so
 

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.370
immers to become individual genomes so
where did they come from so they've

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380
where did they come from so they've
 

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.750
where did they come from so they've
probably been around before agriculture

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760
probably been around before agriculture
 

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.340
probably been around before agriculture
in the 20th century we probably

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:19.350
in the 20th century we probably
 

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:23.860
in the 20th century we probably
introduce them into our crops ourselves

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:23.870
introduce them into our crops ourselves
 

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.870
introduce them into our crops ourselves
when we would be breeding modern crops

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880
when we would be breeding modern crops
 

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.300
when we would be breeding modern crops
you start with wild plants and probably

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:29.310
you start with wild plants and probably
 

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.090
you start with wild plants and probably
some of the wild plants had viroids in

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100
some of the wild plants had viroids in
 

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.520
some of the wild plants had viroids in
them and we transferred them to our

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:34.530
them and we transferred them to our
 

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.670
them and we transferred them to our
modern crops we do a lot of monoculture

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:37.680
modern crops we do a lot of monoculture
 

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.840
modern crops we do a lot of monoculture
we used extremely hybridized plants most

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:41.850
we used extremely hybridized plants most
 

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.780
we used extremely hybridized plants most
of the crops of different sorts in the

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:44.790
of the crops of different sorts in the
 

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.700
of the crops of different sorts in the
world all come from the same plants made

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:46.710

by the same companies they're
genetically identical and they have if

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:50.610
genetically identical and they have if
 

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.280

viroid and these these plant lines are
 

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.150
viroid and these these plant lines are
global so viroids are global as well so

00:24:59.150 --> 00:24:59.160
global so viroids are global as well so
 

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.390
global so viroids are global as well so
they're as i said now they're probably

somehow the if the viroid is in part of
a farmers crop and that farmer uses

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:10.650
a farmers crop and that farmer uses
 

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.830
a farmers crop and that farmer uses
mechanical equipment to plow that

mechanical equipment to plow that
 

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.660
mechanical equipment to plow that
mechanical equipment will transfer it to

00:25:17.589 --> 00:25:17.599
 
 

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:20.329
 
how do they cause disease so some

00:25:20.329 --> 00:25:20.339
how do they cause disease so some
 

00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:22.459
how do they cause disease so some
viroids don't they just replicate in the

the plan they can ruin a whole crop
 

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:29.989
the plan they can ruin a whole crop
depending on the the planting question

00:25:29.989 --> 00:25:29.999
depending on the the planting question
 

00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:32.079
depending on the the planting question
but how can they cause disease without

but how can they cause disease without
 

00:25:32.089 --> 00:25:34.909
but how can they cause disease without
encoding any proteins so we think this

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919
encoding any proteins so we think this
 

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:37.430
encoding any proteins so we think this
all has to do with small interfering

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440
all has to do with small interfering
 

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:41.959
all has to do with small interfering
RNAs so we believe that there are small

00:25:41.959 --> 00:25:41.969
RNAs so we believe that there are small
 

00:25:41.969 --> 00:25:45.529
RNAs so we believe that there are small
RNAs derived from each viroid RNA these

00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539
RNAs derived from each viroid RNA these
 

00:25:45.539 --> 00:25:48.199
RNAs derived from each viroid RNA these
are produced by the silencing machinery

00:25:48.199 --> 00:25:48.209
are produced by the silencing machinery
 

00:25:48.209 --> 00:25:50.329
are produced by the silencing machinery
of the host the Argonaut proteins in all

00:25:50.329 --> 00:25:50.339
of the host the Argonaut proteins in all
 

00:25:50.339 --> 00:25:54.979
of the host the Argonaut proteins in all
of those and these RNAs probably silence

00:25:54.979 --> 00:25:54.989
of those and these RNAs probably silence
 

00:25:54.989 --> 00:25:57.560
of those and these RNAs probably silence
host genes and that causes the

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:57.570
host genes and that causes the
 

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.499
host genes and that causes the
pathogenicity in fact symptom

00:26:00.499 --> 00:26:00.509
pathogenicity in fact symptom
 

00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:02.149
pathogenicity in fact symptom
development correlates with the

00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159
development correlates with the
 

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:04.009
development correlates with the
production of these RNAs if you inhibit

00:26:04.009 --> 00:26:04.019
production of these RNAs if you inhibit
 

00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:05.989
production of these RNAs if you inhibit
their production you have less symptoms

00:26:05.989 --> 00:26:05.999
their production you have less symptoms
 

00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:10.249
their production you have less symptoms
and we think that some of these small

00:26:10.249 --> 00:26:10.259
and we think that some of these small
 

00:26:10.259 --> 00:26:12.829
and we think that some of these small
RNAs are actually located in that

00:26:12.829 --> 00:26:12.839
RNAs are actually located in that
 

00:26:12.839 --> 00:26:15.109
RNAs are actually located in that
pathogenicity determining region that I

00:26:15.109 --> 00:26:15.119
pathogenicity determining region that I
 

00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:17.569
pathogenicity determining region that I
showed you on an earlier viroid so as I

00:26:17.569 --> 00:26:17.579
showed you on an earlier viroid so as I
 

00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:19.369

said before if you make it alterations

00:26:19.369 --> 00:26:19.379
said before if you make it alterations
 

00:26:19.379 --> 00:26:22.039
said before if you make it alterations
mutations in that region it affects the

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:22.049
mutations in that region it affects the
 

00:26:22.049 --> 00:26:24.019
mutations in that region it affects the
pathogenicity of the viroid so we think

00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:24.029
pathogenicity of the viroid so we think
 

00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:26.269
pathogenicity of the viroid so we think
this contains the RNA sequences that

00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279
this contains the RNA sequences that
 

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:28.489
this contains the RNA sequences that
will eventually be chopped down to 21

00:26:28.489 --> 00:26:28.499

nucleotide interfering rnas which will
then interfere with the host ok so the

00:26:34.069 --> 00:26:34.079
then interfere with the host ok so the
 

00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:35.619
then interfere with the host ok so the
symptoms are a consequence of

00:26:35.619 --> 00:26:35.629
symptoms are a consequence of
 

00:26:35.629 --> 00:26:38.269
symptoms are a consequence of
interfering but again not all viroids do

00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279

not clear why that would be okay so
 

00:26:44.369 --> 00:26:46.519
not clear why that would be okay so

just need functions provided by the
 

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.360
just need functions provided by the
helper virus because they don't encode

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:26.370
helper virus because they don't encode
 

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.340
helper virus because they don't encode
enough proteins on their own so they're

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:28.350
enough proteins on their own so they're
 

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.780
enough proteins on their own so they're
different from viroids because they do

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:29.790
different from viroids because they do
 

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.300
different from viroids because they do
encode proteins but they're still

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:31.310

replicate the satellites need another

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:38.670

virus most of the ones we know of are

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:42.780
virus most of the ones we know of are
 

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.940
virus most of the ones we know of are
also associated with plant viruses and

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:45.950
also associated with plant viruses and
 

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.740
also associated with plant viruses and
in a plant that's infected with a

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:48.750
in a plant that's infected with a
 

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:52.160
in a plant that's infected with a
satellite plus helper the disease is

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.170
satellite plus helper the disease is
 

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.620
satellite plus helper the disease is
different than if the plant were just

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:54.630
different than if the plant were just
 

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.630
different than if the plant were just
infected with the helper virus by itself

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640
infected with the helper virus by itself
 

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.490
infected with the helper virus by itself
so the helper can replicate on its own

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.500
so the helper can replicate on its own
 

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.590
so the helper can replicate on its own
it doesn't need the satellite that this

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600
it doesn't need the satellite that this
 

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.890
it doesn't need the satellite that this
the disease symptoms are distinct so

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:03.900
the disease symptoms are distinct so
 

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.510
the disease symptoms are distinct so
here are some examples of satellites of

here are some examples of satellites of
 

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.060
here are some examples of satellites of
bacteriophages and animal viruses so an

e.coli bacteria phage called p4 is a
 

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.660
e.coli bacteria phage called p4 is a
satellite it requires p2 as a helper

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:17.670
satellite it requires p2 as a helper
 

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.900
satellite it requires p2 as a helper
that cannot replicate on its own doesn't

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:20.910
that cannot replicate on its own doesn't
 

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.180
that cannot replicate on its own doesn't
have enough proteins so it only will

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:23.190
have enough proteins so it only will
 

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.390
have enough proteins so it only will
replicate an e coli that that are also

add no virus or
herpes viruses as helpers so again they

have enough genes to replicate they need
 

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.960
have enough genes to replicate they need
another helper virus but again they have

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:50.970
another helper virus but again they have
 

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.630
another helper virus but again they have
no homology with adenovirus or helper

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640
no homology with adenovirus or helper
 

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.169
no homology with adenovirus or helper
nor does p for have homology with p2 you

00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179
nor does p for have homology with p2 you
 

00:29:57.179 --> 00:29:59.659
nor does p for have homology with p2 you
could actually think that the viral

00:29:59.659 --> 00:29:59.669
could actually think that the viral
 

00:29:59.669 --> 00:30:02.060
could actually think that the viral
phages we talked about are like

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:02.070
phages we talked about are like
 

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.250
phages we talked about are like
satellites right because they form

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260
satellites right because they form
 

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.730
satellites right because they form
distinct particles they have some genes

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740
distinct particles they have some genes
 

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.710
distinct particles they have some genes
but not enough to replicate they do need

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720
but not enough to replicate they do need
 

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.560
but not enough to replicate they do need
a helper virus the differences that I

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:12.570
a helper virus the differences that I
 

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.060
a helper virus the differences that I
can see is that they're much bigger than

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:14.070
can see is that they're much bigger than
 

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:16.669
can see is that they're much bigger than
the typical satellites which may not

00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679
the typical satellites which may not
 

00:30:16.679 --> 00:30:19.640
the typical satellites which may not
mean anything and they also inhibit the

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:19.650
mean anything and they also inhibit the
 

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.610
mean anything and they also inhibit the
production of the helper now it may be

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620
production of the helper now it may be
 

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.560
production of the helper now it may be
that there are some real satellites out

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:24.570
that there are some real satellites out
 

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:27.649
that there are some real satellites out
there that also inhibit the helper virus

00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659
there that also inhibit the helper virus
 

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:30.110
there that also inhibit the helper virus
I'm not aware of them at the moment but

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120
I'm not aware of them at the moment but
 

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.820
I'm not aware of them at the moment but
maybe viral phages are in fact

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:31.830
maybe viral phages are in fact
 

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.010
maybe viral phages are in fact
satellites that have just evolved to be

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020
satellites that have just evolved to be
 

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:37.490
satellites that have just evolved to be
bigger so we'll see so it could be that

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500
bigger so we'll see so it could be that
 

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.130
bigger so we'll see so it could be that
at some point in the future we'll talk

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140
at some point in the future we'll talk
 

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.740
at some point in the future we'll talk
about satellites and will include the

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:42.750
about satellites and will include the
 

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.880
about satellites and will include the
vaio phages in them okay this is an

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:46.890
vaio phages in them okay this is an
 

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:49.940
vaio phages in them okay this is an
example of a human satellite it's called

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:49.950
example of a human satellite it's called
 

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:54.560
example of a human satellite it's called
hepatitis delta virus now this is a sort

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:54.570
hepatitis delta virus now this is a sort
 

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.350
hepatitis delta virus now this is a sort
of hybrid between a viroid and a

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360
of hybrid between a viroid and a
 

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.600
of hybrid between a viroid and a
satellite as you will see the helper

00:30:59.600 --> 00:30:59.610
satellite as you will see the helper
 

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.789
satellite as you will see the helper
virus for Delta it's a satellite it

00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799
virus for Delta it's a satellite it
 

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:03.970
virus for Delta it's a satellite it
requires a helper is hepatitis B virus

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:03.980
requires a helper is hepatitis B virus
 

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.590
requires a helper is hepatitis B virus
so this has to come in fact the same

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600
so this has to come in fact the same
 

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.020
so this has to come in fact the same
cell as Hep B in order to replicate as

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.030
cell as Hep B in order to replicate as
 

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.870
cell as Hep B in order to replicate as
you will see now though it used to be

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880
you will see now though it used to be
 

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.760
you will see now though it used to be
that when this Delta was first

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:13.770
that when this Delta was first
 

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:15.260
that when this Delta was first
discovered it was thought that it made

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:15.270
discovered it was thought that it made
 

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.720
discovered it was thought that it made
hepatitis caused by hep be more serious

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:17.730
hepatitis caused by hep be more serious
 

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.110
hepatitis caused by hep be more serious
in people that doesn't seem to be the

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120
in people that doesn't seem to be the
 

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.980
in people that doesn't seem to be the
case anymore there have been a lot more

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:23.990
case anymore there have been a lot more
 

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.360
case anymore there have been a lot more
epidemiological studies which the

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:26.370
epidemiological studies which the
 

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.950
epidemiological studies which the
results of which suggests that this is

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960
results of which suggests that this is
 

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.730
results of which suggests that this is
not the case but it's out there and in

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740
not the case but it's out there and in
 

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.220
not the case but it's out there and in
fact there are about 18 million people

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:34.230
fact there are about 18 million people
 

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.770
fact there are about 18 million people
globally who are infected with hepatitis

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:36.780
globally who are infected with hepatitis
 

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.880
globally who are infected with hepatitis
delta virus that's about five percent of

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:40.890
delta virus that's about five percent of
 

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.149
delta virus that's about five percent of
the 350 million carriers of hepatitis b

00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159
the 350 million carriers of hepatitis b
 

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.799
the 350 million carriers of hepatitis b
so a lot of people are infected with Hep

00:31:45.799 --> 00:31:45.809
so a lot of people are infected with Hep
 

00:31:45.809 --> 00:31:48.620
so a lot of people are infected with Hep
B globally and here's the distribution

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:48.630
B globally and here's the distribution
 

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:55.430
B globally and here's the distribution
of HEPA Delta globally for a time it was

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440
of HEPA Delta globally for a time it was
 

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.440
of HEPA Delta globally for a time it was
also

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:56.450
also
 

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.860
also
invading Europe but the numbers in

00:31:59.860 --> 00:31:59.870
invading Europe but the numbers in
 

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.370
invading Europe but the numbers in
Europe now seem to be declining and

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:02.380
Europe now seem to be declining and
 

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.290
Europe now seem to be declining and
prevalences is rising in the

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:05.300
prevalences is rising in the
 

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:08.830
prevalences is rising in the
asia-pacific region so 18 million people

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:08.840
asia-pacific region so 18 million people
 

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.740
asia-pacific region so 18 million people
have this satellite what is it it's a

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:11.750
have this satellite what is it it's a
 

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:19.180
have this satellite what is it it's a
one-point yes yep

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:19.190
 
 

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.450
 
yeah it does but it's not everywhere

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:22.460
yeah it does but it's not everywhere
 

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.060
yeah it does but it's not everywhere
there is happy but it can't be it cannot

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:25.070
there is happy but it can't be it cannot
 

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:31.990
there is happy but it can't be it cannot
be anywhere where there is no happy yes

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000
be anywhere where there is no happy yes
 

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.130
be anywhere where there is no happy yes
absolutely nobody with hdv doesn't have

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:36.140
absolutely nobody with hdv doesn't have
 

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:40.090
absolutely nobody with hdv doesn't have
hep b you have to have hep beta so delta

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.100
hep b you have to have hep beta so delta
 

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.770
hep b you have to have hep beta so delta
carriers are a subset of those who have

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:41.780
carriers are a subset of those who have
 

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.730
carriers are a subset of those who have
hep b and that's 18 million out of the

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:44.740
hep b and that's 18 million out of the
 

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:51.100
hep b and that's 18 million out of the
350 million with hbv all right the

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:51.110
350 million with hbv all right the
 

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.610
350 million with hbv all right the
genome is a 1.7 kb RNA again it's

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:54.620
genome is a 1.7 kb RNA again it's
 

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.550
genome is a 1.7 kb RNA again it's
single-stranded it's circular like the

00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:57.560
single-stranded it's circular like the
 

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.430
single-stranded it's circular like the
viroids and it folds upon itself to make

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440
viroids and it folds upon itself to make
 

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.140
viroids and it folds upon itself to make
a rod-like structure so it's highly base

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.150
a rod-like structure so it's highly base
 

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.410
a rod-like structure so it's highly base
paired it also has a ribozyme like some

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:05.420
paired it also has a ribozyme like some
 

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:10.230
paired it also has a ribozyme like some
of the viroids do it encodes one protein

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240
of the viroids do it encodes one protein
 

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.670
of the viroids do it encodes one protein
which is called the hepatitis delta

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:12.680
which is called the hepatitis delta
 

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.550
which is called the hepatitis delta
antigen and as we'll see this protein

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:15.560
antigen and as we'll see this protein
 

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.590
antigen and as we'll see this protein
encapsulate the genome where it

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600
encapsulate the genome where it
 

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.050
encapsulate the genome where it
participates in the encapsidation forms

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:20.060
participates in the encapsidation forms
 

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:23.170
participates in the encapsidation forms
part of the coat of the virus and when

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:23.180
part of the coat of the virus and when
 

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.820
part of the coat of the virus and when
this virus comes out of a cell that's

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:24.830
this virus comes out of a cell that's
 

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.980
this virus comes out of a cell that's
infected with Hep B so again it has to

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:26.990
infected with Hep B so again it has to
 

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.170
infected with Hep B so again it has to
multiply in a head be infected cell it

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:29.180
multiply in a head be infected cell it
 

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:31.660
multiply in a head be infected cell it
acquires the coat the envelope proteins

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:31.670
acquires the coat the envelope proteins
 

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.650
acquires the coat the envelope proteins
of Hep B so the virus particle is the

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:35.660
of Hep B so the virus particle is the
 

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.830
of Hep B so the virus particle is the
Hep B surface antigens and the delta

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840
Hep B surface antigens and the delta
 

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.900
Hep B surface antigens and the delta
antigen we have a picture of this to

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:40.910
antigen we have a picture of this to
 

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.600
antigen we have a picture of this to
make that clear alright so this is a

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:43.610
make that clear alright so this is a
 

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.700
make that clear alright so this is a
schematic of the genome of Delta again

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:45.710
schematic of the genome of Delta again
 

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:47.710
schematic of the genome of Delta again
it's a circular single-stranded RNA but

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720
it's a circular single-stranded RNA but
 

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.860
it's a circular single-stranded RNA but
it's over seventy percent base paired so

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:50.870
it's over seventy percent base paired so
 

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.530
it's over seventy percent base paired so
it forms a rod-like structure and we

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:53.540
it forms a rod-like structure and we
 

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.260
it forms a rod-like structure and we
have a genome and an anti genome so this

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:56.270
have a genome and an anti genome so this
 

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.600
have a genome and an anti genome so this
is actually a better nomenclature rather

00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:58.610
is actually a better nomenclature rather
 

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.350
is actually a better nomenclature rather
than plus/minus which we use well not we

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:02.360
than plus/minus which we use well not we
 

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.840
than plus/minus which we use well not we
but those people who study viroids call

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:04.850
but those people who study viroids call
 

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.420
but those people who study viroids call
them plus and minus but genome is an

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:07.430
them plus and minus but genome is an
 

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:10.750
them plus and minus but genome is an
anti genome is a bit better although

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760
anti genome is a bit better although
 

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.900
anti genome is a bit better although
this satellite does encode an mrna ones

this is a ribozyme it can cleave itself

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:32.630
this is a ribozyme it can cleave itself
 

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:33.070
this is a ribozyme it can cleave itself
and that

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.080
and that
 

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:35.410
and that
is because this replicates by making cat

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:35.420
is because this replicates by making cat
 

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.870

emerge just like the viroids do and

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:37.880
emerge just like the viroids do and
 

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.440
emerge just like the viroids do and
those are cut by the ribozyme so here's

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:41.450
those are cut by the ribozyme so here's
 

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.480
those are cut by the ribozyme so here's
a schematic of the replication just to

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:43.490
a schematic of the replication just to
 

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:45.190
a schematic of the replication just to

except that a messenger RNA is made so

00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:50.420
except that a messenger RNA is made so
 

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:53.770
except that a messenger RNA is made so
here's your incoming genome it's copied

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:53.780
here's your incoming genome it's copied

here's your incoming genome it's copied
by host polymerase 2 to make a

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:58.300
by host polymerase 2 to make a
 

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.780
by host polymerase 2 to make a
concatenate version here and then a

little bit more these red dots are the

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:04.940
little bit more these red dots are the
 

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.380
little bit more these red dots are the
ribozyme cleavage sites so this cleavage

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:08.390
ribozyme cleavage sites so this cleavage
 

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.380
ribozyme cleavage sites so this cleavage
here for example is giving you a an mRNA

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:11.390
here for example is giving you a an mRNA
 

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:14.680

molecules you eventually get full length

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:18.830
molecules you eventually get full length
 

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.250
molecules you eventually get full length
plus strands out of these and then you

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:21.260
plus strands out of these and then you
 

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:23.080
plus strands out of these and then you
copy those again to make minus strands

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:23.090
copy those again to make minus strands
 

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:25.000
copy those again to make minus strands
so the point here is that an mRNA is

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.010
so the point here is that an mRNA is
 

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.420
so the point here is that an mRNA is
produced and there is also production of

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:28.430
produced and there is also production of
 

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.760
produced and there is also production of
long come cata murs which are resolved

long come cata murs which are resolved
by cleavage self cleavage at these

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:33.310
by cleavage self cleavage at these
 

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.250
by cleavage self cleavage at these
ribozyme positions so that gives you

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:36.260
ribozyme positions so that gives you
 

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.830
ribozyme positions so that gives you
genomes and anti genomes and this mRNA

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:38.840

which encodes for delta antigen so again
 

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.270
which encodes for delta antigen so again
this is done by the host polymerase 2

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280
this is done by the host polymerase 2
 

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.720
this is done by the host polymerase 2
because this is an RNA it has to be

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:46.730
because this is an RNA it has to be
 

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.990
because this is an RNA it has to be
copied by a host by an enzyme there's no

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000
copied by a host by an enzyme there's no
 

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.300

so for a long time it wasn't understood

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:57.980
so for a long time it wasn't understood
 

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.610
so for a long time it wasn't understood
how this genome would be copied because

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:00.620
how this genome would be copied because
 

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.070
how this genome would be copied because

glycoprotein so these Delta particles

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:56.340
glycoprotein so these Delta particles
 

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.860
glycoprotein so these Delta particles
but out of the host cell and they

00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:57.870
but out of the host cell and they
 

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.500
but out of the host cell and they
acquire the envelope of hepatitis B

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:00.510
acquire the envelope of hepatitis B
 

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.330
acquire the envelope of hepatitis B
virus so they have glycoproteins of Hep

00:37:02.330 --> 00:37:02.340
virus so they have glycoproteins of Hep
 

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.110
virus so they have glycoproteins of Hep
B with a delta genome inside so these

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:06.120
B with a delta genome inside so these
 

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.330
B with a delta genome inside so these
can go on and in fact the same cells

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:08.340
can go on and in fact the same cells
 

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.600
can go on and in fact the same cells
that would be infected by hepatitis B

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:11.610
that would be infected by hepatitis B
 

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.970
that would be infected by hepatitis B
virus but if those cells are not

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980
virus but if those cells are not
 

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.160
virus but if those cells are not
infected with heavy the Delta genome

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.170

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:18.230
infected with heavy the Delta genome
will not make particles it will

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240
will not make particles it will
 

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.030
will not make particles it will
replicate in that cell but it can't make

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040
replicate in that cell but it can't make
 

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.590
replicate in that cell but it can't make
new particles so it's completely

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:21.600
new particles so it's completely
 

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.650
new particles so it's completely
dependent on Hep B for this envelope and

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:24.660
dependent on Hep B for this envelope and
 

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:30.860
dependent on Hep B for this envelope and
glycoproteins okay all right so that

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:30.870
glycoproteins okay all right so that
 

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.370

takes care of our unusual agents with
 

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.420
takes care of our unusual agents with
genomes and that brings us to infectious

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:38.430
genomes and that brings us to infectious
 

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.880
genomes and that brings us to infectious
agents that don't have any genomes that

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:40.890
agents that don't have any genomes that
 

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:44.210
agents that don't have any genomes that

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220
encode that consists just of proteins
 

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.260
encode that consists just of proteins
and you may ask why are we talking about

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:48.270
and you may ask why are we talking about
 

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:52.760
and you may ask why are we talking about
this in a virologist and because they

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:52.770
this in a virologist and because they
 

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.990
this in a virologist and because they
don't have a genome so they're not

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000
don't have a genome so they're not
 

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.540
don't have a genome so they're not
viruses they're just pure proteins their

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:56.550
viruses they're just pure proteins their
 

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.990
viruses they're just pure proteins their
infectious proteins and well I think

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000
infectious proteins and well I think
 

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.490
infectious proteins and well I think
they're very interesting because they

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500
they're very interesting because they
 

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.680
they're very interesting because they
have a transmission pattern which is

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:03.690
have a transmission pattern which is
 

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.440
have a transmission pattern which is
very virus-like but maybe more

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:06.450
very virus-like but maybe more
 

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.110
very virus-like but maybe more
importantly when these when the

importantly when these when the
 

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.030
importantly when these when the
existence of these agents was first

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040
existence of these agents was first
 

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.360

right well so we're going to get to that
 

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.560
right well so we're going to get to that
now but it's your protein so you can't

that is pathogenic but that's kind of
 

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.060
that is pathogenic but that's kind of
difficult so that's the problem okay so

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:05.070
difficult so that's the problem okay so
 

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:07.280
difficult so that's the problem okay so

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.080
characterized by amyloidosis and that is
formation of fibrils of amyloid protein

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:36.090
formation of fibrils of amyloid protein
 

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.930
formation of fibrils of amyloid protein
so whenever proteins accumulate in form

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940
so whenever proteins accumulate in form
 

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.990
so whenever proteins accumulate in form
fibrils call it amyloid so this is one

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000
fibrils call it amyloid so this is one
 

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.300
fibrils call it amyloid so this is one
of a number of diseases that do this and

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:44.310
of a number of diseases that do this and
 

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.550
of a number of diseases that do this and
along with the spongiform appearance

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560
along with the spongiform appearance
 

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:52.160
along with the spongiform appearance
it's a characteristic marker so you can

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:52.170
it's a characteristic marker so you can
 

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.500
it's a characteristic marker so you can
detect the disease by injecting organ

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:54.510

you take a sheep with scrapy you can

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680
you take a sheep with scrapy you can
 

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.410
you take a sheep with scrapy you can
make a brain extract inject it into

make a brain extract inject it into
 

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.630
make a brain extract inject it into
another animal and then you eventually

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640
another animal and then you eventually
 

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:09.050
another animal and then you eventually
get symptoms of the disease difficulty

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060
get symptoms of the disease difficulty
 

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.090
get symptoms of the disease difficulty
walking dementia and death but the

incubation period is very long can be
 

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.260
incubation period is very long can be
months to years so if you're studying

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:15.270
months to years so if you're studying
 

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:18.050
months to years so if you're studying
this you have to be very patient and

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060
this you have to be very patient and
 

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:22.160
this you have to be very patient and
when you inject this these extracts into

our protein which is causing this
 

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:04.630
our protein which is causing this
problem and that's why we don't get an

problem and that's why we don't get an
 

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.819
problem and that's why we don't get an
antibody response so this is difficult

00:48:06.819 --> 00:48:06.829
antibody response so this is difficult
 

00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:09.339
antibody response so this is difficult
because it makes it harder to detect it

00:48:09.339 --> 00:48:09.349
because it makes it harder to detect it
 

00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:12.339
because it makes it harder to detect it
you know with most infections we can use

00:48:12.339 --> 00:48:12.349
you know with most infections we can use
 

00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:15.280
you know with most infections we can use
antibodies to detect the infection but

antibodies to detect the infection but
 

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:19.420
antibodies to detect the infection but
you can't do that here so the problem is

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.430
you can't do that here so the problem is
 

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:21.579
you can't do that here so the problem is
that with most human tses you don't know

00:48:21.579 --> 00:48:21.589
that with most human tses you don't know

you have it until you have symptoms the
 

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:25.750
you have it until you have symptoms the
neurological symptoms and that it's too

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760
neurological symptoms and that it's too
 

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.520

late to do anything not that we can do
 

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.020

Griffiths suggested that the agents of
 

00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:11.710
Griffiths suggested that the agents of
tses were in fact protein so he looked

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720
tses were in fact protein so he looked
 

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.470
tses were in fact protein so he looked
at all the data the ionization radiation

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480
at all the data the ionization radiation
 

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:17.380
at all the data the ionization radiation
data the purification all of this and he

00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:17.390
data the purification all of this and he
 

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:20.049
data the purification all of this and he
decided there must not be any nucleic

00:49:20.049 --> 00:49:20.059
decided there must not be any nucleic
 

00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:23.470
decided there must not be any nucleic
acid in these and then prisoner began

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480
acid in these and then prisoner began
 

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:29.680
acid in these and then prisoner began
working on these he eventually purified

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:29.690
working on these he eventually purified
 

00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:33.579
working on these he eventually purified
the protein that would transfer scrapie

00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:33.589
the protein that would transfer scrapie
 

00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:35.770
the protein that would transfer scrapie
from a sheep to another animal so he

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:35.780
from a sheep to another animal so he
 

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.079
from a sheep to another animal so he
started by making brain extracts from

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:38.089
started by making brain extracts from
 

00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:41.260
started by making brain extracts from
scrapie sheep passing them on to other

scrapie sheep passing them on to other
 

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.650
scrapie sheep passing them on to other
animals and then he would purify the

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:43.660
animals and then he would purify the
 

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.270
animals and then he would purify the
proact and ask what part of the extract

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280
proact and ask what part of the extract
 

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.490

because he found that it was just a
 

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.370
because he found that it was just a
single protein so he identified the

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:03.380
single protein so he identified the
 

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.220
single protein so he identified the
protein got some sequence and then he

protein got some sequence and then he
 

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.650
protein got some sequence and then he
could identify the gene its core its

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:08.660
could identify the gene its core its
 

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:12.400
could identify the gene its core its
encoded by the prion p gene so it's a

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:12.410
encoded by the prion p gene so it's a
 

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.829
encoded by the prion p gene so it's a
normal gene in us that encodes this

00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:14.839
normal gene in us that encodes this
 

00:50:14.839 --> 00:50:16.799

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.120
know if you can delete it from people
though I haven't done that but it

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:40.130
though I haven't done that but it
 

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:43.329
though I haven't done that but it
doesn't seem to be essential right so

00:50:43.329 --> 00:50:43.339
doesn't seem to be essential right so
 

00:50:43.339 --> 00:50:46.870
doesn't seem to be essential right so
maybe someday therapy will consist of

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880
maybe someday therapy will consist of
 

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:51.059
maybe someday therapy will consist of
antagonizing the function of the protein

00:50:51.059 --> 00:50:51.069
antagonizing the function of the protein
 

00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:55.289
antagonizing the function of the protein
so our current view is that a prion is a

00:50:55.289 --> 00:50:55.299
so our current view is that a prion is a
 

00:50:55.299 --> 00:50:58.210
so our current view is that a prion is a
conformational I so form of a normal

00:50:58.210 --> 00:50:58.220
conformational I so form of a normal
 

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.400
conformational I so form of a normal
protein so the normal protein we call

00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:00.410
protein so the normal protein we call
 

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:07.240
protein so the normal protein we call
prpc prion protein C means cellular it's

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:07.250
prpc prion protein C means cellular it's
 

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:09.670
prpc prion protein C means cellular it's
normal normally on the outer surface of

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680
normal normally on the outer surface of
 

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.099
normal normally on the outer surface of
neurons this protein is anchored by a

00:51:12.099 --> 00:51:12.109
neurons this protein is anchored by a
 

00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:17.250
neurons this protein is anchored by a
GPI anchor so that some normal function

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:17.260
GPI anchor so that some normal function
 

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.559
GPI anchor so that some normal function
the abnormal version we call an abnormal

00:51:20.559 --> 00:51:20.569
the abnormal version we call an abnormal
 

00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:24.190
the abnormal version we call an abnormal
come from ER if you take that abnormal

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200
come from ER if you take that abnormal
 

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.380
come from ER if you take that abnormal
come from ER and put it into a host it

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:26.390
come from ER and put it into a host it
 

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.819
come from ER and put it into a host it
will cause the normal hosts prion

00:51:30.819 --> 00:51:30.829
will cause the normal hosts prion
 

00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:33.130
will cause the normal hosts prion
protein to be changed into a pathogenic

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:33.140
protein to be changed into a pathogenic
 

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.940
protein to be changed into a pathogenic
version so let's say you have sheep and

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:35.950
version so let's say you have sheep and
 

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:39.339
version so let's say you have sheep and
you purify the prion protein from them

00:51:39.339 --> 00:51:39.349
you purify the prion protein from them
 

00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:41.319
you purify the prion protein from them
that protein is in haven't what we call

00:51:41.319 --> 00:51:41.329
that protein is in haven't what we call
 

00:51:41.329 --> 00:51:43.990
that protein is in haven't what we call
an abnormal confirmar it's its structure

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000
an abnormal confirmar it's its structure
 

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.970
an abnormal confirmar it's its structure
is different i'll show you what we think

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:45.980
is different i'll show you what we think
 

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.829
is different i'll show you what we think
it is in a moment you take that and put

00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839
it is in a moment you take that and put
 

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:50.920
it is in a moment you take that and put
it into a new sheep the abnormal protein

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:50.930
it into a new sheep the abnormal protein
 

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.930
it into a new sheep the abnormal protein
catalyzes the conversion of the sheep's

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:52.940
catalyzes the conversion of the sheep's
 

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.180
catalyzes the conversion of the sheep's
normal protein into an abnormal form

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:55.190
normal protein into an abnormal form
 

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.609
normal protein into an abnormal form
alright so that's what we mean the

00:51:57.609 --> 00:51:57.619
alright so that's what we mean the
 

00:51:57.619 --> 00:51:59.980
alright so that's what we mean the
abnormal conformer causes conversion of

00:51:59.980 --> 00:51:59.990
abnormal conformer causes conversion of
 

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.589
abnormal conformer causes conversion of
normal prpc into the pathogenic form we

00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599
normal prpc into the pathogenic form we
 

00:52:02.599 --> 00:52:05.240
normal prpc into the pathogenic form we
call that PRP SC so

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:05.250
call that PRP SC so
 

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.220
call that PRP SC so
see means scrapie so prion protein

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:07.230
see means scrapie so prion protein
 

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:10.850
see means scrapie so prion protein
cellular is the normal version and PRP

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:10.860
cellular is the normal version and PRP
 

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:13.970
cellular is the normal version and PRP
SC is the pathogenic version if you take

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:13.980
SC is the pathogenic version if you take
 

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.070
SC is the pathogenic version if you take
a normal version if you take PRP c and

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:16.080
a normal version if you take PRP c and
 

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.350
a normal version if you take PRP c and
inject it into someone it doesn't cause

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:18.360
inject it into someone it doesn't cause
 

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.470
inject it into someone it doesn't cause
disease but if you take PRP SC which you

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480
disease but if you take PRP SC which you
 

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.900
disease but if you take PRP SC which you
can only get from infected animals and

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:23.910
can only get from infected animals and
 

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.330
can only get from infected animals and
inject that into another animal you get

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:26.340
inject that into another animal you get
 

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:33.380
inject that into another animal you get
you get a TSE so this PRP SC and an

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:33.390
you get a TSE so this PRP SC and an
 

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:35.690
you get a TSE so this PRP SC and an
animal with disease accumulates mainly

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700
animal with disease accumulates mainly
 

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.280
animal with disease accumulates mainly
in the brain no matter whether you

00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:37.290
in the brain no matter whether you
 

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.110
in the brain no matter whether you
ingest it or injected it gets to the

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:39.120
ingest it or injected it gets to the
 

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:57.210
ingest it or injected it gets to the
brain and accumulates there yes

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:57.220
 
 

00:52:57.220 --> 00:53:00.570
 
you can't imagine that one abnormal can

00:53:00.570 --> 00:53:00.580
you can't imagine that one abnormal can
 

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.000
you can't imagine that one abnormal can
cause the well we have some models

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:03.010
cause the well we have some models
 

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.490
cause the well we have some models
coming up for that at the triumph it

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:05.500
coming up for that at the triumph it
 

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.500
coming up for that at the triumph it
because that's a puzzle but you get a

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:07.510
because that's a puzzle but you get a
 

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:10.160
because that's a puzzle but you get a
lot of accumulation of the PRP SC

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:10.170
lot of accumulation of the PRP SC
 

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:12.210
lot of accumulation of the PRP SC
eventually that's why you have disease

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:12.220
eventually that's why you have disease
 

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:14.460
eventually that's why you have disease
because you have pathological levels so

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:14.470
because you have pathological levels so
 

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.290
because you have pathological levels so
it doesn't disease doesn't result from

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:16.300
it doesn't disease doesn't result from
 

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:18.930
it doesn't disease doesn't result from
just a few aberrant proteins you have a

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:18.940
just a few aberrant proteins you have a
 

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.930
just a few aberrant proteins you have a
lot of them right alright so these

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:21.940
lot of them right alright so these
 

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.540
lot of them right alright so these
aggregates accumulate in the brain they

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:24.550
aggregates accumulate in the brain they
 

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:27.660
aggregates accumulate in the brain they
make they make amyloid which are the

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:27.670
make they make amyloid which are the
 

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:30.030
make they make amyloid which are the
fibrils of protein and that's prion

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040
fibrils of protein and that's prion
 

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.339
fibrils of protein and that's prion
protein you get these spongiform holes

00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:32.349
protein you get these spongiform holes
 

00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:35.880
protein you get these spongiform holes
and this protein this disease version

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:35.890
and this protein this disease version
 

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:38.839
and this protein this disease version
PRP SC is also protease resistant and

00:53:38.839 --> 00:53:38.849
PRP SC is also protease resistant and
 

00:53:38.849 --> 00:53:42.510
PRP SC is also protease resistant and
that was a important finding for

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520
that was a important finding for
 

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.990
that was a important finding for
purifying it as you'll see so this is a

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000
purifying it as you'll see so this is a
 

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.280
purifying it as you'll see so this is a
staining of a section of brain from an

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:50.290
staining of a section of brain from an
 

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:53.880
staining of a section of brain from an
animal with a TSE and the antibody used

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:53.890
animal with a TSE and the antibody used
 

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.800
animal with a TSE and the antibody used
to stain this is an antibody against

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:55.810
to stain this is an antibody against
 

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:59.250
to stain this is an antibody against
prion protein and these are these are

00:53:59.250 --> 00:53:59.260
prion protein and these are these are
 

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:02.220
prion protein and these are these are
amyloid plaques so these contain fibrils

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:02.230
amyloid plaques so these contain fibrils
 

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:04.290
amyloid plaques so these contain fibrils
of prion protein and you can see they're

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:04.300
of prion protein and you can see they're
 

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:06.870
of prion protein and you can see they're
very discrete depositions of these in

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880
very discrete depositions of these in
 

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.520
very discrete depositions of these in
the Blaine brains so that's what we mean

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:08.530
the Blaine brains so that's what we mean
 

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:11.160
the Blaine brains so that's what we mean
by amyloid plaques if you look at higher

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.170
by amyloid plaques if you look at higher
 

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.990
by amyloid plaques if you look at higher
magnifications you can see very the

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000
magnifications you can see very the
 

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.329
magnifications you can see very the
highly fibrillar nature of these plaques

00:54:15.329 --> 00:54:15.339
highly fibrillar nature of these plaques
 

00:54:15.339 --> 00:54:18.980
highly fibrillar nature of these plaques
which is the accumulated prion protein

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:18.990
which is the accumulated prion protein
 

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:22.950
which is the accumulated prion protein
so normally your prion protein that you

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960
so normally your prion protein that you
 

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.240
so normally your prion protein that you
make we all make a PRP c we know the

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:27.250
make we all make a PRP c we know the
 

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.339
make we all make a PRP c we know the
sequence of it it's GPI length and again

00:54:29.339 --> 00:54:29.349
sequence of it it's GPI length and again
 

00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:33.630
sequence of it it's GPI length and again
it's on the outer membrane of neurons if

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:33.640
it's on the outer membrane of neurons if
 

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.730
it's on the outer membrane of neurons if
you treat this with proteinase k which

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:35.740
you treat this with proteinase k which
 

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.190
you treat this with proteinase k which
is a kind of protease will completely

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200
is a kind of protease will completely
 

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.829
is a kind of protease will completely
digest this protein PRP c is completely

00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839
digest this protein PRP c is completely
 

00:54:40.839 --> 00:54:44.880
digest this protein PRP c is completely
sensitive but what prisoner found was if

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:44.890
sensitive but what prisoner found was if
 

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:49.200
sensitive but what prisoner found was if
you take the PRP SC from say sheep who

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:49.210
you take the PRP SC from say sheep who
 

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.420
you take the PRP SC from say sheep who
have scrapie and digest them with

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:51.430
have scrapie and digest them with
 

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:54.180
have scrapie and digest them with
proteinase k all it does is clip off the

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:54.190
proteinase k all it does is clip off the
 

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.920
proteinase k all it does is clip off the
n-terminus the rest of the protein is

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:55.930
n-terminus the rest of the protein is
 

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:57.720

digestion it's the same protein it's
 

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.530
digestion it's the same protein it's
exactly the same sequence yet somehow it

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:04.540
exactly the same sequence yet somehow it
 

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.990
exactly the same sequence yet somehow it
is folded in a way that it's resistant

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000
is folded in a way that it's resistant
 

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.220
is folded in a way that it's resistant
to cleavage with proteinase k

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:10.230
to cleavage with proteinase k
 

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:13.590
to cleavage with proteinase k
okay so we know the structure of PRP c

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:13.600
okay so we know the structure of PRP c
 

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.480
okay so we know the structure of PRP c
and that's shown here this has been

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:15.490
and that's shown here this has been
 

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:18.420
and that's shown here this has been
solved by x-ray crystallography we don't

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:18.430
solved by x-ray crystallography we don't
 

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:19.980
solved by x-ray crystallography we don't
know the structure of the SC

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:19.990
know the structure of the SC
 

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:22.020
know the structure of the SC
confirmation is very difficult protein

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:22.030
confirmation is very difficult protein
 

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.060
confirmation is very difficult protein
to work with but the idea is that

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:24.070
to work with but the idea is that
 

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:28.160
to work with but the idea is that
somehow going from prpc to SC you have a

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:28.170
somehow going from prpc to SC you have a
 

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:30.690
somehow going from prpc to SC you have a
conformational change that makes it

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:30.700
conformational change that makes it
 

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.950
conformational change that makes it
resistant to protease digestion part of

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960
resistant to protease digestion part of
 

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:37.380
resistant to protease digestion part of
the change involves making a lot of beta

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:37.390
the change involves making a lot of beta
 

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:40.500
the change involves making a lot of beta
sheets which is shown by this here the

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:40.510
sheets which is shown by this here the
 

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:42.240
sheets which is shown by this here the
protein has a high content of beta sheet

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:42.250
protein has a high content of beta sheet
 

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:44.160
protein has a high content of beta sheet
and that's probably part of the reason

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:44.170
and that's probably part of the reason
 

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:47.430
and that's probably part of the reason
why it's resistant so this shows that it

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440
why it's resistant so this shows that it
 

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:50.550
why it's resistant so this shows that it
has conformational difference PRP SC is

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:50.560
has conformational difference PRP SC is
 

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:58.290
has conformational difference PRP SC is
very different from prpc yeah we know

00:55:58.290 --> 00:55:58.300
very different from prpc yeah we know
 

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.390
very different from prpc yeah we know
the sequence of s it's the same as C

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400
the sequence of s it's the same as C
 

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.730
the sequence of s it's the same as C
it's exactly the same protein but we

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:02.740
it's exactly the same protein but we
 

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.410
it's exactly the same protein but we
don't know the exact confirmation yeah

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:04.420
don't know the exact confirmation yeah
 

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:05.550
don't know the exact confirmation yeah
so that's what I want you to remember

00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:05.560
so that's what I want you to remember
 

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.640
so that's what I want you to remember
that PRP c and s you have exactly the

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:08.650
that PRP c and s you have exactly the
 

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:11.010
that PRP c and s you have exactly the
same amino acid sequence but one causes

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:11.020
same amino acid sequence but one causes
 

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.320
same amino acid sequence but one causes
disease and the other doesn't so it must

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:13.330
disease and the other doesn't so it must
 

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:15.990
disease and the other doesn't so it must
be that it has to be something inherent

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000
be that it has to be something inherent
 

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.850
be that it has to be something inherent
in this protein and probably this

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:17.860
in this protein and probably this
 

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:21.350
in this protein and probably this
conformational difference is part of it

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:21.360
conformational difference is part of it
 

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.420
conformational difference is part of it
so what causes the disease the key to

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:24.430
so what causes the disease the key to
 

00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:25.980
so what causes the disease the key to
understanding what causes it is going to

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:25.990
understanding what causes it is going to
 

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.080
understanding what causes it is going to
be to understand what catalyzes this

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:28.090
be to understand what catalyzes this
 

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:33.260
be to understand what catalyzes this
transition we just don't know that yet

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:33.270
 
 

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:36.360
 
now in mice you can do very nice

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:36.370
now in mice you can do very nice
 

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:40.020
now in mice you can do very nice
genetics you can knock out the gene

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:40.030
genetics you can knock out the gene
 

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:43.350
genetics you can knock out the gene
encoding the prion protein you can knock

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:43.360
encoding the prion protein you can knock
 

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.260
encoding the prion protein you can knock
out the gene encoding PR NP the normal

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:46.270
out the gene encoding PR NP the normal
 

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.810
out the gene encoding PR NP the normal
cellular homolog these mice are fine as

00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:48.820
cellular homolog these mice are fine as
 

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.720
cellular homolog these mice are fine as
I said and if you infect them with

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:51.730
I said and if you infect them with
 

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:55.260
I said and if you infect them with
crayons they are totally resistant to

00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:55.270
crayons they are totally resistant to
 

00:56:55.270 --> 00:57:01.340
crayons they are totally resistant to
infection they never develop tses so

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:01.350
infection they never develop tses so
 

00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:03.960
infection they never develop tses so
that shows you that you need your own

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:03.970
that shows you that you need your own
 

00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:06.630
that shows you that you need your own
copy of the prion gene in order to

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640
copy of the prion gene in order to
 

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.510
copy of the prion gene in order to
develop the TSE and that's partly where

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520
develop the TSE and that's partly where
 

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.830
develop the TSE and that's partly where
this idea that the pathogenic protein is

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:12.840
this idea that the pathogenic protein is
 

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.330
this idea that the pathogenic protein is
inducing your normal protein to change

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:15.340
inducing your normal protein to change
 

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.970
inducing your normal protein to change
into an aberrant form came from because

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:17.980
into an aberrant form came from because
 

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:20.970
into an aberrant form came from because
you need your prion gene in order to

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:20.980
you need your prion gene in order to
 

00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.780
you need your prion gene in order to
develop the disease

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:23.790
 
 

00:57:23.790 --> 00:57:28.610
 
so sheep spontaneously seemed to

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:28.620
so sheep spontaneously seemed to
 

00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:33.810
so sheep spontaneously seemed to
generate come down with scrapy and there

00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:33.820
generate come down with scrapy and there
 

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.620
generate come down with scrapy and there
they may it may arise as a genetic

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:37.630
they may it may arise as a genetic
 

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:39.210
they may it may arise as a genetic
mutation in them so there may be

00:57:39.210 --> 00:57:39.220
mutation in them so there may be
 

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.400
mutation in them so there may be
spontaneous single amino acid changes in

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:41.410
spontaneous single amino acid changes in
 

00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:43.290
spontaneous single amino acid changes in
the prion protein which make it miss

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:43.300
the prion protein which make it miss
 

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.470
the prion protein which make it miss
fold and become pathogenic so those are

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480
fold and become pathogenic so those are
 

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.690
fold and become pathogenic so those are
rare mutations or you can acquire these

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:48.700
rare mutations or you can acquire these
 

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:51.510
rare mutations or you can acquire these
tses by infection so she can get it from

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520
tses by infection so she can get it from
 

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.580
tses by infection so she can get it from
each other so that's what those are two

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:53.590
each other so that's what those are two
 

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:56.280
each other so that's what those are two
ways that these appear by infection or

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:56.290
ways that these appear by infection or
 

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:58.710
ways that these appear by infection or
by a rare mutation that causes the

00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720
by a rare mutation that causes the
 

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.760
by a rare mutation that causes the
protein to miss fold so the ideal proof

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:02.770
protein to miss fold so the ideal proof
 

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.440
protein to miss fold so the ideal proof
of the pre and hypothesis would be to

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:04.450
of the pre and hypothesis would be to
 

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:08.820
of the pre and hypothesis would be to
make conformational e altered PRP SC and

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:08.830
make conformational e altered PRP SC and
 

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.490
make conformational e altered PRP SC and
vitro and then in fact an animal and

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:11.500
vitro and then in fact an animal and
 

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.440
vitro and then in fact an animal and
people are working on that it's not

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:13.450
people are working on that it's not
 

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:16.890
people are working on that it's not
quite possible yet to do that but at

00:58:16.890 --> 00:58:16.900
quite possible yet to do that but at
 

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.840
quite possible yet to do that but at
some point it will be done but there's a

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:18.850
some point it will be done but there's a
 

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:20.790
some point it will be done but there's a
lot of very strong evidence for this

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:20.800
lot of very strong evidence for this
 

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.880
lot of very strong evidence for this
entire hypothesis so how does a normal

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:23.890
entire hypothesis so how does a normal
 

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.440
entire hypothesis so how does a normal
protein make an abnormal version of a

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:28.450
protein make an abnormal version of a
 

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:30.480
protein make an abnormal version of a
protein in you I'm sorry how does the

00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:30.490
protein in you I'm sorry how does the
 

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:32.580
protein in you I'm sorry how does the
scrapie protein the abnormal protein

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:32.590
scrapie protein the abnormal protein
 

00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:35.040
scrapie protein the abnormal protein
cause conformational change in your

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:35.050
cause conformational change in your
 

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:36.930
cause conformational change in your
normal protein so there there are many

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:36.940
normal protein so there there are many
 

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.870
normal protein so there there are many
hypotheses these are just two here's one

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880
hypotheses these are just two here's one
 

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:44.540
hypotheses these are just two here's one
on top where here's our normal PRP c and

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:44.550
on top where here's our normal PRP c and
 

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:48.780
on top where here's our normal PRP c and
this prpc theoretically can change into

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:48.790
this prpc theoretically can change into
 

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:52.290
this prpc theoretically can change into
the pathogenic confirmation here you see

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:52.300
the pathogenic confirmation here you see
 

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:54.870
the pathogenic confirmation here you see
that in this model it's not happening

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880
that in this model it's not happening
 

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.090
that in this model it's not happening
there's no alteration between the two

00:58:57.090 --> 00:58:57.100
there's no alteration between the two
 

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.800
there's no alteration between the two
states so in you you just have the

00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:58.810
states so in you you just have the
 

00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:02.030
states so in you you just have the
cellular confirmation but if you

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.040
cellular confirmation but if you
 

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.280
cellular confirmation but if you
encounter some abnormal protein if you

00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:05.290
encounter some abnormal protein if you
 

00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:08.040
encounter some abnormal protein if you
eat infected meat for example then that

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:08.050
eat infected meat for example then that
 

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:10.050
eat infected meat for example then that
abnormal protein can catalyze the

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:10.060
abnormal protein can catalyze the
 

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.870
abnormal protein can catalyze the
confirmation of your normal protein to

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880
confirmation of your normal protein to
 

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.330
confirmation of your normal protein to
make abnormal ones and then those can go

00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:15.340
make abnormal ones and then those can go
 

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:18.660
make abnormal ones and then those can go
on and catalyze the conversion of even

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:18.670
on and catalyze the conversion of even
 

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:21.360
on and catalyze the conversion of even
more so then you can see that this cycle

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:21.370
more so then you can see that this cycle
 

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:23.400
more so then you can see that this cycle
would amplify itself and eventually your

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:23.410
would amplify itself and eventually your
 

00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:25.020
would amplify itself and eventually your
normal protein lots of your normal

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:25.030
normal protein lots of your normal
 

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:28.200
normal protein lots of your normal
protein would be converted that's the

00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:28.210
protein would be converted that's the
 

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:30.000
protein would be converted that's the
refolding model so the idea is that the

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:30.010
refolding model so the idea is that the
 

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:32.040
refolding model so the idea is that the
scrapie version of your protein causes

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:32.050
scrapie version of your protein causes
 

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:34.930
scrapie version of your protein causes
the normal cellular version to refold

00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:34.940
the normal cellular version to refold
 

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.720
the normal cellular version to refold
the seating model there is a there is

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:37.730
the seating model there is a there is
 

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:39.790
the seating model there is a there is
some equilibrium between the normal and

00:59:39.790 --> 00:59:39.800
some equilibrium between the normal and
 

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.760
some equilibrium between the normal and
the pathogenic forms of the protein so

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:42.770
the pathogenic forms of the protein so
 

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:45.819
the pathogenic forms of the protein so
if you have some abnormal protein

00:59:45.819 --> 00:59:45.829
if you have some abnormal protein
 

00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:47.740
if you have some abnormal protein
forming it would very very slowly

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:47.750
forming it would very very slowly
 

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.559
forming it would very very slowly
convert to multimeric forms and then as

00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:50.569
convert to multimeric forms and then as
 

00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:52.180
convert to multimeric forms and then as
you add more abnormal protein these

00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:52.190
you add more abnormal protein these
 

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:54.220
you add more abnormal protein these
would eventually form the amyloid fibers

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:54.230
would eventually form the amyloid fibers
 

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.440
would eventually form the amyloid fibers
leading two plaques so this says that

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:56.450
leading two plaques so this says that
 

00:59:56.450 --> 01:00:00.630
leading two plaques so this says that
there is extremely slow conversion and

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640
there is extremely slow conversion and
 

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:04.150
there is extremely slow conversion and
in some of us that leads to disease it's

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160
in some of us that leads to disease it's
 

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.990
in some of us that leads to disease it's
very rare and that occurs by this miss

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000
very rare and that occurs by this miss
 

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:18.730
very rare and that occurs by this miss

sure there's nothing brain specific

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:30.290
sure there's nothing brain specific
 

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:34.990

about the mechanism now okay there is a

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000
about the mechanism now okay there is a
 

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.200
about the mechanism now okay there is a
very nice story about human TSE which is

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:38.210
very nice story about human TSE which is
 

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:40.210

studied this disease and he found that

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:54.890
studied this disease and he found that
 

01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:58.390
studied this disease and he found that
it largely attacks met at women and

01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400
it largely attacks met at women and
 

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.490
it largely attacks met at women and
children and that's because when people

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:00.500
children and that's because when people
 

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.740
children and that's because when people
die and the four people they're the ones

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:02.750
die and the four people they're the ones
 

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.569
die and the four people they're the ones
who eat the brain of the deceased person

01:01:04.569 --> 01:01:04.579
who eat the brain of the deceased person
 

01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:06.609
who eat the brain of the deceased person
the men don't get to eat the brain just

01:01:06.609 --> 01:01:06.619
the men don't get to eat the brain just
 

01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:08.920
the men don't get to eat the brain just
the women and kids and they develop crew

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:08.930
the women and kids and they develop crew
 

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:11.079
the women and kids and they develop crew
so he studied this and he said you're

01:01:11.079 --> 01:01:11.089
so he studied this and he said you're
 

01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:12.819
so he studied this and he said you're
having kuru because of this so you have

01:01:12.819 --> 01:01:12.829
having kuru because of this so you have
 

01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:15.250
having kuru because of this so you have
to stop the cannibalism and they did and

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:15.260
to stop the cannibalism and they did and
 

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:18.460
to stop the cannibalism and they did and
the disease is now gone so this was the

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:18.470
the disease is now gone so this was the
 

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:22.930
the disease is now gone so this was the
first human tsc known and it came about

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:22.940
first human tsc known and it came about
 

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.670

it was perpetuated in this people
 

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.670
it was perpetuated in this people
because of cannibalism how it was

someone had a sporadic version of the
disease where they just converted to the

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:34.250
disease where they just converted to the
 

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:37.000
disease where they just converted to the
pathogenic form by maybe a mutation or

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:37.010
pathogenic form by maybe a mutation or
 

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:38.770

some other environmental insult and

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:38.780
some other environmental insult and
 

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.900
some other environmental insult and
someone ate that person's brain when

someone ate that person's brain when
 

01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:42.579
someone ate that person's brain when
they died and that started the epidemic

01:01:42.579 --> 01:01:42.589
they died and that started the epidemic
 

01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:45.130
they died and that started the epidemic

so human tses there can be infectious or

01:01:48.849 --> 01:01:48.859
so human tses there can be infectious or
 

01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:51.130
so human tses there can be infectious or
transmissible like kuru you can have

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:51.140
transmissible like kuru you can have
 

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.630
transmissible like kuru you can have
spread of these diseases by

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640
spread of these diseases by
 

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.509
spread of these diseases by
transplantation of infected corneas by

transplantation of infected corneas by
 

01:01:55.519 --> 01:01:56.890
transplantation of infected corneas by
giving people hormones that are

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:56.900
giving people hormones that are
 

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:59.589
giving people hormones that are
contaminated by transfusions this has

01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599
contaminated by transfusions this has
 

01:01:59.599 --> 01:02:02.019

course vse you get by feeding ground up

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:07.430
course vse you get by feeding ground up
 

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:10.210
course vse you get by feeding ground up
infected animals to cattle and that

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:10.220
infected animals to cattle and that
 

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.789
infected animals to cattle and that
ended up causing a variant type of

01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799
ended up causing a variant type of
 

01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:15.160
ended up causing a variant type of
disease in humans called variant CJD

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.170
disease in humans called variant CJD
 

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:21.190
disease in humans called variant CJD
which is you get by eating BSE beef so

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200
which is you get by eating BSE beef so
 

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.799
which is you get by eating BSE beef so
basically forced cannibalism spreads BSE

01:02:23.799 --> 01:02:23.809
basically forced cannibalism spreads BSE
 

01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:27.720
basically forced cannibalism spreads BSE
if we had an epidemic of BSC in the UK

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:27.730
if we had an epidemic of BSC in the UK
 

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:30.640
if we had an epidemic of BSC in the UK
there's a form of cattle cannibalism and

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:30.650
there's a form of cattle cannibalism and
 

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:33.700
there's a form of cattle cannibalism and
this is because we we fed the cows

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:33.710
this is because we we fed the cows
 

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:36.690
this is because we we fed the cows
chopped up other animals so they got

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:36.700
chopped up other animals so they got
 

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.210
chopped up other animals so they got
homogenized high-protein diet the cows

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:40.220
homogenized high-protein diet the cows
 

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:42.190
homogenized high-protein diet the cows
normally don't eat meat right there out

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:42.200
normally don't eat meat right there out
 

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.220
normally don't eat meat right there out
there eating grass but farmers want them

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:45.230
there eating grass but farmers want them
 

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:46.599
there eating grass but farmers want them
to grow quicker so they give them

01:02:46.599 --> 01:02:46.609
to grow quicker so they give them
 

01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:48.880
to grow quicker so they give them
protein and in the UK they were giving

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:48.890
protein and in the UK they were giving
 

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.650
protein and in the UK they were giving
them ground-up carcasses of other

01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:50.660
them ground-up carcasses of other
 

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.410
them ground-up carcasses of other
animals and some of those animals had

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:53.420
animals and some of those animals had
 

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.999
animals and some of those animals had
died of scrapie without anyone knowing

01:02:54.999 --> 01:02:55.009
died of scrapie without anyone knowing
 

01:02:55.009 --> 01:02:57.670
died of scrapie without anyone knowing
it so the cows got a form of a TSE

01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680
it so the cows got a form of a TSE
 

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.970
it so the cows got a form of a TSE
called BSE or malc out mad cow disease a

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:00.980
called BSE or malc out mad cow disease a
 

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.309
called BSE or malc out mad cow disease a
lot of similar symptoms dementia ataxia

01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:03.319
lot of similar symptoms dementia ataxia
 

01:03:03.319 --> 01:03:06.220
lot of similar symptoms dementia ataxia
spongiform encephalopathy so this was

01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:06.230
spongiform encephalopathy so this was
 

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:07.809
spongiform encephalopathy so this was
recognized in the UK they stopped

01:03:07.809 --> 01:03:07.819
recognized in the UK they stopped
 

01:03:07.819 --> 01:03:10.359
recognized in the UK they stopped
feeding this rendered stuff to the cows

01:03:10.359 --> 01:03:10.369
feeding this rendered stuff to the cows
 

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:13.359
feeding this rendered stuff to the cows
and they stopped getting BSE but a lot

01:03:13.359 --> 01:03:13.369
and they stopped getting BSE but a lot
 

01:03:13.369 --> 01:03:16.900
and they stopped getting BSE but a lot
of people ate BSE contaminated beef and

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:16.910
of people ate BSE contaminated beef and
 

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:20.920
of people ate BSE contaminated beef and
they in turn got a variant TSE called

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:20.930
they in turn got a variant TSE called
 

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:24.880
they in turn got a variant TSE called
variant CJD so this is a map of the

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:24.890
variant CJD so this is a map of the
 

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:30.579
variant CJD so this is a map of the
epidemic in the UK the onset of bovine

01:03:30.579 --> 01:03:30.589
epidemic in the UK the onset of bovine
 

01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:33.490

mad cow disease BSC in about nineteen

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:33.500
mad cow disease BSC in about nineteen
 

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.579
mad cow disease BSC in about nineteen
eighty-seven you can see this is when

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:35.589
eighty-seven you can see this is when
 

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:38.829
eighty-seven you can see this is when
the first cases were discovered and then

01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839
the first cases were discovered and then
 

01:03:38.839 --> 01:03:40.960
the first cases were discovered and then
they banned the use of this ground up

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:40.970
they banned the use of this ground up
 

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:42.819
they banned the use of this ground up
feed and cows but it was too late

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:42.829
feed and cows but it was too late
 

01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:45.249
feed and cows but it was too late
there's a very long incubation period so

01:03:45.249 --> 01:03:45.259
there's a very long incubation period so
 

01:03:45.259 --> 01:03:46.749
there's a very long incubation period so
you can see the disease peaked a number

01:03:46.749 --> 01:03:46.759
you can see the disease peaked a number
 

01:03:46.759 --> 01:03:49.410
you can see the disease peaked a number
of years later and then eventually it

01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:49.420
of years later and then eventually it
 

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:52.749
of years later and then eventually it
went away but then you had an overlap of

01:03:52.749 --> 01:03:52.759
went away but then you had an overlap of
 

01:03:52.759 --> 01:03:54.370
went away but then you had an overlap of
an epidemic in people these are very

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:54.380
an epidemic in people these are very
 

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:56.950
an epidemic in people these are very
people with variant CJD they acquire

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960
people with variant CJD they acquire
 

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.579
people with variant CJD they acquire
UTSC by eating

01:03:58.579 --> 01:03:58.589
UTSC by eating
 

01:03:58.589 --> 01:04:01.160
UTSC by eating
emanated beef and this seems to be over

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:01.170
emanated beef and this seems to be over
 

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:06.289
emanated beef and this seems to be over
now there are no more cases in the UK so

01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299
now there are no more cases in the UK so
 

01:04:06.299 --> 01:04:15.170
now there are no more cases in the UK so
it's a form of cannibalism really yes

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180
 
 

01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.200
 
well this is related to how the meat is

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:19.210
well this is related to how the meat is
 

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:21.630
well this is related to how the meat is
the meal is prepared for the cows so

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640
the meal is prepared for the cows so
 

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.890
the meal is prepared for the cows so
they used to this they used to like

01:04:25.890 --> 01:04:25.900
they used to this they used to like
 

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.080
they used to this they used to like
recover the spinal cord by blowing it

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:28.090
recover the spinal cord by blowing it
 

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:30.090
recover the spinal cord by blowing it
out with high-pressure air or water and

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:30.100
out with high-pressure air or water and
 

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.310
out with high-pressure air or water and
they said you can't do that anymore

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:32.320
they said you can't do that anymore
 

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.920
they said you can't do that anymore
because that just contaminates it with

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:34.930
because that just contaminates it with
 

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:37.470
because that just contaminates it with
pre ons so they banned that kind of

01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:37.480
pre ons so they banned that kind of
 

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.140
pre ons so they banned that kind of
process to limit it and they also

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:42.150
 
 

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:45.540
 
instituted some processing measures that

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:45.550
instituted some processing measures that
 

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:49.230
instituted some processing measures that
would inactivate the pre ons so this is

01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240
would inactivate the pre ons so this is
 

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.260
would inactivate the pre ons so this is
over but whenever there's a BSE positive

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:52.270
over but whenever there's a BSE positive
 

01:04:52.270 --> 01:04:54.270

there's a kind of TSE that's infectious

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:25.270
there's a kind of TSE that's infectious
 

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.609
there's a kind of TSE that's infectious
we've been talking a lot about there's

01:05:26.609 --> 01:05:26.619
we've been talking a lot about there's
 

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:29.790
we've been talking a lot about there's
also sporadic and this is around a

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:29.800
also sporadic and this is around a
 

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.950
also sporadic and this is around a

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.780
70 years of age sixty-five percent of
all the TSE s is this sporadic form and

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:36.790
all the TSE s is this sporadic form and
 

01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:38.490
all the TSE s is this sporadic form and
here it appears without any warning it

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:38.500
here it appears without any warning it
 

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.720
here it appears without any warning it
doesn't seem to be any relation to

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:39.730
doesn't seem to be any relation to
 

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.540
doesn't seem to be any relation to
eating any infected meat you have normal

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:42.550
eating any infected meat you have normal
 

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:46.200
eating any infected meat you have normal
genes your PRP genes are normal and you

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:46.210
genes your PRP genes are normal and you
 

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:49.200
genes your PRP genes are normal and you
can transmit it to others so if you give

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:49.210
can transmit it to others so if you give
 

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:51.780
can transmit it to others so if you give
a transfusion or something or you give

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:51.790
a transfusion or something or you give
 

01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.160
a transfusion or something or you give
blood or some other product that's not

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:53.170
blood or some other product that's not
 

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:54.600
blood or some other product that's not
checked properly you can and you can

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:54.610
checked properly you can and you can
 

01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:56.130
checked properly you can and you can
transfer the infection because now you

01:05:56.130 --> 01:05:56.140
transfer the infection because now you
 

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:59.340
transfer the infection because now you
have pathogenic protein in you and as I

01:05:59.340 --> 01:05:59.350
have pathogenic protein in you and as I
 

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.870
have pathogenic protein in you and as I
said that's probably how kuru was

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880
said that's probably how kuru was
 

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.970
said that's probably how kuru was
established in New Guinea person got

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:02.980
established in New Guinea person got
 

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:06.480
established in New Guinea person got
sporadic CJ and then they ate the brain

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:06.490
sporadic CJ and then they ate the brain
 

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:10.109
sporadic CJ and then they ate the brain
and that established the infection so

01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119
and that established the infection so
 

01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:11.940
and that established the infection so
that's sporadic there's also familial

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:11.950
that's sporadic there's also familial
 

01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.880
that's sporadic there's also familial
which is a genetic disease you have a

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:14.890
which is a genetic disease you have a
 

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:17.010
which is a genetic disease you have a
mutation in your gene that predisposes

01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:17.020
mutation in your gene that predisposes
 

01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:20.220
mutation in your gene that predisposes
the protein to miss folding and you

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:20.230
the protein to miss folding and you
 

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.450
the protein to miss folding and you
develop the disease but if you donate

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460
develop the disease but if you donate
 

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.580
develop the disease but if you donate
organs or corneas or blood products and

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:26.590
organs or corneas or blood products and
 

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:28.740
organs or corneas or blood products and
you don't know you have this then you

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:28.750
you don't know you have this then you
 

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.990
you don't know you have this then you
can infect others and that's how some of

01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:31.000
can infect others and that's how some of
 

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.060
can infect others and that's how some of
the transmissions have occurred via

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.070
the transmissions have occurred via
 

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:35.099
the transmissions have occurred via
these kinds of products from people with

01:06:35.099 --> 01:06:35.109
these kinds of products from people with
 

01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:37.800
these kinds of products from people with
a familiar form of a disease so we have

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:37.810
a familiar form of a disease so we have
 

01:06:37.810 --> 01:06:39.500
a familiar form of a disease so we have
three kinds we have an infectious a

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:39.510
three kinds we have an infectious a
 

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:42.720
three kinds we have an infectious a
familial and sporadic so the familial is

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:42.730
familial and sporadic so the familial is
 

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:44.520
familial and sporadic so the familial is
genetic the sporadic just occurs and we

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:44.530
genetic the sporadic just occurs and we
 

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:46.500
genetic the sporadic just occurs and we
don't understand the conditions that

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:46.510
don't understand the conditions that
 

01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:51.599
don't understand the conditions that
cause transfer the transmission we don't

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:51.609
cause transfer the transmission we don't
 

01:06:51.609 --> 01:06:53.490
cause transfer the transmission we don't
understand the conditions that cause the

01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:53.500
understand the conditions that cause the
 

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.040
understand the conditions that cause the
conversion of a normal protein to the

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:56.050
conversion of a normal protein to the
 

01:06:56.050 --> 01:07:00.210
conversion of a normal protein to the
pathogenic one in these cases so what's

01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:00.220
pathogenic one in these cases so what's
 

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.710
pathogenic one in these cases so what's
happening here is we have a normal

01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720
happening here is we have a normal
 

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.150
happening here is we have a normal
cellular protein if you eat infected

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160
cellular protein if you eat infected
 

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.609
cellular protein if you eat infected
meat you get some pathogenic protein

01:07:08.609 --> 01:07:08.619
meat you get some pathogenic protein
 

01:07:08.619 --> 01:07:10.770
meat you get some pathogenic protein
that converts your normal protein into

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:10.780
that converts your normal protein into
 

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.320
that converts your normal protein into
the infectious pathogenic form you may

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:13.330
the infectious pathogenic form you may
 

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:15.300
the infectious pathogenic form you may
have a familial mutation that

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:15.310
have a familial mutation that
 

01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:18.330
have a familial mutation that
predisposes you to miss folding or you

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:18.340
predisposes you to miss folding or you
 

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.220
predisposes you to miss folding or you
may have some spontaneous miss folding

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:20.230
may have some spontaneous miss folding
 

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:21.990
may have some spontaneous miss folding
that occurs this is the sporadic form so

01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000
that occurs this is the sporadic form so
 

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.960
that occurs this is the sporadic form so
three different ways that this

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:24.970
three different ways that this
 

01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:28.710
three different ways that this
altered protein can arise there is a

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720
altered protein can arise there is a
 

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:39.370
altered protein can arise there is a
speed yes

01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:39.380
 
 

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.140
 
so in the sporadic form there's no

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:42.150
so in the sporadic form there's no
 

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:45.039
so in the sporadic form there's no
mutation it's a normal protein and

01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:45.049
mutation it's a normal protein and
 

01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:48.259
mutation it's a normal protein and
somehow it just spur it just begins to

01:07:48.259 --> 01:07:48.269
somehow it just spur it just begins to
 

01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:51.529
somehow it just spur it just begins to
miss fold and that causes the disease

01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539
miss fold and that causes the disease
 

01:07:51.539 --> 01:07:53.479
miss fold and that causes the disease
and then you can transmit it because a

01:07:53.479 --> 01:07:53.489
and then you can transmit it because a
 

01:07:53.489 --> 01:07:55.700
and then you can transmit it because a
Miss folded protein no matter how it's

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:55.710
Miss folded protein no matter how it's
 

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:58.579
Miss folded protein no matter how it's
made is it potentially infectious okay

01:07:58.579 --> 01:07:58.589
made is it potentially infectious okay
 

01:07:58.589 --> 01:08:01.219
made is it potentially infectious okay
the only ones with a change in the

01:08:01.219 --> 01:08:01.229
the only ones with a change in the
 

01:08:01.229 --> 01:08:03.109
the only ones with a change in the
protein are the familial forms which

01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119
protein are the familial forms which
 

01:08:03.119 --> 01:08:05.979
protein are the familial forms which
have a change that predisposes it to

01:08:05.979 --> 01:08:05.989
have a change that predisposes it to
 

01:08:05.989 --> 01:08:09.499
have a change that predisposes it to
miss folding without any infection or

01:08:09.499 --> 01:08:09.509
miss folding without any infection or
 

01:08:09.509 --> 01:08:13.670
miss folding without any infection or
anything else okay so there is the good

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680
anything else okay so there is the good
 

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.650
anything else okay so there is the good
news is there is a species barrier it's

01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660
news is there is a species barrier it's
 

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.300
news is there is a species barrier it's
not easy to go from one species to

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:17.310
not easy to go from one species to
 

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:19.550
not easy to go from one species to
another so if you put diseased brain

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.560
another so if you put diseased brain
 

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.870
another so if you put diseased brain
from one animal to another you don't

01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880
from one animal to another you don't
 

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.510
from one animal to another you don't

how to overcome this if you make
transgenic mice that make the bovine

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520
transgenic mice that make the bovine
 

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.359
transgenic mice that make the bovine
protein you can then infect mice with

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:38.369
protein you can then infect mice with
 

01:08:38.369 --> 01:08:42.559
protein you can then infect mice with

if you take mad cow extracts and put

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:44.730
if you take mad cow extracts and put
 

01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:46.309
if you take mad cow extracts and put
them into mice the mice don't get sick

01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319
them into mice the mice don't get sick
 

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:48.919
them into mice the mice don't get sick
but if you give the mice a transgene

01:08:48.919 --> 01:08:48.929
but if you give the mice a transgene
 

01:08:48.929 --> 01:08:52.039
but if you give the mice a transgene
that produces the bovine protein then

01:08:52.039 --> 01:08:52.049
that produces the bovine protein then
 

01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:54.740
that produces the bovine protein then
the mice will become infected so the

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:54.750
the mice will become infected so the
 

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:56.300
the mice will become infected so the
barrier to transmission is in the

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:56.310
barrier to transmission is in the
 

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:59.120
barrier to transmission is in the
sequence of the protein but apparently

01:08:59.120 --> 01:08:59.130

different foldings cause the proteins to
 

01:09:46.529 --> 01:09:49.280
different foldings cause the proteins to
act in different ways and these can

01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:49.290
act in different ways and these can
 

01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:52.519

so you can actually take a prion from an

01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380
so you can actually take a prion from an
 

01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:57.770
so you can actually take a prion from an
infected animal and put it in cells in

01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780
infected animal and put it in cells in
 

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.260
infected animal and put it in cells in
culture and the prion will multiply in

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:00.270
culture and the prion will multiply in
 

01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:02.930
culture and the prion will multiply in
those cells and you can pass the prion

01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940
those cells and you can pass the prion
 

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.879
those cells and you can pass the prion
from cell to cell as if it were a virus

they could get infected could get into

01:11:50.029 --> 01:11:50.039
they could get infected could get into

cows on the same farm from sheep and
then of course the cows led to BSE the

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:56.010
then of course the cows led to BSE the
 

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:58.970
then of course the cows led to BSE the
cows probably led to infections of other

01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980
cows probably led to infections of other
 

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:02.270
cows probably led to infections of other
species by feed product transmission and

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280
species by feed product transmission and
 

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.330
species by feed product transmission and
also into cats so all of these tses

01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340
also into cats so all of these tses
 

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.470
also into cats so all of these tses
probably originated from

we got our variant CJ from cows and

01:12:11.479 --> 01:12:11.489
we got our variant CJ from cows and
 

01:12:11.489 --> 01:12:13.400
we got our variant CJ from cows and
these a lot of these people who had

these a lot of these people who had
 

01:12:13.410 --> 01:12:15.410
these a lot of these people who had
variant CJ probably transmitted it to

01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420
variant CJ probably transmitted it to
 

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:18.190
variant CJ probably transmitted it to
others by transplants of various sorts

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:18.200
others by transplants of various sorts
 

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.150
others by transplants of various sorts
and then there were probably some

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:20.160
and then there were probably some
 

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.270
and then there were probably some
sporadic origins which are natural and

01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280
sporadic origins which are natural and
 

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.210
sporadic origins which are natural and
humans from which I at regenexx spread

the food supply is a problem because of

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:32.850
the food supply is a problem because of
 

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:36.650
the food supply is a problem because of
the experience with BSE and a lot of

01:12:36.650 --> 01:12:36.660
the experience with BSE and a lot of
 

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.450
the experience with BSE and a lot of
work is being done to try and protect it

01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:38.460
work is being done to try and protect it
 

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.220
work is being done to try and protect it
from this we're developing diagnostic

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:40.230
from this we're developing diagnostic
 

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.430
from this we're developing diagnostic
tests and screening for drugs that block

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440
tests and screening for drugs that block
 

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.710

food chain and it's going to be a

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:48.750
food chain and it's going to be a
 

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:51.380
food chain and it's going to be a
problem now the last thing I want you to

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:51.390
problem now the last thing I want you to
 

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:53.180
problem now the last thing I want you to
know is that not all prions cause

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:53.190
know is that not all prions cause
 

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:56.090
know is that not all prions cause
disease they have been identified in

01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:56.100
disease they have been identified in
 

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:59.510
disease they have been identified in
other microbes as well and they don't

01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520
other microbes as well and they don't
 

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.270
other microbes as well and they don't
cause disease they create protein-based

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280
cause disease they create protein-based
 

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.300
cause disease they create protein-based
memories and they they are believed to

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:05.310

allow organisms to switch between

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:07.170
allow organisms to switch between
 

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:09.560
allow organisms to switch between
phenotypic states so you have a cellular

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:09.570
phenotypic states so you have a cellular
 

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:13.250
phenotypic states so you have a cellular
prion and a pathogenic prion but imagine

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260
prion and a pathogenic prion but imagine
 

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.960
prion and a pathogenic prion but imagine
in yeast you have two forms of a protein

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:14.970
in yeast you have two forms of a protein
 

01:13:14.970 --> 01:13:16.790
in yeast you have two forms of a protein
with two very different functions and

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800
with two very different functions and
 

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.160
with two very different functions and
this may help the yeast for example to

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:19.170
this may help the yeast for example to
 

01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:21.500
this may help the yeast for example to
adapt to stressful environments so in

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:21.510
adapt to stressful environments so in
 

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:24.650
adapt to stressful environments so in
yeast well many Benny prion like

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:24.660
yeast well many Benny prion like
 

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:26.390
yeast well many Benny prion like
proteins have I been identified and

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400
proteins have I been identified and
 

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.520
proteins have I been identified and
these are proteins which can change

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:28.530
these are proteins which can change
 

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:31.220
these are proteins which can change
confirmation they don't change sequence

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:31.230
confirmation they don't change sequence
 

01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:33.200
confirmation they don't change sequence
but they change confirmation and then

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:33.210
but they change confirmation and then
 

01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:35.240
but they change confirmation and then
they have a new function associated with

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:35.250
they have a new function associated with
 

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:37.460
they have a new function associated with
that change and hear all the native

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:37.470
that change and hear all the native
 

01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:40.400
that change and hear all the native
proteins in yeast and then in the prion

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:40.410
proteins in yeast and then in the prion
 

01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:42.710
proteins in yeast and then in the prion
state this is what they're called and

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:42.720
state this is what they're called and
 

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.620
state this is what they're called and
they do different things so for example

01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:45.630
they do different things so for example
 

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.420
they do different things so for example
in mammals we've been talking about how

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:47.430
in mammals we've been talking about how
 

01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:49.550
in mammals we've been talking about how
this conformational change leads to a

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560
this conformational change leads to a
 

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:53.150
this conformational change leads to a
disease but in yeast these changes allow

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:53.160
disease but in yeast these changes allow
 

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.550
disease but in yeast these changes allow
the yeast to use different sources of

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560
the yeast to use different sources of
 

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:58.670
the yeast to use different sources of
material to metabolize altered carbon

01:13:58.670 --> 01:13:58.680
material to metabolize altered carbon
 

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:02.000
material to metabolize altered carbon
source utilization the indiscriminate

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:02.010
source utilization the indiscriminate
 

01:14:02.010 --> 01:14:03.950
source utilization the indiscriminate
utilization of nitrogen so they're

01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960
utilization of nitrogen so they're
 

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.790
utilization of nitrogen so they're
beneficial and so probably the vast

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800
beneficial and so probably the vast
 

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.890
beneficial and so probably the vast
majority of prions that exists are good

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900
majority of prions that exists are good
 

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.740
majority of prions that exists are good
and it happens to be this one causes a

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:12.750
and it happens to be this one causes a
 

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:16.180
and it happens to be this one causes a
neurological disease

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:16.190
 
 

01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:19.160
 
yes yes it goes back and forth in these

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:19.170
yes yes it goes back and forth in these
 

01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:21.350
yes yes it goes back and forth in these
yeast cases now that in humans it

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360
yeast cases now that in humans it
 

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:30.529
yeast cases now that in humans it
doesn't seem to happen

01:14:30.529 --> 01:14:30.539
 
 

01:14:30.539 --> 01:14:32.879
 
way

01:14:32.879 --> 01:14:32.889
way
 

01:14:32.889 --> 01:14:37.049
way
I I suppose theoretically it could but I

01:14:37.049 --> 01:14:37.059
I I suppose theoretically it could but I
 

01:14:37.059 --> 01:14:46.200
I I suppose theoretically it could but I
don't it's not been shown

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:46.210
 
 

01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:48.270
