00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.060
I'm now going to do one of
my least favorite things

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.310
to do by hand, and that is
to invert a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.575
And it can be useful because
you can solve systems that way.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:12.700
But you'll see it's very
computationally-intensive.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.480
And it is better to
be done by a computer.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.604
And the only thing that's
more painful is doing a 4

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:20.620
by 4 or a 4 by 5 matrix, which
would-- or a 4 by 4 or a 5

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.132
by 5 matrix, which
could take all day.

00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:25.340
And I'd probably, definitely
make a careless mistake.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.160
But let's just take
it step-by-step.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.150
So the first thing I'm going to
do, this is my 3 by 3 matrix,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.820
is I'm going to construct
a matrix of minors.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:44.750
So let me construct
here a matrix of minors.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.370
And I'm going to draw this
really big, right over here,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.520
to give ourselves
some real estate.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.560
And the matrix of minors, what
you do is, for each element

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.930
in this matrix, you cross
out the corresponding row,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.510
the corresponding column.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.070
And you replace it
with the determinant

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.170
of the elements that are left.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.790
So what are left
when you get rid

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.860
of this row and this column,
the minor is 1, 1, 4, 5.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.190
So the determinant
of 1, 1, 4, 5.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.730
Let's keep doing that.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.970
This will be
replaced-- well I'll

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.380
let you think about that first.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.120
What is this going
to be replaced with?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.920
Well it's going to be replaced--
this row, this column.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.615
The determinant of 2, 1, 3, 5.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.720
Let's keep going.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.480
Let's do this element.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.610
It's going to be replaced with
the determinant of, we get rid

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.120
of this row, this
column, 2, 1, 3, 4.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.040
We're a third of the way done,
at least with this first stage

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.180
of it.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.680
So for this element
right here, it's

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.980
going to be replaced
with its minor.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.840
So we get rid of this
row, this column.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.050
The determinant of
negative 2, 2, 4, 5.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.660
Then we have-- I'm
trying to switch up

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.840
the colors reasonably--
this element.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.910
Get rid of the middle
row, middle column.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.425
You're left with the
determinant negative 1, 2, 3, 5.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.080
Now we move on
to-- and I'm really

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.800
running out of colors-- this
element right over here,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.580
where its minor is-- we'll get
rid of this row, this column--

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.130
negative 1, negative 2, 3, 4.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.810
So let me see that.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.160
Sorry, someone's car alarm
started ringing outside.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.320
So let me make sure I
didn't lose my focus here.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.170
I don't want to make
any careless mistakes.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.700
This row, this column,
negative 1, negative 2, 3, 4.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.870
All right.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.100
Now let's move over here.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.930
Get rid of the first
column, last row.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.290
You have negative 2, 2, 1, 1.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.040
So we have negative 2, 2, 1, 1.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.460
Now let's move to this one.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.800
The middle column, bottom row,
you have negative 1, 2, 2, 1.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.840
So we have negative 1, 2, 2, 1.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.540
And then we are in
the home stretch

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.570
for at least the
matrix of minors.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.990
And so we are looking at
this element right over here.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.610
Get rid of the last
column, last row.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.940
You're left with negative
1, negative 2, 2, 1.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.870
So the determinant of
negative 1, negative 2, 2, 1.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.470
And from here we just have
to evaluate each of these

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.695
to get the actual
matrix of minors.

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:51.400
This is just a
representation of it.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.150
So let's do that.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.860
So once again, we're
still at the stage

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.914
of getting our matrix of minors.

00:03:58.914 --> 00:04:01.080
And actually I don't have
to write it as big anymore

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.630
because now they're going
to have numeric values.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.671
They're not going to be
these little determinants

00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:05.910
of two-by-twos.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.540
So what is the determinant
over here on the top left?

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.440
Well it's going to be 1
times 5 minus 1 times 4.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.360
1 times 5 minus 4 times 1.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.440
So it's going to be 5
minus 4, which is 1.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.220
What is the determinant over
here, this blue determinant?

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.410
Well it's going to be 2 times
5, which is 10, minus 3 times 1.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.390
So 10 minus 3 is 7.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.100
What is this determinant,
on the top right,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.850
going to evaluate to?

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.640
Well you have 2 times 4
is 8, minus 3 times 1.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.140
So it's 8 minus 3, which is 5.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.130
Then we go over here.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.080
What is this determinant
going to evaluate to?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.350
We have negative 2 times 5 is
negative 10, minus 4 times 2.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.950
So it's negative 10 minus
8, which is negative 18.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.300
Then we have negative 1
times 5, which is negative 5,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.110
minus 3 times 2.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.420
So it's negative 5 minus
6, which is negative 11.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.120
I want to do that in
white, negative 11.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.170
What's this determinant
going to evaluate to?

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.200
We have negative 1 times 4,
negative 4, minus negative 6.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.810
So that's negative 4 plus
6, which is positive 2.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.870
I want to do that in that--
so that is positive 2.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.440
We have three left.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.970
What does this evaluate to?

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.960
Negative 2 times 1 is
negative 2, minus 1 times 2.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.880
So it's negative 2 minus
2 gets us to negative 4.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.330
Home stretch now.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.770
Negative 1 times negative 1 is
negative 1, minus 2 times 2.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.500
So it's negative 1 minus
4, which is negative 5.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.910
And then finally we
have negative 1 times 1

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.480
is negative 1, minus
2 times negative 2,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.850
so minus negative 4.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.930
So it's negative 1
minus negative 4.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.260
That's the same
thing as adding a 4.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.940
So it's negative 1 plus 4.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.600
So it's going to
be a positive 3.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.630
So this right over here is
our true matrix of minors.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.140
And from there we
can get our cofactor.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.270
We can get our
cofactor matrix just

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.950
by remembering a
checkerboard pattern.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.620
So a checkerboard
pattern tells us

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.910
positive, negative, positive,
negative, positive, negative,

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:50.340
positive, negative, positive.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.970
It's a little
self-explanatory why

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.650
that's called a checkerboard.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.010
So if we sign this matrix
of minors in this pattern,

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.390
then we get our cofactor matrix.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.580
So let's set up our cofactor
matrix right over here.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.898
So this is our cofactor.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.980
A lot of terminology,
but hopefully it's

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.450
making a little bit of sense.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.950
Our cofactor matrix.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.730
So we just have to apply
these signs to these values,

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.610
to the matrix of minors.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.590
So 1 is now going to have
applied a positive sign to it.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.030
So it's still just going
to be a positive 1.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.850
You're going to have
7, but it's going

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.560
to have a negative
sign applied to it.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.190
So it's going to
be a negative 7.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.800
You have a 5, positive 5.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.140
The 5 is already positive.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.530
You multiply it
times a positive,

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.550
it's going to be a positive.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.140
You have negative
18, but then we

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.040
have to multiply that
times a negative.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.360
So you get positive 18.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.430
You have negative 11, multiply
that times a positive 1.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.560
And so you still
have negative 11.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.680
You have positive 2,
multiply by a negative 1.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.270
You're going to have negative 2.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.840
Then you have negative 4,
multiply by a positive 1.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.160
You still have negative 4.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.980
And then you have negative 5.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.210
What is this going to be
in the cofactor matrix?

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.800
Well you take a negative 5,
multiply by a negative 1.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.810
You have a positive 5.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.160
And then finally, you
have a positive 3,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.080
multiply by a positive 1.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.510
You're still going
to have a positive 3.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.650
So we've gone pretty
far in our journey,

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.187
this very
computationally-intensive

00:08:30.187 --> 00:08:31.770
journey-- one that
I don't necessarily

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.370
enjoy doing-- of finding
our inverse by getting

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.081
to our cofactor matrix.

00:08:37.081 --> 00:08:38.830
Now we just have to
take this determinant,

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.288
multiply this times 1 over the
determinant and we're there.

00:08:41.288 --> 00:08:45.663
We've figured out the
inverse of matrix C.
