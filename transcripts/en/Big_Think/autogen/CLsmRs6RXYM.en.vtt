00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.700
that's one of the more common nightmares
that we see is the person is chasing

that we see is the person is chasing
 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.770

some sort of we call it dysphoric
 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.960
some sort of we call it dysphoric
emotions there's something uncomfortable

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970
emotions there's something uncomfortable
 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.810
emotions there's something uncomfortable
you could be sad you could be unhappy

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820
you could be sad you could be unhappy
 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.030
you could be sad you could be unhappy
it could be scared anxious but it

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040
it could be scared anxious but it
 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.830
it could be scared anxious but it
traditionally the definition is you have

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840
traditionally the definition is you have
 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.569
traditionally the definition is you have
to be a weight you have to awaken from

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579
to be a weight you have to awaken from
 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.270
to be a weight you have to awaken from
this nightmare so you have it if you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280
this nightmare so you have it if you
 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.489
this nightmare so you have it if you
awaken from it and you can recall in

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:38.499
awaken from it and you can recall in
 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.470
awaken from it and you can recall in
detail what just happened that's a

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480
detail what just happened that's a
 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.149
detail what just happened that's a
nightmare so it's very different from a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159
nightmare so it's very different from a
 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.529
nightmare so it's very different from a
dream where you generally don't wake up

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539
dream where you generally don't wake up
 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:44.759
dream where you generally don't wake up
from it and you don't have this

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769
from it and you don't have this
 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.009
from it and you don't have this
dysphoric emotion there's some debate as

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019
dysphoric emotion there's some debate as
 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:48.450
dysphoric emotion there's some debate as
to whether you need to awaken from them

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460
to whether you need to awaken from them
 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.559
to whether you need to awaken from them
because there are some patients who are

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.569
because there are some patients who are
 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.059
because there are some patients who are
actually starting to say I had these

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069
actually starting to say I had these
 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.549
actually starting to say I had these
horrible nightmares but I never woke up

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559
horrible nightmares but I never woke up
 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.110
horrible nightmares but I never woke up
from them but they can still call them

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120
from them but they can still call them
 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.040
from them but they can still call them
when they get up in the morning so

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050
when they get up in the morning so
 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.770
when they get up in the morning so
there's still some debate in the field

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
there's still some debate in the field
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.389
there's still some debate in the field
when it comes to the reason why we have

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399
when it comes to the reason why we have
 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.860
when it comes to the reason why we have
nightmares we're still debating that

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870
nightmares we're still debating that
 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.410
nightmares we're still debating that
it's a new area of research nightmares

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420
it's a new area of research nightmares
 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.620
it's a new area of research nightmares
and the way that I like to think about

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630
and the way that I like to think about
 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.660
and the way that I like to think about
it is our brain we have stress during

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670
it is our brain we have stress during
 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.819
it is our brain we have stress during
the day and our brain needs to learn to

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829
the day and our brain needs to learn to
 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.280
the day and our brain needs to learn to
process this stress so there are people

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290
process this stress so there are people
 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.230
process this stress so there are people
who have repetitive nightmares and what

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240
who have repetitive nightmares and what
 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.880
who have repetitive nightmares and what
happens is their brain is trying to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890
happens is their brain is trying to
 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.469
happens is their brain is trying to
process a stress and help their brain

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479
process a stress and help their brain
 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.719
process a stress and help their brain
actually deal with what happens if this

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729
actually deal with what happens if this
 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.459
actually deal with what happens if this
stress happens again so their brain is

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:23.469
stress happens again so their brain is
 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:25.469
stress happens again so their brain is
preparing them to deal with it in case

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479
preparing them to deal with it in case
 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.240
preparing them to deal with it in case
the stress happens again but it's so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250
the stress happens again but it's so
 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.459
the stress happens again but it's so
scary that they're waking from it so

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469
scary that they're waking from it so
 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.810
scary that they're waking from it so
they're never actually able to finish

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820
they're never actually able to finish
 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.010
they're never actually able to finish
the file and put it away

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020
the file and put it away
 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.330
the file and put it away
it just keeps happening because they

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340
it just keeps happening because they
 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.190
it just keeps happening because they
awaken from it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
 
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.310
 
so ir 2 imagery rehearsal therapy or ir

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
so ir 2 imagery rehearsal therapy or ir
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.830
so ir 2 imagery rehearsal therapy or ir
two years I'll call it for now it's a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
two years I'll call it for now it's a
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.929
two years I'll call it for now it's a
very very simple treatment that was

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
very very simple treatment that was
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.359
very very simple treatment that was
developed by Barry Krakow in the late

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
developed by Barry Krakow in the late
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.960
developed by Barry Krakow in the late
90s early turn of this turn of the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
90s early turn of this turn of the
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.440
90s early turn of this turn of the
decade

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
decade
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.020
decade
to really help change the imagery that

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
to really help change the imagery that
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.210
to really help change the imagery that
you're having at night so we think of it

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220
you're having at night so we think of it
 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.520
you're having at night so we think of it
as imagery during the day seeing things

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
as imagery during the day seeing things
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.080
as imagery during the day seeing things
picturing things you had painting a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
picturing things you had painting a
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.389
picturing things you had painting a
picture is very similar to imagery at

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
picture is very similar to imagery at
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.779
picture is very similar to imagery at
night

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789
night
 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.219
night
that's what dreams are nightmares

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
that's what dreams are nightmares
 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.260
that's what dreams are nightmares
they're imagery at night so what we do

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
they're imagery at night so what we do
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.719
they're imagery at night so what we do
is we take this very simple technique by

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
is we take this very simple technique by
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.340
is we take this very simple technique by
basically telling someone if they have a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350
basically telling someone if they have a
 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.930
basically telling someone if they have a
nightmare so it takes someone who has a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
nightmare so it takes someone who has a
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.520
nightmare so it takes someone who has a
recurrent nightmare of being chased by

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
recurrent nightmare of being chased by
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.100
recurrent nightmare of being chased by
someone will have them come in and will

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
someone will have them come in and will
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.199
someone will have them come in and will
say to them okay now take that nightmare

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
say to them okay now take that nightmare
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.150
say to them okay now take that nightmare
tell me what it is but now I don't want

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160
tell me what it is but now I don't want
 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.199
tell me what it is but now I don't want
you to think about it anymore

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
you to think about it anymore
 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.610
you to think about it anymore
just take it almost like it's on a piece

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
just take it almost like it's on a piece
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.920
just take it almost like it's on a piece
of paper and throw it out change that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
of paper and throw it out change that
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.110
of paper and throw it out change that
nightmare any way you want you can

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120
nightmare any way you want you can
 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.880
nightmare any way you want you can
change a tiny bit of it you can change

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890
change a tiny bit of it you can change
 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.740
change a tiny bit of it you can change
the whole thing it doesn't matter and

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750
the whole thing it doesn't matter and
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.210
the whole thing it doesn't matter and
I'm not the one to tell them how to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
I'm not the one to tell them how to
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.979
I'm not the one to tell them how to
change it it's their dream that they're

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989
change it it's their dream that they're
 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.020
change it it's their dream that they're
making so change it any way you want to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
making so change it any way you want to
 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.110
making so change it any way you want to
make it just it can be neutral it can be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
make it just it can be neutral it can be
 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.810
make it just it can be neutral it can be
positive whatever so the person chasing

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
positive whatever so the person chasing
 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.979
positive whatever so the person chasing
them it could be a very scary experience

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989
them it could be a very scary experience
 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.300
them it could be a very scary experience
what they would do is for example had a

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
what they would do is for example had a
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.949
what they would do is for example had a
patient yesterday who changed his

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959
patient yesterday who changed his
 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.170
patient yesterday who changed his
nightmare from him to him being chased

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180
nightmare from him to him being chased
 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.580
nightmare from him to him being chased
who actually having his two younger

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590
who actually having his two younger
 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.979
who actually having his two younger
brothers chase him around in his old

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989
brothers chase him around in his old
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.860
brothers chase him around in his old
apartment and they were playing so just

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
apartment and they were playing so just
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.900
apartment and they were playing so just
by still having the chasing element but

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910
by still having the chasing element but
 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.750
by still having the chasing element but
making it a fun playful chase with two

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
making it a fun playful chase with two
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.849
making it a fun playful chase with two
people he knew made it a much different

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859
people he knew made it a much different
 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.710
people he knew made it a much different
dream than the nightmare he was having

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
dream than the nightmare he was having
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720
dream than the nightmare he was having
so then what I had him do is close his

stop then they stopped for a minute and
 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.680
stop then they stopped for a minute and
then they kept running after each other

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
then they kept running after each other
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.620
then they kept running after each other
he pictured that whole story in his head

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
he pictured that whole story in his head
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.270
he pictured that whole story in his head
painted a picture and could see what

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280
painted a picture and could see what
 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.400
painted a picture and could see what
everyone was wearing the smells he could

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
everyone was wearing the smells he could
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.500
everyone was wearing the smells he could
tell he could see the carpet every

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510
tell he could see the carpet every
 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.539
tell he could see the carpet every
detail and once he took himself through

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549
detail and once he took himself through
 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.280
detail and once he took himself through
that picture for about five minutes

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290
that picture for about five minutes
 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.410
that picture for about five minutes
practice it morning and night if you

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
practice it morning and night if you
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.819
practice it morning and night if you
keep doing that it actually helps to

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829
keep doing that it actually helps to
 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.650
keep doing that it actually helps to
reduce the nightmare frequency because

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
reduce the nightmare frequency because
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.759
reduce the nightmare frequency because
you're getting control over your

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769
you're getting control over your
 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.750
you're getting control over your
nightmare

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760
 
 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.210
 
for some patients will have that new

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220
for some patients will have that new
 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.399
for some patients will have that new
dream for others it just reduces the

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409
dream for others it just reduces the
 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.170
dream for others it just reduces the
nightmare frequency we don't know why

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180
nightmare frequency we don't know why
 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.240
nightmare frequency we don't know why
yet but it's such a simple technique

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250
yet but it's such a simple technique
 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.949
yet but it's such a simple technique
because it gives you control over it

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959
because it gives you control over it
 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.240
because it gives you control over it

over the nightmare
that it works for there have been

that it works for there have been
 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.140
that it works for there have been
studies that show upwards of 90 90

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150
studies that show upwards of 90 90
 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.670
studies that show upwards of 90 90
percent of patients who actually do this

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680
percent of patients who actually do this
 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.430
percent of patients who actually do this
treatment actually report it getting

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440
treatment actually report it getting
 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.150
treatment actually report it getting
better the nightmare frequency

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160
 
 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.310

parents so in kids what we think is
happening in the brain the way I like to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020
happening in the brain the way I like to
 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.690
happening in the brain the way I like to
think about it is almost like your brain

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700
think about it is almost like your brain
 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.890
think about it is almost like your brain
is going through all these stages of

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900
is going through all these stages of
 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.600
is going through all these stages of
sleep and it's developing and children

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610
sleep and it's developing and children
 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.730
sleep and it's developing and children
so fast it's almost like you're shifting

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740
so fast it's almost like you're shifting
 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.010
so fast it's almost like you're shifting
gears in a car and at some point you

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020
gears in a car and at some point you
 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.480
gears in a car and at some point you
actually stall out a little bit and

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490
actually stall out a little bit and
 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.860
actually stall out a little bit and
that's kind of what happens during a

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870
that's kind of what happens during a
 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.270
that's kind of what happens during a
night terror their brains shifting so

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280
night terror their brains shifting so
 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.580
night terror their brains shifting so
fast that it stalls out they have this

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590
fast that it stalls out they have this
 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.170
fast that it stalls out they have this
episode but then they go back to sleep

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180
episode but then they go back to sleep
 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.380
episode but then they go back to sleep
and everything regulates itself very

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390
and everything regulates itself very
 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.850
and everything regulates itself very
common in kids like I said it tends to

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860
common in kids like I said it tends to
 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.130
common in kids like I said it tends to
get better as you get older now there

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140
get better as you get older now there
 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.360
get better as you get older now there
are some night terrors that happen in

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370
are some night terrors that happen in
 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.970
are some night terrors that happen in
adults and if it starts as an adult and

adults and if it starts as an adult and
 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.409
adults and if it starts as an adult and
you never had them before then there

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419
you never had them before then there
 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.790
you never had them before then there
might be other things that are happening

might be other things that are happening
 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.260
might be other things that are happening
there might be anxiety depression stress

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270
there might be anxiety depression stress
 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.030
there might be anxiety depression stress
and that's when you might have more of a

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040
and that's when you might have more of a
 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.130
and that's when you might have more of a
thorough psychological evaluation and
