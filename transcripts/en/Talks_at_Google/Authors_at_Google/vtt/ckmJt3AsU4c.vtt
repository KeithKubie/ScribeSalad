&gt;&gt; Female Announcer: Hi everyone and thanks
for coming to today's Authors@Google event

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.879
with Charles Yu.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:20.951
It's really my pleasure to introduce him and
as I just discovered we are from the same

00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:21.951
hometown, really small world.

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:25.619
But Charles is the author of How to Live Safely
in a Science Fictional Universe, which was

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.519
actually named one of the best books of the
year by both Time Magazine and the San Francisco

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:32.519
Chronicle.

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.530
His novel has been described as a complex,
brainy, genre-hoping joy ride of a story,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.160
far more than the sum of its component parts.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.059
And Yu is also the author of a short story,
a story collection, Third Class Superhero.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:55.539
And is 2007, I believe, he won the National
Book Foundations Five Under Thirty-five Fiction

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:56.890
Writers to Watch.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.570
So besides being a writer Charlie is also
a full-time lawyer at a visual effects company

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.040
in Southern California.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.780
So without further ado, please join me in
welcoming Charles Yu to Google.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.880
[applause]
&gt;&gt; Charles: Thanks Erica.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.700
Thanks very much for having me and thanks
for coming.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:29.380
I think I am going to read little bits and
talk in between, try to keep it from getting

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.700
too much of my voice.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.550
Well I guess it will be all of my voice [laughs]
so, I'll try to keep from just reading large

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.290
chunks, I will read little bits.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.460
So I guess to set it up a little bit, this
is a novel about a guy named Charles Yu and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.220
he lives in a place called Minor Universe
31, which is described as a damaged universe.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.920
It was in the process of its construction,
it was abandoned.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.110
So it is now an unfinished universe that is
93% complete.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.750
And the inhabitants of this universe are basically
science fictional characters who have been

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.750
kicked out of their own stories.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.599
So you have got a lot of people that are sort
of, people and other entities that are sort

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.700
of floating around looking for a story to
be in.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.320
Charles's job in this universe is that he
is a time machine repair man and so that's,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.170
you are going to hear a bit about.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.490
The first part I will read is him describing
his job.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:33.340
[reading from book] When it happens, this
is what happens, I shoot myself.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.530
Not, you know, myself self, I shoot my future
self.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.890
He steps out of a time machine, introduces
himself as Charles Yu, what else am I supposed

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.890
to do?

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.890
I kill him.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.440
I kill my own future.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.510
There is just enough space inside here for
one person to live indefinitely, or at least

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.460
that's what the operation manual says.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.560
User can survive inside the TM31 Recreational
Time Travel device in isolation for an indefinite

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.780
period of time.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.310
I'm not totally sure what that means.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.940
Maybe it doesn't actually mean anything, which
would be fine, which would be OK by me.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.550
Because that's what I have been doing, living
here indefinitely.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.680
The tense operator has been set to present/indefinite
for I don't know how long, some time now.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.490
And although I still pick up the occasional
job from dispatch, they seem to come less

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.590
frequently these days.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.569
And so, when I am not working I like to wedge
the gear shift in p/i and just sort of cruise.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.850
My gums hurt, it's hard to focus.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.970
There much be some kind of internal time distortion
effect in here because when I look at myself

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.210
in the little mirror above my sink, what I
see is my father's face.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.190
My face turning into his.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.570
I am beginning to feel how the man looked.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.900
Especially how he looked on those nights he
came home so tired he couldn't even make it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.989
through dinner without nodding off.

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.110
Sitting there with his bowl of soup cooling
in from of him.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.050
A rich pork and winter melon saturated broth
that moment by moment was losing or giving

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.032
up its tiny quantum of heat into the vast
average temperature of the universe.

00:04:19.032 --> 00:04:24.520
The base model TM31 runs on state-of-the-art
chronodiegetical technology.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.809
A six-cylinder grammar drive built on a quad-core
physics engine which features an implied temporalinguistics

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:36.669
architecture allowing for free-form navigation
within a rendered environment, such as, for

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.020
instance, a story space.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.330
And in particular a science fictional universe.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.809
Or as Mom used to say, it's a box, you get
into it, you push some buttons, it takes you

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:52.819
to other places, different times, hit this
switch for the past, pull up that lever for

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.750
the future, you get out and hope that world
has changed, or at least maybe you have.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.180
I don't get out much these days, at least
I have a dog, sort of.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.830
He was retconned out of some space western.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.240
It was the usual deal: hero on his way up
has a trusty canine sidekick, then hero gets

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.889
famous and important and all of that and by
the time season two rolls around, hero doesn't

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.680
feel like sharing the spotlight anymore.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.650
Not with a scruffy-looking mutt, so they put
the little guy in a trash pod and sent him

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.650
off.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.860
I found him just as he was about to drift
into a black hole.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.960
He had a face like soft clay and haunches
that were bald in spots where he'd been chewing

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.030
off his own fur.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.650
I don't think anyone has ever been as happy
to see anything as this dog was to see me.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.860
He licked my face and that was that.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.740
I asked him what he wanted his name to be,
he didn't say anything so I named him Ed.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.100
The smell of Ed is pretty powerful in here
but I'm OK with that.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.669
He is a good dog, sleeps a lot, sometimes
licks his paw to comfort himself.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.930
Doesn't need food or water, I'm pretty sure
he doesn't even know that he doesn't even

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:59.930
exist.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.779
Ed is just this weird ontological entity that
produces unconditional slobbery, loyal affection.

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:06.779
Superfluous.

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:07.779
Gratuitous.

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:11.270
He must violate some kind of conservation
law.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.599
Something from nothing: all of this saliva
and, I guess, love.

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:20.479
Love from the abandoned heart of a non-existent
dog.

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.050
Because I work in the time travel industry
everyone assumes I must be a scientist, which

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.979
is sort of correct.

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.639
I was studying for my Masters in Applied Science
fiction, I wanted to be a structural engineer

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:32.919
like my father.

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.960
And then the whole situation with Mom got
worse and then with my dad missing I had to

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.369
do what made sense.

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:43.400
And then things got even worse and this job
came along and I took it.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.199
Now I fix time machines for a living.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.599
To be more specific I am a Certified Network
Technician for TClass Personal-Use Chronogrammatic

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:57.069
Vehicles and an Approved Independent Affiliate
Contractor for Time Warner Time, which owns

00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:02.710
and operates this Universe as a spatio-temporal
structure and an entertainment complex zoned

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.439
for retail, commercial and residential use.

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:09.439
The job is pretty chill for the most part,
although right at this moment I am not loving

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.080
it because I think my tense operator might
be breaking down.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.409
It's happening now, or maybe not, maybe it
was earlier today, or yesterday.

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:21.349
Maybe it broke down a long time ago, maybe
that's the point.

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:25.629
If it is broken and my transmission has been
shifting randomly in and out of gears, then

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:28.919
how would I ever know when it happened.

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:34.099
Maybe I am the one who broke it, trying to
fool myself, thinking I could live like this,

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:35.820
thinking I could stay out here forever.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.689
[ends reading]
&gt;&gt;Charles Yu: So that's Charles, he lives

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:43.520
in this kind of lonely box, just this time
machine.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.050
It's like his repair vehicle that he gets.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:53.289
And he goes around taking client calls and
visiting people that have gotten themselves

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:55.509
in trouble with their time machines.

00:07:55.509 --> 00:08:00.039
The rules of this universe though are that
you can't, in Minor Universe 31, are that

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:05.419
you can't change the past.

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:07.979
You can go back and look at it.

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:16.300
So now, whether or not that makes perfect
sense, I am not sure but that's the rules.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:27.259
[laughs] So this is Charles taking a client
call and mostly what he does is he explains

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:32.960
to people that they are trying to use their
machine in a way that they are not allowed

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.960
to.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.329
[reads from book] Client call: Screen says
Skywalker, L and my first thought is "Oh may,

00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:41.329
wow!"

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:45.230
But when I get there it's not you know who
with the man-blouse and the soft boots and

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.750
the proficiency at wielding light-based weapons.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.750
It's his son Linus.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.620
We are on a pretty standard-looking Ice Planet,
19-20 years in the past.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.180
A few huts are off in the distance.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.750
It's so cold everything is blue; it hurts
to breathe.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.220
Even the air is blue.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.560
The crash site is maybe two hundred yards
up the hill to the north.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.759
I park the unit, pop the hatch, listen to
it go "Shhhhhh" that hydraulic hatch-popping

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.759
sound.

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:13.850
I love that sound.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.300
I hike up to the sight with my service pack
to an outcropping of frozen rock.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.569
And as I am catching my breath, I notice a
small amount of smoke seeping out of a side

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:24.670
panel on Linus' rental unit.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:30.029
I pop it open and see a small fire burning
in his wave function collapser.

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:32.930
I get my clipboard out, tap my knuckles on
the hatch.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:37.600
I have never met Linus Skywalker before but
I have heard stories from other techs so I

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.070
feel like I have a good idea what to expect.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.829
What I don't expect is a kid.

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:48.850
A boy opens the hatch and climbs out, pushes
the hair out of his eyes, can't be a day older

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.850
than nine.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.240
I ask him what he was doing when the machine
failed and he mumbles something about how

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.370
I would never understand.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.829
I say "Try me."

00:09:56.829 --> 00:10:00.750
He looks down at his anti-gravity boots, which
appear to be a couple of sizes too big, then

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:06.769
gives me a look like "I'm a fourth grader,
what do you want from me?"

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:08.430
Dude, I say, you know you can't change the
past.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.150
And he says "Then what the hell is a time
machine for?"

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.839
"Not for trying to kill your father when he
was your age."

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:16.839
I say.

00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:22.000
He closes his eyes, tilts his head back, pushes
air out through his nostrils in a super-dramatic

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
way.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.540
"You have no idea what it is like man, to
grow up with a freaking Savior of the Universe

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.279
as your dad."

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.910
I tell him that doesn't have to be his whole
story.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.149
That he can have a new beginning.

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:37.540
"For starters" I say "change your name."

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.910
He opens his eyes, looks at me as seriously
as a nine-year old can and says "Yeah, maybe."

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.730
But I know he doesn’t mean it.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:50.300
He is trapped in this whole dark-father-lost-son
galactic mono-myth thing and he doesn’t

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.920
know any other way.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:00.040
[ends reading]
So, skip ahead a little bit here.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:07.300
[pause]
[begins reading again] When you were a kid

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.560
playing with the other kids on your street
and everyone is fighting over who they are

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.310
going to be, you have to call dibs early.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.399
As soon as you see one another, pretty much
as soon as you step outside of your house.

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:23.860
Even if you are halfway down the block, first
dibs gets Han Solo, everyone knows that.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.810
You almost don’t even have to say it, if
you are first, you are Han Solo period, end

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:29.810
of story.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.360
There was one time Donny, the kid from two
blocks over, the other side of the freeway,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.910
got first dibs and said he was going to be
Buck Rogers.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.920
And everyone laughed at Donny so hard and
for so long that he looked like he was going

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.920
to cry.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.129
He begged to change his answer but by then
it was too late.

00:11:44.129 --> 00:11:48.040
Justin, who had second dibs, got to be Solo
that day.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.310
Which was like winning the lottery with a
ticket he didn’t even buy, and he milked

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.120
it for all it was worth.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.630
Donny was in agony, he was in hell, really.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.149
And everyone called his Suck Rogers until
he peed his pants and then got on his blue

00:11:59.149 --> 00:12:02.790
Huffy bike and rode away never to return.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.990
I was never totally sure why everyone wanted
to be Han Solo.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:11.279
Maybe it was because he wasn't born into it
like Luke, with the birth-right, natural talent

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:13.910
for the force and the premade stories.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.290
Solo had to make his own story, he was a freelance
protagonist, a relatively ordinary guy that

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.830
got to the major leagues by being quick with
a gun and a joke.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.399
He was basically a hero because he was funny.

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:30.509
Whatever the reason, first place was always
Solo, always, always, always.

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:35.910
And second place was usually Chewbacca because
if you weren't the one saving the galaxy,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.009
you might have well be eight feet tall and
covered with hair.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:42.670
[ends reading]
&gt;&gt;Charles: Here is a bit that I actually don't

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:48.670
usually read when I am reading but I am going
to read here.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:56.470
And so , I don't know why but [laughs] because
it's the bit of fake science that I made up

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.050
for this book called 'chronodiegetics'.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.260
And it's probably a bad idea that I am reading
it because you'll all realize how little science

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.759
I actually know, but maybe you already know
that.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:09.319
So, OK, let's just try it.

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:15.899
[reads from book] Chronodiegetics is the branch
of science fictional science focusing on the

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:21.190
physical and metaphysical properties of time,
given a finite and bounded diegesis . It is

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.660
currently the best theory of the nature and
the function of time within a narrative space.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:31.040
A man, as the theory goes, falling through
time at a constant rate of acceleration will

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.450
not, absent in any visual or other contextual
clues, be able to distinguish between one,

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:42.730
acceleration caused by a force that is diegetical
in nature and two, an extradiegetical force.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.579
Which is to say, from the point of view of
this man being pulled into the past, it is

00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:52.160
impossible to know if he is at rest, in an
narrated frame pulled by gravitational memory

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.269
or an accelerated frame of narrative reference.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:59.649
The man experiences what is termed past tense/memory
equivalence.

00:13:59.649 --> 00:14:04.240
In other words the character within the story
or even the narrator has, in general, no way

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.189
of knowing whether or not he is in the past
tense narration of a story or is instead in

00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:14.430
the present tense or some other tense, state
of affairs and merely reflecting upon the

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.430
past.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:20.350
This equivalence forms a theoretical basis
for an entire field summarized as follows.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:26.129
The foundational theory of chronodiegetics:
within a science fictional space, memory and

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:31.899
regret, are when taken together the set of
necessary and sufficient elements required

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:33.819
to produce a time machine.

00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:34.819
I.e.

00:14:34.819 --> 00:14:39.350
It is possible in principle to construct a
universal time machine from no other components

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:43.800
than one: a piece of paper that is moved in
two directions through a recording element,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:49.220
backward and forward, which, two: performs
only two basic operations: narration and the

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:52.370
straight forward application of the past tense.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.430
I remember there were Sunday afternoons in
our house when it felt as if the only sound

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.749
of the world was the ticking of the clock
in our kitchen.

00:14:59.749 --> 00:15:01.180
Our house was a collection of silences.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.610
Each room a mute, empty frame.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:09.129
Each of us three oscillating bodies, Mom,
Dad and Me, moving around in our own curved

00:15:09.129 --> 00:15:13.800
functions from space to space, not making
any noise, just waiting.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.019
Waiting to wait, trying for some reason not
to disrupt the field of silence.

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:22.480
Not to perturb the delicate equilibrium of
the system.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.399
We wandered from room to room just missing
one other.

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:32.290
On paths neither chosen by us nor random,
but determined by our own particular characteristics.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:37.220
Our own properties, unable to deviate, to
break from our orbital loops.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.329
Unable to do something as simple as walking
into the next room, where our beloved, our

00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:47.300
father, our mother, our child, our wife, our
husband was sitting, silent, waiting but not

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.690
realizing it.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.560
Waiting for someone to say something, anything.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.470
Wanting to do it, yearning to do it, physically
unable to bring ourselves to change our velocities.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:56.470
[ends reading] [pause]
How much time do I have?

00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:01.330
A little bit, OK.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:11.589
A couple of more sections here.

00:16:11.589 --> 00:16:29.240
[pause]
[reading from book] The earliest memory I

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:35.019
have of my own dad is the two of us, sitting
on my bed as he reads me a book we have checked

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:36.171
out from the local library.

00:16:36.171 --> 00:16:39.610
I am three.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.309
I don't remember what the story is or even
the title of the book.

00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:46.779
I don't remember what he is wearing or if
my room is messy.

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:51.660
What I do remember is the way I fit between
his right arm and his body and the way his

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.680
neck and the underside of his chin look.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:59.259
And the soft yellow light of my lamp, which
has a cloth lampshade, light blue, covered

00:16:59.259 --> 00:17:02.680
by an alternating pattern of robots and spaceships.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:09.050
This is what I remember: one, the little pocket
of space he creates for me.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.390
Two, how it is enough.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.400
Three, the sound of his voice.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.240
Four, the way those space ships look shot
through from behind with light so that every

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:25.089
stitch in the fabric of the surface is a whole
in a source, a point in an absence, a coordinate

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.620
in a ship's celestial navigation.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:32.550
Five, how the bed feels like a little spaceship,
itself.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.770
People rent time machines, they think they
can change the past.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.620
Then they get there and find out causality
isn't worked the way they thought it did.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.980
They get stuck, stuck in places they didn't
mean to go.

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.750
In places they did mean to go, in places they
should not have tried to go.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.720
They get into trouble, logical, metaphysical,
etc.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.480
That's where I come in, I go and get them
out.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.320
I tell people I have a job and I have job
security.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.150
I have a job because I know how to fix the
cooling module on the quantum decoherence

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.500
engine of the TM31.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.540
That's the reason I have a job.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.690
But the reason I have job security is because
people have no idea how to make themselves

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.060
happy, even with a time machine.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:17.400
I have job security because what the customer
wants, when you get right down to it, is to

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.070
relive his very worst moment over and over
and over again.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.170
Willing to pay a lot of money to do it, too.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:29.050
I mean look, my father built a sort of semi-working
proto-time machine years before pretty much

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.220
anyone else had even thought of it.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.070
He was one of the first people to work out
the basic math and the parameters, and the

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.940
limitations of live and the various canonical
time travel scenarios.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.130
He was gifted or cursed, depending upon how
you looked at it.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:47.130
With a deep intuition of time, an ability
to feel it inside, viscerally and he still

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.650
spent his whole life trying to figure out
how to minimize lose and entropy and logical

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:52.650
impossibility.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:56.340
How to tease out the calculus underlying cause
and effect.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.790
He still spent the better part of four decades
trying to come to terms with just how screwed

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.740
up and unfair it is that we only get to do
this once.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.260
With the intractability and general awfulness
of trying to parse the idea of 'once'.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:13.810
Trying to get any kind of handle of it, trying
to put it into the equations, isolate into

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:18.660
a variable the slippery concept of 'once-ness'.
[ends reading]

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:29.730
&gt;&gt;Charles Yu: One more section and then maybe
talk a little bit about stuff.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.010
[chuckles] OK, alright.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:38.450
–[pause]
[reading from book] My personal clock shows

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.930
that I have been in here more or less for
almost ten years.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:47.060
Nine years, nine months and twenty-nine days
according to the sub-dermal biochronometric

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.880
chip inserted just under the skin on my left
wrist.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.690
That's how much time has passed for me, for
my body and my head.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.400
A rough measure of how many breaths I have
taken, how many times I have closed and opened

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.540
my eyes.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.590
How many lunches I have had in here, how many
memories I have formed.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.460
I guess that makes me thirty, thirty-one-ish.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.500
Probably goes without saying but time machine
repair guys don’t get a lot of action.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.090
I had a one night stand with something cute
a couple of years ago.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.970
Not human exactly, human-ish.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:22.930
We hung out a few times, tried messing around
but the end couldn't figure out her anatomy.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.800
Or maybe it was the other way around, in the
end it wasn't going to work.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.340
I don't think she had the brain chemistry
for love, or maybe that was me.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.330
I don't even get much sexbot these days.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.700
When you are thirteen you spend all your time
imagining what it would be like to live in

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.950
a world where you could pay a robot for sex,
and that sex would cost a dollar.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.200
And the only obstacle to getting sex would
be making sure you had four quarters.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.560
Then you grow up and it turns out you do live
in the kind of world, a world with coin-operated

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.560
sexbots.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.610
And it's not really as great as you thought
it would be.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.740
Partly because it doesn't make you any less
lonely in the perpetual dark of total vacuum.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.520
And partly because well, it's gross.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.400
Your friends, your neighbors, your family,
they know what you are doing in the kiosk.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.220
They know, cause they do it themselves.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:14.080
Partly because sexbot technology hasn't really
improved much since the first generation consoles.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.620
No one cares enough.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.690
For a dollar it is pretty hard to complain.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.240
Living like this means the year stops making
sense and the month and the week.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.830
The dates fall away from the days like glass
punched out of window frames, or ice cubes

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.690
out of a tray into a sink.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.450
Identical, dateless, nameless durational blobs
melting into an undifferentiated puddle.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.910
Is that a Saturday, a Friday, a Monday?

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:41.870
Is that an April 13th or a November 2nd.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.200
Living like this means you don't have a container
anymore for the different days, can hold in

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:51.490
a little twenty-four hour-sized box a set
of events that constitutes a unit.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:56.160
Something you can compartmentalize, something
with a beginning and an end, something to

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.180
fill with a to-do list.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.240
Living like this means that it all runs together.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.470
A cold and bright December morning with your
father, or a lazy evening in late August.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.730
One of those sunsets seemed to take longer
than is possible.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:14.980
Where the sun just refuses to go down, where
the hour seems to elongate to the point that

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.020
it doesn't seem like it can stretch any farther
without detaching completely from the hour

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.130
before it.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.700
Like a piece of taffy.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:27.030
Like undersea molten lava forming a new island,
a piece of time detaching from the sea floor

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.960
and floating up to the surface.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.650
It's not comfortable in here, but it's not
not-comfortable either.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.170
Its neutral, the null point on the comfort
discomfort/ access.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:43.220
The exact fulcrum, the precise coordinate
located to the half infinity of positive comfort

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.960
value to the right and the half infinity of
negative values on the left.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.310
To live in here is to live at the origin,
at zero.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:55.350
Neither present nor absent, a denial of self
and creature-hood to an arbitrary small epsilon-delta

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:56.350
limit.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.150
Can you live your whole life at zero?

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:03.670
Can you live your entire life in the exact
point between comfort and discomfort?

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.530
You can in this device, my father designed
it that way.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:10.160
Don't ask me why, if I knew the answer to
that I would know a whole lot of other things,

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160
too.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.910
Things like why he left, where he is, what
he is doing, when he is coming back, if he

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.910
is coming back.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:22.620
Where has he been all these years, I am guess
that is where he is now.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:27.820
I don't miss him anymore, most of the time
anyway.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.720
I want to, I wish I could, but unfortunately
it's true.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.170
Time does heal.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.910
It will do so whether you like it or not.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.530
And there is nothing anyone can do about it.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:42.620
If you're not careful, time will take away
everything that ever hurt you, everything

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.210
that you have ever lost and replace it with
knowledge.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.670
Time is a machine, it will convert your pain
into experience.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:54.970
Raw data will be compiled, will be translated
into a more comprehensible language.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:59.760
The individual events of your life will be
transmuted into another substance called memory,

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:05.520
and in the mechanism something will be lost
and you will never be able to reverse it.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.210
You will never again have the original moment
back, in it's uncategorized, preprocessed

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:11.370
state.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:15.650
It will force you to move on and you will
not have a choice in the matter.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.120
[ends reading]
&gt;&gt; Charles: So that's all I am going to read.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.550
I guess I will talk a little bit about writing
this book.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:28.670
[pause]
I started out really wanting to tell a father-son

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.090
story, and that's, that's, um.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:39.950
I didn't read much from the father-son story
cause it's, it takes a bit of context, I guess,

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.390
to understand what's happening.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:47.530
Basically what happens is Charles Yu is living
in this sort of a-chronological way, he's

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.530
just drifting.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:53.490
And he goes and does his job to repair someone's
time machine and then pops back sort of into

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.760
his little pocket of space where he lives
and he doesn't really interact with anybody.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:06.760
He is just a really sad dude and so he, at
the very beginning he shoots his future self

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:12.700
and he realizes that that's going to have
to happen to him in the future.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.740
So he decides to go back and say "well, maybe
I can figure out a way to get out of this."

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.410
Even though he knows he can't, it's going
to happen to him.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.910
But in the course of going back he goes to
visit his father and really he is not visiting,

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:27.650
he is looking at his own memories.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:33.550
And so that forms most of the second half
of the book is Charles visiting his own childhood

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:39.940
and watching, sort of, his parents' marriage
dissolve and watching his father and himself,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:45.290
his younger self, build a time machine together
in the garage.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:54.621
So what happened is it was started as sort
of a father-son story and I was writing the

00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:58.960
father-son story sort of straight, without
any sort of science fictional aspect to it.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:06.290
And then I had sort of another file, I had
this story about a guy who wakes up every

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.240
day in a different universe.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.770
That story really wasn't going anywhere because
one, it's hard to make a story about a guy

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:19.560
who wakes up every day in a different universe
and two, it just didn't have any engine to

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.560
it.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.350
I couldn't figure out how to care about that
story and the father-son story was also not

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:35.900
going anywhere either because it was just
this sort of emotionally raw story about a

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:39.130
guy who really misses his father.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:44.970
It didn't, for some reason it didn't occur
to me for several months to combine the two

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:50.850
stories and then I had this sort of like chocolate
and peanut butter moment and I was like, "Oh,

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.180
I should just smash them together."

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:58.890
And partly it was just like "why not?", just
out of desperation and partly because once

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:05.020
I did it I realized 'Oh it's fun to write
about he emotional story through this sort

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.370
of fake technical language.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:15.350
And it's also sort of fun to write about this
universe where people and characters sort

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:24.540
of drift around and can be a kind of larger,
sort of, canvas for Charles' internal landscape.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:30.840
Which is, as you have probably gathered it
is, sort of, kind of just a melancholy place.

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:36.120
So that, sort of, some of the first things
I wrote that actually ended up staying in

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:45.060
the book are these bits of fake science because
for whatever reason it was more interesting

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.330
to me to write about this.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:54.940
Like taking the language of science and completely
distorting it and mangling it and using it

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.290
for, sort of, literary and emotional purposes.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:07.190
That, sort of, was the impulse behind writing
it, at first, and then it turned out to be

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:12.680
a pretty good vehicle to explore Charles'
relationship with his father.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.500
So that's sort of how the book came about.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:26.850
I don't know if there is anything in particular,
I guess, I don't know if there is anything

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:37.260
else you want me to talk about in particular.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:46.400
[pause]
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Actually, I read the book before

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.580
coming here and I thought it was great.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.770
&gt;&gt; Charles: Thanks
&gt;&gt; Male #1: So I am just curious, I know you

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.220
said you are a full-time lawyer, I’m wondering
if, I think the book did pretty well based

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.720
on the amount of press, it was on a Best Seller
list, so I am wondering like are you able

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.600
to make the transition to a writer or if you
wanted to and you're just holding back because

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.910
you didn't want to immerse yourself fully
in that world?

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:09.230
Or do you really have to sell like, you know,
a gazillion number of copies to really become

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.690
a writer full-time?

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.610
&gt;&gt; Charles: That’s a very interesting questions.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.910
Able, oh and thanks for reading it.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:24.720
[laughs] Able, is kind of relative term I
guess right for anybody.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:33.630
Well speaking to a room full of people that--
[laughs] So able for me is a relative term,

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:38.200
so I really like my job and I am not just
saying that cause it's going to be on the

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.200
internet forever.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.090
[audience laughter] I do, and I also think
that this book is about work.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:46.130
I mean, it's a big job obviously to be a time
machine repair man, as far as I know, it's

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.190
not a real job yet.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:55.070
But it's about sort of what it is like to
be a work and have a boss and have to balance

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:01.640
that with other things and I don't know that
I could get that if I were not working.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:07.770
I think I might, if I ever got to a place
where able was really like yes, there is no

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:12.840
question that I should pursue this full-time
then I think I would still miss that kind

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.930
of rhythm and interaction and just like the
conversation.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:25.010
You know what I mean, the talking to people
and absorbing how they talk and how I talk

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.210
to them and that sort of thing.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:31.960
I would have to then actually interact with
people voluntarily [laughs] which is harder

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.260
to do.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:41.450
I guess the short answer to your question
is I'm not really able to but I am not, and

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:49.580
this could just be me rationalizing it, I'm
not sure I would even if I were completely

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.280
able to.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:58.180
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Besides Star Wars, are there other
major Sci-Fi influences that sort of pushed

00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.190
you in this direction?

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.620
&gt;&gt; Charles: Another major one would be Isaac
Asimov's foundation books, all of which I

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.390
read in a very short period of time in my
teens.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:16.001
And [pause ] I don't know if you are familiar
with it but he invents psycho-history, which

00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:25.870
is a rigorous social science which can basically
predict the course of human history down to

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.680
individual levels, and also on large levels.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.770
I wasn't trying to anything nearly that ambitious
here but that was one of the fun things about

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.780
it, was making up something fake.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:41.040
And the faker the better so that people wouldn't
actually think "Oh this is supposed to--"you

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.280
know what I mean.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:49.080
Not using like some sort of form of physics
actually making up a literary science actually.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:56.100
That was one of the first things that sort
of got me going on writing this.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.600
&gt;&gt; Male #3: How you perceived something in
the book, for those who haven't read it I

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:06.610
won't spoil it, but he tells Phil probably
the cruelest thing you can, I've ever read.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.840
[laughter] I wonder, but it was OK because
Phil is what he is?

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.430
You couldn't do that to a real person and
get away with it and I'm wondering if that

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.950
was as significant to you as it was to me?

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:20.310
&gt;&gt; Charles: It was.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:25.480
I would probably be a very cruel person [laughs]
cause that was cruel.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:30.580
I was, I won't spoil it either, well maybe
I will spoil it because I guess otherwise

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.820
it is not going to make any sense, I will
just be talking.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:40.770
Phil is Charles Yu's boss and he is a software
program, but Phil doesn't know that he is

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:41.770
a software program.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:52.000
So Charles is a pretty nice guy and he doesn't
burst Phil's bubble, now that I think about

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.080
it I don't know if Phil has other employee's
or not.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.860
You would think that somebody would, [inaudible
audience] OK, thank-you, Phil's married.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.170
Phil also has a wife who is a spreadsheet
program.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:08.380
Phil is a program called Middle Manager 2.0
and he is a cool guy, he is the kind of boss,

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.510
and I apologize if there is any of this kind
of boss in this room, he is the kind of boss

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.520
that wants to pal around.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:21.260
He's like that boss, and like, he just loves
Charles, he loves hanging out with him, he

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.341
always wants to get a beer with Charles.

00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:29.310
Charles always has to say no because, you
know, for obvious reasons and so finally one

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:33.000
day Charles just was having a terrible day
and he was just like Phil, you know, just

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.880
kind of basically ruins Phil sort of whole
existence, right, because he tells him that

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.720
he is not a human.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:50.300
And I think that that's the reason why, it
was incredibly cruel yes, and I think the

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:56.100
reason why that was an important moment for
Charles was that he's living in this completely

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.590
self-absorbed place, right.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:03.890
He literally lives in a box and inside of
his own head and he doesn’t interact with

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:12.659
people anymore and he has to, that's a moment
where Charles remembers that you can still

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.990
hurt people.

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:19.909
But hurting people is a subset of interacting
with people, what he does still matters and

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:26.490
so it was a key moment for me that he had
to remember.

00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:32.800
Charles thinks being a lonely guy is not hurting
anyone, but it is because he is not using

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.030
his time to help people that he could be helping.

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:42.159
And also just ignoring people in his life
that are wondering what he has been up to.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:48.120
So yeah, it was intended to be cruel and to,
I have to say that if and when we get to the

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:53.000
point where software can have feelings, I
mean, I think it would be pretty cruel to

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.580
hurt their feelings, right.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:35:02.430
Maybe not, I don’t know [laughs], I was
just talking about this with somebody, if

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.930
you would do the same, if you actually had
software that thought it was human.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.610
I don't know, I wouldn't.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:14.380
Oh, I will let my software live in a bubble
of delusion if that's what makes it happy.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:27.970
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Why did you write a Charles Yu
that is so sad?

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:28.970
&gt;&gt; Charles: Um, that's a good question.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.150
I think sad is sort of my default mode for
writing.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:44.710
Not necessarily for being, but it's um, yeah,
for better or for worse, it is kind of like

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.010
my range – sad.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:52.280
[laughs] I got a couple of degrees of sad,
trying to expand that range.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:36:02.520
In this case though, this Charles Yu has lost
his father in time and so this book is about

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.640
memory and regret and how those things are
kind of tied up together.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:14.110
And so exploring the idea of a time machine
where you can go back but not change anything,

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:19.690
the sad is inextricably kind of in there.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:27.119
But I am trying to not make every protagonist
sad in the future [chuckles].

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:32.590
&gt;&gt; Male #4: inaudible
&gt;&gt; Charles: Yeah, I'm working on a collection

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:43.230
of short stories that some of which have some
sort of science fictional elements to them,

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:47.860
some of which don't.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:57.220
That's probably not that entertaining of a
description so maybe I should describe some

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.000
of those stories [laughs].

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.410
I guess the longest story in that book, which
has been published, is the story called "Standard

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:14.320
Loneliness Package" and it's a story about
a guy who works at an, basically this is a

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.810
world where you can outsource bad parts of
your life.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:26.640
So what you do, if you are rich in this world,
is you know that you like are going to go

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:32.460
to dentist so you, from eight to nine, so
you schedule with your emotional transference

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:39.560
broker that time and they will basically zap
out your consciousness.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:46.580
You get to either feel something pre-recorded
like that you would enjoy or something in

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.220
the past that you liked.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:55.560
And then during that time somebody else, in
this story it's in India, feels that for you.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.880
And so there is a bunch of people in cubicles
in India in these huge warehouses that basically

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:08.840
they have tickets and they pull a service
ticket and they, it's like, "Oh, dentist appointment"

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:12.890
"Oh, funeral" or some other bad experience.

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:26.910
So you feel that, or these emotional, sort
of, outsource workers feel the crappy experience

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:33.900
and it's sort of told from the point of view
of the workers on the bad end of things.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.380

&gt;&gt; Charles: [laughs] Yeah, I guess, I'm really

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:43.310
going to make a note to write something happy.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:48.260
I'm going to try really hard, I promise.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.790
Anybody else?

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:54.400
[Pause]
