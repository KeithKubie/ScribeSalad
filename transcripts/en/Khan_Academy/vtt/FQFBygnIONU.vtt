00:00:00.227 --> 00:00:01.187
- [Voiceover] What I
wanna do in this video

00:00:01.187 --> 00:00:03.732
is give ourselves a quick
overview of the different ways

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:06.147
that cells can communicate
with each other.

00:00:06.147 --> 00:00:07.733
And maybe the most basic one,

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:11.045
is just through direct contact

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:14.471
and this can happen
several different ways.

00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:15.463
One way could be,

00:00:15.463 --> 00:00:17.280
you just have neighboring cells

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.099
so this is one cell right over here,

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.973
and this is the neighboring
cell right over here.

00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:27.998
And they actually might have
gaps in their membranes.

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:29.355
If these are plants cells

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:32.331
we would call these gaps, gap junctions.

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:35.240
I just drew two of them
and this is obviously

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.732
just a two-dimensional slice.

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:37.801
So we're not fully appreciating

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.399
the three-dimensional structure,

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.013
but the basic idea is that
maybe the cell on the left

00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:44.345
starts producing some molecules,

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:45.761
especially some small molecules

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.576
that are able to go through
these gap junctions.

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.985
And when they're able to go
through the gap junctions,

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:53.864
maybe they latch on to some
proteins in the second cell

00:00:53.864 --> 00:00:56.719
that start maybe activating
them in a certain way,

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:57.938
or inhibit them in a certain way,

00:00:57.938 --> 00:00:59.644
or trigger some type of reaction.

00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:03.662
And so then you have a
response in the second cell.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.460
So this would be a form of communication.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.929
Something happened in this first cell

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:07.919
to produce these molecules.

00:01:07.919 --> 00:01:10.219
Those molecules were able
to get into the second cell,

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:11.777
and trigger a response.

00:01:11.777 --> 00:01:13.904
And as I mentioned, if
these are animal cells,

00:01:13.904 --> 00:01:15.759
we would call these gaps,

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.105
we'd call them gap junctions.

00:01:18.105 --> 00:01:20.101
So that right over there,

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.309
that is a gap junction.

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:26.569
And we covered this in other videos.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:27.978
And if we're talking about plant cells

00:01:27.978 --> 00:01:29.668
we can have very similar things happening,

00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:32.052
but we wouldn't call them gap junctions.

00:01:32.052 --> 00:01:33.566
These would be gaps,

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.997
not even tunnels through the membrane,

00:01:34.997 --> 00:01:36.727
it would also be through the cell walls.

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:37.956
If we were talking about plants,

00:01:37.956 --> 00:01:40.285
they would be plasmodesmata.

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:45.598
And we'd talk about these more

00:01:45.598 --> 00:01:47.894
in The Structure of Cell videos.

00:01:47.894 --> 00:01:49.612
But there is other ways
that you could communicate

00:01:49.612 --> 00:01:51.156
via direct contact.

00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:52.519
You could imagine maybe some cells

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:55.155
that are floating around
in the blood stream.

00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:58.062
Maybe this is one cell over here,

00:01:59.692 --> 00:02:02.191
maybe this is another cell over here.

00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.705
And they have complementary
surface proteins.

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:06.995
Surface proteins that are
able to bind to each other.

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:08.579
So maybe this one has a surface protein

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:09.700
that looks like this.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.137
I'm obviously exaggerating its shape,

00:02:12.137 --> 00:02:13.333
the protein wouldn't look exactly like

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.330
this inverted triangle.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.135
But this one has a
surface protein like this,

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:20.389
and I'm also exaggerating
it's size relative to a cell,

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:21.819
just so we can appreciate

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.790
how they could maybe lock together.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.916
So this one has a surface
protein like that.

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.413
And when they bind to each other

00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:30.371
it might change the proteins in some way,

00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:32.498
and then trigger a reaction
in each of these cells.

00:02:32.498 --> 00:02:34.032
That the communication then continues.

00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:36.052
If this protein changes a little bit,

00:02:36.052 --> 00:02:37.468
it might activate something.

00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:39.175
It might activate the
release of some molecules,

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.055
it might activate some other proteins,

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.191
it might catalyze some type of reaction.

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:45.234
We've seen this in multiple other videos,

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.127
all sorts of crazy biological reactions

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:48.450
can happen inside of cells.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.168
But it might illicit a,

00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:53.261
it could illicit a response.

00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:56.109
And actually it could even
illicit a response in both cells,

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.126
some type of response.

00:02:57.126 --> 00:03:01.505
They know that they are
latched-on to someone else.

00:03:02.155 --> 00:03:03.639
Now direct contact you could imagine,

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.037
is not the only way that you
could have cell-cell signaling.

00:03:07.037 --> 00:03:09.222
You could actually have
cells start to signal

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:10.859
over a little bit of a distance,

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.437
by releasing molecules into
the extracellular space

00:03:13.437 --> 00:03:15.920
and eventually even into the blood stream.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.792
So, for example,

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:23.052
let me draw a cell right over here,

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:27.290
and maybe it's able to
produce some molecules.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.913
And these molecules either,

00:03:29.913 --> 00:03:32.270
they might be lipid soluble
and maybe make their way

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.024
through the cellular
membrane on their own.

00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:38.290
Or, maybe they are packed in nice vesicles

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.129
that allow them to traverse the membrane.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:42.788
So when you get actually,

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.646
so the membrane of the vesicle

00:03:44.646 --> 00:03:47.942
merges with the membrane of the cell.

00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:50.120
And then it allows

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.713
these things to get out.

00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:55.321
And so you could imagine,

00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:58.055
if another cell has the
right receptors for these,

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:01.373
that would signal some type of a response

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:03.634
or it will form some
form of communication.

00:04:03.634 --> 00:04:05.621
So let's say that I have,

00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.438
actually let me draw a couple of cells.

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:09.832
So let's say I have this cell over here,

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:14.243
and then I have this cell over here.

00:04:14.243 --> 00:04:18.643
And let's say that this
cell has the right receptor,

00:04:21.623 --> 00:04:22.268
and this cell doesn't.

00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:23.487
It could have other receptors,

00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:26.217
maybe it has receptors like that

00:04:26.217 --> 00:04:27.484
but it's not the right receptor.

00:04:27.484 --> 00:04:30.721
And so these molecules that
were released by this first cell

00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:32.675
could bind not on this character,

00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:34.435
not on this surface protein,

00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:36.235
but it could bind on this character.

00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:38.708
So it could bind on this character

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:39.949
and when it does so,

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.899
this protein that's on
the cellular membrane,

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:45.069
it might change its shape,

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.276
it might do all sorts of things.

00:04:46.276 --> 00:04:49.515
But that signal can be then taken somehow,

00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:54.175
it can continue on into
the cell and once again,

00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:56.292
you might illicit some type of response.

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:58.075
And we'll go into more
detail in future videos

00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.422
on exactly how that happens,

00:04:59.422 --> 00:05:03.078
or what these responses actually might be.

00:05:03.078 --> 00:05:06.212
Now, if this is over a short distance,

00:05:07.962 --> 00:05:10.432
if this is a short distance,

00:05:15.826 --> 00:05:19.606
short distance,

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:21.809
we would call this paracrine.

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.191
This would be part of
the paracrine system,

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.209
or we would call this
paracrine communication.

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:28.777
Let me write that down,

00:05:28.777 --> 00:05:33.495
paracrine system,

00:05:34.163 --> 00:05:36.113
or paracrine communication,

00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:37.652
or paracrine signaling,

00:05:37.652 --> 00:05:40.211
and we would call these paracrine factors.

00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.549
But if it was happening
over long distances,

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:44.358
say maybe these molecules

00:05:44.358 --> 00:05:46.585
they enter into the blood stream,

00:05:46.585 --> 00:05:48.396
so they make their way
into the blood stream

00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:49.549
right over here.

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:52.969
So let me depict somehow that
this is the blood stream.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.553
So this is the blood stream,

00:05:58.273 --> 00:06:00.904
and they're able to go
through the blood stream

00:06:00.904 --> 00:06:04.753
over longer distances to other molecules.

00:06:06.023 --> 00:06:09.089
So maybe this one has the right receptors

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:14.089
for those molecules.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.574
Then we'd call this the endocrine system,

00:06:16.574 --> 00:06:18.450
or this is endocrine signaling.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.918
So long distances,

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.095
we would call this the endocrine system,

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.524
or endocrine signaling.

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:34.866
And we're talking about
the endocrine system

00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:36.720
and endocrine signaling,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.097
these molecules which could just be,

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:41.227
there could be all sorts of
different types of molecules.

00:06:41.227 --> 00:06:42.366
They could be steroids,

00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:44.368
they could be proteins of some kind.

00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:48.007
In this case, we would call them hormones.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.481
And you've probably heard the word before

00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:52.477
and we will do a whole
series of videos on hormones.

00:06:52.477 --> 00:06:54.567
But these molecules
actually could even affect

00:06:54.567 --> 00:06:56.563
the cell that produced them.

00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:58.178
For example, the cell that produced it

00:06:58.178 --> 00:07:00.373
might have the right receptor.

00:07:02.373 --> 00:07:04.183
And so, if it's able to signal,

00:07:04.183 --> 00:07:06.972
if it's able to trigger
a reaction in itself,

00:07:06.972 --> 00:07:09.786
so if these things are able to
trigger a reaction in itself,

00:07:09.786 --> 00:07:12.628
we would call that an autocrine process.

00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:16.310
It is acting on itself.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.373
And just so you're familiar
with some of the terminology,

00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:21.368
these proteins on the surface,

00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:24.673
and this would be the case
especially if you have

00:07:24.673 --> 00:07:29.231
non-lipid soluble types
of signaling factors,

00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:30.377
or molecules right over here.

00:07:30.377 --> 00:07:32.760
These proteins, actually even
if they're on the surface

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.920
or even if they're within the cell,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.801
we would call them receptors.

00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:37.050
So that right over there,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.973
that is a receptor.

00:07:41.966 --> 00:07:43.156
And the molecules themselves,

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:45.259
these things that bind on to the receptor,

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:47.592
we call them the ligand.

00:07:48.329 --> 00:07:50.411
In general, it's the
general term for something

00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:52.518
that binds on to a receptor.

00:07:52.518 --> 00:07:55.179
And so at that point where
you bind on to a receptor,

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:57.486
whether you're talking
about the paracrine process

00:07:57.486 --> 00:07:58.935
or endocrine,

00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:02.244
actually endo, I left a C out here,

00:08:02.244 --> 00:08:05.068
endocrine signaling,

00:08:05.068 --> 00:08:08.763
this process where it latches on,

00:08:08.763 --> 00:08:11.101
we would call that a signal perception.

00:08:11.101 --> 00:08:14.894
And then when this protein
somehow changes its shape,

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:16.558
or starts catalyzing a reaction,

00:08:16.558 --> 00:08:18.631
or inhibiting a reaction,

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:21.684
we would call this the
signal transduction.

00:08:24.255 --> 00:08:26.984
It's bringing the signal into the cell.

00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:28.833
And then you have,

00:08:30.723 --> 00:08:34.087
you have your actual cellular response.

00:08:34.087 --> 00:08:35.357
So hopefully you appreciate that

00:08:35.357 --> 00:08:37.513
as just a bit of an overview

00:08:37.513 --> 00:08:40.417

00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:43.860
