00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.497
So whether we're trying to write that one number is less than another number or

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:08.568
that one number is greater than another number, the bigger side of this

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:13.030
inequality sign is next to the larger number. Thinking about how we use this

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.702
symbol, which of these statements is mathematically correct? There may be more

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:19.047
than one right answer.
