batteries but not yet nanotechnology is
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.490
batteries but not yet nanotechnology is
still in its infancy so we just have to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
still in its infancy so we just have to
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200
still in its infancy so we just have to
get used to the fact that gasoline is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
get used to the fact that gasoline is
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.350
get used to the fact that gasoline is
still very efficient
