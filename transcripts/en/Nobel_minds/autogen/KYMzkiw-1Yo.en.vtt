have had wonderful ideas where we talked

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799
have had wonderful ideas where we talked

together I would suggest something I

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479
together I would suggest something I
 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.480
together I would suggest something I
tell them for us to just walk around the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490
tell them for us to just walk around the
 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.399
tell them for us to just walk around the
lab and to speak to people and see what

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409
lab and to speak to people and see what
 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.840
lab and to speak to people and see what
projects really interest them at one

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850
projects really interest them at one
 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.429
projects really interest them at one
point I would make is I encourage

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439
point I would make is I encourage
 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.719
point I would make is I encourage
students to tackle important problems

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729
students to tackle important problems
 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.219
students to tackle important problems
because I think once you've sensed what

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229
because I think once you've sensed what
 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.349
because I think once you've sensed what
it's like to really solve something

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359
it's like to really solve something
 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.760

wonderful you become addicted the

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770
wonderful you become addicted the
 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.770
wonderful you become addicted the
satisfaction of doing something which is

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780
satisfaction of doing something which is
 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.770
satisfaction of doing something which is
novel and which is important this is

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780
novel and which is important this is
 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.139
novel and which is important this is
very very satisfying so how is a young

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149
very very satisfying so how is a young
 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.880
very very satisfying so how is a young
person do you spot an important problem

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890
person do you spot an important problem
 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.010
person do you spot an important problem
because it presumably yes it with them

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020
because it presumably yes it with them
 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.380
because it presumably yes it with them
and you help them that's how I can be

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390
and you help them that's how I can be
 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.270
and you help them that's how I can be
useful I can tell them this is not

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280
useful I can tell them this is not
 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.580
useful I can tell them this is not
interesting this is it's a question of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590
interesting this is it's a question of
 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.210
interesting this is it's a question of
taste you help them develop taste
