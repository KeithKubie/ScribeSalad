00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:01.931
For those of you who are curious

00:00:01.931 --> 00:00:03.996
and have a little bit of
a background in calculus,

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:05.633
I thought I would do a very optional and

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:07.471
when I say it's optional,
you don't have to

00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:09.310
understand this in order
to progress with the

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.383
economics playlist, but
a very optional proof

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:14.136
showing you that in general,

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:17.689
the slope of the marginal
revenue curve for a monopolist is

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.272
twice the slope of the demand curve,

00:00:20.272 --> 00:00:21.871
assuming that the demand curve is a line.

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:25.270
So if the demand curve looks
like that, this is price.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.755
This is quantity. That is
demand right over there.

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:30.737
I'm going to show that
the marginal revenue curve

00:00:30.737 --> 00:00:33.936
has twice the slope. It
is twice as steep as this.

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:36.070
It's really twice the negative slope.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.069
So let me just write price
as a function of quantity.

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:41.737
We know we get price.

00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:44.120
Since this is a line, we
can essentially write it in

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.471
our traditional slope y-intercept form.

00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.604
In algebra class, you would write

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:49.995
if this was y and this was x,

00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:53.312
you would write y = mx+b

00:00:53.312 --> 00:00:56.154
where m is the slope and
b is the y-intercept.

00:00:56.154 --> 00:00:58.602
I'll do something very
similar, but instead of y and x

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:00.308
we have P and Q.

00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:05.767
So, if P = m x Q where m is the slope

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:10.320
plus ... plus the P-intercept + b.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.870
So this right over here is b

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.109
and if you were to ...
If you were to take your,

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.029
If you were to take your change in P,

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:19.855
if you were to take your change in P

00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:23.870
and divide it by your change
in Q ... your change in Q,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.283
you would get m. That is your slope,

00:01:26.283 --> 00:01:30.336
change in P / change in Q.

00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:33.337
Now what is going to be our total revenue?

00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:35.338
And this is kind of ... We're
just kind of almost doing

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:36.957
what we've done in the last few videos,

00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:38.988
but we're doing it in general terms.

00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:40.903
So if this is total revenue,

00:01:40.903 --> 00:01:43.486
total revenue as a function of quantity.

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:46.070
Well, total revenue is
just price x quantity.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.069
Total revenue is just price x quantity.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.070
We've already written ... We've
already written price as a

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.154
function of quantity right over
here, so we could take that

00:01:55.154 --> 00:01:58.737
and substitute it ... and
substitute it in right over there.

00:01:58.737 --> 00:02:03.272
So we get total revenue is equal
to and I'll write it all in blue.

00:02:03.272 --> 00:02:09.569
We have mQ + b and then we're
going to multiply that x Q.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.336
We're going to multiply that x Q or we get

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:16.203
total revenue = mQ^2.

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:20.871
mQ^2 + b x Q

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.177
And this is a parabola and
it's actually going to be a

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:24.675
downward sloping parabola because

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:26.080
m is going to be negative.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.486
This is downward sloping.

00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:30.387
m has a negative slope, so m is negative.

00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:34.336
So we know ... We know
that M &lt; 0 over here.

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:35.737
That's one of the assumptions we'll make.

00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:40.203
If m &lt; 0, this is going to be
a downward opening parabola.

00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:41.936
Total revenue will look something,

00:02:41.936 --> 00:02:45.320
total revenue will look
something like that.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.902
That is our total revenue.

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:50.070
Now, the marginal revenue
as a function of quantity is

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.487
just the derivative and
this is the calculus part.

00:02:52.487 --> 00:02:54.986
It's the slope of the tangent
line at any given point

00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:57.338
and that is what the derivative is.

00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:00.669
It's the slope of the tangent
line at any point as a function

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.238
as a function of quantity.
So you give me a quantity,

00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:06.902
I will tell you what the slope
of the tangent line of the

00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:09.154
total revenue function is at that point.

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:11.003
So we essentially just have
to take the derivative of this

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.202
with respect to Q.

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:18.149
So we get D, TR/DQ.

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.736
So how much does total revenue
change with a very, very

00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:25.569
small change in quantity,
infinitely small, infinitesimal

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.152
change in quantity and this
comes straight out of calculus.

00:03:29.152 --> 00:03:33.471
m is a constant. Q^2, the
derivative of Q^2 with respect

00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:38.153
to Q is 2Q. So it's going
to be 2Q x the constant.

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:42.336
So it's going to be 2m ... 2mQ.

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:46.604
And then b is a constant.
We're assuming it's given.

00:03:46.604 --> 00:03:47.902
b is a constant.

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:53.336
The derivative of bQ with respect
to Q is just going to be b.

00:03:53.336 --> 00:03:55.205
It's just going to be b.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:58.668
And so right over here, this
is our marginal revenue curve.

00:03:58.668 --> 00:04:00.737
or I should say our marginal line.

00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:03.737
It is 2mQ + b.

00:04:03.737 --> 00:04:08.071
So notice, it has the same
y-intercept as our demand curve

00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:10.806
so definitely starts right over there,

00:04:10.806 --> 00:04:12.669
but it has twice the slope.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.652
The slope of our demand curve is m.

00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:19.486
The slope of our marginal
revenue curve is 2m, is 2m

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:22.119
and this is a negative slope, so
this will be twice as negative.

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:24.153
So it will look something like this.

00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:27.236
It will look something
like this, just like that.

00:04:27.236 --> 00:04:29.070
So no matter what your demand curve is,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.402
if you assume it's a line like this,

00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:35.869
the marginal revenue curve
will be a line with twice the

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:38.153
slope and in this case, it's
twice the negative slope which

00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:40.337
is kind of ... what's
going to be generally true.

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:42.537
Anyway, if you understood that, great.

00:04:42.537 --> 00:04:44.936
You now feel good that this
is always the case for a

00:04:44.936 --> 00:04:46.736
linear demand curve like this.

00:04:46.736 --> 00:04:48.319
If you did not understand it, don't worry.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.142
You can proceed with
the economics playlist.

00:04:50.142 --> 23:59:59.999
You don't need to know
calculus for this playlist.
