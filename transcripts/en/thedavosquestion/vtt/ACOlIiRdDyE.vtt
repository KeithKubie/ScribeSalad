ANDY STERN &gt;&gt; Obviously people need a code

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.930
of ethics, but we need to appreciate that
right now there are four thousand companies

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.219
that have signed on to the U.N. guidelines;
every single major corporation has ethics

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.309
and values statements that their Board of
Directors sign. The signing statements is

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.240
not an indication of compliance. The rules
aren't self-regulating so to let corporate

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.730
executives off the hook by simply signing
a piece of paper is more about changing image

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.430
than changing reality. And only when they're
accountable, only when we deal with toxic

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.820
assets in the same way we deal with toxic
products which is prosecute people who abuse

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.060
their values and their authority will be we
be able to make the kind of changes we need.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.140
So I totally believe in a code of ethics but
it has to be accountable, responsible and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.760
enforced by everyone outside the corporation,
by governments and independent third parties.
