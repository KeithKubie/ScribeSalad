00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:03.591
(clicking sound)

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:07.849
(piano music)

00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:12.402
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:13.628
Bipedal.

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:14.807
Naked.

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:15.807
Large brain.

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:21.694
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:25.111
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.233
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:31.316
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.517 --> 00:00:34.017
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:37.467
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.550
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.926 --> 00:00:43.849
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:44.849
of the past.

00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:50.265
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.265 --> 00:00:53.036
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:54.703
and how we got here.

00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:59.048
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:00.715
of humans, like you.

00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:18.030
(electronic music)

00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:23.488
(driving music)

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.636
I wanna thank the
organizers for inviting me

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:40.941
and for providing this
incredible opportunity

00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:43.691
for all of us to be
together and to imagine.

00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:45.957
It is the human capacity
to move between the worlds

00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:48.614
of what is and what could
be that marks the emergence

00:01:48.614 --> 00:01:51.017
of a particular evolutionary context

00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:55.024
and history for the
genus Homo, us, humans.

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:57.132
I argue that it's the
human capacity to imagine,

00:01:57.132 --> 00:01:59.404
to be creative, to hope, and to dream,

00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:01.276
to infuse the world with meanings

00:02:01.276 --> 00:02:04.185
and to cast our inspirations far and wide.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:07.548
Limited neither by personal
experience nor material reality,

00:02:07.548 --> 00:02:10.268
it has enabled our
lineage, the genus Homo,

00:02:10.268 --> 00:02:11.866
to develop a particular niche,

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:14.191
a particular way of being in the world,

00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:16.806
where imagination plays a central role.

00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:18.030
Humans are very creative,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.091
and we use our imagination to be so.

00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:23.578
This has an evolutionary history.

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:26.941
The real challenge to understanding
human evolution, then,

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.471
is not just the tracing
of the bones and stones

00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:33.641
of the 2.6 million year
history of our genus.

00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:37.546
Instead it is understanding those changes

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:39.379
alongside the reality.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.867
There are lineages that went

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:45.290
from the makers of basic stone tools

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.191
to the creators of amazing cave art

00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:51.274
to the constructors of massive cities

00:02:53.094 --> 00:02:56.573
and the dominant force
shaping the ecosystem today.

00:02:56.573 --> 00:02:58.380
Our lineage's transition from a cluster

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.213
of medium-sized, fangless,
hornless, clawless,

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.951
semi-naked, or fully
naked, ape-like things

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:09.638
with a few rocks and some sticks

00:03:09.638 --> 00:03:11.831
to a species who invented domestication,

00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:16.345
economies, cities, nations,
religion, warfare, and peace.

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:19.945
That is the challenge of
understanding human evolution.

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:21.853
Now, let me put human in context here

00:03:21.853 --> 00:03:23.986
before you think I'm talking only

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:25.759
about human exceptionalism, that is,

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:29.185
we know that there are many
other species that use tools,

00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:31.630
that have incredibly complex social lives,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.460
that use sound as communication traveling

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.303
across incredible distance,

00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:38.639
and that have cultural varieties

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.433
that actually impact the ways
in which their genomes shift.

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:44.727
Here's an example of hunting patterns

00:03:44.727 --> 00:03:48.867
across latitudinal variations in orca pods

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:50.303
that has actually had a huge change

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:52.382
in their structure of their genomes.

00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:55.407
So gene culture co-evolution
doesn't just occur in humans,

00:03:55.407 --> 00:03:57.683
it occurs in many organisms.

00:03:57.683 --> 00:04:01.766
However, we have studied
other complex organisms,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.702
like chimpanzees and whales and orcas,

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:08.120
for a long time, and we know
a lot about what they do

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.789
and what they don't do.

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.517
We know that chimpanzees
don't have cash economies,

00:04:12.517 --> 00:04:15.820
governments, religious
institutions, creeds, or fanatics.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.791
They don't arrest and deport each other,

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.744
and they don't create massive economies

00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:22.145
of material and social inequality.

00:04:22.145 --> 00:04:24.035
They don't change planet wide ecosystems,

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:25.726
build cities, make airplanes,

00:04:25.726 --> 00:04:28.436
drive thousands of other
species to extinction,

00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:30.320
or give CARTA talks.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.225
(laughter)

00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:33.058
But we do.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.860
We are a particular mammal,
a particular primate,

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.204
and a particular hominoid kind of ape

00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:42.172
that is able to look
at the world around us

00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:43.942
and see it as it is,

00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:46.286
imagine entirely new possibilities,

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:50.712
and convert those imaginings
into material reality.

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:53.040
We have evolved the most compassionate,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.575
the cruelest, the most creative,
and the most destructive

00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:58.098
of all life on this planet.

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:00.252
And we demonstrate these abilities often.

00:05:00.252 --> 00:05:04.106
How this difference came to be matters.

00:05:04.106 --> 00:05:05.921
And it is by delving into humanity's

00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:07.618
very distinctive history

00:05:07.618 --> 00:05:12.368
that we are able to understand
why we are the way we are.

00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:15.512
There's incredibly good evidence

00:05:15.512 --> 00:05:17.666
that over the last 2 million years,

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:19.184
the members of the genus Homo,

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:21.063
all of those things that
have something to do

00:05:21.063 --> 00:05:22.740
with our specific ancestry,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.555
underwent significant in
their brains, their bodies,

00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:27.528
their behavior, and they
created a new niche,

00:05:27.528 --> 00:05:31.211
a new way of existing, both
ecologically and socially

00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:32.115
in the world.

00:05:32.115 --> 00:05:33.189
This is a human niche

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.022
and this niche involves
a particular evolution

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.666
of something called a human imagination.

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.443
Human imagination, I would like to argue,

00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:44.907
is as important as the bones and stones

00:05:44.907 --> 00:05:47.212
in understanding the
processes and patterns

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.608
of human evolution.

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:51.871
Alright, here is a
summary of a whole bunch

00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:53.224
of interesting things that have happened

00:05:53.224 --> 00:05:55.953
over the last 2 million
years to our lineage.

00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:57.504
What I want to point out here,

00:05:57.504 --> 00:05:59.316
and I'll provide some specific examples,

00:05:59.316 --> 00:06:02.408
is that this is not just about linear,

00:06:02.408 --> 00:06:05.578
even though it's a line, linear evolution.

00:06:05.578 --> 00:06:09.243
This is about the changing
relation between individuals,

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:11.450
between individuals
and the material world,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.099
between individuals, the material world,

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.614
and their cognitive interpretation
of that material world,

00:06:15.614 --> 00:06:19.055
and that cycle getting
more and more dense.

00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:20.222
As we changed,

00:06:21.092 --> 00:06:22.514
as we changed the world around us,

00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:24.207
as we changed one another,

00:06:24.207 --> 00:06:26.063
we began an intricate dance,

00:06:26.063 --> 00:06:28.313
which is culminating today,

00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:31.487
and hopefully will
continue into the future.

00:06:31.487 --> 00:06:34.610
So rather than talk about
this shifting in crania

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.443
or other morphologies,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.506
let's spend a little time with a few

00:06:39.506 --> 00:06:41.254
of the pieces of evidence we have

00:06:41.254 --> 00:06:43.129
of our evolutionary history that talk

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:44.998
about this incredible dynamic,

00:06:44.998 --> 00:06:47.382
this feedback between
the material, the social,

00:06:47.382 --> 00:06:51.830
the cognitive, and our
evolutionary histories.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.710
So we know that significant
dietary changes happened

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.907
fairly early on in our history,

00:06:58.907 --> 00:07:02.675
but those significant
dietary changes enabled,

00:07:02.675 --> 00:07:04.569
for example, our brains to get much larger

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:05.835
and a variety of other things.

00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:08.169
However, we sometimes forget

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.325
that those significant dietary changes

00:07:10.325 --> 00:07:14.028
are really associated
with the use of tools.

00:07:14.028 --> 00:07:17.189
Now, I'm gonna show you some tools here.

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:21.222
This is, up here in
your upper left corner,

00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:22.476
this is an Oldowan tool.

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:23.926
It's about 1.8 million years old.

00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:26.244
I'm sure none of you are impressed.

00:07:26.244 --> 00:07:28.171
It is a rock with some sharp edges.

00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:29.671
But you should be.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.799
Nothing else in the
history of this planet,

00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:34.161
aside from our lineage,

00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:37.783
has ever had the capacity to take a stone,

00:07:37.783 --> 00:07:39.142
to look at that stone,

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:41.735
and to imagine something
else inside that stone,

00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:44.220
to talk another object and work it

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.934
on that initial stone to create
something anew from inside.

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:50.300
That's fairly impressive.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.722
And we know how difficult
some of these processes are.

00:07:53.722 --> 00:07:57.538
If you look at the next illustration here,

00:07:57.538 --> 00:08:00.236
you will notice that this
is actually a reconstruction

00:08:00.236 --> 00:08:03.280
of all of the mapping
of a stone tool, right?

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.038
So what we actually do is you go in

00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:06.933
and you get the detritus, the debris,

00:08:06.933 --> 00:08:08.050
and you piece it back together.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.587
So you can look at every single strike.

00:08:10.587 --> 00:08:12.144
Now, when I say we, I
mean the graduate students

00:08:12.144 --> 00:08:15.609
that actually did the
work, not the professors.

00:08:15.609 --> 00:08:17.806
But what you then know is you can see

00:08:17.806 --> 00:08:19.956
that the individual stone tool maker,

00:08:19.956 --> 00:08:22.053
even for these fairly old stone tools,

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:25.473
here we're getting into the
Acheulean stone tool industry,

00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:27.542
looking something a bit more like this,

00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:29.191
what we can see is that you take it,

00:08:29.191 --> 00:08:31.313
you have the platform, you
look at it, you strike it,

00:08:31.313 --> 00:08:33.987
you've totally, radically
altered the whole shape.

00:08:33.987 --> 00:08:35.929
You now have to reimagine
the entire thing,

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:37.311
hit it in the next place,
hit it in the next place,

00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:39.208
and when we construct those together,

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:40.551
it is unbelievably difficult.

00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:44.421
It takes a student today months to learn

00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:45.944
how to be a good stone tool maker.

00:08:45.944 --> 00:08:48.043
And that is with video training,

00:08:48.043 --> 00:08:49.748
with the rocks already brought to you,

00:08:49.748 --> 00:08:51.358
and without any large
predators trying to eat you

00:08:51.358 --> 00:08:53.275
while you do your work.

00:08:54.253 --> 00:08:58.348
We can underestimate
how important this was.

00:08:58.348 --> 00:08:59.991
Think about what I just said.

00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:03.453
Not all stones are equally
good for making stone tools.

00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:05.025
So, to make stone tools,
even the most basic ones,

00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:06.514
you have to be able to find decent stones

00:09:06.514 --> 00:09:07.913
and replicate that finding.

00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:09.488
You have to go back and
get them again and again.

00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:10.796
Then you have to carry,
I don't know how many

00:09:10.796 --> 00:09:13.469
of you carry regularly 20 or
30 kilos of stones with you,

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:15.478
but that's a lot of work.

00:09:15.478 --> 00:09:17.645
Dispersing that socially
is very important.

00:09:17.645 --> 00:09:19.184
Then you have to make stone tools

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:22.226
in an environment that is
packed with very large things

00:09:22.226 --> 00:09:24.116
with large teeth that want to eat you,

00:09:24.116 --> 00:09:25.801
and remember, you're very small, naked,

00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:28.940
and you've got some rocks
and some few sticks.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.765
When you make stone tools,
it makes a lot of noise,

00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:33.569
so you've got everything
stacked against you.

00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:35.543
How did our ancestors figure this out?

00:09:35.543 --> 00:09:36.753
How did they work through it?

00:09:36.753 --> 00:09:39.989
Imagination, collaboration, cooperation,

00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:41.863
really focusing in on the social,

00:09:41.863 --> 00:09:44.186
but really interestingly, current work,

00:09:44.186 --> 00:09:47.753
looking at what it means
to make stone tools,

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:50.513
by Dietrich Stout and a
number of other groups,

00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:54.943
have demonstrated that when
you make these stone tools,

00:09:54.943 --> 00:09:58.443
certain areas of neuro-biological activity

00:10:00.163 --> 00:10:03.752
are accentuated and there's
some corollary patterns.

00:10:03.752 --> 00:10:05.101
Now, what are these areas,

00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:06.819
and frequently these are areas associated

00:10:06.819 --> 00:10:09.665
with higher functioning and memory,

00:10:09.665 --> 00:10:12.538
with planning and, interestingly enough,

00:10:12.538 --> 00:10:13.928
with language.

00:10:13.928 --> 00:10:15.573
But wait, don't order yet,

00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:16.939
because it's not just
the making stones tools

00:10:16.939 --> 00:10:18.889
that does these things in your brain,

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:22.139
which probably means
they have a deep ancestry

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:23.253
for doing that,

00:10:23.253 --> 00:10:27.253
but also if you are
watching a stone tool maker,

00:10:28.202 --> 00:10:31.095
you mirror some of those functions.

00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:33.221
And here is the critical component

00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:36.394
of stone tools: it's not
about the tools themselves,

00:10:36.394 --> 00:10:37.971
it's about the social context

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:40.888
in which they were made and used.

00:10:40.888 --> 00:10:42.335
We can debate whether or not

00:10:42.335 --> 00:10:45.040
teaching occurred 1.5 million years ago.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.555
What we can't debate is
these complex stone tools

00:10:47.555 --> 00:10:48.934
were made at 1.5,

00:10:48.934 --> 00:10:51.289
one million, five hundred
thousand years ago,

00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:56.042
that you or I could not make
without being instructed.

00:10:56.042 --> 00:10:57.116
Was there language?

00:10:57.116 --> 00:10:58.540
I don't think so.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.409
But there was a broad bandwidth

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:02.471
of highly dense information transfer

00:11:02.471 --> 00:11:06.493
that was social and it was imaginative.

00:11:06.493 --> 00:11:08.084
Now around this time period,

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:10.309
and between about 1.5
and a million years ago,

00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:12.561
as I pointed out, that niche is constantly

00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:15.815
sort of augmenting as more ways

00:11:15.815 --> 00:11:17.330
of dealing with the world occur,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.316
that density and those feedbacks continue

00:11:19.316 --> 00:11:23.228
to shape our bodies, our
lives, our cognition.

00:11:23.228 --> 00:11:26.279
We know that by about
half a million years ago,

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.710
give or take 50 thousand years,

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.488
I like to work in big numbers,

00:11:30.488 --> 00:11:33.765
we had an incredible
capacity to collaborate

00:11:33.765 --> 00:11:36.224
in ways that seem to
exceed the collaboration

00:11:36.224 --> 00:11:37.602
of many other organisms.

00:11:37.602 --> 00:11:40.505
We had incredibly complex,
cooperative parenting

00:11:40.505 --> 00:11:44.479
where males and young were
also caring for offspring,

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:47.669
we had a pattern of the
whole communities responding

00:11:47.669 --> 00:11:50.813
to environmental pressures,
not just individuals,

00:11:50.813 --> 00:11:55.063
and we had evidence of
augmentation and enhancement

00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:58.948
in our imaginative capabilities.

00:11:58.948 --> 00:12:00.564
For example, and we'll hear more

00:12:00.564 --> 00:12:03.541
about this later today, fire.

00:12:03.541 --> 00:12:05.800
We heard about it already
in the previous talk.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.536
People underestimate fire all the time.

00:12:07.536 --> 00:12:10.077
Yes, fire is wonderful
because it allows us access

00:12:10.077 --> 00:12:11.963
to nutrients that we
wouldn't have otherwise

00:12:11.963 --> 00:12:12.796
by heating food.

00:12:12.796 --> 00:12:15.245
It also allows us to
modify stones and wood

00:12:15.245 --> 00:12:17.381
to alter their physical structure

00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:18.761
so that we can better use them.

00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:21.801
But more importantly, as
was already mentioned,

00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:23.801
fire turns night to day.

00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:29.248
Fire releases us from the
constraint of the sun.

00:12:29.248 --> 00:12:32.629
Fire enables an expansion
of the time we have

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:36.931
to be together, to think
together, to imagine together.

00:12:36.931 --> 00:12:39.009
But it's not just evidence of fire,

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:43.369
which maybe goes back as far
as 1.6 million years ago.

00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:46.288
We have glimmerings, elements,

00:12:46.288 --> 00:12:47.121
but it really isn't until

00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:48.622
about four or five hundred
thousand years ago,

00:12:48.622 --> 00:12:49.455
three hundred thousand years ago,

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:52.780
that we start to see it
with increasing regularity.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.233
But it's not just fire, and really,

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:59.253
from my perspective, cool stone tools.

00:12:59.253 --> 00:13:03.062
Here's a nearly 300,000
year old clamshell from Java

00:13:03.062 --> 00:13:06.222
that, at some point,
something in the lineage Homo

00:13:06.222 --> 00:13:10.639
picked up, grabbed another
object, and doodled on it.

00:13:11.553 --> 00:13:12.386
Most people, just like

00:13:12.386 --> 00:13:14.104
that early Oldowan
stone tool I showed you,

00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:15.496
are not impressed by doodles.

00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:17.542
But you should be.

00:13:17.542 --> 00:13:19.041
Think what it means to doodle.

00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:20.626
Think what it means to take an object,

00:13:20.626 --> 00:13:22.869
to take another object,
and alter the surface

00:13:22.869 --> 00:13:25.036
to create a new sensation.

00:13:27.128 --> 00:13:29.623
We see this over the last three hundred,

00:13:29.623 --> 00:13:31.012
four hundred thousand years.

00:13:31.012 --> 00:13:32.753
We see glimmerings earlier,

00:13:32.753 --> 00:13:33.900
but it's really over this last three

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.322
to four hundred thousand years
that we start to see this

00:13:36.322 --> 00:13:37.739
with much higher density.

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:41.725
At that same time period, we
also have two very interesting,

00:13:41.725 --> 00:13:43.187
okay, not very many,

00:13:43.187 --> 00:13:44.492
but two very interesting events.

00:13:44.492 --> 00:13:46.446
Here at Atapuerca,
about 400,000 years ago,

00:13:46.446 --> 00:13:49.887
we have a number of
bodies found in one place,

00:13:49.887 --> 00:13:50.973
a deep pit.

00:13:50.973 --> 00:13:52.689
In that deep pit are a couple cave bears

00:13:52.689 --> 00:13:53.731
that look like they fell in,

00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:54.564
and a bunch of other things

00:13:54.564 --> 00:13:56.256
that have been gnawing on the bones,

00:13:56.256 --> 00:13:59.024
but nothing else except
for, as you can see here,

00:13:59.024 --> 00:14:02.412
this beautiful hand ax, about this big.

00:14:02.412 --> 00:14:05.741
It's made from a stone that is not local.

00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:06.716
And it is gorgeous.

00:14:06.716 --> 00:14:10.049
It was carved and thrown in, never used.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:11.986
What does that mean?

00:14:11.986 --> 00:14:14.651
We won't ever know, but I
bet it had something to do

00:14:14.651 --> 00:14:17.541
with the imagination and
the creativity and meaning

00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:20.181
for that group of people.

00:14:20.181 --> 00:14:23.389
And more recently, about, say,
between two hundred thousand

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:24.639
and three hundred thousand years ago,

00:14:24.639 --> 00:14:29.064
we have another evidence of
possible movement of bodies

00:14:29.064 --> 00:14:30.955
into an underground cave.

00:14:30.955 --> 00:14:32.485
People debate whether it's burial or not,

00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:34.944
I don't wanna get into that debate.

00:14:34.944 --> 00:14:36.452
But I do want to point out

00:14:36.452 --> 00:14:38.638
that we have glimmerings earlier on,

00:14:38.638 --> 00:14:43.261
but all of these things, burials,
art, creative imaginings,

00:14:43.261 --> 00:14:45.187
incredible manipulation of the world,

00:14:45.187 --> 00:14:47.510
all has a deep evolutionary history

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.505
and didn't just show up
when our species shows up

00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:52.337
'cause everything I've just showed you

00:14:52.337 --> 00:14:54.837
predates homo sapiens sapiens.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.635
But by the last 30, 50
thousand years or so,

00:15:01.635 --> 00:15:03.724
we find clear examples of identity,

00:15:03.724 --> 00:15:06.718
clear examples of
individuals taking items,

00:15:06.718 --> 00:15:09.722
reshaping them to create
a completely new reality,

00:15:09.722 --> 00:15:12.208
a new imagination, a new
way to be in the world,

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:14.434
and it is my, and many other's, arguments

00:15:14.434 --> 00:15:15.770
that this new way to be in the world,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.218
these new senses of identity,

00:15:17.218 --> 00:15:19.438
this new deployment of imagination,

00:15:19.438 --> 00:15:22.478
had a huge impact on those feedback loops

00:15:22.478 --> 00:15:24.287
between our ecology,
between the materials,

00:15:24.287 --> 00:15:26.073
between our bodies, between our cognition,

00:15:26.073 --> 00:15:28.240
and between our societies.

00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:32.787
So the human niche is, of course,

00:15:32.787 --> 00:15:35.585
centrally located and focused.

00:15:35.585 --> 00:15:37.077
Our studies of understanding
human evolution

00:15:37.077 --> 00:15:38.937
has to be about our brain and our DNA

00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:40.281
and our morphology and our bodies,

00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:42.902
but it also has to be about
all of the different ecologies

00:15:42.902 --> 00:15:45.272
that humans have spread
across the entire planet,

00:15:45.272 --> 00:15:47.497
so it's our brains, our
bodies, our ecologies,

00:15:47.497 --> 00:15:50.502
and, and you already all know this,

00:15:50.502 --> 00:15:52.394
our perceptual realities.

00:15:52.394 --> 00:15:53.407
The way we see the world,

00:15:53.407 --> 00:15:54.299
the way we think about the world,

00:15:54.299 --> 00:15:57.193
the way we feel the world is as important

00:15:57.193 --> 00:16:00.062
as our bones, our muscles, and our DNA

00:16:00.062 --> 00:16:02.204
because part of that
system, that feedback,

00:16:02.204 --> 00:16:05.239
that complex dynamic that is the human

00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:07.322
involves the imagination.

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:10.940
So the human niche includes creativity,

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.369
cooperation, and imagination.

00:16:12.369 --> 00:16:15.291
Meaning, especially making meaning,

00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:17.864
matters as an agent in the processes

00:16:17.864 --> 00:16:19.976
of our evolutionary histories.

00:16:19.976 --> 00:16:22.782
It is specifically feedback
systems between behaviors,

00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:25.036
ecologies, cognitive and bodily systems

00:16:25.036 --> 00:16:28.737
involved in teaching and
learning and meaning making,

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:30.644
communicating, that
facilitated a new niche

00:16:30.644 --> 00:16:31.848
that had huge impacts.

00:16:31.848 --> 00:16:34.304
For example, it set up our brains,

00:16:34.304 --> 00:16:35.415
it structured them in a way

00:16:35.415 --> 00:16:38.915
that Michael Arbib calls "language ready."

00:16:40.337 --> 00:16:42.289
You don't just get language.

00:16:42.289 --> 00:16:44.091
It has to evolve, and the cognitive

00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:45.804
and neuro biological
structures have to be there.

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:46.697
And part of that is this,

00:16:46.697 --> 00:16:48.888
we also have communities
of shared imagination,

00:16:48.888 --> 00:16:51.501
seeing these multiple, iterative events

00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:53.675
of meaning making across space and time

00:16:53.675 --> 00:16:56.432
shows that communities of humans,

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:57.515
and I'm using the term broadly

00:16:57.515 --> 00:17:00.328
because I don't necessarily
just mean homo sapiens,

00:17:00.328 --> 00:17:04.158
were capable of working
together to remake the world

00:17:04.158 --> 00:17:07.030
in their, and from their, imagination.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:08.950
So meaning making,
imagination, communication,

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.350
creativity and community are central.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:12.475
And that's my pitch.

00:17:12.475 --> 00:17:15.159
However, all of this stuff
sounds really positive

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.782
and really, really exciting.

00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:18.529
I would like to say
that our capacity to be

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:20.068
with one another, to share our minds,

00:17:20.068 --> 00:17:22.558
to imagine, to think
forward as a central part

00:17:22.558 --> 00:17:25.072
of our evolutionary niche also brings

00:17:25.072 --> 00:17:27.638
with it a few problems.

00:17:27.638 --> 00:17:30.080
Imagination made humans exceptional,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.560
but also potentially extremely dangerous.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.469
We have interconnected the world in a way

00:17:34.469 --> 00:17:37.088
that nothing on this planet has ever done,

00:17:37.088 --> 00:17:39.758
and through that
interconnection, we are reshaping

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.713
what the world actually looks like.

00:17:41.713 --> 00:17:44.082
Here's a global human density map.

00:17:44.082 --> 00:17:47.547
This is a better map than
most that you look at

00:17:47.547 --> 00:17:50.575
because this is the way we're
shaping the actual surface

00:17:50.575 --> 00:17:52.112
and functioning of the earth.

00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:54.963
We have imagined ourselves into a position

00:17:54.963 --> 00:17:57.905
where it is in the balance.

00:17:57.905 --> 00:18:01.506
Our ecologies, our
capacities, our creativities

00:18:01.506 --> 00:18:04.070
are nearing, they're
bringing us to the point

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.310
where decisions have to be
made and have to be imagined.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.730
We know today, for example,
in the United States,

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.280
we have systems of racism, mysogony,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.780
and inequality unknown before.

00:18:19.893 --> 00:18:22.216
So we need to understand
how our imagination

00:18:22.216 --> 00:18:25.281
and creativity has
gotten us to this state,

00:18:25.281 --> 00:18:29.448
always remembering that,
in fact, that imagination

00:18:30.389 --> 00:18:34.506
and creativity is the one thing
that can get us out of it.

00:18:34.506 --> 00:18:37.425
Being together with one
another, thinking together,

00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:40.479
creating, imagining, seeing
the world as the way it is,

00:18:40.479 --> 00:18:43.752
imagining other possibilities,
and at least trying

00:18:43.752 --> 00:18:44.995
to make them happen.

00:18:44.995 --> 00:18:47.806
That's what got humans
to where we are today.

00:18:47.806 --> 00:18:48.922
Thank you.

00:18:48.922 --> 00:18:51.922

00:18:54.057 --> 00:18:56.724
