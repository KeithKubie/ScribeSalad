[applause]

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.180
&gt;&gt;Liv Wu: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.180
[applause]

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.320
&gt;&gt;Liv Wu: Hi, everyone. I'm Liv Wu, Executive
Chef, and I'm excited and delighted that Mark

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.750
Hyman accepted our invitation to speak to
us as part of our Optimize Your Life, Health

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.490
Speaker Series.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.170
I first met Mark at a health conference and
was struck by-by this man's extraordinary

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:32.050
level of enthusiasm and energy. He talks fast.
And-and how just passionate he is about health

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.680
and well being.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.930
He tells a compelling story about finding
and living in ways that optimizes all our

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.460
systems and-and-and drive us to perform well
and feel well and thrive.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.690
I don't think I'll ever encounter the word
"ultra" again without thinking of-of Mark.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.130
He's kind of the ultra guy.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.900
[laughter]

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.579
The gains, the greatest gains in 90% of medicine
and longevity have been about cleaning up;

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.639
cleaning up the inner and outer environment.
And in the early 20th century it was about

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:12.749
clean water, basic sanitation, getting rid
of infections.

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:19.119
And so now at the dawn of the 21st century
we need to look at cleaning up again. From

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.930
processed, highly refined, chemicalized foods
we consume to the air we breathe, and-and

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.350
all the other toxicities that are, that are
part of our world.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.600
Mark combines his training in conventional
medicine with cutting edge genetics and nutrition,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.029
and tells us why and how we should clean up
within and without so that we can really perform

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:47.259
as ultra human beings.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.189
Mark is a four-time New York Times best-selling
author and Chairman of the Institute for Functional

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.810
Medicine which is a very exciting new field;
a real paradigm shift in-in medicine.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.990
He has dedicated his career to identifying
and addressing the root causes of chronic

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.340
illness through a groundbreaking whole systems
approach that he calls "functional medicine."

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.989
He is also Founder and Medical Director of
the UltraWellness Center. He advises Dr. Oz-Oz's

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.579
HealthCorps group and he is nominee to President
Obama's advisory group on prevention, health

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.970
promotion, and integrative and public health.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.970
Welcome, Mark.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.970
[applause]

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.120
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Thank you. Thank you.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.499
So as I was, I do talk fast so they-they told
me you were smart enough you could handle

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.180
it so I think it's, I should be okay.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.900
Now as I was getting my talk ready I realized
that Googlers know more about the future of

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.989
medicine than most doctors do. And they know
that because Google is very much like the

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:03.689
future of medicine. In medicine we have a
new model that's emerging we call P4 Medicine

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:11.849
which is personalized, it's predictive, it's
preventive, and it's participatory.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.980
In the same way of Google, it's very personalized.
You-you get to find out exactly what you're

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.870
looking for at the moment you're looking for
it.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.730
It's also predictive 'cause it predicts, what
Google is [inaudbile] exactly what you're

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.819
looking for and it allows you to identify
exactly what you wanna find at any moment.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.120
And it's also preventive 'cause it prevents
you from going down all sorts of roads looking

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.349
for data and information that isn't relevant
to you.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.730
And it's also participatory 'cause you have
to take action based on what you find and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.730
what you do.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.400
So Googlers actually have created a system
that models the future of medicine 'cause

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.780
the future of medicine is going to be personalized.
It's gonna look at your genetics, at your

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.900
environment and how those variations affect
your health in this moment.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.800
The future of medicine is taking the data
in your story which is called narrativomics

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.849
this, the data in your narrative, in your
story and making sense out of that and seeing

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.370
the patterns in that.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.710
The future of medicine is about genomics and
all the omics: the proteomics, metabolomics,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.549
the phenomics, which is really looking for
the patterns in the data which is exactly

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.400
what you do here.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.390
And it's also preventive because we're going
to be able to understand how to best look

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.810
at a health map on a predictive model by looking
at all the data points in your story and in

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.170
your file markers, and tracking that forward
to see what your health risks are and how

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.540
to create a personalized plan to help you
get healthy and stay healthy.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.870
And it's also participatory 'cause it means
you need to be engaged. It's not just taking

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.240
a pill that your doctor gives you because
you're gonna treat some symptom of some disease

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.220
and not-not to do anything else except pop
that pill. So it's very participatory and

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.300
you have to be an engaged user of health care.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.860
So this is, so what struck me this morning
at about 6 o'clock in the morning and-and

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.970
made me realize that the talk today you guys
are gonna get it because it really reflects

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.470
what you guys already do and already know,
but it-it's the medicine of the 21st century.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.230
And the unfortunate fact is that it takes
about 20 to 50 years before a medical discovery

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.650
gets implemented in practice. It took 50 years
for the stethoscope to begin to be used.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:23.770
And-and the future of medicine is-is not going
to be creating a hypothesis, as we do now,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.980
and then doing a study and collecting data
and analyzing the data. It's gonna to be looking

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.760
for patterns in the data that already exists
and the patterns in your story and the patterns

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.310
in the biomarkers and using the computational
power we have now to create a model of thinking

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.330
about disease, disease patterns, and connections
and relationships and linkages in ways that

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.500
we don't now. Because medicine is completely
is completely solid as I'll share with you

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.290
in a minute.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.060
Now this is happening all across the world.
You may not have heard of it. You may not

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.030
be familiar with it in the words that I'm
speaking to you about it, like functional

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.650
medicine or P4 Medicine, but you've heard
about the concept of systems and of a systems

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.650
biology.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.870
And schools like Johns Hopkins have created
an entire new medicine school curriculum to

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.690
map to this new concept called Genes to Society.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.280
And we don't realize this but medical education
was established in 1910 and the-the model

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.000
of education we have now is pretty much the
same as it was then.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.262
If you wanna know how a doctor practices you
just look at the early graduate of medical

00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:23.040
school and things are very difficult and slow
to change.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.500
So they're tryin' to shift that and tryin'
to understand how the environment interacts

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.290
with our genes in any moment to create our
phenotype.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.520
This is really the-the concept of the future
of medicine which is the moment of health

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.480
that you have now, the person you are right
now, is created by your lifestyle and your

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.090
environment, toxins and everything in your
environment, washing over your DNA to create

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.300
the person you are in this moment.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.300
And that it's really a continuum of illness
not simply on or off, you have this disease

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.970
or you don't. One day you have, don't have
diabetes, the next day you don't. One day

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.100
you-you're free of cancer and the next day
you have cancer. That's not how disease works.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.200
It's a continuum of shift from optimal function
all the way to full blown disease.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.381
It's the medicine of-of why not what. We're
trained as doctors to say, "What disease do

00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:14.170
you have? What drug to I give you?" Instead
of, "Why is this happening? Why does this

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.540
particular person have this particular symptom
at this moment. What are the underlying causes?

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:23.530
What are the mechanisms and pathways and connections
that we can use to link together this information

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.190
to understand what's really at the root of
disease?

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.130
And this is happening all over the world.
Over 40 countries have participated in educational

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:35.330
programs at the Institute for Functional Medicine.
There's 31 medical ed-educational institutions

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.460
that have been involved. There's over 13 residency
programs that are exploring this. So this

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.460
is out there.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.340
And today I wanna take you through the lens
of the brain and show you how this model applies.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.480
And it applies not just to the brain, but
to all chronic diseases; all the things that

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:56.020
are our pain points as a nation, as a, as
a world which we'll share globally. I don't

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.430
know if you know this but by 2020 there will
be less than 20 million who will die from

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.470
infectious disease. But over 50 million will
die from preventable, chronic illnesses, and

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.100
reversible chronic illnesses like heart disease,
diabetes, and cancer.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.410
So it's not just in America, it's globally.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.931
So how do you power up your brain?

00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:20.530
It's important to focus on prevention because
often as I'm gonna show you with this patient

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.260
it's difficult and it can be too late if you
wait too long you can end up with re-irreversible

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.680
problems with your brain.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:33.110
And-and hopefully you haven't gotten to this
stage yet about where we can do a lot. Now

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:38.010
this is a, no joking, this is a big epidemic.
There's 1.1 billion people in the world who

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:43.090
have brains that aren't working; they have
depression, they have ADD, they have dementia

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.030
and there's all sorts of other spectrum of
brain disorders along the continuum of brain

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.030
dysfunction.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.800
And the question is how is your brain working?
I mean it's probably a good brain to start

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.340
with or you wouldn't be here, but is it working
as well as it can and if not, why not? And

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.440
how can you make your brain work better?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.180
Maybe you have mood issues, maybe you have
a little trouble focusing, maybe you have

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.950
trouble sleeping, maybe you have trouble with
energy, maybe you have trouble with even cognitive

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.080
focusing and-and memory.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.260
Now we have a lot of insults to our brain
and there's a lot of damage that happens as

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:19.200
a result of things that we do. And there's
a way we can understand how to change that.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:26.580
When our brain aches we don't really feel
pain, but it shows up as mood problems or

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.230
focus problems or attention problems, right?
If you're, if you have a sore throat your

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.700
throat hurts. If you have a toothache, you're
tooth hurts, right?

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:38.330
But if you're, if you're brain hurts what
happens? You have ADD, you have autism, you

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.120
have depression, you have dementia, you have
cognitive loss. These are things that happens

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.960
to your brain as your system becomes imbalanced.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:48.690
And so what we're gonna learn about is how
if you change your body it'll change your

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:54.060
brain. The inputs you put into your system
create the outputs. And if you change the

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.740
inputs you'll get different outputs in terms
of cognitive function, mood, attention, memory,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.310
behavior, and so forth.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.800
So I'm gonna talk to you a little bit today
about a pretty radical idea. But I think you

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:10.740
guys are up for it; which is that the way
we think about disease really is passé. In

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.991
fact and recently at a conference a CEO of
a major drug company said that in the future

00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:21.440
there'll be no more drugs for block buster
diseases only drugs for block buster mechanisms.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.500
And the reason for that is that diseases don't
exist. Not really in the way we think they

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.610
do because just the way the world looks flat
and it's not and just the way it-it appears

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.880
that the earth seems to be the center of the
universe, it's really not. Diseases also appear

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.920
real but their simply the downstream effects
from upstream mechanisms and causes.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.990
So we're gonna talk about how your brain works
and how we do things that harm it and what

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.280
we can do to help it and how we can optimize
your brain function, your focus, your mood,

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.680
and your performance.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.360
So the way we do this, and-and I've written
about this in the books. Many of you got lucky

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.220
to sit in a seat with the UltraMind book which
this is what this is and the other ones have

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.800
the weight book. I don't know if it's applicable
to you, but you can swap the books around

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.391
and this is a personalized prescription for
creating a powerful brain.

00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:12.080
It's-it's not a generic program; it's something
that can be personalized and-and individualized

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.700
to match your specific issues. And we'll talk
about why that's important. And it's based

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:21.220
on this notion that P4 Medicine, which its
clinical model is functional medicine.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.640
Most of what I'm gonna tell you is in the
book. There's over 400 references in the book;

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.230
there-there's really based on seeing thousands
of patients over 15 years using this model.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.570
Here's the practice that I have in Lennox,
Massachusetts which is having an ice storm

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.570
now so I'm thankful I'm not there.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.310
So the basic notion here is that if you change
your body, you'll change your brain.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:44.300
We all know that the mind influences the body
but we don't think so much about how the body

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.880
influences the mind. And someone mentioned
to me earlier that they were having depression

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.010
and that they were gonna go see a psychiatrist
and they were probably gonna get a drug and

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.880
said, "Gee if I knew that I could change what
I'm doing to change my mood, I might do that."

00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.520
So people don't really make the connection
between what the inputs are and how they feel.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.250
We sort of don't think about it. Somehow we
wait until we get sick to really think about

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.870
our health, but we don't notice that all these
subtle problems and symptoms and conditions

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.330
that we suffer from are really fixable by
addressing the underlying cause.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.980
If you guys want a copy of the slides you
can go to drhyman.com/google to-to get a download

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.150
so you don't have to write everything down.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:25.600
So this is a pretty shocking idea, but diseases
don't really matter anymore. As we understand

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.700
the body as a system our notion of disease
is-is taking flight and it's, and it's shifting

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.690
from understanding disease as a discreet set
of different conditions to understanding the

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.360
underlying pathways and systems underneath
it.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.320
So my hypothesis today is that there really
is no such thing as depression. There's no

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.839
such thing as bipolar disorder. There's no
such thing as ADD or autism or dementia; that

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:51.380
these are really systemic illnesses that happen
to affect the brain. And that you have to

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.839
treat the system in order to fix the problem.

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:59.770
So we get stuck in this whole concept of the
name it, blame it, and tame it. We name the

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.411
disease and then we blame the name for the
problem, and then we try to tame it with a

00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:07.520
drug. And-and we don't think in a complex
way in medicine.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:14.740
We get really focused on one disease, one
drug model which is really 19th century diseases.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.980
The bacillus that was discovered by Louis
Pasteur and was treated with antibiotic that

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.960
seemed to work, so we try to apply that to
all the rest of medicine. But that's actually

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.640
not how the body works.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.029
And-and we really good at labeling things
and naming things. There's this category of

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:33.200
psychiatric diseases called DSM-IV and I was
sitting at dinner with the-the head of the

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.780
National Institutes for Mental Health in Washington
a few years ago and I said, "Dr. Insel what

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.441
do you think of this book the DSM-IV which
is the Bible for psychiatrists? He said, "I

00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:48.990
think it has a 100% accuracy but 0% validity."
Meaning it's very good at describing the symptoms

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:53.339
people have and putting them into groups according
to their symptoms, but it tells me nothing

00:13:53.339 --> 00:13:58.320
about the cause for those problems or even
really how to think about them in a way that

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320
works.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.510
And this is an article from my favorite alternative
medical journal, the Journal of the American

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.540
Medical Association, which has all sorts of
amazing things that people just don't pay

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:11.570
attention to. And-and they-they-they talk
about dementia in this article and-and our

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.630
shifts in thinking about it and how when we
study dementia and we look at ginkgo or fish

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.010
oil or this or that it doesn't seem to work.
Or we use this drug or that drug.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.589
It's because dementia doesn't really exist
the way we think it does. It's simply an end

00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:28.360
result of a whole series of insults and many
different kinds of insults that can lead to

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.010
the same common symptoms.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:36.510
So in this article they talk about how that-that
we classify things incorrectly and we're not

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.850
very good at talking about the cause. This
is categorical misclassification and etiologic

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:46.292
imprecision. Meaning we classify by symptoms
instead of by cause which is really what we're

00:14:46.292 --> 00:14:47.880
going to be doing in the future.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.320
So let's just take an example. You go to the
doctor and you feel sad and helpless and hopeless

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.690
and you're not interested in life and sex
and food anymore; you can't sleep well; and

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.190
you even have thoughts maybe of killing yourself
from time to time. And your doctor goes, "I

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:05.770
know what's wrong with you. You have depression."

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:10.740
But that's not what's wrong with you, that's
just a name of those collection of symptoms.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.430
It doesn't tell you anything about the cause.
It tells you what, it doesn't tell you why.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:20.690
So for example, someone who comes in with
depression might have many, many causes. You

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:25.080
might be, for example, eating gluten and you
might have a genetic susceptibility to create

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.780
problems from this which creates an autoimmune
disease that attacks your thyroid that causes

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.660
you to have low thyroid function that can
lead to depression. And the treatment is getting

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.850
off gluten and treating your thyroid.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:40.790
Or you might be having reflux for years and
taking an acid blocking pill which inhibits

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.120
B-12 absorption which leads to depression.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.880
Or you may live in Seattle or work inside
all the time, although you guys are out playin'

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.360
volleyball so maybe you get outside and get
some Vitamin D, but you might have a Vitamin

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.480
D deficiency and have depression and need
Vitamin D.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.220
Or you might be taking antibiotics for acne
or have frequent colds or sinus infections

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.480
and take antibiotics that destroy your gut
flora. And that changes the microbiome in

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.339
your gut and changes the regulation of the
immune system in your body that leads to inflammation.

00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:12.649
And an inflamed brain is also a depressed
blane, brain.

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:19.090
Or you might love sushi 'cause I see you had
lunch today and may be full of mercury. And

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:25.790
mercury can cause depression. Or you may hate
fish and have Omega-3 fat deficiency because

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.190
you don't like fish. And Omega-3 fats are
critical for brain development and mood.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:35.260
Or you might love sugar and eat lots of sugar
and soda which actually leads to something

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.920
called pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome
which has been cause of depression.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:45.910
So the treatment and the diagnosis of each
of these things is very different and you

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.750
have to ask the question why, not what.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:54.010
So in-in medicine we come up with a lot of
solutions and often we find out they may be

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:55.490
the wrong thing later on.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.710
This is an ad from 50 years ago that more
doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarettes

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.770
and 113,000 doctors are coast to coast. So
you can substitute more doctors recommend

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.480
Prozac or Lipitor or any other drug for this
or that and in 50 years how are we gonna be

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.480
looking at this?

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.569
In fact think about it, is depression a Prozac
deficiency? Right? Is it, is this a drug deficiency

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.689
or is it some other imbalance in your system
that's driving this?

00:17:18.689 --> 00:17:24.000
Now in the future we're gonna be shifting
away from just saying, "You have depression.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.249
Take this antidepressant," to "Oh this is
a-a symptom of some other factors. Let's find

00:17:29.249 --> 00:17:33.639
out what those factors are. Let's look at
your whole biology as a system." This is called

00:17:33.639 --> 00:17:39.499
systems biology. And redefine disease based
on causes and mechanisms and not on labels.

00:17:39.499 --> 00:17:44.389
And we're gonna be shifting from the silos
we have which are all the ologies, the specialties,

00:17:44.389 --> 00:17:47.389
that we have in medicine and we go to a doctor
for every different part of our body. We take

00:17:47.389 --> 00:17:48.929
a pill for every ill.

00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:52.399
We're gonna shift into thinking more about
complex networks and systems. We're gonna

00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:57.750
be moving away from the 12,000 labels of diseases
we have in our code book to an understanding

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.090
of biology as a, as a network or a system.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:04.539
And it happens at a, at a very fundamental
level. We're-we're discovering this in biology

00:18:04.539 --> 00:18:11.750
that your-your physiology is a web; that it's
a network and that it happens at a genomic

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:16.179
level, at a metabolic level, at a disease
level, and there's patterns that connects

00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:19.639
all of these different pathways and things
together and link them together.

00:18:19.639 --> 00:18:24.559
And there's also a network at a social level.
In fact if your friends are overweight you're

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:28.190
more likely to be overweight than if your
relatives are overweight, or your mother or

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.419
father's overweight.

00:18:29.419 --> 00:18:34.149
So there's a huge component of-of-of understanding
the networks and connections between things

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:35.370
that are important.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:42.779
So just as, for example, depression can be
caused by many different factors. One causative

00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:49.549
agent can trigger many different diseases.
For example, gluten can cause depression.

00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:55.779
It can also lead to autism. It can also cause
rheumatoid arthritis. It can lead to osteoporosis.

00:18:55.779 --> 00:18:59.740
It can lead to irritable bowel syndrome or
even inflammatory bowel syndrome. Sorry some

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:07.309
of you guys are eating lunch. And even heart
attacks, and cancer, and dementia.

00:19:07.309 --> 00:19:13.239
In a recent study of 30,000 people they found
that people who had low level reactions to

00:19:13.239 --> 00:19:18.379
gluten, not even a full blown celiac disease,
had between a 35 and 72% increase in their

00:19:18.379 --> 00:19:22.070
risk of death from heart disease and cancer.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.230
So we have to reframe how we're thinking about
these things.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.240
You can go to the doctor and have all these
different conditions, you're gonna get a certain

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.610
specific treatment based on suppressing the
symptoms. You're not gonna get a treatment

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:39.629
based on the cause. And so for all these conditions
you might have a result of relieving the symptoms

00:19:39.629 --> 00:19:41.399
by treating the-the gluten problem.

00:19:41.399 --> 00:19:48.220
And this is not just applicable to mood issues.
It's across the whole spectrum of what we

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:55.179
call the B-O-I which is the Burden of Illness,
including the big cost drivers and-and-and

00:19:55.179 --> 00:19:59.850
things that drive suffering and disease like
obesity, heart disease, diabetes, depression,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.980
and mood disorders which are rampant; I mean
the second leading category of pharmaceuticals

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.370
are psychiatric drugs.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:11.059
And then of course these arise in allergies
and asthma and respiratory illnesses, digestive

00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:12.059
disorders.

00:20:12.059 --> 00:20:15.700
I was shocked to find that one of the biggest
cost drivers for a major insurer was reflux

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.760
and heart burn which is a treatable condition
not using PPI's or acid blocking drugs but-but

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.389
using the approach that I'm talking about.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:27.619
Cancer, back pain, migraines, and all autoimmune
disease which affects 24 million people collectively

00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:30.690
like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and MS,
and so forth.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:36.650
These are all things that-that have really
very poor treatments in conventional medicine,

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.559
but in this new model of systems thinking
that we addresses the underlying causes; a

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:42.690
very powerful approach.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.840
So the question is: do you suffer from brain
damage, and if you do, what can you do about

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.029
it?

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:51.820
Now this is what our brain should like, look
like, and this is what it may look like if

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:57.169
you've taken too many drugs or maybe drink
too much alcohol or don't get enough sleep

00:20:57.169 --> 00:21:00.690
or drink too much sugar or on and on and on.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.639
And-and the good news is though, that if you've
injured your brain you can repair your brain.

00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:09.080
This concept of neurogenesis is very critical
in-in the research. And even in people who

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.640
are dying they're making new brain cells.
People who have cancer they, they're-they're

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:19.869
dividing neurons through a special tag, biochemical
tag, and they find that in rapidly dying people

00:21:19.869 --> 00:21:22.340
there are actually new dividing cells in their
brains.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.260
And there's also the concept of neurotrophic
factors: things that enhance and optimize

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.250
our brain function. We were talking about
that at lunch. There's a molecule for example

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.820
in coffee and-and in actually the coffee bean
and in-in curcumin and in fish oil that actually

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.609
help regulate pathways that improve your brain
development and improve connections. So you

00:21:39.609 --> 00:21:45.619
have both new brain cells, which is neurogenesis,
and-and new connections, which is neuroplasticity

00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:46.860
at any age.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:52.361
And the cause of our problem with brains is-is
really not a chemical imbalance in the way

00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:57.200
we think it is. There's not a Prozac deficiency.
But it's a, it's a series of insults that

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.091
happen over time. It's our nutrient depleted
diet. It's our toxic environment, heavy metals

00:22:02.091 --> 00:22:07.279
and pesticides; it's our unremitting stress.
It's various triggers that upset our immune

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:11.499
system such as allergens or-or infections.

00:22:11.499 --> 00:22:15.460
And in many of the things we eat: high fructose
corn syrup, sugar, trans fats, food additives,

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.749
pesticides, hormones, all influence our brain
function.

00:22:18.749 --> 00:22:23.150
Also things we do everyday affect it: our
sleep cycles, our circadian rhythms, levels

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.980
of stress, not-not exercising. Exercising
is one of the best things you can do to actually

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.781
prevent Alzheimer's. And a brain trauma, I
saw somebody fall off a swing today out there.

00:22:32.781 --> 00:22:36.269
I was a little worried, but brain trauma is
not good for your brain and I know they're

00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:38.940
your most important assets. You wanna be very
careful.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:44.429
And in certain drugs we use: nicotine, caffeine,
alcohol, in some ways are all injuring to

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:48.760
the brain. Caffeine has a, is a double edged
sword. It may help regulate certain pathways

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:54.139
that control inflammation, but it also may
damage you by decreasing dopamine and that

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:59.259
leads to needing more coffee and then having
this sort of crash and burn cycle where you

00:22:59.259 --> 00:23:03.520
basically get a little boost and then you-you
fatigue and then you need more coffee and

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.700
it eventually doesn't work. So you have to
be careful.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.249
There's certain medications that can have
impact: the statins, and acid blockers, and

00:23:09.249 --> 00:23:12.009
various things. So, also heavy metals and
toxins.

00:23:12.009 --> 00:23:17.139
So we really have to understand that depression,
ADD, and autism and dementia are not really

00:23:17.139 --> 00:23:20.489
diseases they're really just symptoms of some
underlying imbalances.

00:23:20.489 --> 00:23:25.109
And they can be nutritional imbalances and
this is really the crux of-of the story here.

00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:29.559
And this is what I-I talk a lot about in-in
my books and which is the foundation of functional

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:35.889
medicine is reorganizing biology into a series
of-of nodes within the network of-of our physiology

00:23:35.889 --> 00:23:37.040
and the webs of our physiology.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.889
And these nodes are really the places we wanna
look for problems in nutritional status.

00:23:40.889 --> 00:23:45.919
We wanna look for problems with B vitamins
and Vitamin D and zinc and magnesium and Omega-3

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:46.919
fats.

00:23:46.919 --> 00:23:50.539
We wanna look for triggers of inflammation
in the brain like gluten and food sensitivities

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:53.419
and infections and toxins and sugar and molds.

00:23:53.419 --> 00:23:58.519
We wanna look for hormonal imbalances like
thyroid, adrenal, and sex hormones and problems

00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:04.029
with sugar. Even our gut and I'll talk some
a little bit about how the gut plays a role

00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:05.379
in-in our brain.

00:24:05.379 --> 00:24:12.100
And then of course toxic injury: heavy metals,
pesticides, molds, loss of energy in our cells,

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.429
very important. And loss of energy in our
cells and our capacity to produce energy creates

00:24:16.429 --> 00:24:21.559
a decreased brain function and performance
and then any sort of chronic or acute stress.

00:24:21.559 --> 00:24:26.950
So these are the areas that we pay attention
to and we-we navigate to and filter our information

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:27.950
through a new set of lenses.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.999
And the problem with medicine is that the
treatments we use don't match the cause. So

00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:37.729
if you're eating gluten and you have depression,
taking Prozac's not gonna help. Or if you

00:24:37.729 --> 00:24:42.600
have a folic acid deficiency, for example
you get a 6% benefit from an antidepressant.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.769
If you actually correct the folic deficiency
the benefit of the drug goes up 44%. But I

00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:52.070
say, "Why not just try the folic acid first
or the folate first and then if it doesn't

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.940
get better use a medication?"

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:58.159
So let me make this a little more granular
for you and show how this works in a particular

00:24:58.159 --> 00:25:02.509
story of-of a boy who came to me with Attention
Deficit Disorder.

00:25:02.509 --> 00:25:07.539
This is a rampant problem. There's 12 million
kids who have problems and this arises in

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:12.549
all the whole spectrum of disease like autism
over the last 20 years in extraordinarily

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:19.190
high rates. We've gone from 1 in 10,000 to
1 in 100 kids who have autism.

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.110
And the-the-the hypothesis here is that the
cure for brain disorders is really outside

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:27.539
the brain. It's by treating your system and
your body. So we have to ask, "What's going

00:25:27.539 --> 00:25:29.399
on? Why are these kids having this problem?"

00:25:29.399 --> 00:25:35.309
And this is Clayton; this is every kid in
America. He came to me he had 11 diagnoses,

00:25:35.309 --> 00:25:42.909
he'd seen five specialists, was on eight medications.
He had asthma, allergies, anxiety, ADD, and

00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:45.260
anal spasms, and that's just the A's.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:51.519
Now he had lots of other issues: digestive
problems, and he had anxiety and fearfulness,

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:56.419
and he was very disruptive, he had bad handwriting.
And-and these are his list of problems. You

00:25:56.419 --> 00:26:00.690
can see it's a very long list and he was a
long, a long list of medications at 12 years

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.690
old.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:05.669
And nobody asked how is everything connected
in this boy. Nobody wanted to look at how

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:10.960
things are out of balance. How is he sort
of off kilter? And-and nobody wanted to understand

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.249
how we can look at the underlying factors
that are driving his symptoms.

00:26:15.249 --> 00:26:20.309
So we began to do things that put his system
back together and it required a sort of set

00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:25.279
of complex changes that-that looked at the
underlying factors.

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:29.351
Now we knew he was on antibiotics, he had
frequent infections, he had a horrible diet,

00:26:29.351 --> 00:26:33.759
he ate junk food, and we knew that-that he'd
seen a bunch of people, but no one asked how

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:35.399
is everything connected.

00:26:35.399 --> 00:26:36.629
So we were asking the wrong questions.

00:26:36.629 --> 00:26:40.419
Now this is the map I used to help figure
out what was wrong with him. Which is rather

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:47.310
than seeing a specific disease and treating
it separately like his ADD and treating that

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.239
with Ritalin, and his asthma-asthma with a
certain inhaler, and his allergies with an

00:26:50.239 --> 00:26:54.029
antihistamine, and so on. I said let's take
a map and look at how all these things are

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:55.029
connected.

00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:59.259
So it just looks like probably one of your
white boards as you're doing your-your-your

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:03.840
programming, but this is a model of-of this
little boy, Clayton, who had some predisposing

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:10.029
factors of poor diet which led to, and antibiotics
for lots of infections when he was younger,

00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:13.820
which led to disruptive, disruption in his
digestive system.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:19.669
And that led to various disruptions in his
immune system. And that led to also to antibody

00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:22.509
development related to foods and also gluten.

00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:27.989
So that disrupted his whole system and that
affected his-his brain. He also had lead in

00:27:27.989 --> 00:27:30.299
his system and he had also nutritional deficiencies.

00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:34.950
And this was obvious just from talking to
him 'cause he had, for example, muscle cramps

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:41.619
and anxiety and insomnia and-and-and headaches
which were all signs of magnesium deficiency.

00:27:41.619 --> 00:27:44.909
He never ate fish so I knew he had Omega-3
fat deficiency. He was always inside playing

00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:50.671
video games so I knew he had Vitamin D deficiency.
He also had very poor diet, he didn't eat

00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:54.139
vegetables, so I'm assuming he had low levels
of antioxidants like beta carotene. And he

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:57.039
had a high processed diet and it was high
in sugar.

00:27:57.039 --> 00:28:01.130
So these were all clues to me and patterns
that I see and I-I see this disruption in

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:05.169
his basic physiology and I wasn't sort of
treating each disease separately I was saying,

00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:08.159
"How do we create balance back in his physiology?"

00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:12.250
"I'm afraid that your irritable bowel syndrome
has progressed. Your now have furious and

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.799
vindictive bowel syndrome." [laughs]

00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:18.229
And I think what people don't realize is that
an irritable bowel often causes an irritable

00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:25.730
brain; that the disturbances in the gut flora,
in the levels of inflammation in the gut trigger

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.919
inflammation in the brain. And that leads
to mood and cognitive disorders.

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:34.419
So we really spent our time looking at all
these nodes and this network and this system

00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:38.799
that are all dynamically interactive. These
really aren't separate things; they're really

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:43.169
just, we're just using this as a model for
thinking about disease, but it's-it's a model

00:28:43.169 --> 00:28:46.299
that-that can explain most chronic illness.

00:28:46.299 --> 00:28:49.550
So instead of thinking about diseases, I think,
"Well what's goin' on with his immune system?

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:54.629
How's his digestion? What is his nutritional
status? How-how's he detoxifying? What's going

00:28:54.629 --> 00:28:55.970
on with his-his gut?"

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.529
So these are the things that I really look
at. And we found when we looked under the

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:03.580
hood, and people say that modern medicine
is like trying to figure out what's wrong

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:08.580
with your car while listening to the noises
it makes, right? We need to look under the

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.580
hood a little bit.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:14.369
So not everybody needs all these tests and
I just use this for you as an illustration,

00:29:14.369 --> 00:29:18.119
but I-I've been able to actually predict what
most of these-these results would be just

00:29:18.119 --> 00:29:21.169
by talking to him; just by his narrativomics,
by his story.

00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:25.909
So we found out he had low levels of certain
amino acids and low levels of fish oil, low

00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:29.090
levels of minerals like zinc and magnesium
which we predicted; low levels of Vitamin

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:34.159
D and E 'cause he didn't like grains and he
had B12 and B6 deficiencies which affect mood.

00:29:34.159 --> 00:29:38.999
He also had immune disturbance with allergies
as we talked about and elevated antibodies

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:45.049
to gluten. And he also developed yeast problems
in his gut because had lots of antibiotics.

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:49.389
And when we checked for mercury and lead we
found he had a high level of lead which can

00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:51.409
really disturb his-his system.

00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:56.049
Now this might look like one of your white
boards too and, or computer program, but essentially

00:29:56.049 --> 00:30:00.729
this the-the sort of dynamic interactions
that happen at a molecular level that drive

00:30:00.729 --> 00:30:01.909
downstream symptoms.

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:03.739
So let me just sort of walk you through this.

00:30:03.739 --> 00:30:09.080
This is an enzyme and enzymes are simply catalysts
or helpers in biochemical reaction; they turn

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.169
one molecule into another.

00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:15.769
If there are things that stop this enzyme
from functioning like heavy metals, mercury,

00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:20.200
lead, it jams that biology and that creates
a whole series of things so this wheel can't

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.700
turn and you end up, for example, not being
able to methylate or turn on dopamine receptors.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:31.509
So you can't focus or pay attention or concentrate.
It prevents the energy production to preventing

00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:37.489
adenosine which needs to be methylated and
so you lose energy in your body in your cells.

00:30:37.489 --> 00:30:41.419
It prevents methylation of neurotransmitters
so you can't produce serotonin and-and-and

00:30:41.419 --> 00:30:43.710
epinephrine and adrenalin which help you focus.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:49.470
And you also can't produce antioxidants like
glutathione which protect you against inflammation

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:56.429
and help you detoxify from heavy metal; so
this will all jam if something is-is-is poisoning

00:30:56.429 --> 00:30:57.429
this enzyme.

00:30:57.429 --> 00:31:01.769
The good news is there are ways to help this.
For example, you can unblock it using methylcobalamin

00:31:01.769 --> 00:31:05.940
which is a special form of B12 that actually
can open up the system.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.509
And I've seen kids for example with attention
deficit or autism or behavior issues, you

00:31:10.509 --> 00:31:14.789
give them the right form in the right way
of this methylcobalamin and they literally

00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:18.559
focus and pay attention. You know these kids
don't look at you, they don't look at you

00:31:18.559 --> 00:31:20.690
in the eye, they don't pay attention; they'll
literally wake up and they'll focus and they'll

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.190
pay attention, be alert.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.400
Very interesting to see how you can play with
this web of physiology by dealing with the

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.129
root issue as opposed to dealing with the
downstream symptoms.

00:31:29.129 --> 00:31:33.580
And here are just some of the tests we did:
looking at his food sensitivities, genetic

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:39.340
predispositions, looking at heavy metal levels,
looking at his gut function, looking at his-his

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.179
levels of-of mitochondrial function, and all
sorts of things that are novel biomarkers

00:31:44.179 --> 00:31:49.330
that don't specifically look for a disease
but look for patterns in the data; look for

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:53.990
associations and connections and linkages
to help us understand what the drivers are

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.990
of disease.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.389
And actually we can work and play in this,
in this data field and change the outcomes

00:31:58.389 --> 00:32:03.080
by simply taking out the bad stuff and putting
in the good stuff. And it helps create balance

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.080
in the body.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.759
So how did I treat him? I gave him a healthier
diet, I took away the junk food, I took away

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:12.639
the things that his body is reacting to in
his immune system, I cleaned up his gut with

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:17.279
some drugs that clear out the bad bugs like
antifungals, I got rid of his heavy metals,

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:22.009
and then I-I gave him a real food diet and
some nutrients that were based on his story

00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:27.500
and some of the testing that helped to regulate
his biochemistry and change his gene expression

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:28.999
and changed how he was actually functioning.

00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:33.099
And I gave him things to help his gut and
the bacteria and normalize his gut function.

00:32:33.099 --> 00:32:36.789
And you know what was striking to me was no
not that his symptoms got better and his stomach

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:41.730
aches and headaches and his allergies and
his asthma and his ADD went away and that

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:46.090
he had good school performance and he was
doing better in every way, but what struck

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:49.850
me was what happened to his handwriting.

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:54.149
This was his handwriting before he came to
see me and I was downstairs taking a tour

00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:56.600
and I saw some white boards that sort of looked
like this actually.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600
[laughter]

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.200
And maybe [laughs] some of you have some of
these issues, I don't know but.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:07.929
The-the result of two months later looking
at his handwriting was this.

00:33:07.929 --> 00:33:12.840
So I had to ask myself when I saw this what
was going on? How did his brain go from dysfunctional

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:17.219
to functional; from incoherent to coherent?
How did the asynchrony and coherence happen

00:33:17.219 --> 00:33:18.219
in his system?

00:33:18.219 --> 00:33:23.009
I didn't treat his brain, I treated his body.
I treated all the imbalances that I found.

00:33:23.009 --> 00:33:26.989
And-and really as we think about this were
looking at these sort of biological origins

00:33:26.989 --> 00:33:32.659
of-of dysfunction, this complexity science
and how genes interact with our, with our

00:33:32.659 --> 00:33:37.150
environment and our diet and out food and
how various insults like toxins or nutritional

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:42.840
deficiencies or immunological factors, stress
all play a role and change the brain conditions

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.669
or the conditions in any area of our body,
right?

00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:49.450
And they, and that leads to abnormal cell
function and cell structure and organization

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:54.679
or chemistry and that leads to altered processing
and signaling and gene transcription and the

00:33:54.679 --> 00:34:00.330
whole proteomics, metabolomics phenomics which
is the end result of phenome is the expression

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.880
of your genes at any moment.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:07.430
And-and that's when we see the downstream
observable symptoms which we call ADD or depression

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:12.179
or dementia. But those become less relevant
as we understand the underlying causes in

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:13.889
disease.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:19.240
Now this was me 15 years ago and as you see
this is me today. And I-I began by, this journey

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.889
by being sick myself and understanding this-this
problem in a way that forced me to look at

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:25.980
things differently.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.600
In-in medical school I didn't learn what I
needed to know to solve my own problem. So

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.690
I had to go and begin to look at the data
and look at the research and see what was

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:36.720
going on out there in medicine to find out
how things really work. How does the body

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.139
work? What are the, what are the basic organizational
principles that on which our biology is founded?

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:47.339
How, it's really very sort of existential
question and it's a paradigm shift so profound

00:34:47.339 --> 00:34:52.200
it's as great as when Columbus said, "The
earth is not flat," or Galileo said, "The

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:56.240
earth is not the center of the universe,"
or when Darwin said, "Species don't just arise

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.960
fixed in their current form but they evolve."

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.640
In the same way diseases don't just show up
fixed in one moment to the next, they evolve

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:07.520
in a continuum. And this is a really new-new
radical idea in medicine that has not been

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520
adopted yet.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.060
But at the Institute for Functional Medicine
we have a textbook if any of you are really

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.779
interested in this you can learn more about
it. And it's really based on this-this notion

00:35:15.779 --> 00:35:19.320
of dealing with the roots of the problem.
Most of the ologies are out here in the branches

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:24.250
and the leaves of the tree and we focus on
this-this diagnosis by organ, right?

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:27.650
And then we-we don't really look down here
at what are the underlying drivers of disease

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:31.869
and what are genetic predispositions in our
thoughts and our feelings and how those affect

00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:32.869
us.

00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:36.700
We-we know that our thoughts and our feelings
actually talk to our DNA; that our food talks

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:43.089
to our DNA and changes its expression moment
to moment. And that leads to physiologic changes

00:35:43.089 --> 00:35:46.170
that lead to imbalances as in these sys, in
these systems that I mentioned.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:50.220
So these are the systems that we looked at
with this little boy and that's what really

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:55.210
I focused on in practice and that's what we
teach at the Institute for Functional Medicine.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:59.680
Now many of you think you sort of got genetics
from your family. I had lunch with somebody

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.809
today who said they have a family history
of diabetes and heart disease and dementia

00:36:03.809 --> 00:36:08.440
and Parkinson's and these are things which
we sort of somehow believe we're destined

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.789
to experience because they are in our genetics.

00:36:10.789 --> 00:36:16.170
But DNA is not your destiny. In fact, your
genes are fixed but the expression of those

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.329
genes is not fixed.

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:20.170
And let me show you some pretty radical information.

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:24.410
This is talking about, for example, Parkinson's
where we know that-that there be certain pre-predispositions

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:29.230
to Parkinson's and there's, but there's a
dynamic interaction between the genes and

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:33.160
the environment to-to lead to certain problems
in our biology like inflammation and free

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.549
radicals and energy production which then
leads to cell death.

00:36:36.549 --> 00:36:41.299
And we know, for example, I was talking about
earlier the NR2 pathway which works in modulating

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:45.920
this-this expression of your genes and regulates
things like inflammation.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.470
This is a really profound study looking at
the Agouti mouse which looked at these predisposed

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:55.960
mice who were predisposed to diabetes, heart
disease, obesity, and cancer; sounds like

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.160
most of us; and had a lower life span.

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.260
And what they did was they took pregnant rats
and they gave them certain supplements that

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:07.980
were methylating supplements that are-are
nutritional supplements that regulate gene

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:08.980
expression.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.559
But these are nutrients that our bodies have
used since we've evolved and are used across

00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:17.049
all life species to actually regulate turning
on and off of genes. It's called methylation.

00:37:17.049 --> 00:37:24.359
So things like B12 and folate, zinc, and so
forth, B6, they regulate this-this-this modulation

00:37:24.359 --> 00:37:25.359
of your genes.

00:37:25.359 --> 00:37:30.609
So they found that without actually evolving
you can create what we call epigenetic changes

00:37:30.609 --> 00:37:34.349
that tag genes and turn on and off genes and
regulate genes to create a different outcome.

00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:40.030
And the outcome in this little mouse was a
brown mouse instead of a white mouse; a thin

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:44.120
mouse instead of a fat mouse; a mouse that
doesn't have diabetes or cancer or heart disease

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.120
and lives a long time.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.750
And the only thing that changed was they changed
the inputs in terms of the nutrients that

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:54.809
regulate gene expression. Same genes, no different
in genes; change in expression.

00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:58.400
So this is the kind of impact we can have
and it's enormously important we've seen this

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400
go in reverse.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.280
This is the Pima Indians who a hundred years
ago were thin and fit and had no diabetes,

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:10.460
obesity, or heart disease. And now 80% have
diabetes and their life expectancy is 46.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:16.059
And in one generation they went from being
really relatively thin to being enormously

00:38:16.059 --> 00:38:18.641
obese and now they're the second most obese
population in the world.

00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:22.490
Their genes didn't change, but the environment
changed and the expression of those genes

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:23.490
changed.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:27.380
So what we have to realize is that food isn't
just calories. It's actually information;

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:33.000
it talks to our DNA. It talked to our epigenome
and it transforms our biology in a moment

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.240
to moment way.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:38.450
So the most powerful decision you have every
day is what you put on your fork or what you

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:43.530
put in your mouth. Literally with every bite
are talking to your genes. And it's-it's as

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:48.000
well worked out scientifically it's not just
a theory. We understand how this works. And

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.760
we see changes in our phenome that leads to
for example increases in obesity.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:57.510
Now we've seen obesity rates triple, double
triple, quadruple across the world in a very

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:58.510
short time.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:02.190
We've seen China; 30 years ago I was in China
and I never saw an overweight person. Now

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:07.150
there's-there's tremendous amounts of obesity
and they went from having no-no diabetes to

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:12.400
having 93 million diabetics in-in less than
a generation in China.

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:18.150
And the reason is that they're eating different
food and it's quickly changing their biology.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:24.520
The bad news is is that as your belly size
goes up your brain size goes down. So if you

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.430
have a fat stomach you have small brain. You
shrink the hippocampus which is the memory

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:29.970
center in your brain.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:34.940
So this correlation is not just there for
cognitive function and memory, it's also there

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.981
for depression. More likely you are to be
depressed if you have metabolic syndrome.

00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:42.470
The more likely you are to get cancer and
heart disease and all these factors that have

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.460
impact on your brain.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:50.670
And-and we're-we're sort of inundated with-with
sugar. We went from less than 10 pounds per

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:56.240
year per person a hundred years ago to 185
pounds per person per year now. And I know

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.849
I don't have that much so that means some
of you are having a lot more; that's average.

00:39:59.849 --> 00:40:05.400
So we have a tremendous problem and-and we-we
drink a lot of our calories. So if-if you

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.900
look at the caloric intake. For example, if
you just drink one soda or drink a day and

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:16.480
that has about 225 calories that's about 90,000
calories a year, that's about in terms of

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:22.380
3500 calories per pound, that's about 20,
25 pounds of weight gain a year just from

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.079
one drink a day if you don't equalize your
calories.

00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:29.549
And the thing about liquid calories is that
you don't compensate by decreasing your solid

00:40:29.549 --> 00:40:35.059
food intake. So you actually will-will gain
weight. If-if you have one way to lose weight

00:40:35.059 --> 00:40:39.599
and gain health in this, in this country that's
easy to do it's don't drink your calories.

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:45.299
Now you might think, that this was in the
New England Journal of Medicine that you can,

00:40:45.299 --> 00:40:48.910
you can just do things like liposuction and
get rid of all this fat and-and have some

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:49.910
benefit.

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:54.640
And in fact they found there was really no
benefit by removing all this outer fat because

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.210
the inner fat wasn't removed by the liposuction.
So all their metabolic parameters: their blood

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:03.019
pressure, their blood sugar, their cholesterol,
their inflammation levels, were not changed

00:41:03.019 --> 00:41:07.109
at all; and so there was no impact and then
we see the opposite happen.

00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:11.369
If you take someone who does a gastric bypass
they can't eat. All their metabolic markers

00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:15.069
change even though they don't lose weight
that much because their inputs are different

00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:16.579
and it happens very quickly.

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:19.630
Now there may have been some psychological
benefits in this patient that was reported

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:23.280
in New England Journal because before liposuction
she was wearing a panty and after she was

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.280
wearing a thong --

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.280
[laughter]

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.280
so there may be some benefits, I don't know.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.890
[laughter]

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.730
Now how do you fix your brain? I'm gonna give
you some take homes and then were gonna open

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.960
it up for question and answer.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:38.490
The-the concept here is that if you heal your
body you can power up your brain. And that

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:44.289
you can customize the prescriptions for powering
up your brain other than just a generalized

00:41:44.289 --> 00:41:45.289
lifestyle program.

00:41:45.289 --> 00:41:49.481
So this is a sort of a generalized wellness
program or what I call Lifestyle 1.0. This

00:41:49.481 --> 00:41:54.950
is Lifestyle 2.0. This is personalized wellness
lifestyle recommendations that-that are based

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:59.109
on this model of systems biology or P4 medicine.

00:41:59.109 --> 00:42:02.910
So there's some basic concepts that work for
everybody, right? Which is eat right for your

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:06.880
brain. Tune up your brain chemistry with supplements
and I'll talk to you about those in a minute.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.390
The UltraMind Lifestyle which is essentially
common sense: exercise which increases what

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:16.670
we call B-D-N-F or miracle grow for your brain;
fertilizes the increases in connections and

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.760
neuroplasticity.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.180
Sleeping is critical; if you used to sleep
seven, nine hours a night a hundred years

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:27.130
ago now we sleep seven hours and that two
hour decrease not only affects our cognitive

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:31.349
function in focus and depression, it causes
depression, but also causes obesity 'cause

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:32.349
it drives appetite.

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:36.970
I know when I worked in the ER I used to be
hungrier because I wouldn't sleep so I would

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:40.680
crave more sugar. So we found that if you
reduce sleep by a couple hours a night in

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.600
young healthy men they'll increase their levels
of ghrelin which is the hunger hormone and

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:49.799
decrease the hormone called PYY which leads
to increases in sugar cravings.

00:42:49.799 --> 00:42:51.440
So it's a big problem.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:57.390
Learning how to find the pause button is ke-key.
We all know how to work hard and we all know

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:02.540
how to produce, but most of us don't know
where our pause button is. We don't know where

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:07.431
the off switch is. Very poor at, you have
massage here which is fantastic, you have

00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:13.990
fitness and play, so I think you have tools
here at your, at your service to do something

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:18.940
that can help you switch on the pause button.
And it's critical because you have to have

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:22.770
active relaxation. You can't just do nothing
and expect your body to relax.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:28.010
And we were talking at lunch about this concept
of heart rate variability which is a big predictor

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.349
of health. And that's really how complex your
heart rate is. So the-the least complex heart

00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:35.109
rate is a flat line; you don't want that,
right?

00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:36.109
[laughter]

00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:40.859
More complex, the healthier you are. So marathon
runners and people who are very fit have very

00:43:40.859 --> 00:43:46.140
complex heart rates, beat to beat. It's not
72 every minute, it's 72, it's 71, it's 69

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:51.010
1/2, it's 73 1/4, and it just varies from
beat to beat. That indicates health and that's

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.029
something you can measure; you could even
measure it on a device like an Android and

00:43:54.029 --> 00:43:58.920
just have your-your-your pulse taken and it
measures the complexity of your heart rate.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:04.400
And that's an incredible predictor of health
and of-of disease and mood and cognitive function.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:08.930
And it's something that is directly related
to your ability to reduce stress and to modulate

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:10.090
the stress response in your body.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:13.480
And of course there's things that you do everyday
thought lifting, you don't have to worry about

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.789
that that's using your brain; you do that
and you're good at it.

00:44:15.789 --> 00:44:20.059
And also living clean and green which is removing
insults from your brain. So and I'm, I was

00:44:20.059 --> 00:44:23.960
really pleased to talk to Olivia here who
told me that they-they don't serve foods that

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.099
are on the dirty dozen list in terms of pesticides,
for example. They have water filters which

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:29.099
is great.

00:44:29.099 --> 00:44:31.609
So how do you eat right for your brain? What
do you do?

00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:35.180
And-and these are really common sense things,
but one of the things that I think has-has

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:40.460
been overlooked in a lot of care is that there
is certain foods in our diet for various reasons

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:44.750
that have to do with hybridization, have to
do with genetic changes in the foods, have

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:49.530
to do with changes in our gut flora, that
drive inflammation in our body.

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:53.340
And a lot of people have brain allergies and
brain fog and brain dysfunction and they don't

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.330
know it until they stop eating these certain
foods.

00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:00.849
And the two biggest triggers are gluten and
diary which is the wheat, barley, rye, oats,

00:45:00.849 --> 00:45:06.490
spelt, kamut, these grains that-that you should
be alright to eat but actually drive inflammation

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:08.690
in a lot of people.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.890
Getting rid of the toxins, the food additives.
I mean I don't know how many people have Diet

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:18.400
Coke but aspartame is-is a neurotoxin. It
actually increases what we call excitotoxicity

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.140
that increases something called glutamate
which overexcites your brain cells and causes

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.140
cell death.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:26.140
And it, and a lot of people have extraordinary
symptoms and that we know are connected to

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.460
what they're drinking and they may have headaches
or migraines or other things.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.690
Eating real food. You've heard Michael Pollan
speak. He talks about eat real food; not too

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:38.480
much, mostly plants, that's a good thing.
And-and I think that's really sort of common

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.599
sense eating lots of fruits and vegetables.

00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:44.890
I mean I think less than 5% of Americans or
3% get their recommended five a day fruits

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:50.099
and vegetables. Lots of fiber; good quality
protein; and Omega-3 fats which are incredibly

00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:56.029
important for your brain; a multi-vitamin
is also very important and-and this is a whole

00:45:56.029 --> 00:45:59.650
concept that I think hasn't really been talked
about enough in relationship to the brain,

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:01.890
but your brain runs on nutrients.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:06.609
What do nutrients do? They-they actually are
the helpers or the co-factors for all the

00:46:06.609 --> 00:46:08.450
chemicals and reactions in your brain.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:14.180
And if you don't have adequate levels of nutrients
you can't actually regulate your brain function

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:19.269
properly. So having adequate levels of nutrients
particularly the methylating nutrients: B6,

00:46:19.269 --> 00:46:24.339
folate, B12, Vitamin D, Omega-3 fats, these
are critical for brain function.

00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:28.200
And then we personalize the care based on
optimizing your nutrition, balancing your

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.079
hormones, cooling off inflammations, fixing
your gut, all these nodes in the network.

00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:36.920
We help to tune them up. It's like a metabolic
tune up. We help you detoxify and boost energy

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:40.069
in yourself and we help you learn how to calm
your mind.

00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:43.480
And-and-and what I do is I have a bunch of
stories here and cases that teach you how

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.600
to treat the fire and not the smoke that-that
sort of go through this a little bit.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.010
And I-I thought maybe I would just stop here
rather than go through all these stories 'cause

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:56.089
I've given you the broad view and-and invite
you to ask questions and to explore and to

00:46:56.089 --> 00:47:00.520
sort of think with me about how you can power
up your brain a little better.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.980
So thank you and I look forward to some questions.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.980
[applause]

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:09.000
&gt;&gt;Liv Wu: Are there any questions?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
[pause]

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:22.930
&gt;&gt;male in audience #1: I was wondering what
your thoughts are on how if all of this, if

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:30.410
your program is very personalized how does
that stack up in a world where all of our

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:31.900
results are judged by clinical trials and
everything that can't be personalized?

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:39.495
You know you look at a single drug and they
say, "Well in a population, here's the results."

00:47:39.495 --> 00:47:40.495
Your technique doesn't work with that.

00:47:40.495 --> 00:47:41.495
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Yeah.

00:47:41.495 --> 00:47:44.519
Well you're-you're exactly right. And I was
at a NIH think tank recently on complexity

00:47:44.519 --> 00:47:50.279
in-in-in systems research. It's not something,
and I have funds and research is driven by

00:47:50.279 --> 00:47:54.460
drug development which is a single drug for
a single disease looking at a single end point.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:59.109
But we don't live like that. That's not human
beings. In fact if you look at clinical trials

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:03.609
they don't really reflect real people in the
real world. And-and they're helpful in certain

00:48:03.609 --> 00:48:08.559
ways to identify the benefits of certain treatments.
And-and-and you have to look at the collective

00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:13.900
data not this-this sort of evidence based
they call it the randomized clinical trial

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:15.089
or control trial.

00:48:15.089 --> 00:48:21.170
These-these actually distort the-the larger
body of research which is that the basic science,

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:27.200
the-the epidemiologic research, the observational
research, and the whole body of-of data points

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.200
together.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.079
And-and if you look at actually the practice
of medicine today very little of it is actually

00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:35.690
evidence based. Probably 70% of it doesn't
have clinical trials to support it.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:40.599
And-and this model has to be looked at differently.
I-I think that the instructive kind of work

00:48:40.599 --> 00:48:44.930
that Sergey's doing looking at-at patterns
in the data and collecting large amounts of

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:49.579
data and then looking at-at-at results based
on that as opposed to the-the sort of traditional

00:48:49.579 --> 00:48:53.240
way we do science which is at a glacial pace,
is really the future of health care. And-and

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:56.960
this model lends itself perfectly to that.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.960
Yeah.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:03.180
&gt;&gt;male in audience #2: I've got two questions
so I'll take turns with another person.

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:08.020
So consumers are confused, right? Like what's
the common thread running through all this?

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:13.640
They've got [inaudible], [inaudible], about
reversing heart disease [inaudible] reversing

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:17.020
diabetes, and then your supplements [inaudible].

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:20.890
So keeping things simple what's common thread
that's running through all these different

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.990
speakers and experts that we should do? Like
something actionable that we should do?

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:28.980
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Right, well I think the
common thread, some of the simple things are-are

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:33.410
really important and I sort of talked about
just-just briefly which is realizing that

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:37.779
food is information and that the quality of
the food and the type of food you put in your

00:49:37.779 --> 00:49:39.460
body changes your gene expression.

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.431
So you have to have a healthy respect for
that and-and also-also understand that a lot

00:49:43.431 --> 00:49:48.079
of the symptoms that you have currently are
the, are the result of some input that's going

00:49:48.079 --> 00:49:51.569
in and you can change that input and have
a different outcome in terms of how you feel.

00:49:51.569 --> 00:49:55.869
'Cause most people don't connect how they
feel to what they're eating or doing.

00:49:55.869 --> 00:50:00.049
So simple things like changing your diet,
getting enough sleep, exercising, taking a

00:50:00.049 --> 00:50:04.020
few nutrients are simple things that you can
easily implement. And in fact the food service

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.740
here's so fabulous at Google it's not even
that hard, and see the outcomes.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:11.170
And I've talked to a number of people in the
audience today who actually came to me and

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:15.750
said, "Well we tried this, we did this, and
we saw these changes. And we can do this ourselves."

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.630
So there-there-there's some very simple common
sense threads that run through all of it and

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:22.839
I think if you listen to all the speakers
that have come and all that are gonna come,

00:50:22.839 --> 00:50:24.420
we're all saying similar things.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:28.869
The unique thing that I'm really saying here
is that, is that this is really not just about

00:50:28.869 --> 00:50:32.869
general wellness program this is about beginning
to understand the roots of illness and-and

00:50:32.869 --> 00:50:37.450
creating a model that's based on this-this
concept of P4 Medicine or personalization.

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:43.039
And that-that-that actually requires some
algorithms to help you figure it out.

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:46.150
And I-I think that's what's so exciting for
me to be here at Google is 'cause you guys

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:51.779
understand how to turn words into math. And
you-you can take the words in a person's story

00:50:51.779 --> 00:50:55.661
and you can take the biomarkers and data points
and we begin to create algorithms that help

00:50:55.661 --> 00:50:57.759
to customize and personalize care and treatment.

00:50:57.759 --> 00:51:03.160
And using feedback mechanisms through various
tools that we can develop that-that help us

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.799
create the quantified self in a sense and-and
get that immediate feedback. So we can customize

00:51:07.799 --> 00:51:08.799
and personalize it.

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:13.460
So while there is some general concepts that
are common to everybody it is also important

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.150
to realize that not one size fits all.

00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:16.150
Yeah.

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:20.070
&gt;&gt;male in audience #3: You mentioned some
of the tools we have here at Google to manage

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:21.550
stress. Can you quickly walk --

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:22.550
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: [laughs]

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:23.550
&gt;&gt;male in audience: us through.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:26.940
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Well you're an expert
in that. He's head of, well what's the department?

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.790
Massage services? [laughs]

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:33.109
So I-I think the things that-that you have
that I, that I've just noticed is you have

00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:39.519
outside. So there's lot of play out there.
There was all kinds of devices and courts

00:51:39.519 --> 00:51:43.950
and sand and volleyball and all sorts of things
to-to play and have fun. And that's a way

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:44.950
to reduce stress.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:47.549
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Right. Can you walk us
through what happens in the body if we do

00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:49.200
or don't manage stress well?

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.529
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Absolutely.

00:51:50.529 --> 00:51:54.440
So in terms of stress one thing we talked
about is heart rate variability.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:58.640
Stress leads to increased weight gain around
the middle. It leads to high cholesterol.

00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:05.539
It leads to high sugar. It leads to inflammation
in the body. It shrinks your brain in the

00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:11.640
hippocampus. It causes depression, it causes
cancer, it can cause heart disease. I mean

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:16.049
these are well described phenomena that happen
and also can make you feel badly and disrupt

00:52:16.049 --> 00:52:17.960
your-your normal cognitive functioning.

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:23.551
So-so looking at stress and its impact on
biology is-is-s very [inaudible]. I talk a

00:52:23.551 --> 00:52:27.589
lot about it in my book. But in terms utilizing
tools there's a lot of stuff you have here:

00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:31.980
the massage, you have exercise, even food.
You can stress your body by eating the wrong

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:36.380
foods. Having too much caffeine, too much
sugar, these actually raise epinephrine, adrenalin,

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:42.230
cortisol, all of which damage your-your biology
and your brain.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:43.230
Hi.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:58.710
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: Hi. Dr. a bit of a
plug for you for about a year and a half ago

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:00.859
I read your book and followed the UltraMetabolism
Diet and literally within a week or two sleep,

00:53:00.859 --> 00:53:09.980
stress level, certainly skin rashes, stomach
problems all of that just kind of went away

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:15.640
and-and continued to kind of stay away as
I, as I, as I continued to stay on the eating

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.640
the-the right foods.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.440
I'm-I'm so fascinated by the gluten thing.
There is something, so I try to get rid of

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.660
it completely from my diet, but is there something
good about it? You-you-you see a--

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:21.660
&gt;&gt;Liz Wu: It tastes good.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.660
&gt;&gt;Male in audience: and start hearing a lot
more about it, but you can eat gluten free

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.660
foods that are just, almost just as good –

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:24.660
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Yeah.

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:25.660
&gt;&gt;male in audience: and are getting better.
What-what is it about the food that it-it

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.660
is good or why do we keep using –

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:27.660
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Why is gluten here and
to it's --

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:28.660
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:29.660
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Well we choose grains
when we start agriculture and gluten was one

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:33.019
of the grains that was in wheat that we ate
a lot of and it became part of our diet as

00:53:33.019 --> 00:53:34.750
we became an agricultural society.

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:40.519
But our genes change .2% every 20,000 years
and we only became agricultural about 10,000

00:53:40.519 --> 00:53:44.720
years ago. So from an evolutionary point of
view we're not in complete harmony with eating

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.720
a lot of grains.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:53.049
Wheat is a particular unique grain in that
it has a very unique protein called gliadin

00:53:53.049 --> 00:53:59.069
and this-this plus other findings that we're
seeing now, for example, like wheat germ agglutinin

00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:05.210
and-and gliadin affect our-our gut function
and change our immune system and lead to things

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:06.210
like rashes.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.369
Like you said you had rashes all over your
body that can be from inflammation that's

00:54:09.369 --> 00:54:12.240
triggered from gut. And when you stop eating
it the rashes went away. And you had side

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:16.109
effects like your-your brain woke up, you
had more energy, you could focus, and you

00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:20.430
lost weight as a side affect 'cause if you're
inflamed you actually gain weight. So they

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:22.690
may cause inflammation like we will gain weight.

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:28.769
So I mean I like bread like the next person
and like-like flour and it's just sort of

00:54:28.769 --> 00:54:32.940
delicious products, but the reality is that
about 30% of us have a problem with it.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:38.030
And as I was talking at lunch we-we know that-that
increasing portions of our population are

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:39.030
sensitive.

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:43.640
They had 10,000 pooled samples of blood from
50 years ago and they compared it with 10,000

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:49.451
pool samples today, and they found that there
was a real increase of 400% in celiac disease.

00:54:49.451 --> 00:54:54.640
And that's not even latent celiac or latent
gluten problems which probably affect many

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.640
more.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:59.890
And we know that if you have latent celiac
you can increase your risk death from heart

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:05.232
disease and cancer by 35 to 75%, and that
99% of people who have this problem are not

00:55:05.232 --> 00:55:06.470
diagnosed.

00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:09.130
At-at Cigna they did a study there 11 mil
 –

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:12.420
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.420
[pause]

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:19.230
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: At-at Cigna they did a
study there of 11,000 subscribers and they

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:24.950
found that there was a 30% reduction in cost
in those people who actually identified gluten

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:27.140
sensitivity and eliminated the gluten.

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:29.930
So not only will it make people feel better,
but it-it had a direct impact on health care

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:34.859
costs. And 99% of the people who have this
problem don't know it.

00:55:34.859 --> 00:55:35.859
[pause]

00:55:35.859 --> 00:55:38.720
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So I was –

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.870
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: I want to say one other
thing about that.

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:43.670
People say, "Why all of a sudden do we see
this increase in gluten sensitivity?"

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:48.650
There's a couple of reasons. One is that I
think we've changed the-the actual protein

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:52.789
structure of the gliadin in the wheat and
that we know that as a fact and-and that may

00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:55.200
have different immunological affect on the
body.

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:59.009
But also we've changed our digestive system
and our, what we'll call our microbiomes.

00:55:59.009 --> 00:56:02.990
I don't know if you know this but there's
more foreign DNA in your body than your native

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:05.799
DNA from the microbes that live within you
and on you.

00:56:05.799 --> 00:56:09.720
That there's more foreign cells in your body
than your own cells from all the microbiome.

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.470
And they have enormous impact on our health
and our immune system.

00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:16.630
For example, in Africa they did a study recently
of hunter-gatherers they found that they had

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:21.470
a whole different profile looking at DNA analysis
of the bugs in their gut than we do today.

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.529
And that are in the comparable group of-of
people from Europe.

00:56:24.529 --> 00:56:30.380
And those-those changes have led to more allergies,
more asthma, more autoimmunity, and-and I

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.529
believe also more heart disease, and many
other things we see in obesity.

00:56:33.529 --> 00:56:36.339
So I-I think this is, this is just the tip
of the iceberg that we're seeing here.

00:56:36.339 --> 00:56:37.339
Yeah.

00:56:37.339 --> 00:56:42.380
&gt;&gt;male in audience #5: So I'm interested in
helping people like you make a long and lasting

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:43.380
impact. So my question is –

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.460
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: That's good news. [laughs]

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:48.269
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Who will continue your
work after you? How do you spread what you're

00:56:48.269 --> 00:56:52.670
doing, how do you spread behavioral change
in the consumer world like wildfire?

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:56.519
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: That's a great question
and I've spent a lot of time thinking about

00:56:56.519 --> 00:57:00.440
that. And I don't have a ton of time to answer
it, but I'll give you the short answer which

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:07.390
is I believe we need to create a disruptive
model for health and-and to-to create what-what

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:10.319
a friend of mine recently called a "disintermediate
strategy."

00:57:10.319 --> 00:57:15.819
Where we empower people to gather their own
data about themselves, both through questionnaires

00:57:15.819 --> 00:57:22.369
and through bio-biochemical and various blood
specimens and body fluid data; to input it

00:57:22.369 --> 00:57:29.990
into a computational model that recognizes
patterns that is predictive of what the imbalances

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:35.119
are in their systems; that then can be prescriptive
for what to do in a personalized way to identify

00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:36.119
the problem.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:41.549
So, for example, you [inaudible] could have
put in that you had rashes and that you're

00:57:41.549 --> 00:57:46.499
tired and you're a bit of gaining weight and
you have x, y, and z symptoms. Then you might

00:57:46.499 --> 00:57:49.890
have been suggested to maybe do certain types
of tests and ask your doctor, or you might

00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:54.420
be able to actually do home testing to actually
look at some of these things.

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:58.920
And then there may be other devices you can
look at to measure it through very sort of

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:03.849
quantified self techniques that we're learning
about. What-what's going on the other biometrics.

00:58:03.849 --> 00:58:05.990
And then you put all that into the system
and then it gives you certain outputs that

00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:09.329
tell you what the likely probability is that
you have gluten sensitivity or that you have

00:58:09.329 --> 00:58:13.510
magnesium deficiency or that you have trouble
with your gut flora 'cause you've taken years

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:18.010
of antibiotics for acne or all sorts of patterns
and correlations and relationships that we

00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:19.859
know exist that are out there in the data.

00:58:19.859 --> 00:58:24.849
And this is what was so extraordinary to me
is that the scientific data has not been looked

00:58:24.849 --> 00:58:29.520
at as a collective whole. It's like, it's
like we have the answers already. It's like

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:33.700
Dorothy and her-her ruby red slippers we-we,
she can go away any time she wants.

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:37.349
We have all the data points we need in the
current scientific research that are laid

00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:42.200
out like puzzle pieces strewn across the floor
and nobody's put the puzzle pieces together.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.650
And I-I think in terms of what-what you guys
do here at Google that's-that's so extraordinary

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:51.039
for me to think about is how do you take that
computational understanding and that ability

00:58:51.039 --> 00:58:55.839
to-to sort of use math to solve problems and
apply that to biomedicine and systems biology.

00:58:55.839 --> 00:58:57.700
That's what's exciting.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.670
I-I know you guys actually have the answer
to the world's health problems right here.

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:02.770
&gt;&gt;Liz Wu: Thank you –

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:03.940
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: You don't need me.

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.940
&gt;&gt;Liz Wu: very much. Thank you.

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.420
It's two o'clock. Mark will be over here signing
books.

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.550
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: I'll answer more questions
as I'm signing books, too.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:10.550
&gt;&gt;Liz Wu: Yeah.

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:11.550
&gt;&gt;Mark Hyman, M.D.: Thank you so much for
the time. I really appreciate it.

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:11.551
