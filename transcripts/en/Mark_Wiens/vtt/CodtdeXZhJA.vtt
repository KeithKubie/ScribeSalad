00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.510
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.540
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Peshawar,
which is an ancient city

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.060
in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
province of Pakistan.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.390
This is a city that I, one of
the cities that I most wanted

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.030
to visit in Pakistan because they're known

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.200
for their food culture.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.620
It's an ancient city.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.100
And so today we're gonna go
on a food tour of Peshawar,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.933
eat a lot of street food.

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.880
We're gonna explore the
ancient markets and traders.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.710
And so it's gonna be a
full tour of Peshawar.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.240
We are gonna start for breakfast

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.060
and I'm gonna share all the food with you

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.002
in this video today right now.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.585
(upbeat music)

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.440
Hello, good morning.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.273
- Vikas.

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:45.106
- How are you?

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.280
We're at the Hashtnagri Gate

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.200
in the old, ancient city of Peshawar

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.020
and this is where we're
gonna have breakfast.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.840
This is, we're just gonna
walk around for a little bit.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.670
- We just have a quick halwa puri here

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.050
and then the place which is for the payes

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.713
is, you know, just five centimeters away.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.334
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.084
(food sizzling)

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.470
- Quite a bustling stall here.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.310
They are flying on the puris,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.152
but they're deep frying the puris.

00:01:16.152 --> 00:01:17.280
This place is known for their halwa puri,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.160
and yeah, it's pretty,
very well-known, actually.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.333
It's packed in the morning.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.429
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.160
So there's always three
components to this dish:

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.350
the puri, which is the fried dough,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.310
the halwa, which is the
sweet semolina pudding,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.210
and then the chana, which
is the chana masala,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.724
which is the chickpea stew.

00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:36.997
(speaking in a foreign language)

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.487
Conditions are a little bit tight in here.

00:01:39.487 --> 00:01:40.988
I'm gonna grab one of the puris.

00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:43.483
I'm gonna start with the
chana, the chickpeas.

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.480
Oh, the chickpeas are amazing here.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.600
Some of the chickpeas have
disintegrated into the sauce,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.990
but others are still remaining whole.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.663
It's so flavorful, you
can taste that desi ghee.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:59.030
This is the halwa made from the semolina,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.863
and also desi ghee,

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:02.347
And it has kind of an orange color to it.

00:02:02.347 --> 00:02:04.463
(people speaking in a foreign language)

00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:06.673
Mmm, yeah it's like a pudding.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.600
Less grainy than other versions
that I've had, as well.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.133
Sweet, but I prefer the,
I prefer the chickpea.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.280
Some of the better chickpeas I've had.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.960
A small little golf ball,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.103
flattened golf ball-sized sweet puri.

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:31.159
Oh yeah, it's like a little pastry cake.

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:33.830
(engine puttering)

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.050
Breakfast was good; it's a
little bit on the oily side,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.180
to get the morning started.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.270
But it is, I especially
like the chickpea curry.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.330
We're gonna move on now to
eat another breakfast dish

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.390
that you cannot miss
when you're in Peshawar.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.239
- [Ali] This place is called Naiki Paye.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.110
This is a legendary--

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.943
- Naiki Paye

00:02:48.943 --> 00:02:50.697
- A very famous Paye in Peshawar.

00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:51.960
- Oh ho ho ho, yes.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.620
Okay, this is the, this is
gonna be the real breakfast,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.098
and you can already smell
the meatiness of it.

00:02:57.098 --> 00:02:59.060
(speaks in a foreign language)

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.780
Has to be one of the coolest
stalls I've ever seen.

00:03:03.294 --> 00:03:05.711
Ho ho ho ho, that's the meat.

00:03:07.111 --> 00:03:09.044
(laughs)

00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:09.877
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:11.927
(spoon scraping clay pot)

00:03:11.927 --> 00:03:14.510
(upbeat music)

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:30.700
Person grabs, fishes out some of the meat

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.570
and some of the trotters.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.840
He kind of scoops that around,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.060
puts that into your bowl

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.250
and then he reaches into
the giant, tilted pot,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.910
clay pot, and fishes out some of the soup,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.300
and then puts that on top,

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.470
and then finally finishes
up with some desi ghee,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.270
which looks like it's infused

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.560
with chilies and oil and spices.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.600
It looks so rich, so comforting and warm.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.867
One of the more beautiful
looking red oily dishes

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.620
I have ever seen in my life.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.980
And you can just see the meat,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.920
it's just, it's just ultra falling apart.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.930
So you've got the combination,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.630
it's like 50 percent of the cow foot

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.560
which has just been rendered down

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.760
into just gelatinous floppiness,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.310
and then 50 percent of the meat

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.710
which is just, it just looks like stringy,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.027
stringy fall-apart tender.

00:04:15.027 --> 00:04:19.290
Ho, ho, ho, it's just, you
can't even, it's so tender.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.540
And just dripping with the
desi ghee and that spice.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.080
Look at that meat.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.240
Okay, I didn't even get any of
the trotter on my first bite,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.970
but that's just the meat.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.643
Look at that.

00:04:30.643 --> 00:04:33.226
(upbeat music)

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:39.520
Mmm, oh the garlic in there,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.130
you can really taste the garlic.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.463
That's so rich.

00:04:43.427 --> 00:04:44.720
It's so oily.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.490
And that meat is so tender.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.360
It's just like all oozey-goozey
things all together

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.570
in one single bowl,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.100
that you can tell it's been
stewed for so many hours

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.950
until it just completely
harmonizes together.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.330
And then just wrapped up in
more just like liquid meat.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.630
That's going to be jiggly.

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:06.170
(upbeat music)

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.003
Whoa.

00:05:13.587 --> 00:05:15.390
The liquid collagen.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.300
That trotter, it's just,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.710
I mean it's the skin and fat combined.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.010
But it's so soft it just
melts in your mouth,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.900
but you've got every kind of like

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.240
oozey, gelatinous, like jelly texture

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.227
in your mouth all at the same time.

00:05:29.227 --> 00:05:31.162
- I always used to think that
the Bhawra had the best payas,

00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:34.314
but I think Chowry's has even
better payas than Bhawra.

00:05:34.314 --> 00:05:36.800
- Look at that chunk, look at
that chunk I just pulled out.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.040
Oh, and you get things that
hang, just gelatinous bits

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.790
that just can't control themselves.

00:05:50.376 --> 00:05:53.506
It's like one of the richest,

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:56.557
but most flavorful dishes I've every had

00:05:56.557 --> 00:06:00.790
and that's just like pure
glorification of meat.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.970
Another thing that you'll notice is

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.500
that the bread here, the tandoori roti,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.270
is thicker than most
versions that you'll have,

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.540
and that's because you actually need it.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.510
It helps because you have
to mop up all of that ghee,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.270
all of the oil, all of the fats,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.790
all of the gelatiney trotters.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.510
You gotta mop that all up with the bread.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.608
And so you have to have
that thick, spongy bread.

00:06:21.608 --> 00:06:23.780
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.768
It's a tradition to drink
green tea in Peshawar.

00:06:26.768 --> 00:06:28.200
So you'll see green tea all over.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.470
I am sure we'll be drinking
more green tea today.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.870
And what's great about it though,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.740
is it's just not green tea,

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.507
they also crushed a
few pods of cardamom in

00:06:35.507 --> 00:06:36.830
and boiled that within the tea

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.360
so you've got that essence of cardamom.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.193
- [Mark] Shukeriya.

00:06:39.193 --> 00:06:40.026
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:40.026 --> 00:06:41.010
That was amazing.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.400
Oh, shukeriya, shukeriya.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.110
One of the top dishes that
I've eaten so far in Pakistan.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.220
The garlickiness really stood out to me.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.570
And then just the, I mean
the trotter was great

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:51.970
because it was so soft and oozey,

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.070
but the actual meat is
what I enjoyed the most.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.790
From here we're off to just walk around

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.140
the historical center of Peshawar.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.485
It's an ancient city and this
was an important market place,

00:07:01.485 --> 00:07:03.530
which has now been restored.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.530
It's actually quite, kind of
calm and peaceful here today.

00:07:08.805 --> 00:07:12.410
(motor bike puttering)

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.573
Nice to meet you.

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.192
(upbeat music)

00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:20.109
(engine puttering)

00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:24.910
We made it to the clock
tower which is a landmark.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.880
And the clock tower was
built in the year 1900

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.424
by the British to celebrate
the Queen Jubilee.

00:07:30.424 --> 00:07:33.674
(motor bike puttering)

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.250
I've got just half my butt on the seat,

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.050
so I've gotta balance here.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.490
But we're gonna go to the other side

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.440
of the walled city, the old city,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.300
because there's a very iconic
and very ancient mosque

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.720
that we're going to check out.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.230
Everyone's in the back.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.600
Hello Micah.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.125
- Micah, hello.

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.048
(speaking foreign language)

00:07:55.048 --> 00:07:57.631
(upbeat music)

00:07:58.765 --> 00:08:00.390
- Whoa, that was a sharp turn.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.139
Okay, we're heading down
an alley, whoa ho ho.

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:04.962
(motor puttering)

00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:07.545
(upbeat music)

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.320
That kind of rattled around
those trotters in my stomach.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.393
We have just arrived.

00:08:16.353 --> 00:08:19.430
- This is Masjid Mahabat Khan,

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.983
located in Andar Sheher,

00:08:21.983 --> 00:08:25.149
which is basically the
old city of Peshawar.

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:28.399
- And this is an ancient
mosque in Peshawar.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.232
- Yes.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.010
- [Mark] Okay, step inside
of here, and it's just

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.180
this calm courtyard with marble floors.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.870
And what's really fascinating
is the front of the mosque

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.410
with the minarets and just
the detail, and the doors.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.020
Everything is white, but then the doors,

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.340
they have some blue tiles in them.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.041
It just feels that you have
taken a step back in time here.

00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:52.291
- [Micah] Come on, come on!

00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:56.644
(upbeat music)

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.400
- Okay, so we've walked
over to what is, in English,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.447
is the Storytellers Bazaar, but in--

00:09:05.447 --> 00:09:06.820
- Qissa Khawani Bazaar.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.660
- Qissa Khawani.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.230
It's called Qissa Khawani Bazaar,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.886
which is famous for storytelling.

00:09:10.886 --> 00:09:13.500
Since ancient times, this is a market,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.740
this is a bazaar area where people would,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.480
traders would come, especially
along the silk road, right?

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.299
They would share their
stories, drink tea--

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:23.030
- [Vikas] Bhindi qehwa.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.470
- Green tea, which is called qehwa.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.303
So that's what we're going to do,

00:09:25.303 --> 00:09:26.140
we're going to walk through the bazaar,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.940
we're going to have some
green tea, and, yeah.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.633
Very cool history, very cool place.

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.150
(motor puttering)

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.070
Just stepping down this alley,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.540
maybe it's going to
lead to another street,

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.740
it's kind of mysterious.

00:09:41.976 --> 00:09:45.582
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:45.582 --> 00:09:48.249
(pots clanging)

00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:52.469
(water bubbling)

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.203
The green tea.

00:10:00.203 --> 00:10:01.036
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:10:01.036 --> 00:10:03.120
The key ingredient that you
have to have with green tea

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.260
when you're in this region is cardamom.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.730
So he has a little mortar and pestle,

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.030
he crushes the cardamom
to release that flavor,

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:13.248
plops it into your tea,
lets it boil and simmer.

00:10:13.248 --> 00:10:15.593
It's going to be really nice.

00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:19.530
(pots hissing)

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.833
Oh, he's pouring it,
okay, I better get there.

00:10:23.963 --> 00:10:26.720
(people conversing in foreign language)

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.690
It's just an open floor space area.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.070
People used to get tea,
drink tea, tell stories,

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.941
just hang out.

00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:37.107
- [Together] Cheers.

00:10:37.107 --> 00:10:38.233
- [Joel] Cheers, man.

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:42.884
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:44.410
- Ahhhh,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.970
it's so good.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.940
Just that pure,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.860
I mean it's so freshly boiled,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.070
but the cardamom, that's
what really makes this--

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.690
- [Man] Yeah.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.630
- And part of the entire experience

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.463
is watching them make it,

00:10:57.463 --> 00:10:59.800
because that's such a
unique way to make the tea.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.970
It's really, and just
the ancient tea kettles.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.170
I'm sure that makes a difference
with the taste of the tea.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.273
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:11:06.273 --> 00:11:07.106
Shukeriya.

00:11:08.656 --> 00:11:10.190
- [Vikas] Shukeriya

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.920
(speaking foreign language)

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.760
- Well, that was great.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.830
Most people in Peshawar speak
a language called Pashto.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.660
And the name of the dish
that we are about to go eat

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.559
is called?

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:25.670
- [Vikas] It's maguvha, basically brains

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.576
and in Urdu you call it maghaz.

00:11:27.576 --> 00:11:29.907
- [Mark] Oh, in Urdu it's
maghaz and in Pashto?

00:11:29.907 --> 00:11:30.883
- [Vikas] Brain masala.

00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:31.930
- [Mark] Brain masala.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.610
- In Pashto, it's saal maguvha.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.770
- That's what we're gonna eat next

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.390
because we just saw a man who
is selling it right up here.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.723
He's gonna make it fresh.

00:11:39.723 --> 00:11:41.980
(speaking foreign language)

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.380
- [Man] This is buffalos brain.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.123
- [Mark] Buffalo brains, nice.

00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:49.706
(cooking flames whooshing)

00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:53.723
(food sizzling)

00:11:58.054 --> 00:12:01.304
(spoon tapping in pan)

00:12:02.323 --> 00:12:04.990
(food sizzling)

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:15.467
Okay.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:19.920
We saw the plate of brains

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.450
and we just could not pass
by him without ordering

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.870
a plate of brains, it's like
scrambled brains masala.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.333
Got some fresh tandoori roti.

00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:31.237
(upbeat music)

00:12:38.054 --> 00:12:38.887
- Mmmmm,

00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:41.196
ho ho ho ho ho.

00:12:42.193 --> 00:12:44.693
Ho ho ho, that is sensational.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.290
The brain is so creamy, and
like mashed up scrambled.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.060
You've got the tomatoes, the garlic,

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.530
and the coriander in there
really comes in nicely.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:57.580
Wow, that is impressive.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.870
And fried so fresh and hot.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.070
That's incredible.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.730
Okay next up I'm going to
try some of that chutney.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.500
I'll touch the bread with the chutney.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.990
It's like a tomatoey chutney
and then grab some of,

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.989
after that grab some of the brains.

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:09.822
It's okay to do it something like this?

00:13:09.822 --> 00:13:11.070
- [Man] Yeah, yeah,
it's the way you do it.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.553
- That's the way you do it, okay.

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:15.913
That is,

00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:17.830
that is amazing.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.697
And then with that chutney, that like adds

00:13:20.697 --> 00:13:23.160
the cooling, refreshing element to it.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.740
What I really like is the freshness

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.423
of the chilies and the coriander in there.

00:13:28.423 --> 00:13:31.006
(upbeat music)

00:13:32.682 --> 00:13:34.182
- Huh, huh, ho ho,

00:13:35.942 --> 00:13:36.775
mmmm.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.080
Okay, I could understand
if a Peshawari man,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.530
thinking of this, dreaming
of this in the winter.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.503
- Oh wow!

00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:52.552
Oh wow.

00:13:52.552 --> 00:13:53.665
- [Mark] That is amazing.

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:54.870
- I mean I would have regretted it

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.190
if I had not tasted this thing.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:58.093
- [Mark] Yeah, you
would have regretted it.

00:13:58.093 --> 00:14:00.130
- It's amazing, full marks!

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.270
- Unbelievably good, like the
brain literally just melted

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.986
into that sauce and masala and desi ghee.

00:14:05.986 --> 00:14:09.420
He is a master of brains masala.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.840
And that entire brains
fry cost just 90 rupees.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.843
So, that's like at the moment
122 or so to the dollar,

00:14:17.767 --> 00:14:18.981
so that's like 75 cents.

00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:19.814
- Yeah.

00:14:19.814 --> 00:14:21.410
- For that plate.
- Yeah.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.650
- Whoa.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.902
What a spot, what a dish.

00:14:24.902 --> 00:14:27.110
- I'm not surprised it was awesome,

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.278
but man, it was awesome!

00:14:29.278 --> 00:14:30.111
- [Mike] Hahaha, yeah.

00:14:30.111 --> 00:14:33.061
- [Joel] That was so awesome.

00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:35.312
(energetic music)

00:14:35.312 --> 00:14:36.145
- [Ali] Peshawari cap.

00:14:36.145 --> 00:14:37.628
- [Mark] Ah, Peshawari cap.

00:14:37.628 --> 00:14:39.228
- You want to try one?

00:14:39.228 --> 00:14:41.643
(exciting music)

00:14:41.643 --> 00:14:42.476
- Nice.

00:14:42.476 --> 00:14:43.759
- It looks good.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:47.710
- Nice, I like that design.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.112
- You look like a local, we
have loved Peshawars so much.

00:14:51.112 --> 00:14:53.471
We have decided to look like locals.

00:14:53.471 --> 00:14:54.671
- [Mark] Yes.

00:14:54.671 --> 00:14:57.338
(upbeat music)

00:15:05.108 --> 00:15:08.387
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:08.387 --> 00:15:11.304
(machine whirring)

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.070
It's so frothy, it's so, look at that,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.230
just, there's no sugar or anything in it.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.343
Just purely squeezed pomegranate seeds.

00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:27.655
Ho ho ho ho!

00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:31.530
Oh, that's incredible, naturally sweet.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.203
You've got that sourness,
but the froth, whoa, man!

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.140
I have never had that
good of pomegranate juice,

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.880
it's almost banana-ey,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.080
and like the perfect
tartness and sweetness.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.400
- [Joel] It looks like
an orange, you know,

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.510
and it's obviously a citrus.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.081
But that flavor is incredible, and it is,

00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:53.320
at first taste, obviously
it is not an orange,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.320
it's like lime, like the
father of lime, basically.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.940
- It's a mamong in English,

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.860
I believe, or something along those lines.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.463
And he just freshly squeezed it.

00:16:07.264 --> 00:16:08.097
Mmmm,

00:16:08.097 --> 00:16:09.640
mmm, to me it's more lemony,

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.700
but not really lemony either.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.370
You can taste the bitter pith
flavor of it, like a lemon.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.950
(road noise)

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:16.869
(pan clanking)

00:16:16.869 --> 00:16:17.702
Okay,

00:16:19.648 --> 00:16:20.648
ho ho ho ho.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.960
The next place we're stopping

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.940
on this ultimate food
tour of Peshawar is to eat

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.400
Peshwari pulao, and pulao is
very famous in this region.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.500
It's a rice dish, you
can smell the spices.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.900
There's chickpeas in it, there's raisins,

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.220
there's chunks of meat.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.570
They actually, I think they
make it that big pot there,

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.840
they cook it in the pot and
then when they serve it,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.255
they put it into this
big metal serving bowl.

00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:51.940
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:52.773
Okay, great.

00:16:52.773 --> 00:16:55.390
Just have some low stools to sit on.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.400
I'm going to put it onto a little stool.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.920
And then you can see he
got some meat in there,

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.090
there's some chickpeas,

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.090
you can see the spices as well in there,

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.810
right out of the pot.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.610
The raisins, or the
sultans, they just provide

00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:13.960
enough sweet and tartness
to contrast the saltiness

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.350
of the rice and meat, really
like, really aromatic.

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:20.590
And that beef in there is so good,

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.520
and just like a hint of black
pepper taste in there as well.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.048
- That tops any Sunday
roast I've ever had.

00:17:27.048 --> 00:17:28.813
That, that is comfort food.

00:17:32.662 --> 00:17:35.681
- [Mark] Yeah, this is good.

00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:37.533
(upbeat music)

00:17:37.533 --> 00:17:40.630
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.380
- Directly outside from
where we just ate the pulao,

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.480
there's a man who is selling
two different dishes.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.680
The main pot is lassi.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.450
The other is saag, so
he has a pot of saag,

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.350
which is like a wild spinach.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.740
He topped it with chili
flakes, he serves you the saag

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.270
in a little bowl with
a unique type of bread

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.103
that I haven't seen before.

00:17:56.103 --> 00:17:58.270
And then he whips up your lassi.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.687
(metal and ice clanking)

00:18:05.636 --> 00:18:06.469
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:06.469 --> 00:18:07.302
- [Mark] Okay.

00:18:07.302 --> 00:18:08.307
- [Man] Like this.

00:18:08.307 --> 00:18:09.431
(liquid pouring)

00:18:09.431 --> 00:18:12.594
(liquid sloshing)

00:18:12.594 --> 00:18:16.594
(man speaking foreign language)

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.373
- And serves it to you
in like a metal bowl.

00:18:24.376 --> 00:18:28.350
Whoa, oh wow, that is
so cool and refreshing.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.070
That's like buttermilk, frothy too.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.170
Oh yeah, that's great.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.130
Tastes like liquid cottage cheese.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.273
You've got to try that, that is awesome.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.243
- Yeah, it smells, it smells cheesy.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.190
I was expecting it to
be at least a bit sweet.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.150
It's not sweet at all.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.100
Yeah, that's great.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.230
- Okay next I'm going to
try some of that saag.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:01.020
And that's a really thick
bread, it's like a cornbread.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.360
Okay, grab a bit of this.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.580
Oh, and it doesn't feel buttery,

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.370
it doesn't feel like
there's desi ghee in it,

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.923
it feels more, like, watery.

00:19:10.878 --> 00:19:11.711
Mmm, mmmm,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.903
very nice.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:17.900
Well that's just like pure.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:20.420
You just taste like spinach

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.130
and then the dried chilis in there.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.588
Really healthy tasting.

00:19:23.588 --> 00:19:24.421
- Mmm.

00:19:26.602 --> 00:19:27.435
- [Mark] So healthy tasting.

00:19:27.435 --> 00:19:29.870
- So healthy, so nice, very nice, mm hm,

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.320
and the spice just kicks
in a bit late, but yeah.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.360
It's a good after taste.

00:19:37.224 --> 00:19:39.807
(upbeat music)

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.240
- Wow, that's just like the pure lassi,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.563
just straight, like, drinkable cheese.

00:19:54.307 --> 00:19:56.120
And just look at this,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.293
look at this scene.

00:20:00.354 --> 00:20:02.533
We are on the side of the road.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.313
There's just people all
around, surrounding us.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.300
Man, the people here are
so nice, so friendly.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.633
They've welcomed us in.

00:20:15.651 --> 00:20:16.854
- You from Thailand?

00:20:16.854 --> 00:20:17.687
- [Mark] Thailand, yes.

00:20:17.687 --> 00:20:18.520
- I know, I see you in Thailand.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.353
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:20:19.353 --> 00:20:22.233
Peshawar is, what a
city it is, what a city.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.053
Bye-bye.

00:20:25.335 --> 00:20:28.168
(energetic music)

00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:32.669
(upbeat music)

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.250
We've arrive to an area
called Namak Mandi,

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.130
so Ali was just explaining to me

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.452
that Namak means salt, Mandi
means market or bazaar.

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:46.030
So this is probably, it
definitely has history

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.040
as being a salt trading area.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.900
They're known for their meat in Peshawar

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.452
in this entire region.

00:20:51.452 --> 00:20:54.160
(speaking foreign language)

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:54.993
- [Mark] How are you?

00:20:54.993 --> 00:20:56.400
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.870
This is the main one, this
is the legendary spot.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.320
Animals are just hanging out here,

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.086
literally hanging out.

00:21:04.086 --> 00:21:05.470
(metal clanging)

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.680
- [Ali] So we will choose
the portion of meat

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:08.693
which we want to have.

00:21:08.693 --> 00:21:09.526
- [Mark] Ah, okay.

00:21:09.526 --> 00:21:11.945
- [Ali] And they will
cut it in front of us.

00:21:11.945 --> 00:21:14.570
(speaking foreign language)

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.490
- So you choose your chunk of lamb,

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.950
and we're going to get a
couple of different dishes,

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.280
I know we're going to get
some stuff on the grill

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.997
and then also a karahi,

00:21:20.997 --> 00:21:23.990
which is the rounded skillet pan.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.176
- [Ali] Because of the
skewers, skewers it.

00:21:27.176 --> 00:21:29.843
(meat sizzling)

00:21:31.765 --> 00:21:33.926
(utensils tapping)

00:21:33.926 --> 00:21:34.759
(pans sizzling)

00:21:34.759 --> 00:21:36.750
- And they're also making the
kaharis in the front here,

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.003
but look at this chicken display!

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.270
It's 360!

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.290
Oh, I just bumped into a car.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:49.048
A 360 chicken rotation, around a barrel.

00:21:49.048 --> 00:21:51.257
Ho, ho, ho, that's amazing!

00:21:51.257 --> 00:21:52.984
(pots clanging)

00:21:52.984 --> 00:21:55.651
(food sizzling)

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.410
So he's making the lamb kahari here.

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.240
You can see tomatoes are going here,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.623
and just the fat is just
sizzling out into oil.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.862
Oh, here comes in some chilies.

00:22:08.862 --> 00:22:12.902
(men talking in foreign language)

00:22:12.902 --> 00:22:15.943
Oh, yes, okay.

00:22:15.943 --> 00:22:18.193
Wow, that looks and smells incredible.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.500
It just sizzles in its own fat.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.650
Oh, the tomatoes, yeah.

00:22:27.484 --> 00:22:29.770
And we walked past the duck
underneath the chicken,

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.810
360 chicken formation again.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.210
But we have put in our order
for the kahari and the grill.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.610
And that's going to take
about an hour to cook

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.310
because it has to cook
until it's really tender.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:39.630
So in the meantime we're going to go over

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.030
to this really well-known
place where the local sandals,

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:45.170
which are called the chappalis, chappala?

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.407
- Yeah, this place, they
make Peshwari chappals.

00:22:48.407 --> 00:22:49.372
- Chappals, chappals, okay.

00:22:49.372 --> 00:22:50.860
- Peshwari chappals have
been famous for long,

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.570
but this specific shop is famous

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.530
because the Prime Minister
of Pakistan, Imran Khan,

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.240
he got a chappal designed
for himself here.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.710
And he buys from this shop.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.610
- Chappals, so that's the
next fashion accessory

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.817
that we need to get.

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:06.670
- This chappal is now a brand.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.880
- [Ali] And there's a
story behind this chappal,

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:12.070
when the Prime Minister wanted a chappal,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.340
he asked some of his friends in Peshawar

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.230
to get him a chappal
that has a thicker sole.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.490
So the guy came here
and asked the shopkeeper

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.718
to make a chappal with
a slightly thicker sole.

00:23:21.718 --> 00:23:22.551
- [Mark] Wow, cool.

00:23:22.551 --> 00:23:24.480
- But the shopkeeper
ended up making a chappal

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.060
with too thick a sole.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.160
So he told the guy, I have made a mistake.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.930
The sole has become too
thick, so you might as well

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.920
take this chappal to the Prime Minister,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.401
who knows he like it?

00:23:35.401 --> 00:23:36.647
So when they took the chappal
to the Prime Minister,

00:23:36.647 --> 00:23:39.060
and he was like, wow, this is so good.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.380
- [Mark] Oh, okay, cool!

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.510
- [Ali] A world famous Greg Turr.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.343
- [Mark] Oh, yeah.

00:23:42.343 --> 00:23:44.294
- [Ali] And this is the
Prime Minister of Pakistan.

00:23:44.294 --> 00:23:45.949
- [Mark] And this is the
Prime Minister of Pakistan.

00:23:45.949 --> 00:23:47.210
- And you can see the Prime
Minister's picture over there.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:48.043
- [Mark] Yes.

00:23:49.806 --> 00:23:53.473
(speaking foreign language)

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.210
- They make everything by
hand in this little shop.

00:23:59.461 --> 00:24:02.411
Oh, I thought that was a stool,
but that's a giant battery.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.810
Okay, and this is very, very cool.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:07.873
- [Ali] This is the extra thick sole.

00:24:07.873 --> 00:24:09.428
- [Mark] This is the Prime Minister's one?

00:24:09.428 --> 00:24:10.261
- [Ali] This is the Prime Minister's one.

00:24:10.261 --> 00:24:11.140
- [Mark] Oh, extra thick sole.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.973
- [Ali] Extra thick sole, yeah.

00:24:11.973 --> 00:24:14.790
- [Vikas] And look at
its weight, it's light.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.540
- [Mark] Oh, what a sandal.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.950
- [Ali] Yeah.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.270
- Try this on.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.154
Oh yeah, I think this one
is a little bit small.

00:24:21.154 --> 00:24:25.321
(men talking in foreign language)

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.260
Sandal, I've never done
this much sandal shopping

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.093
in my life.

00:24:32.093 --> 00:24:33.670
I think I've decided on these.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.190
What do you think about these?

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.260
These are awesome, I
even took off my socks.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.420
Yeah, these are the ones right here.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.490
Immediately you can feel the airflow,

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.710
the airflow in these sandals, right?

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:44.820
You can really feel the airflow.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.490
- The toes have chilled
out to a new level.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.119
- I hope the people in
Bangkok will love these shoes.

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:50.233
- [Mark] Oh, yeah.

00:24:50.233 --> 00:24:51.387
- And they'll ask you about them.

00:24:51.387 --> 00:24:52.220
- They are so comfortable.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.110
- They are extremely comfortable.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.507
Very foamy, very cushioned,
they have a great cushion.

00:24:55.507 --> 00:24:57.247
- [Vikas] The dumba kahari will be ready.

00:24:57.247 --> 00:24:59.016
- [Mark] The dumba kahari will be ready.

00:24:59.016 --> 00:25:00.700
- From head to toe, we
are the Peshwari boys now,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.120
the Peshwari boys.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.703
(upbeat music)

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.533
(speaking foreign language)

00:25:10.533 --> 00:25:11.616
- [Man] Whoa!

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:14.803
- Yes.

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.060
So we're sitting in this section.

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.980
We got a whole booth with a carpet.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.773
And the meat should be ready.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:29.370
We got two different dishes.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:30.950
They prepared the lamb
in two different ways.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.440
One is the kahari, with all the
spices and the tomato sauce.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.370
One is the grill, so those
are like the rib sections

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:37.920
that have just been grilled up.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.250
(laughing)

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.300
- Ultimate position for eating, hahaha.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.800
So the grilled one is called the tikka.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.567
And these are lamb chops.

00:25:48.567 --> 00:25:50.936
- [Together] Cheers.

00:25:50.936 --> 00:25:52.522
- Mmmm.

00:25:52.522 --> 00:25:55.133
- It just fell off, I didn't even bite it.

00:25:55.133 --> 00:25:57.200
- It's just everything
you want in a lamb chop.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.600
It's so tender, I think
it's mostly just salt.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.820
There's not like a marinade of spices.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.930
It's just the pure meat
roasted over charcoal.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.093
The dumba kahari, lamb kahari.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.760
And there's, yeah, you can
see how they just reduce it.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.280
They reduce it, they keep on cooking it

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.113
until it reduces into a thick sauce.

00:26:18.406 --> 00:26:19.489
Whoa, ho, ho,

00:26:22.128 --> 00:26:24.050
the kahari does it again.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:25.640
This one is just very tomatoey,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.660
and you've got just big
chunks of lime there.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.350
You can really taste the
green chiles in there too.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.750
Follow that with a spoonful of raita,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.513
which is the yogurt
infused with coriander.

00:26:36.826 --> 00:26:41.826
Mm, mm, oh, like the dill
flavor, in that right now.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.703
That completes the
experience in your mouth.

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.900
And not to mention, both dishes
complement each other, so,

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.300
oh, is that some raita on my chin?

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.310
And once again, got
some Peshawari green tea

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.460
to finish off the meal.

00:27:03.183 --> 00:27:04.016
Whoa, that's hot!

00:27:04.016 --> 00:27:06.280
Oh, the cardamom is always so nice,

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.970
it always just hits the spot.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.570
And actually this is going
to be the end of the meal.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.326
This is going to be the final
meal of this tour of Peshawar.

00:27:12.326 --> 00:27:13.943
From here we've got to move on.

00:27:13.943 --> 00:27:16.623
What a day it has been in Peshawar.

00:27:19.472 --> 00:27:20.842
Ahhhh.

00:27:20.842 --> 00:27:23.410
It is time to utilize the cushion.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.243
Oh, ha ha ha.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.510
- [Ali] This is my signature position.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:31.105
- So your signature position is like this.

00:27:31.105 --> 00:27:33.355
(laughing)

00:27:34.454 --> 00:27:37.037
(upbeat music)

00:27:40.363 --> 00:27:41.710
- [Joel] The design is so simple and cool.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.360
- [Mark] This has been
one of the greatest cities

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.700
that we've visited in Pakistan.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.840
The culture, the ancient
streets, the action,

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.300
the colors, and the energy.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.080
and the people that we've interacted with,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.970
has been amazing, and this has
been some of the best food.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.870
I mean, Peshawar, I
wanted, specifically wanted

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.700
to visit Peshawar because
the food is so well known

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.680
throughout all of Pakistan.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.640
And I want to say a
huge thank you to Vikas,

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.960
He's local from here,
he's brought us around,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.230
and he did a lot of planning for us.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.964
And also to Ali for arranging everything,

00:28:13.964 --> 00:28:16.150
including our entire trip to Pakistan.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.770
So I'll have their links
in the description box.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.320

(speaking foreign language)

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.387
Peshawar, Peshawar.
