project and we have to some extent
 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.480
project and we have to some extent
picked up that work and remind all of

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
picked up that work and remind all of
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.040
picked up that work and remind all of
those links and all of the syllabi that

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050
those links and all of the syllabi that
 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.020
those links and all of the syllabi that
and thought he had back in the day are

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030
and thought he had back in the day are
 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.180

now to the extent that they're findable

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190
now to the extent that they're findable
 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.010
now to the extent that they're findable
we found them and have integrated them

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020
we found them and have integrated them
 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.470
we found them and have integrated them
into that base so I'll say a bit about

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480
into that base so I'll say a bit about
 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.570
into that base so I'll say a bit about
the agenda but first since I don't know

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580
the agenda but first since I don't know
 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.310
the agenda but first since I don't know
that we have any other explicit moment

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320
that we have any other explicit moment
 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.410
that we have any other explicit moment
to talk about it I belong to make sure

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420
to talk about it I belong to make sure
 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.140
to talk about it I belong to make sure
that everybody knew what the project is

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150
that everybody knew what the project is
 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.260
that everybody knew what the project is
and potentially where they can fit it

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270
and potentially where they can fit it
 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.820
and potentially where they can fit it
where they can connect with it so this

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830
where they can connect with it so this
 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.170
where they can connect with it so this
is you know a very simplified map of

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180
is you know a very simplified map of
 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.100
is you know a very simplified map of
what I think of as not really you know

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110
what I think of as not really you know
 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.260

components but the different levels at

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270
components but the different levels at
 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.540
components but the different levels at
which that levels at which the work is

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550
which that levels at which the work is
 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.080
which that levels at which the work is
being conducted so at the top it's

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
being conducted so at the top it's
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.460
being conducted so at the top it's
really a question about how you collect

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470
really a question about how you collect
 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.380
really a question about how you collect
syllabi where they come from what kinds

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390

of social and legal arrangements you

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820
of social and legal arrangements you
 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.210
of social and legal arrangements you
need in order to get a hold of them once

need in order to get a hold of them once
 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.309
need in order to get a hold of them once
and then get a hold of them again in the

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319
and then get a hold of them again in the
 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.690
and then get a hold of them again in the
future as we try and build a resource

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
