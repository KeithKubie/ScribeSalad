00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:15.704
When we think about learning,

00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.365
we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall,

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:19.673
books open on their desks,

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:21.941
listening intently to a teacher or professor

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:23.599
in the front of the room.

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.511
But in psychology, learning means something else.

00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:30.152
To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:32.283
that's based on experience.

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:34.379
Two of the main types of learning are called

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.021
classical conditioning

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:39.066
and operant, or instrumental, conditioning.

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.969
Let's talk about classical conditioning first.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.505
In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:48.404
did some really famous experiments on dogs.

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:49.736
He showed dogs some food

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:51.780
and rang a bell at the same time.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.290
After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.942
They would learn that when they heard the bell,

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:58.420
they would get fed.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.454
Eventually, just ringing the bell

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:01.915
made the dogs salivate.

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:05.461
They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell.

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.564
You see, under normal conditions,

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:11.015
the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate.

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:13.565
We call the food an unconditioned stimulus,

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:17.564
and we call salivation the unconditioned response.

00:01:17.564 --> 00:01:21.032
Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak.

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:24.313
However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food

00:01:24.313 --> 00:01:26.634
with something that was previously neutral,

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.202
like the sound of a bell,

00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:31.458
that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:35.086
And so classical conditioning was discovered.

00:01:35.086 --> 00:01:37.463
We see how this works with animals,

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.588
but how does it work with humans?

00:01:39.588 --> 00:01:41.405
In exactly the same way.

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:44.811
Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot.

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:47.766
She says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit,"

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:51.935
and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had.

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:54.856
A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up.

00:01:54.856 --> 00:01:56.408
He starts to put a mirror in your mouth

00:01:56.408 --> 00:01:57.859
to examine your teeth,

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.324
and he says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit."

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:03.747
Even though you know the mirror won't hurt,

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:05.195
you jump out of the chair and run,

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:06.924
screaming from the room.

00:02:06.924 --> 00:02:08.604
When you went to get a shot,

00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:10.852
the words, "This won't hurt a bit,"

00:02:10.852 --> 00:02:12.467
became a conditioned stimulus

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.628
when they were paired with pain of the shot,

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:16.637
the unconditioned stimulus,

00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:18.798
which was followed by your conditioned response

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:21.270
of getting the heck out of there.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.008
Classical conditioning in action.

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.267
Operant conditioning explains how consequences

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:29.142
lead to changes in voluntary behavior.

00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:31.478
So how does operant conditioning work?

00:02:31.478 --> 00:02:34.730
There are two main components in operant conditioning:

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.989
reinforcement and punishment.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.777
Reinforcers make it more likely

00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:40.525
that you'll do something again,

00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:42.708
while punishers make it less likely.

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:45.869
Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative,

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.134
but this doesn't mean good and bad.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.490
Positive means the addition of a stimulus,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.951
like getting dessert after you finish your veggies,

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:55.264
and negative means the removal of a stimulus,

00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:56.965
like getting a night of no homework

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:59.469
because you did well on an exam.

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.176
Let's look at an example of operant conditioning.

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:03.995
After eating dinner with your family,

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:06.522
you clear the table and wash the dishes.

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:08.724
When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug

00:03:08.724 --> 00:03:11.108
and says, "Thank you for helping me."

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.267
In this situation, your mom's response

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:15.896
is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.689
to repeat the operant response,

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.611
which is to clear the table and wash the dishes.

00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:24.038
Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives.

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:25.533
There aren't many things we do

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.473
that haven't been influenced at some point

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:29.308
by operant conditioning.

00:03:29.308 --> 00:03:31.080
We even see operant conditioning

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.121
in some extraordinary situations.

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:36.461
One group of scientists showed the power

00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.501
of operant conditioning

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:40.390
by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.725
Using food as a positive reinforcer,

00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:44.142
scientists have taught pigeons

00:03:44.142 --> 00:03:46.392
to select paintings by Monet

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.388
over those by Picasso.

00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:50.644
When showed works of other artists,

00:03:50.644 --> 00:03:53.436
scientists observed stimulus generalization

00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:55.229
as the pigeons chose the Impressionists

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.754
over the Cubists.

00:03:56.754 --> 00:03:58.609
Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.535
to paint their own masterpieces.
