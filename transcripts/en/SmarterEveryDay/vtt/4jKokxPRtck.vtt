00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.020
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.040
So some of my favorite things to learn are those things that I've seen for several years

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.080
and I've made a lot of observations and I kind of think I get it, you know.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.120
I mean, like really get it. And then I find out, I don't.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.260
So when I first saw what I'm about to show you, it blew my mind because it was

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.290
so simple I should have seen it my entire life but I didn't. Look at this bird.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.330
The muscle that flaps the wing is here toward the center, and he pushes down on the wing.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.370
But the feathers going out towards the edge of the wing are overlapping in such a way

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.390
that they all push together on the down-stroke, but on the back stroke they

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.450
delaminate, allowing them to open up like louvers and allowing the wind

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.480
to pass through them. This means there's a lot less resistance on the back stroke.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Basically this bird wing is a biomechanical check valve. That's amazing.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.520
I've never thought about that, but I saw it in the high speed video in Peru on the macaws

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.570
for the first time. This is why I've never seen it. 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.070
Look how fast it happens.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.580
There's no way I could have observed that.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.590
But watch the macaws on high speed and you can see for yourself, clearly the feathers are delaminating

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.610
on the back stroke. On the down stroke you can see that all the feathers

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.630
overlap in such a way that they provide a firm boundary layer that air can't pass,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.640
but on the up stroke look what happens. You can see that the wing separates and the feathers turn

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.680
so that the air is flowing straight in between them. You can even see

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.700
straight through the wing. I think that's amazing, so he has a lot less resistance on the back stroke

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.740
than he does the down stroke. Another thing he does to decrease this resistance on the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.750
back stroke is he's performing more of an elliptical sweep with his wings instead of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.800
just an up and down flap. So what he's doing is, on the back stroke he's pulling that

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.840
wing in, and he's decreasing the length so he decreases the surface area

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.870
of the total wing. That's pretty awesome as well. So one of the coolest misconceptions I had

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.900
is pretty clear to see on this red macaw. I used to think that birds just flap down

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.940
and they create high pressure underneath them and they push themselves up. But if you look

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.950
at this macaw something else is happening. Look at the back of his wing here.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.000
You can see that the feathers are being lifted up on the down stroke. What that means is we have

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.030
a low pressure situation there. It's like in engineering when we use something called

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.050
computational fluid dynamics. Basically what we do is we analyze the flow field and we figure out

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.110
what pressure situations we have at each location. Now you know

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.190
that on an airplane wing we have a low pressure situation on top. That's exactly what's happening

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.210
with this red macaw. So look at his wing and you can see that not only does he have a high pressure

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.250
situation on the bottom, but the low pressure is so great that it's pulling those feathers

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.270
off of his wing. That's amazing. So not only is he pushing down but he's

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.290
being pulled up on the same stroke. That's pretty awesome.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.310
Now this green parrot's doing the last thing that I thought was pretty wild. If you notice he is angling the tips

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.320
of his wings on the back stroke and pushing back behind him, so he's providing

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.370
thrust, but one thing that's happening that I don't really understand but it looks like it could be

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.420
true, he's breaking his wing in half between the secondary and primary feathers,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.430
and he's angling it and it looks like he's diverting that flow down,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.480
almost like a vertical take off Harrier jet. It's pretty cool, and I think it could be

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.520
happening, but I've never actually thought about a bird being able to provide downward thrust

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.550
on a backward stroke. That's pretty wild. So I thought I knew

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.590
how flapping flight works but clearly I didn't. Send this to any of your buddies that like to think critically

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.600
cause they'll do what I do now. Every time I see a bird against the sky I watch his wing

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.630
and on the down stroke right at that point where he's pausing to transition back to an up stroke

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.670
if you watch you can see sunlight pop in between the feathers because he's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.680
opened it up for lower air resistance on the back stroke, and I think that's awesome

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.700
because now I know how bird flight works. Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.730
Smarter Every Day and I'll leave you with this picture that my daughter made by gluing homing pigeon feathers to a piece of paper

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.770
to create her own bird. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.800
We are in the middle of a cotton field in Alabama. If you've never seen it, it's a really pretty sight.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.850
And what are we gonna do here son?
- Let this bird go.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.900
- We

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.940
- We're gonna let this bird go, but before we let the bird go, we're gonna talk about his feathers, aren't we.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.970
