00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
&gt;&gt; The brainstorming session assumes that
there was, in fact, a market

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.600
failure, a huge market failure, a failure
of the regularty system and

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.170
that you had this burn psychology that meant
that people thought you

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.380
could leverage-- from date endlessly and that
it was stainable.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.329
But more became real issue is who's gonna
share the blame, who's

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.910
gonna stand up and say we were responsible.
We apologize and take the consequences.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.250
In a reality of a sector there are rules of
law.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.150
But here working people are the victims of
the system that was simply

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.760
about casino capitalism and yet here at Davos
today as a labor leader

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.130
on continued we could no body take the blame.
It is absolutely horrendous that 50 million

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.510
more unemployed people will
be the victims of a financial system that

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.680
got out of whack because
people were basically hooked on greed.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.789
We need to make sure that the resources are
distributed more over

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:12.539
equivocally that working people not only have
jobs but the decent jobs,

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.130
the jobs where they have rights, collective
bargaining rights,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.659
and that there is a frame work for global
regulation, not just national

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.409
but global regulation, that sees this could
never happen again.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.869
So there's a little bit more need for-- humility
for or honesty and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.109
acknowledgement that the financial leaders,
the corporate leaders who

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.659
played into that financial environment got
it wrong.
