00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.881
- [Instructor] The following is

00:00:01.881 --> 00:00:04.410
the balance sheet of First Superior Bank.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.420
And so it's here on the asset side,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.330
it has $200 of reserves
and $1,800 of loans

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.390
so its total assets are $2,000.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.790
And then that should be the same

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.590
as its liabilities and equity.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.530
And we see here that it has
$2,000 in demand deposits,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.950
that's a liability 'cause
people can come to the bank

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.510
and say, "Hey, I want that money."

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.110
These are checkable deposits so they

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.460
could even try to withdraw that money.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.390
And since all of that
$2,000 is on the liability

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.580
side there's no equity right over here.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.020
These two should sum up to $2,000,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.363
the same as you have on your assets side.

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:44.363
Assume that the required
reserve ratio is 10%.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.930
And just as a review, that's
the percent of deposits

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.286
that the bank needs to keep as reserves

00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:52.766
and we can see that it's at
that reserve ratio right now.

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:57.546
It has $2,000 in deposits
and so it needs to keep 10%

00:00:57.546 --> 00:01:01.720
as reserves, 10% of $2,000 is $200,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.845
so it's at its minimum reserves already.

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:09.300
Part A says what is the
dollar value of new loans

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.610
that First Superior
Bank can make, explain.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.710
Pause this video and see if you

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.483
can figure that out yourself.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.960
Well as I just mentioned,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.410
this bank is already at
its minimum reserves.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.220
It's already loaned out
as much as it could.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.120
If you get $2,000 in deposits
and you have a 10% reserve

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.330
ratio, that means you can
loan out 90% of that $2,000

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.604
and it has already loaned
out 90% of the $2,000.

00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:38.420
So what is the dollar value of new loans

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.290
that First Superior Bank can make?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.820
Well it's zero dollars.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.357
Zero dollars because
already at minimum reserves.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.173
Minimum reserves.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.120
Alright, let's do part B.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.770
Mr. Smith deposits $100 of
cash in a demand deposit

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.881
account in First Superior Bank.

00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:08.217
Calculate the maximum amount of new loans

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:11.710
that First Superior Bank can now make.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.720
So pause this video again

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.890
and see if you can figure that out.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.190
Well there's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.080
Before Mr. Smith makes
that deposit we already saw

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.229
in part A that First Superior
Bank can't make any new loans

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:27.743
and so now if it gets $100
of cash in a demand deposit

00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:30.379
account because the reserve ratio is 10%,

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.811
the bank needs to keep 10%
of that deposit as reserves

00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:37.080
and it can loan out the other 90%.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.250
So you could just say well it
could loan out 90% of that new

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.737
deposit and so it would be 90% times $100

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:50.998
which is equal to $90 of new loans.

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:53.370
Another way that you
could think about it is

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.040
after Mr. Smith's deposit,
the demand deposits right over

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.790
here goes to $2,100 and
that increase in liabilities

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.510
is offset by an increase in assets.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.460
It just got $100 of cash so the reserves

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.998
go from $200 to $300.

00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:13.939
Now at this point, First
Superior Bank is clearly above

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.660
its minimum reserve requirements.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.740
300 over 2,100 is more than 10%.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.760
So it can loan out some money.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.270
How much could it loan out?

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.878
Well it has to keep 10%
of this $2,100 as reserves

00:03:27.878 --> 00:03:32.740
so it needs to keep $210 right over here

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.480
and so that other $90 it could loan out.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.830
And so this could be $1,890

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.193
and so it can make $90 in new loans.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.480
As a result of Mr.
Smith's $100 cash deposit,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.142
calculate the maximum change over time

00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:53.556
in each of the following
in the banking system.

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:57.400
So part one is loans, so
what's the maximum change

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.040
over time in the banking system of loans?

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.990
Pause this video, try to figure it out.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.529
Well as we just said Mr.
Smith by depositing $100.

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:10.155
First Superior Bank can make $90 of loans

00:04:10.155 --> 00:04:12.842
so that would be $90 of
new loans but then whoever

00:04:12.842 --> 00:04:15.850
they loan that money to,
they could then deposit

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.960
that in a bank and then
that bank could loan out

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.960
90% of that, so then it
would be plus 0.9 times 90.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.130
Now this bank that got 0.9
times $90 which is $81,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.390
it can then loan out 90% of that.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.203
So it's gonna be plus 0.9 times this,

00:04:37.203 --> 00:04:40.657
so 0.9 squared times 90
and you just keep going

00:04:40.657 --> 00:04:42.845
like this and then this
gives us essentially

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.100
the equation for the multiplier

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.670
which you might have memorized.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.740
This is just going to be equal

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.740
to 90 times one over one
minus you could say this 0.9

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:58.208
or you could say this is the same thing as

00:04:58.208 --> 00:05:03.130
90 times one over the
reserve ratio which is 0.1

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.990
and one over .1 is 10 so this
is going to be equal to $900.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.670
Now what is going to be the maximum

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.440
change over time in demand deposits?

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.673
Pause this video again and
try to figure that out.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.010
When Mr. Smith first
deposits that $100 in cash

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.050
at First Superior Bank,
that creates a $100 increase

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.880
demand deposit here on First
Superior Bank's balance sheet.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.110
So that is, let me just write it this way.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.700
So you have 100 but then we
already said that First Superior

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.690
Bank could loan out as much as
90% of that and whoever they

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.410
loan that to, they could
put all of that into a bank

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.400
as a demand deposit and so
that's gonna be plus 0.9

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.684
times 100 and then that bank
could then loan out .9 times

00:05:49.684 --> 00:05:51.903
this and then whoever gets that loan,

00:05:51.903 --> 00:05:55.020
that could be, they could
deposit that in a bank

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.110
creating a demand deposit
so plus 0.9 squared

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.540
times 100 and it keeps
going on and on and on.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.310
And you could just view this
as this is going to be equal

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.310
to 100 times one over one
minus 0.9 which is the same

00:06:11.527 --> 00:06:16.049
thing as 100 times one
over the reserve ratio

00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:18.658
and so this is just gonna be 100 times 10

00:06:18.658 --> 00:06:23.482
which is going to be $1,000.

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:28.244
Part D, as a result of Mr.
Smith's $100 cash deposit,

00:06:28.244 --> 00:06:33.244
calculate the maximum change
over time in the money supply.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.670
So pause this video again
and try to think about it.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.277
So you might be tempted to say,

00:06:39.277 --> 00:06:41.367
"Hey, maybe that's just
going to be the same thing

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:45.000
"as the total maximum
change in demand deposits."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.957
But we have to be very careful.

00:06:46.957 --> 00:06:51.957
That first $100 already existed
as cash in the money supply,

00:06:52.486 --> 00:06:55.820
the maximum change is everything else.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.955
It's this part right over here.

00:06:57.955 --> 00:07:01.364
Mr. Smith's deposits $100 in
cash, that's not new money

00:07:01.364 --> 00:07:04.787
but then the bank can
loan out 90% of that.

00:07:04.787 --> 00:07:09.040
So that's $90 in new money
that someone could use

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.237
to then deposit in another
bank and so that other

00:07:11.237 --> 00:07:14.646
bank could then loan out 90% of that 90

00:07:14.646 --> 00:07:16.760
and we've seen this drill before,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.340
that was the exact same calculation

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.970
for part one right over here.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.930
This is just going to be
equal to 90 times one over

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.590
the reserve ratio which is equal to $900.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.820
Part E, provide one reason
why the actual change

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.844
in money supply can be
smaller than the maximum

00:07:35.844 --> 00:07:39.060
change you identified in part D.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.120
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.000
Well there's actually two good reasons why

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.190
the actual change in money supply might

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.470
be smaller than what we just calculated.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.206
One reason is if banks decide to keep

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:52.379
more than the minimum reserves.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:57.379
So banks, banks might
keep more than minimum,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.270
minimum reserves.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.150
So you could imagine even
though by law according

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.724
to this world, they have to
keep a reserve ratio of 10%,

00:08:13.724 --> 00:08:16.869
if on average the banks
decide to keep a reserve ratio

00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:21.140
of 20% then every time
they would loan out 80%

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.930
of whatever they get in deposits

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.520
and so you would have a lower number here.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.510
There's another world where
the people who get the loans

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.770
don't deposit all of that
into the banking system.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.890
So if you wanted a second
reason, we've already answered

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.150
their question, we've given
one reason but a second

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.420
reason is people might not deposit all

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.866
of their funds in the banking system.

00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:42.973
So I will leave you there.
