the reason I say
I'm a bookkeeper

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:21.541
is 'cause once
I was on a flight

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.142
from JFK to LAX,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.477

I had paid to see those shows,

but I was--
I was on the guest list.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.219
Uh...

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.622
I had told a friend of mine,

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:53.125
hey, heads up--
if ever I start talking too fast

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.460

00:04:57.696 --> 00:05:00.299

And that's what happened.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:11.644
So my friend drove me
to the psych ward,

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:15.848
and I had my interview
with the psychiatrist.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:18.984
And he asked me,
you know, "Why are you here?"

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.753
I said, "Well, I have a plan.

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:23.823
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna kill myself."

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:28.193
"Okay, great, um...

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:30.262
What are
the mitigating circumstances?"

00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:32.998
"Well, I just, you know--
I just--I just--

and so I'm just worried

I just don't want
to do that to other--"

00:05:44.843 --> 00:05:49.248
Okay. And they said,
"Well, what do you do?

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.384
For a living?"

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.056
And I said, "I'm a comedian."

00:05:58.724 --> 00:06:00.426
No response.

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.195
Totally chill with it.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:06.031
And went on typing
on his laptop.

00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:07.533
He seemed a little distracted,

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:11.103
and there was some sound
coming from his machine.

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:14.072

I get bored at work.

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:16.042

I'm doing this story,

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.779

something on his laptop.

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:39.231
Turned it around to me,
and he said, "Is this you?"

00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:42.835

and it was me,

and much better material.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.642

that you weren't having

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:09.095
It's not like I said
I was Richard Pryor.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.431

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:14.533

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:18.337

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:29.347
well, how wonderful
would that have been?

00:07:29.347 --> 00:07:31.517
But the last laugh was on me,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.552

on a mood stabilizer

I was doing a gig and--

by myself, down in Chicago,
bleeding,

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:02.981
and I had lost
all my identification

00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:04.984
and was making this noise--

[moaning unintelligibly]

00:08:09.654 --> 00:08:11.690
About an hour before showtime.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.327
And I called my mother
and said...

00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:20.099
[moaning unintelligibly,

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:23.335

about your website."

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.583
And I did
what my mother told me,

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:39.719
and I got
a first-class upgrade,

00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.088
'cause I was just
batshit crazy enough

to have that many points.

00:08:43.722 --> 00:08:47.860
And ended up taking--
yeah, almost two years off work.

And--oh, just--
I always like to say this.

anyone found out, you know?

what if somebody found out?

Well, oh, God.
Oh, God."

This is what happens
if somebody finds out.

"in New Brunswick,
New Jersey.

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:20.893
"Do you ever play there?
You don't?

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.895
"Oh, you should.
It's a great--

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:24.797
"That's surprising,
'cause I would think that your--

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:27.566
"I mean, not that I would--
I would never tell.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.935
"This is
completely confidential,

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:31.336
"and I would never--

00:09:31.336 --> 00:09:34.574
[whispering]
I would never tell anyone."

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:40.345
Um...I'm in
a county-stamped gown

00:09:40.345 --> 00:09:42.915
and a pair
of electric-green gripper socks

00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:45.918
that are not my own.

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:50.256
You tell whoever
the fuck you want.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.792
Because all is lost.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:10:01.033
But I went back to work
and I just--

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.469
you know, I just can't do
as much as I used to,

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:04.837
and I got all this shit

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:08.106
from this one fellow coworker,
you know?

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:12.278
"Hey, I heard what happened
in Chicago. Jeez."

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.545
"Yeah, it was a real mess.

00:10:13.545 --> 00:10:15.314
"I owed them a lot of money.

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:16.816
"I missed, like, six shows.

00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:19.952
It was a terrible,
terrible mess."

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:23.889
"Yeah, I've never done that.
I've never missed a show.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:27.125
"I had a temperature
of 475 degrees.

00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:31.797
"I was the temperature
of a fully charred pork chop.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:35.234
"I did a full 90 minutes,
lost control of my bowels,

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:36.535
"to standing ovations.

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:39.672
You got to make
those fuckers laugh."

00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:43.876
"Yeah, I guess
I was just worried--

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:45.544
"you know, I wasn't able
to think or talk,

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:48.714
and it might not be
as funny as I'd hoped."

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.984
"Yeah, comedy's
got to be funny.

00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:54.820
"It's got to be funny
to everybody.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:59.424
"If it's not funny,
it's not comedy.

00:10:59.424 --> 00:11:01.560
"You gotta check it out.
I test my shit.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.697
"I went to China this year.
I was not welcome.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:06.431
"It was extremely
uncomfortable.

00:11:06.431 --> 00:11:09.702
"I did not have a visa.

00:11:09.702 --> 00:11:12.271
"But I spent
three months there,

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:15.741
"I translated all my jokes
into facial expressions.

00:11:18.543 --> 00:11:21.547
Guess who has a tour
of the Jiangsu Province."

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:23.115
"That's awesome, man.

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:25.250
"So you don't ever get scared
of doing a certain,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.685
you know, type of gig?"

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.220
"Nah, nah, nah.
I love a challenge.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.792
"I was doing a pop-up open mic
at a live birth, and...

00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:35.727
"You know, of course,
the mom's distracted,

00:11:35.727 --> 00:11:38.297
"but you know, just to--
[choking up]

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:43.235
"just to be there
for baby's first laugh...

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:45.638
"You know, and I always--
I always do this closer

00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:47.706
"with the younger crowds--
please don't take it.

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:49.407
"I've been doing it
since the late '80s

00:11:49.407 --> 00:11:51.576
and it kind of pisses me off
'cause I see people doing it."

00:11:51.576 --> 00:11:54.045
And he's like,
"I've got this on tape.

00:11:54.045 --> 00:11:56.882
"But here,
you close your eyes.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.767
"Oh, shit.
Peek-a-boo is yours, man?"

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:20.906
"Yeah, I basically copyrighted
the entire human experience."

00:12:24.442 --> 00:12:26.745
"That's awesome."

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:30.616
Yeah, I guess, I don't know,
I just, I can't--

00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:33.919
I can't be as ambitious
as I once was, you know?

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:37.155
So--like right before
tonight's show,

00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:40.826
I looked in the reflection
of my Diet Coke can.

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:43.361
And I said,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:45.597
[in gravelly voice]
Hey, kid.

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:47.666
I want to see 20%.

00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:54.607
If not, 5.

00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:58.443
'Cause so what?
Who cares?

00:12:58.443 --> 00:13:01.480
It doesn't even matter.

00:13:02.614 --> 00:13:04.349
Thank you guys so much.
Thanks a lot.

00:13:04.349 --> 00:13:05.618
[cheers and applause]
