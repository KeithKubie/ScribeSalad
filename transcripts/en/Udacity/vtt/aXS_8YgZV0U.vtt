00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.310
In this section, we'll talk about how
to build user interfaces for wearables.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.620
The important thing about Android Wear
is that it uses the same underlying

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.780
framework as Android on phones does, so

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.578
anything you know about Android
applies to wearables as well.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:16.570
Key difference is, you want to design
your app to work well on a wearable,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.010
you can't just smoosh down your
phone app to fit on a watch,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.700
you really need to rethink your UI to
make sure it looks good on a wearable.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.210
A really good question you
should ask yourself is this,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.690
what couldn't we do on the phone
that we can do now on the wrist?

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.420
What now becomes possible?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.660
So in this section you'll learn about
the additional widgets that we've given

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.750
app developers to use that
are wearable specific, and

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.910
that will give a common look
to your Android wear app.
