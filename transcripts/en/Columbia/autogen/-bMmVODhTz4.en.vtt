the beginnings of sequence databases and
certain principles of open access and

certain principles of open access and
 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.530

that if we were going to make the

that if we were going to make the
sequence data available it was useful to

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.100
sequence data available it was useful to
 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.670
sequence data available it was useful to
have the associated abstracts from the

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900
papers also available and then we

and we can connect it also to the
 

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.010
and we can connect it also to the
protein structure database because the

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:17.020
protein structure database because the
 

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.140
protein structure database because the
protein structures when they come we can

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:19.150
protein structures when they come we can
 

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.110
protein structures when they come we can
mine out the chemical ligands that are

that way connect as well so these sorts

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:28.510
that way connect as well so these sorts
 

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.630
that way connect as well so these sorts
of connections can be useful and I'll

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:30.640
of connections can be useful and I'll
 

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.940
of connections can be useful and I'll
talk a little bit about how we currently

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:32.950
talk a little bit about how we currently
 

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.830
talk a little bit about how we currently
use that and how we hope to in the

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:34.840
use that and how we hope to in the
 

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.280
use that and how we hope to in the
future pubmed central has also become

international actually we always thought

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:39.400
international actually we always thought
 

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.860
international actually we always thought
it would have to be international that's

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:40.870
it would have to be international that's
 

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.090
it would have to be international that's
our experience with all the other

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:42.100
our experience with all the other

and the idea would be that the legal
 

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.040

agreements would be between the
 

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.200

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.050
publishers and then LM and n LM would
have agreements with other archives and

all of this has to be consistent it can

all of this has to be consistent it can
 

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.200
all of this has to be consistent it can
be a little bit of a bother at times but

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:01.210
be a little bit of a bother at times but
 

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.120
be a little bit of a bother at times but
most of that is flowing along fairly

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:03.130
most of that is flowing along fairly
 

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.130
most of that is flowing along fairly
smoothly the idea is to protect the

smoothly the idea is to protect the
 

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.900
smoothly the idea is to protect the

going to skip them multiple archiving

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120
going to skip them multiple archiving

going to skip them multiple archiving
centers it's pretty obvious that the

content is safer if it's available in
 

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.560
content is safer if it's available in
more different places but but there's

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:28.570
more different places but but there's

more different places but but there's
also other reasons to have multiple

also other reasons to have multiple

right now we're at probably around

move us up to closer to a hundred
 

00:21:46.929 --> 00:21:50.070
move us up to closer to a hundred
percent I think NIH's really tried to

kind of take a light hand with this but

kind of take a light hand with this but
 

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.990
kind of take a light hand with this but
by the times it becomes apparent that

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:55.000
by the times it becomes apparent that
 

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.590
by the times it becomes apparent that
they have to step that up forward

00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600
they have to step that up forward

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:18.150
 
so so the policy applies to all papers

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.160
so so the policy applies to all papers
 

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.560

that were coming out of research that

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:22.570
that were coming out of research that
 

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.610
that were coming out of research that
was funded back back here okay and so

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:26.620
was funded back back here okay and so
 

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.000

does not it does not apply all right so

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:34.030
does not it does not apply all right so

does not it does not apply all right so
yeah I think even if we even if we can

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:37.270
yeah I think even if we even if we can
 

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.300
yeah I think even if we even if we can
make the future look better with that

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:39.310
make the future look better with that
 

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.440
make the future look better with that
being in there there's still going to be

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:40.450
being in there there's still going to be
 

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.600
being in there there's still going to be
a lot of old content that that won't be

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:42.610
a lot of old content that that won't be
 

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.440
a lot of old content that that won't be
freely available I'm going to switch

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:46.450
freely available I'm going to switch

gears a little bit here and talk briefly

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:48.610
gears a little bit here and talk briefly
 

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.320
gears a little bit here and talk briefly
about what we call our discovery

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.330
about what we call our discovery

the motivations really for pushing more

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:57.100
the motivations really for pushing more
 

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.130
the motivations really for pushing more
with public access so this was motivated

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:02.140
with public access so this was motivated
 

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:08.820
with public access so this was motivated
because we we found that that there were

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:08.830
because we we found that that there were
 

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.030
because we we found that that there were
a million ways to improve pages and our

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.040
a million ways to improve pages and our
 

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.850
a million ways to improve pages and our
website nothing was right really in my

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:14.860
website nothing was right really in my
 

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.830
website nothing was right really in my
opinion everything could be improved and

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:16.840
opinion everything could be improved and
 

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.780
opinion everything could be improved and
we would sometimes put a lot of work

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:18.790
we would sometimes put a lot of work
 

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.520
we would sometimes put a lot of work
into improving something and then I

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:20.530
into improving something and then I
 

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.690
into improving something and then I
would look at what they didn't I thought

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:21.700
would look at what they didn't I thought
 

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.450
would look at what they didn't I thought
why did we prioritize that why did we do

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:24.460
why did we prioritize that why did we do
 

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.520
why did we prioritize that why did we do
that what was the goal of that it would

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:26.530
that what was the goal of that it would
 

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.290
that what was the goal of that it would
be much easier if we had something like

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:28.300
be much easier if we had something like
 

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.630
be much easier if we had something like
Amazon or we were like Google where all

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640
Amazon or we were like Google where all
 

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.310
Amazon or we were like Google where all
we're talking about is a simple

buying something here you know what what
 

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.270
buying something here you know what what
could we do and and what what became

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280
could we do and and what what became
 

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.620
could we do and and what what became
apparent was that we could take

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:40.630
apparent was that we could take
 

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.590
apparent was that we could take
advantage of a paradox that most users

that to be absolutely as I say it's a
it's a double-edged sword on the one

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:11.920
it's a double-edged sword on the one
 

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.710
it's a double-edged sword on the one
hand it makes it harder to get people to

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:13.720
hand it makes it harder to get people to
 

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.750
hand it makes it harder to get people to
good information on the other hand it

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760
good information on the other hand it
 

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.340
good information on the other hand it
allows you to see when you're when

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:17.350
allows you to see when you're when
 

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.870
allows you to see when you're when
you're improving because people won't do

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880
you're improving because people won't do
 

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.510
you're improving because people won't do
three clicks to get some place if you

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520
three clicks to get some place if you
 

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.830
three clicks to get some place if you
don't make it very easy for them they

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840
don't make it very easy for them they
 

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.590
don't make it very easy for them they
won't go

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600
won't go
 

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.460
won't go
and so our bottom line has to be

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:27.470
and so our bottom line has to be
 

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.470
and so our bottom line has to be
something simple and I call it

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:29.480
something simple and I call it
 

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.480
something simple and I call it
discoveries it's basically we need to

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:31.490
discoveries it's basically we need to
 

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.490
discoveries it's basically we need to
improve the quantity and quality and the

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:33.500
improve the quantity and quality and the
 

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.930
improve the quantity and quality and the
relevance of the information obtained

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:34.940
relevance of the information obtained
 

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.630
relevance of the information obtained
and viewed by our users and we need to

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:37.640
and viewed by our users and we need to
 

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.060
and viewed by our users and we need to
be able to wherever possible see that by

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.070
be able to wherever possible see that by
 

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.400
be able to wherever possible see that by
studying our web logs so we can design

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:42.410
studying our web logs so we can design
 

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.020
studying our web logs so we can design
sites in the beginning with interviews

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.030
sites in the beginning with interviews
 

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.880
sites in the beginning with interviews
we can go back and ask users questions

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:45.890
we can go back and ask users questions
 

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.919
we can go back and ask users questions
but in the end we have to really make

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:47.929
but in the end we have to really make
 

00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:49.270
but in the end we have to really make
sure that we delivered and we see a

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:49.280
sure that we delivered and we see a
 

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.669
sure that we delivered and we see a
change a quantitative change in how

00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679
change a quantitative change in how
 

00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:54.250
change a quantitative change in how
people are using our system so we do you

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:54.260
people are using our system so we do you
 

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.200
people are using our system so we do you
want to interview users but we focus

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:56.210
want to interview users but we focus
 

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.590
want to interview users but we focus
also on iterating constantly developing

00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600
also on iterating constantly developing
 

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.899
also on iterating constantly developing
a quantitative picture of how people are

00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:01.909
a quantitative picture of how people are
 

00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:04.330
a quantitative picture of how people are
using our site and then modify what

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:04.340
using our site and then modify what
 

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.060
using our site and then modify what
we're doing and then sing if that's

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.070
we're doing and then sing if that's
 

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.580
we're doing and then sing if that's
working better all right now it turns

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:09.590
working better all right now it turns
 

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.669
working better all right now it turns
out that it is not easy to do this it's

00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:12.679
out that it is not easy to do this it's
 

00:25:12.679 --> 00:25:16.330
out that it is not easy to do this it's
not intuitive and we're still struggling

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:16.340
not intuitive and we're still struggling
 

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.669
not intuitive and we're still struggling
with it but we can make we've made

00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:18.679
with it but we can make we've made
 

00:25:18.679 --> 00:25:22.180
with it but we can make we've made
quantitative easy to prove examples of

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.190
quantitative easy to prove examples of
 

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:24.340
quantitative easy to prove examples of
this and sometimes our users are not

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:24.350
this and sometimes our users are not
 

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.500
this and sometimes our users are not
even aware when we've made a change in

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:26.510
even aware when we've made a change in
 

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.720
even aware when we've made a change in
the system and we can see that that a

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:28.730
the system and we can see that that a
 

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:29.950
the system and we can see that that a
certain fraction of the users are doing

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960
certain fraction of the users are doing
 

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.310
certain fraction of the users are doing
better with it so one thing you can see

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320
better with it so one thing you can see
 

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.260
better with it so one thing you can see
and this is true for many sites this

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:35.270
and this is true for many sites this
 

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.180
and this is true for many sites this
data is no one correct for our site but

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.190
data is no one correct for our site but
 

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.680
data is no one correct for our site but
it doesn't really matter you can treat

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:38.690
it doesn't really matter you can treat
 

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.409
it doesn't really matter you can treat
this as an abstract if you wish that

00:25:40.409 --> 00:25:40.419
this as an abstract if you wish that
 

00:25:40.419 --> 00:25:42.970
this as an abstract if you wish that
that typically with any kind of search

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:42.980
that typically with any kind of search
 

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.850
that typically with any kind of search
system people will do a search and

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:44.860
system people will do a search and
 

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.750
system people will do a search and
sometimes they'll click right away but

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760
sometimes they'll click right away but
 

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.730
sometimes they'll click right away but
sometimes they modify the search as soon

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:48.740
sometimes they modify the search as soon
 

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.680
sometimes they modify the search as soon
as they see the results and then they'll

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:50.690
as they see the results and then they'll
 

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:51.970
as they see the results and then they'll
find the click something or sometimes

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:51.980
find the click something or sometimes
 

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.770
find the click something or sometimes
they'll go back and do three different

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:53.780
they'll go back and do three different
 

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:55.539
they'll go back and do three different
searches and they'll click and you see a

00:25:55.539 --> 00:25:55.549
searches and they'll click and you see a
 

00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:57.100
searches and they'll click and you see a
distribution it looks like this and

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:57.110
distribution it looks like this and
 

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.810
distribution it looks like this and
different search systems depending on

00:25:58.810 --> 00:25:58.820
different search systems depending on
 

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.690
different search systems depending on
how well they work will have different

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:00.700
how well they work will have different
 

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.580
how well they work will have different
decay curves like that but that also

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:03.590
decay curves like that but that also
 

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.470
decay curves like that but that also
tells you that your query logs have a

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480
tells you that your query logs have a
 

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.180
tells you that your query logs have a
lot of useful information in them

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:07.190
lot of useful information in them
 

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.640
lot of useful information in them
because people are typing inquiries and

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:09.650
because people are typing inquiries and
 

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.049
because people are typing inquiries and
then you can see do they click or not

00:26:11.049 --> 00:26:11.059
then you can see do they click or not
 

00:26:11.059 --> 00:26:12.549
then you can see do they click or not
what's happening what did they actually

00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559
what's happening what did they actually
 

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:14.440
what's happening what did they actually
type what's the similarity of the

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:14.450
type what's the similarity of the
 

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:16.360
type what's the similarity of the
queries to each other and so you can

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:16.370
queries to each other and so you can
 

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.200
queries to each other and so you can
mine the query logs in useful ways and

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.210
mine the query logs in useful ways and
 

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.740
mine the query logs in useful ways and
and one way to do that is through

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:22.750
and one way to do that is through
 

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.180
and one way to do that is through
determining related queries basically

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:25.190
determining related queries basically
 

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.750
determining related queries basically
over here we have also try all right now

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760
over here we have also try all right now
 

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.850
over here we have also try all right now
we have a drop-down that actually sort

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:30.860
we have a drop-down that actually sort
 

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.830
we have a drop-down that actually sort
of steals the fraction of users that use

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840
of steals the fraction of users that use
 

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.289
of steals the fraction of users that use
this but this is based on on looking at

00:26:37.289 --> 00:26:37.299
this but this is based on on looking at
 

00:26:37.299 --> 00:26:39.479
this but this is based on on looking at
that are more specific than the user's

00:26:39.479 --> 00:26:39.489
that are more specific than the user's
 

00:26:39.489 --> 00:26:43.409
that are more specific than the user's
query and and that match it well and and

00:26:43.409 --> 00:26:43.419
query and and that match it well and and
 

00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:45.539
query and and that match it well and and
and these become suggested queries that

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:45.549
and these become suggested queries that
 

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:47.549
and these become suggested queries that
that might be better for the user than

00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559
that might be better for the user than
 

00:26:47.559 --> 00:26:51.239
that might be better for the user than
this and we find is that that related

00:26:51.239 --> 00:26:51.249
this and we find is that that related
 

00:26:51.249 --> 00:26:54.419
this and we find is that that related
queries ad has worked very well we get a

00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:54.429
queries ad has worked very well we get a
 

00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:56.940
queries ad has worked very well we get a
click-through rate of over six percent

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:56.950
click-through rate of over six percent
 

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.549
click-through rate of over six percent
with that now as I say we the drop-down

00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559
with that now as I say we the drop-down
 

00:26:59.559 --> 00:27:01.619
with that now as I say we the drop-down
more of our users are using that and so

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:01.629
more of our users are using that and so
 

00:27:01.629 --> 00:27:03.029
more of our users are using that and so
the number of people who end up having

00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039
the number of people who end up having
 

00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:05.430
the number of people who end up having
to use the the related queries ad is

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440
to use the the related queries ad is
 

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.499
to use the the related queries ad is
less but it's using the same kind of

00:27:07.499 --> 00:27:07.509
less but it's using the same kind of
 

00:27:07.509 --> 00:27:09.570
less but it's using the same kind of
information so this is kind of thing

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:09.580
information so this is kind of thing
 

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.729
information so this is kind of thing
that we do with everything now on our

00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:11.739
that we do with everything now on our
 

00:27:11.739 --> 00:27:13.529
that we do with everything now on our
site it takes a while to work through

00:27:13.529 --> 00:27:13.539
site it takes a while to work through
 

00:27:13.539 --> 00:27:14.879
site it takes a while to work through
all the pages and to keep revisiting

00:27:14.879 --> 00:27:14.889
all the pages and to keep revisiting
 

00:27:14.889 --> 00:27:17.220
all the pages and to keep revisiting
things another example is for the

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:17.230
things another example is for the
 

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.109
things another example is for the
nucleotide database if you look at the

00:27:19.109 --> 00:27:19.119
nucleotide database if you look at the
 

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:20.700
nucleotide database if you look at the
query logs you see that a lot of the

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:20.710
query logs you see that a lot of the
 

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.409
query logs you see that a lot of the
queries that users are making really

00:27:22.409 --> 00:27:22.419
queries that users are making really
 

00:27:22.419 --> 00:27:24.149
queries that users are making really
would be better if they were queries in

00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159
would be better if they were queries in
 

00:27:24.159 --> 00:27:27.479
would be better if they were queries in
the genes database that information is

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:27.489
the genes database that information is
 

00:27:27.489 --> 00:27:29.820
the genes database that information is
more curated and it's more organized and

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:29.830
more curated and it's more organized and
 

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.289
more curated and it's more organized and
if you're using a gene name as a query

00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:31.299
if you're using a gene name as a query
 

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:33.629
if you're using a gene name as a query
it's probably a better place to go and

00:27:33.629 --> 00:27:33.639
it's probably a better place to go and
 

00:27:33.639 --> 00:27:37.919
it's probably a better place to go and
so we put this little ad at the top here

00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:37.929
so we put this little ad at the top here
 

00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:40.470
so we put this little ad at the top here
that if you're looking for gene

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480
that if you're looking for gene
 

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.940
that if you're looking for gene
information you might want to click

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:41.950
information you might want to click
 

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:47.099
information you might want to click
there and and what we find I've switched

00:27:47.099 --> 00:27:47.109
there and and what we find I've switched
 

00:27:47.109 --> 00:27:48.840
there and and what we find I've switched
already but what we find is a very high

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:48.850
already but what we find is a very high
 

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.249
already but what we find is a very high
fraction it started off at about

00:27:50.249 --> 00:27:50.259
fraction it started off at about
 

00:27:50.259 --> 00:27:52.229
fraction it started off at about
fourteen percent now I think it's almost

00:27:52.229 --> 00:27:52.239
fourteen percent now I think it's almost
 

00:27:52.239 --> 00:27:54.299
fourteen percent now I think it's almost
twenty-five percent of our users of this

00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:54.309
twenty-five percent of our users of this
 

00:27:54.309 --> 00:27:57.060
twenty-five percent of our users of this
database click through to the gene add

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.070
database click through to the gene add
 

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.879
database click through to the gene add
all right because it's been a better

00:27:59.879 --> 00:27:59.889
all right because it's been a better
 

00:27:59.889 --> 00:28:01.169
all right because it's been a better
place for them to go and what was

00:28:01.169 --> 00:28:01.179
place for them to go and what was
 

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:02.279
place for them to go and what was
interesting is in the beginning was

00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:02.289
interesting is in the beginning was
 

00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:03.869
interesting is in the beginning was
about fifteen percent and then over time

00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:03.879
about fifteen percent and then over time
 

00:28:03.879 --> 00:28:06.899
about fifteen percent and then over time
that rate went up this is the citation

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:06.909
that rate went up this is the citation
 

00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:10.590
that rate went up this is the citation
matcher that this has a very high

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600
matcher that this has a very high
 

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.029
matcher that this has a very high
click-through rate let's see I didn't

00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039
click-through rate let's see I didn't
 

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:17.129
click-through rate let's see I didn't
put that down I think it's something

00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:17.139
put that down I think it's something
 

00:28:17.139 --> 00:28:20.549
put that down I think it's something
like 28 or 29 percent and it's just a

00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559
like 28 or 29 percent and it's just a
 

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.619
like 28 or 29 percent and it's just a
matter of us improving the citation

00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:22.629
matter of us improving the citation
 

00:28:22.629 --> 00:28:24.269
matter of us improving the citation
matcher and we will be improving over

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279
matcher and we will be improving over
 

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:25.830
matcher and we will be improving over
the next couple months because we see

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840
the next couple months because we see
 

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:28.019
the next couple months because we see
how often it's used we want to get as

00:28:28.019 --> 00:28:28.029
how often it's used we want to get as
 

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:30.119
how often it's used we want to get as
many queries where if they look like

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:30.129
many queries where if they look like
 

00:28:30.129 --> 00:28:31.859
many queries where if they look like
they were trying to do citation matching

00:28:31.859 --> 00:28:31.869
they were trying to do citation matching
 

00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:34.590
they were trying to do citation matching
get that to trigger so now right now in

names for citations for a variety of
 

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:47.039
names for citations for a variety of
other things and then even though the

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:47.049
other things and then even though the
 

00:28:47.049 --> 00:28:49.060

basic query handling

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.070
basic query handling
 

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.509
basic query handling
the query may work one way we're

00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519
the query may work one way we're
 

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:53.680

automatically firing off many other
 

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.810
automatically firing off many other
types of queries and seeing can we do a

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:55.820
types of queries and seeing can we do a
 

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.879
types of queries and seeing can we do a
better match that's basically the way

00:28:57.879 --> 00:28:57.889
better match that's basically the way
 

00:28:57.889 --> 00:29:01.149
better match that's basically the way

but that basic approach is really what

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600
but that basic approach is really what
 

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.749

you have to do you have to try lots of
 

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:18.789
you have to do you have to try lots of
guesses at once see what the results are

00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799
guesses at once see what the results are
 

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:21.610
guesses at once see what the results are
and then decide how to present all of

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:21.620
and then decide how to present all of
 

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.289

use pay page rank at all anymore or

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:34.129
use pay page rank at all anymore or
 

00:29:34.129 --> 00:29:39.580
use pay page rank at all anymore or
barely at all so we we have a dashboard

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:39.590
barely at all so we we have a dashboard

barely at all so we we have a dashboard
that we keep adding different kinds of

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:41.990
that we keep adding different kinds of

00:29:43.899 --> 00:29:43.909
tracking tools to various things that
 

00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:45.070
tracking tools to various things that
we're doing and seeing how they're

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080
we're doing and seeing how they're
 

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.529

working sometimes you fix one thing and

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:47.539
working sometimes you fix one thing and
 

00:29:47.539 --> 00:29:49.299
working sometimes you fix one thing and
it works better but it makes something

00:29:49.299 --> 00:29:49.309
it works better but it makes something
 

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:51.039
it works better but it makes something
else not work as well people don't use

00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:51.049
else not work as well people don't use
 

00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:53.019
else not work as well people don't use
it as much or there's something degraded

00:29:53.019 --> 00:29:53.029
it as much or there's something degraded
 

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:54.460
it as much or there's something degraded
there and so we have to keep track of it

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:54.470
there and so we have to keep track of it
 

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.889
there and so we have to keep track of it
all every week or two we have a meeting

00:29:56.889 --> 00:29:56.899
all every week or two we have a meeting
 

00:29:56.899 --> 00:29:58.480
all every week or two we have a meeting
of all the senior people in the group

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:58.490
of all the senior people in the group
 

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.399
of all the senior people in the group
with the people in charge of the web log

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:00.409
with the people in charge of the web log
 

00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:03.940
with the people in charge of the web log
analysis project and we go over various

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:03.950
analysis project and we go over various
 

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.340
analysis project and we go over various
reports and discuss new things to

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:06.350
reports and discuss new things to
 

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.930
reports and discuss new things to
analyze and so forth so it's a lot of

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:07.940
analyze and so forth so it's a lot of
 

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.210
analyze and so forth so it's a lot of
fun it's very challenging it turns out

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:10.220
fun it's very challenging it turns out
 

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.190
fun it's very challenging it turns out
most people even if they're smart folks

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:12.200
most people even if they're smart folks
 

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.590
most people even if they're smart folks
and good in other areas turn out not to

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.600
and good in other areas turn out not to
 

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.810
and good in other areas turn out not to
be so good at analyzing web logs it's it

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:16.820
be so good at analyzing web logs it's it
 

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.419
be so good at analyzing web logs it's it
it you have to sort of be like Sherlock

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:19.429
it you have to sort of be like Sherlock
 

00:30:19.429 --> 00:30:21.340
it you have to sort of be like Sherlock
Holmes because you'll see something

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:21.350
Holmes because you'll see something
 

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:22.690
Holmes because you'll see something
you'll try to figure out what does it

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:22.700
you'll try to figure out what does it
 

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.700
you'll try to figure out what does it
mean then you have to sort of test if

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:24.710
mean then you have to sort of test if
 

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.440
mean then you have to sort of test if
that were true then we should see

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:26.450
that were true then we should see
 

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.909
that were true then we should see
something else happen and it gets very

00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919
something else happen and it gets very
 

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:29.980
something else happen and it gets very
complex very quickly but then when you

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:29.990
complex very quickly but then when you
 

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.649
complex very quickly but then when you
get something right it's amazingly it's

00:30:32.649 --> 00:30:32.659
get something right it's amazingly it's
 

00:30:32.659 --> 00:30:34.299
get something right it's amazingly it's
really a lot of fun because all of a

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:34.309
really a lot of fun because all of a
 

00:30:34.309 --> 00:30:36.009
really a lot of fun because all of a
sudden you see wow we got that one right

00:30:36.009 --> 00:30:36.019
sudden you see wow we got that one right
 

00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:38.259
sudden you see wow we got that one right
your numbers really pick up because if

00:30:38.259 --> 00:30:38.269
your numbers really pick up because if
 

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:39.970
your numbers really pick up because if
you have a couple million users you

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:39.980
you have a couple million users you
 

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.279
you have a couple million users you
really can get good statistics we've

00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:42.289
really can get good statistics we've
 

00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:43.960
really can get good statistics we've
changed the look of PubMed Central we've

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:43.970
changed the look of PubMed Central we've
 

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.970
changed the look of PubMed Central we've
gotten some good feedback on it we also

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:45.980
gotten some good feedback on it we also
 

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.369
gotten some good feedback on it we also
some show links down below but one of

00:30:48.369 --> 00:30:48.379
some show links down below but one of
 

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:49.810
some show links down below but one of
the questions we need to ask ourselves

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:49.820
the questions we need to ask ourselves
 

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.119
the questions we need to ask ourselves
is how should this look best on an

00:30:52.119 --> 00:30:52.129
is how should this look best on an
 

00:30:52.129 --> 00:30:54.369
is how should this look best on an
iPhone because we definitely have

even worse than that is that cause it's

important enough to put that much time
 

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.840
important enough to put that much time
into and so a lot of discoveries just

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:52.850
into and so a lot of discoveries just
 

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.060
into and so a lot of discoveries just
never get published and then they're

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.070
never get published and then they're
 

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:58.180
never get published and then they're
rediscovered as needed often these are

00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:58.190

go on Wikipedia and see something they

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960
go on Wikipedia and see something they
 

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.780
go on Wikipedia and see something they
think is wrong and make a change or they

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:34.790
think is wrong and make a change or they
 

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.970
think is wrong and make a change or they
can have a blog or whatever have some

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:36.980
can have a blog or whatever have some
 

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.010
can have a blog or whatever have some
idea and get it out the door but with

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:39.020
idea and get it out the door but with
 

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.950
idea and get it out the door but with
their own research it's very very slow

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960
their own research it's very very slow
 

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.869
their own research it's very very slow
so it would be great if we had an

00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879
so it would be great if we had an
 

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:45.369
so it would be great if we had an
approach that we could have almost

00:34:45.369 --> 00:34:45.379
approach that we could have almost
 

00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:47.919
approach that we could have almost
something like a blog anybody can be an

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:47.929
something like a blog anybody can be an
 

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:49.810
something like a blog anybody can be an
author we can get feedback from readers

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:49.820
author we can get feedback from readers
 

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.820
author we can get feedback from readers

well so actually there is an option for
 

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.770
well so actually there is an option for
that right now that we've been playing

00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:56.780
that right now that we've been playing
 

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.810
that right now that we've been playing

now have about 60 articles or so in

all of themselves you just see a sort of

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:06.630
all of themselves you just see a sort of
 

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.860
all of themselves you just see a sort of
a cartoon empty box and then you started

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:09.870
a cartoon empty box and then you started
 

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.660
a cartoon empty box and then you started
to see some very stiff pictures and then

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:11.670
to see some very stiff pictures and then
 

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.640
to see some very stiff pictures and then
you saw some other pictures there was

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:13.650
you saw some other pictures there was
 

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.440
you saw some other pictures there was
one graduate student who was kind of

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.450
one graduate student who was kind of
 

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.050
one graduate student who was kind of
funny to watch the the evolution of the

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060
funny to watch the the evolution of the
 

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.090
funny to watch the the evolution of the
pictures until there was a kind of a

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:20.100
pictures until there was a kind of a
 

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.660

changing their picture because this is

changing their picture because this is
 

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.450
changing their picture because this is
just linked to the google profile and

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460
just linked to the google profile and
 

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.720
just linked to the google profile and
and so we sort of get a sense of of what

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:32.730
and so we sort of get a sense of of what
 

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.070

relevant peer reviewers and then you can
set the journal up on for example this

00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:54.209
set the journal up on for example this
 

00:37:54.209 --> 00:37:56.779

with a publisher they want to see more

with a publisher they want to see more
articles and then they look at and they

articles and then they look at and they

also do ask for input from other folks

00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:36.189
also do ask for input from other folks

to see whether it looks like these you

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:38.140
to see whether it looks like these you
 

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.989
to see whether it looks like these you
know this is a reasonable and then and

00:40:39.989 --> 00:40:39.999
know this is a reasonable and then and
 

00:40:39.999 --> 00:40:42.299
know this is a reasonable and then and
then that's that so largely it's fairly

and an outside review but so this is

00:40:56.009 --> 00:40:56.019
and an outside review but so this is
 

00:40:56.019 --> 00:41:02.210
and an outside review but so this is
fairly lightweight

of the way Google Scholar allows you to
search across the text rather than just

that's a good question so actually the

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:18.570
that's a good question so actually the
 

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.190
that's a good question so actually the
full text is searchable now but I would

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200
full text is searchable now but I would
 

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.260
full text is searchable now but I would
not say that we're that happy with our

not say that we're that happy with our

not say that we're that happy with our
approach the full text retrieval it's

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.010
approach the full text retrieval it's
 

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.170
approach the full text retrieval it's
been a lot of studies done comparing

what you can show is if you're using a

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420
what you can show is if you're using a
 

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.780
what you can show is if you're using a
really good approach searching the full

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:41.790
really good approach searching the full
 

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.220
really good approach searching the full
text is a little bit better but

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:43.230
text is a little bit better but
 

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.270

surprisingly not that much better and

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:46.280
surprisingly not that much better and
 

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:51.080

and so were we are working on that I

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:51.090
and so were we are working on that I
 

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.760
and so were we are working on that I
mean you already can do it if you search

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:52.770
mean you already can do it if you search
 

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.490
mean you already can do it if you search
directly in pubmed central post to

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500
directly in pubmed central post to
 

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.640
directly in pubmed central post to
pubmed what we're working on is actually

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:57.650
pubmed what we're working on is actually
 

00:41:57.650 --> 00:41:59.720
pubmed what we're working on is actually
incorporating more the information from

00:41:59.720 --> 00:41:59.730
incorporating more the information from
 

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.349
incorporating more the information from
pubmed central into the PubMed search so

00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359
pubmed central into the PubMed search so
 

00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:05.599
pubmed central into the PubMed search so
that at least for the articles that we

00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:05.609
that at least for the articles that we
 

00:42:05.609 --> 00:42:07.250
that at least for the articles that we
have the full text there's other things

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260
have the full text there's other things
 

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.410
have the full text there's other things
we can get and it's not just in terms of

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:09.420

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:11.000
we can get and it's not just in terms of

moving to create a image database with
all of the figures that are in our books

00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359
all of the figures that are in our books

things because maybe in fact what's

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:24.030
things because maybe in fact what's
 

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.520
things because maybe in fact what's
really most useful to you is seeing a

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:25.530
really most useful to you is seeing a
 

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.800
really most useful to you is seeing a
particular figure and that's the way I

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:27.810
particular figure and that's the way I
 

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.690
particular figure and that's the way I
know that is what I want that's got what

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700
know that is what I want that's got what
 

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.359

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680
when if
 

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.410
when if
officer sponsored research contacts them

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:53.420
officer sponsored research contacts them
 

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.870
officer sponsored research contacts them
i think they'll be more responsive

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880
i think they'll be more responsive
 

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.460
i think they'll be more responsive
chances are at some point nih may end up

00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:57.470
chances are at some point nih may end up
 

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:59.559
chances are at some point nih may end up
having to say to somebody GI we you're

00:45:59.559 --> 00:45:59.569
having to say to somebody GI we you're
 

00:45:59.569 --> 00:46:01.210
having to say to somebody GI we you're
funded you're great but you're not going

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:01.220
funded you're great but you're not going
 

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.920
funded you're great but you're not going
to get your funds until your articles

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:02.930
to get your funds until your articles
 

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:04.420
to get your funds until your articles
are in and i think just a few examples

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:04.430
are in and i think just a few examples
 

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:05.859
are in and i think just a few examples
of that and people will be more

00:46:05.859 --> 00:46:05.869
of that and people will be more
 

00:46:05.869 --> 00:46:11.200
of that and people will be more
responsive I was wondering what you

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:11.210
responsive I was wondering what you
 

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:12.430
responsive I was wondering what you
could tell us about what it took

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440
could tell us about what it took
 

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.559
could tell us about what it took
politically to get the appropriations

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:14.569
politically to get the appropriations
 

00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:21.069
politically to get the appropriations
bill passed so I'm not a politician what

00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079
bill passed so I'm not a politician what
 

00:46:21.079 --> 00:46:24.190
bill passed so I'm not a politician what
I would say is that it has always been

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:24.200
I would say is that it has always been
 

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.559
I would say is that it has always been
the case that actually Congress was

00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:26.569
the case that actually Congress was
 

00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:28.839
the case that actually Congress was
ahead of NIH in terms of wanting this

00:46:28.839 --> 00:46:28.849
ahead of NIH in terms of wanting this
 

00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:31.720
ahead of NIH in terms of wanting this
policy so starting way back there have

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:31.730
policy so starting way back there have
 

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:38.549
policy so starting way back there have
been efforts in Congress to push to have

00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559
 
 

00:46:38.559 --> 00:46:41.920
 
more access or open access actually even

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:41.930
more access or open access actually even
 

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:47.010
more access or open access actually even
at times of NIH funded content and so

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:47.020
at times of NIH funded content and so
 

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.210
at times of NIH funded content and so
while there has been a lot of back and

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:49.220
while there has been a lot of back and
 

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.859
while there has been a lot of back and
forth when publishers were upset about

00:46:50.859 --> 00:46:50.869
forth when publishers were upset about
 

00:46:50.869 --> 00:46:53.230
forth when publishers were upset about
it and they would tell the staffers

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240
it and they would tell the staffers
 

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.910
it and they would tell the staffers
things we'd have to go to them and

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920
things we'd have to go to them and
 

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.280
things we'd have to go to them and
explain no this is this is actually how

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:57.290
explain no this is this is actually how
 

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:58.780
explain no this is this is actually how
we see it or these are the facts as we

00:46:58.780 --> 00:46:58.790
we see it or these are the facts as we
 

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.609
we see it or these are the facts as we
know them and so forth so there has been

00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:00.619
know them and so forth so there has been
 

00:47:00.619 --> 00:47:03.480
know them and so forth so there has been
back and forth that way but most of the

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:03.490
back and forth that way but most of the
 

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.400
back and forth that way but most of the
most of the initiative really for the

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:06.410
most of the initiative really for the
 

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.200
most of the initiative really for the
policy at all stages has come from

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:08.210
policy at all stages has come from
 

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:10.480

Congress it's not too surprising it's

district where a publisher is very
active the fact is that Congress is

00:47:19.539 --> 00:47:19.549
active the fact is that Congress is
 

00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:20.650

colleges are not having access to
federally funded research so it's really

00:47:42.819 --> 00:47:42.829
federally funded research so it's really
 

00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:46.089
federally funded research so it's really
not be an NIH that's led the half that

published article well I think that the

published article well I think that the
the tack that was taken on the issue was

00:49:40.039 --> 00:49:40.049
the tack that was taken on the issue was
 

00:49:40.049 --> 00:49:45.499
the tack that was taken on the issue was
that that the version of the article

00:49:45.499 --> 00:49:45.509
that that the version of the article
 

00:49:45.509 --> 00:49:51.440
that that the version of the article
which the US government felt was most

obviously one that they could claim
control over was the author's final

00:49:55.279 --> 00:49:55.289
control over was the author's final
 

00:49:55.289 --> 00:49:57.799
control over was the author's final
manuscript which is the one prior to

00:49:57.799 --> 00:49:57.809
manuscript which is the one prior to
 

00:49:57.809 --> 00:50:00.470
manuscript which is the one prior to
copy editing and that's the one that

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480
copy editing and that's the one that
 

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.920
copy editing and that's the one that
that they pushed for if a publisher

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:03.930
that they pushed for if a publisher
 

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:05.779

for those articles then the final

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:08.430
for those articles then the final
 

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.059
for those articles then the final
published article is in PubMed Central

00:50:11.059 --> 00:50:11.069
published article is in PubMed Central
 

00:50:11.069 --> 00:50:13.579
published article is in PubMed Central
but otherwise I think for a variety of
