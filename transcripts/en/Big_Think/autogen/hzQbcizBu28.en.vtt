00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.610
hey this is a great question because

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620
hey this is a great question because
 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.590
hey this is a great question because
this actually really is a big problem in

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600
this actually really is a big problem in
 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.420
this actually really is a big problem in
space exploration all of the different

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430
space exploration all of the different
 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.340

junk that's up there you know it's

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350
junk that's up there you know it's
 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.230
junk that's up there you know it's
actually the sixtieth anniversary of the

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240
actually the sixtieth anniversary of the
 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.029
actually the sixtieth anniversary of the
first satellite the United States ever

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:22.039
first satellite the United States ever
 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.760
first satellite the United States ever
sent up called Explorer 1 so for more

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770

up satellites and robots and space

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330
up satellites and robots and space
 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.850
up satellites and robots and space
stations and all kinds of stuff up into

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860
stations and all kinds of stuff up into
 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.610

orbit and a lot of junk has accumulated

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620
orbit and a lot of junk has accumulated
 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.619
orbit and a lot of junk has accumulated
and sometimes it's just very small in

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629
and sometimes it's just very small in
 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:36.779
and sometimes it's just very small in
the early days of space exploration

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789
the early days of space exploration
 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:38.590
the early days of space exploration
sometimes they would even paint

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600
sometimes they would even paint
 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.020
sometimes they would even paint
satellites and all of those little paint

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030
satellites and all of those little paint
 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.850

chips you know as things actually

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860

the paint all chipped off and now there

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460
the paint all chipped off and now there
 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.860
the paint all chipped off and now there
are these tiny little things flying

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870
are these tiny little things flying
 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.200
are these tiny little things flying
around in orbit but the problem is is

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210
around in orbit but the problem is is
 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.270
around in orbit but the problem is is
that if you're in low-earth orbit by

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280
that if you're in low-earth orbit by
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.940
that if you're in low-earth orbit by
definition you're traveling at about

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950
definition you're traveling at about
 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.979
definition you're traveling at about
17,000 miles an hour that's much much

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989
17,000 miles an hour that's much much
 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.840
17,000 miles an hour that's much much
much faster than a bullet comes out of a

much faster than a bullet comes out of a
 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.779
much faster than a bullet comes out of a
gun so even a tiny little thing going at

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789
gun so even a tiny little thing going at
 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.190

that speed if it hits you in the wrong

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200
that speed if it hits you in the wrong
 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.529
that speed if it hits you in the wrong
direction it can cause huge amounts of

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539
direction it can cause huge amounts of
 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.450
direction it can cause huge amounts of
damage and in fact one of the things

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460
damage and in fact one of the things
 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.160
damage and in fact one of the things
that we do is actually study all the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170
that we do is actually study all the
 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.660
that we do is actually study all the
debris up there at all the collisions

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670
debris up there at all the collisions
 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.520
debris up there at all the collisions
there's parts of the Hubble Space

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530
there's parts of the Hubble Space
 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.109
there's parts of the Hubble Space
Telescope that the astronauts have

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119
Telescope that the astronauts have
 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.300
Telescope that the astronauts have
actually brought back to earth and we

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310
actually brought back to earth and we
 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.620
actually brought back to earth and we
actually look at the metal and the

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630
actually look at the metal and the
 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.480
actually look at the metal and the
surfaces and think about all of the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
surfaces and think about all of the
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.460
surfaces and think about all of the
little things that have hit we study how

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470
little things that have hit we study how
 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.020
little things that have hit we study how
much damage there is from all of the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030
much damage there is from all of the
 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.240
much damage there is from all of the
debris up there some of the debris is

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250
debris up there some of the debris is
 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.859
debris up there some of the debris is
caused by humans you know bits of old

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869
caused by humans you know bits of old
 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.719
caused by humans you know bits of old
spacecraft and some of it is actually

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729
spacecraft and some of it is actually
 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.730
spacecraft and some of it is actually
natural there's just particles of dust

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740
natural there's just particles of dust
 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.920
natural there's just particles of dust
up there this is what creates meteors

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930
up there this is what creates meteors
 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.120
up there this is what creates meteors
right where people know if it's shooting

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130
right where people know if it's shooting
 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.280
right where people know if it's shooting
stars the earth accumulates about a

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
stars the earth accumulates about a
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.310
stars the earth accumulates about a
hundred tons every day of natural rock

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320
hundred tons every day of natural rock
 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.499
hundred tons every day of natural rock
and sandy stuff from space falling down

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509
and sandy stuff from space falling down
 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.810
and sandy stuff from space falling down
on us so some of the junk up there isn't

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820
on us so some of the junk up there isn't
 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.219
on us so some of the junk up there isn't
even human caused it's actually even

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229
even human caused it's actually even
 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.340
even human caused it's actually even
natural so what do you do with this

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350
natural so what do you do with this
 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.289
natural so what do you do with this
environment up there that's full of tiny

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299
environment up there that's full of tiny
 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.539
environment up there that's full of tiny
little things in some cases we actually

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549
little things in some cases we actually
 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.520
little things in some cases we actually
worry about the astronauts being hit by

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530
worry about the astronauts being hit by
 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.440
worry about the astronauts being hit by
these so if there's an astronaut out

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450
these so if there's an astronaut out
 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.090
these so if there's an astronaut out
doing a spacewalk they're in a

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100
doing a spacewalk they're in a
 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.700
doing a spacewalk they're in a
pressurized spacesuit and just like you

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710
pressurized spacesuit and just like you
 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.260
pressurized spacesuit and just like you
can't really make a tiny little hole in

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270
can't really make a tiny little hole in
 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.060
can't really make a tiny little hole in
a balloon if something actually got

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070
a balloon if something actually got
 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.380
a balloon if something actually got
through the spacesuit under pressure

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390
through the spacesuit under pressure
 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.359
through the spacesuit under pressure
that would be incredibly dangerous for

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369
that would be incredibly dangerous for
 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.250
that would be incredibly dangerous for
the astronaut so there are many things

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260
the astronaut so there are many things
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.530
the astronaut so there are many things
up there that we track we're actually so

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540
up there that we track we're actually so
 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.390
up there that we track we're actually so
aware that space junk is becoming more

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400
aware that space junk is becoming more
 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.860
aware that space junk is becoming more
and more of a problem that we're really

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870
and more of a problem that we're really
 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.720
and more of a problem that we're really
encouraging other countries to be

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
encouraging other countries to be
 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.369
encouraging other countries to be
all about what they do up in space a

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379
all about what they do up in space a
 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.979
all about what they do up in space a
couple years ago China as an experiment

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989
couple years ago China as an experiment
 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.420
couple years ago China as an experiment
actually collided two of their

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430
actually collided two of their
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.430
actually collided two of their
satellites it was sort of a military and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440
satellites it was sort of a military and
 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440
satellites it was sort of a military and
space experiment and the amount of space

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
space experiment and the amount of space
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.360
space experiment and the amount of space
junk went up almost exponentially from

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
junk went up almost exponentially from
 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.280
junk went up almost exponentially from
that from that one single event these

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
that from that one single event these
 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.050
that from that one single event these
two satellites colliding all of this

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
two satellites colliding all of this
 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.600
two satellites colliding all of this
different stuff went off into space so

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610
different stuff went off into space so
 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.520
different stuff went off into space so
some people have a job at NASA to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530
some people have a job at NASA to
 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.440
some people have a job at NASA to
actually track the larger bits of space

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450
actually track the larger bits of space
 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.630
actually track the larger bits of space
junk and in some cases we know exactly

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640
junk and in some cases we know exactly
 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.490
junk and in some cases we know exactly
where they are and we can actually get

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500
where they are and we can actually get
 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.199
where they are and we can actually get
our satellites out of the way of them

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209
our satellites out of the way of them
 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.149
our satellites out of the way of them
even the International Space Station has

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159
even the International Space Station has
 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.460
even the International Space Station has
the ability to change its orbit just a

the ability to change its orbit just a
 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.289
the ability to change its orbit just a
little bit and actually maneuver so

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299
little bit and actually maneuver so
 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.610
little bit and actually maneuver so
there's a particularly large piece of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
there's a particularly large piece of
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.559
there's a particularly large piece of
space junk the space station may choose

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569
space junk the space station may choose
 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.390
space junk the space station may choose
to make little maneuvers to avoid it a

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400
to make little maneuvers to avoid it a

few times astronauts have actually been

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530
few times astronauts have actually been
 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.170
few times astronauts have actually been
a little bit worried there's been a tiny

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180
a little bit worried there's been a tiny
 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.089
a little bit worried there's been a tiny
tiny chance of a collision only a couple

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099
tiny chance of a collision only a couple
 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.920
tiny chance of a collision only a couple
percent but that's enough for us to be

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930
percent but that's enough for us to be
 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.660
percent but that's enough for us to be
concerned for them and in some cases

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670
concerned for them and in some cases
 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.979
concerned for them and in some cases
we've asked them to get ready for an

evacuation in case anything happened but
 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.690

luckily nothing ever did so NASA is very

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700
luckily nothing ever did so NASA is very

aware of the space junk problem the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250
aware of the space junk problem the
 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.580
aware of the space junk problem the
question is what do you do about it

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590
question is what do you do about it
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.800
question is what do you do about it
because think about this when you're up

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810
because think about this when you're up
 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.020
because think about this when you're up
in orbit above the earth you're talking

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030
in orbit above the earth you're talking
 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.300
in orbit above the earth you're talking
about an area that's actually larger

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310
about an area that's actually larger
 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.550
about an area that's actually larger
than the entire surface of the earth and

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560
than the entire surface of the earth and
 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.500
than the entire surface of the earth and
you're not only talking about an area

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510
you're not only talking about an area
 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.030
you're not only talking about an area
that extends up from the surface of the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040
that extends up from the surface of the
 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.039
that extends up from the surface of the
earth but it extends up for hundreds of

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049
earth but it extends up for hundreds of
 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:33.610

miles

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620
miles

space junk is at many different

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030
space junk is at many different
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.839
space junk is at many different
altitudes so there really isn't any way

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849
altitudes so there really isn't any way
 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.270
altitudes so there really isn't any way
to take a giant vacuum cleaner and just

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280
to take a giant vacuum cleaner and just
 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.039
to take a giant vacuum cleaner and just
start going after piece by piece of

space junk you would never cover that

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000
space junk you would never cover that
 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.159
space junk you would never cover that
amount of volume it would take you

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169
amount of volume it would take you
 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.309
amount of volume it would take you
centuries to even try so people are

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319
centuries to even try so people are
 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.990
centuries to even try so people are
talking about ideas like could you take

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000
talking about ideas like could you take
 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.270

lasers could you maybe actually vaporize

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280
lasers could you maybe actually vaporize
 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.099
lasers could you maybe actually vaporize
some of the space dust how would you

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109
some of the space dust how would you
 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.599
some of the space dust how would you
clean it up could you actually unfurl

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609
clean it up could you actually unfurl
 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.699
clean it up could you actually unfurl
big sails that would sail around the

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709
big sails that would sail around the
 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.140
big sails that would sail around the
earth and scoop up some of the space

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150
earth and scoop up some of the space
 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.099
earth and scoop up some of the space
junk maybe but I for now haven't seen a

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109
junk maybe but I for now haven't seen a
 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.470
junk maybe but I for now haven't seen a
particularly good solution the best

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480
particularly good solution the best
 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.300
particularly good solution the best
solution is to try to put as little of

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310
solution is to try to put as little of
 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.250
solution is to try to put as little of
that stuff into orbit as possible and

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260
that stuff into orbit as possible and
 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.470
that stuff into orbit as possible and
know where the bigger pieces are and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480
know where the bigger pieces are and
 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.420
know where the bigger pieces are and
right now we really have to manage the

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430
right now we really have to manage the
 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.720
right now we really have to manage the
problem more than solvent

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730
problem more than solvent
 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.980
problem more than solvent
