00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
We see a lot of sort of figures and numbers

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.040
for kind of how small things are getting

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.600
in computing, right?

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.520
And I thought who better to come and talk to than Phil Moriarty, would you call yourself a nano-scientist?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.020
h

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.940
Oh I guess I would it depends on which funding agency I'm applying to funding for, but yeah nano-scientist is a good one *laughs*

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.560
Yeah it's great to be back on Computerphile it's been a long time I don't know a couple of years or something like that?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.660
Um.. So yeah we do, within the group here we manipulate individual atoms that's what we do

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.280
so we work at the level of not just single atoms and single molecules but actually looking inside single molecules

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.880
The state of the art is no longer, at least in the research and development community not in the commercial or industrial community

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.460
but in the research and development, particularly in the universities,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.340
State of the art isn't seeing atoms we've been able to do that for years. In fact, we could see atoms as long ago as 1955.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.180
Um, with something called the field ion microscope.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.700
At the beginning of the 80s however,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.260
it all changed because there was in instrument called the scanning tunneling microscope developed,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.740
Which is basically a sharp probe, you bring it in close to a surface, you move it back and forth

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.760
and you measure a force or an interaction

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.940
and the important thing is if you can make this probe atomically sharp, then your resolution is at the single atom level.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.040
So we can see atoms we can move them, but as I said the state of the art is actually single bonds

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.940
looking at single electron orbitals, single chemical bonds, and manipulating those.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:40.200
Commercially, that technology doesn't exist and its gonna be quite a while before we get down to devices which are truly mass produced at the single atom level.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.760
But if you look at the, you  know, from the 70s I think we were at the sort of 10 micrometer level,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.340
so 10 micrometers, a micrometer is a thousandth of a millimeter, a millionth of a meter.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.720
We are now at the 14 nano-meter level, so the really offhand way to try and get some vague handle on it,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.980
is, for many of you out there perhaps not for me but for many of you out there- your hair will grow roughly about a nano-meter a second,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.740
Particularly if you're in your, you know, teens, 20s

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.500
Your hair's growing out at about that rate of about a nano-meter a second.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.800
In the context of single atoms, the diameter of an atom is about a few tenths of a nano-meter

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.220
When we're working at 14 nano-meters and the feature sizes on semiconductor chips are around about 14 nano-meters

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.860
We're talking, you know, tens of atoms, we're talking about about 50-60 atoms wide, the features

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.880
So it's um, it's really quite remarkable you know?

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.200
We went from a thousandth of a millimeter down to 50 atoms in the course of, you know, 50 years or something like that

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.520
So you mentioned the features, is that things like the individual wires that go to make a transistor?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.120
Yeah, exactly, that's exactly, so it's the feature size really is to do with the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.960
all the different elements on the chip in terms, largely the transistors and the wiring and the different types of components you have in the chip

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.700
that have been just scaled all the way down to that level.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.200
At the moment, the way it works and the way it worked for decades is that you control where the electrons are, you control the electron's charge

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:20.680
and electrons will respond to electric fields so if you've got a battery, and you've got two metal plates and you put a battery across them

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.440
What you have between those plates is whats called an electric field

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.820
if you put an electron in there, then that electron will respond to the electric field

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:35.060
A great deal of the electronics around us is based on silicon, there are other compounds, like Gallium arsenide for example

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.360
But a great deal of the micro and the nano electronics industry is based on silicon.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.640
S: So does the silicon work a bit like the plastic, or maybe the PCB, if I said the green PCB, that's plastic with wires on it-

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.280
That's a really good question, no the silicon's much more active than that, much more active, it's not like you pattern these features in the silicon

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.160
as just a passive substrate, you're actually using the silicon and the electrons in the silicon and you're controlling where the electrons in the silicon go

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.920
and you can take the raw silicon and you can dope it, you can add impurities deliberately

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.820
to add, to introduce more electrons, or indeed, actually, to take electrons out.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.300
So we got electrons and holes. And that means you can change dramatically how when you put a battery on this thing, or when you put a power source on it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:30.260
how those electrons flow, and then by, in turn, patterning little metal features on top of that, you can apply electric fields and you can control where the electrons go.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.380
You generally switch on or switch off the flow of the electrons, you trap the electrons in a region of space.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.880
Now, the problem with this technology is that it's starting to run out of steam.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.100
It's been running out of steam for quite some time.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.180
And there's been lot's of nay-saying going on since the early 80s

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.300
Saying it's going to stop -it's going to fail

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.120
and the semiconductor industry

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.000
is extremely clever and comes up with new ideas time and time again.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.340
But, you can't beat physics

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.380
and were going to come very soon -we're now at tens of atoms

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.880
when we get down to features that are just a few atoms, or say ten atoms across

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.840
then, we've got to take into account that

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.040
once you get down to that level

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.740
it's quantum, which means that you can no longer just think of the electron as a little hard

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.260
billiard ball, which is the picture that all of us have in our heads

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.820
it's actually got a wave-like character

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.900
which is not to say it would be easy if it were just that the electrons spread out in space

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.520
that's not what happens

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.400
it means that under certain circumstances it behaves

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.900
as if it were a wave

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.840
and if you find that confusing

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.200
good,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.220
because so many of us find it confusing.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.260
This is raw quantum physics

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.440
As a physicist, it's not that you understand it.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.900
You just get used to it.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.100
Once you get down to this level

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.420
you get this wave-like characteristic

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.880
and just like waves will spread out

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.360
so you might want to trap the electron in this region of space

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.380
but it's starting now -due to this really small size-

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.180
at the point where we've got to take that wave-like nature into consideration

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.220
and the electron could spread out.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.280
We call that tunneling.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.580
And that means you want to trap it in space, but in fact

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.420
you just can't. It's so slippery, it's tunneling away.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.000
So I'm gonna find a really stupid question cause I am full of them today

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.760
I've heard that quantum computing is a good thing, so I mean...

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.120
Oh,   So, oh, so, no, So there's a different, yeah right, *bleargh*

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:30.920
So there's quantum computing which is where you absolutely exploit that. So there is classical computing which is what we have now.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.320
And than we have quantum computing. Now those are two very, very different paradigms.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.880
So instead this is quantum effects on classic computing

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.800
Perfect! Yes. Quantum effects on classical computing instead of just being pure quantum,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.120
The sort of mindset in the industry and the mindset in some areas of academia  is

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.600
How do we work around these effects? I think we are gonna have to start, particularly when we get down to these really small sizes

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:59.660
We are gonna have to stop seeing them as something that's a, erm, you know to the detriment of device and exploit it instead

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.280
Well we can do amazing things when we start thinking of that wave-like character

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:12.440
And the move towards a much more quantum mindset

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.040
Where instead of trying to work around these things, we exploit them

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.240
So we work with silicon a great deal in the lab

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.380
It's quite shiny...

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.760
It is very very shiny. So, it's polished on that side.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.480
So, when we do our experiments to manipulate atoms

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.180
we take a chunk of this, a little bit less than a centimeter squared, something like that

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.960
we put it in a ultrahigh vacuum and we heat it up to about 1200C

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.760
and that drives off the oxide that is on the surface

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.040
and just after it cools down, we can see atoms.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.560
So it's actually straight forward to see individual atoms on Silicon surfaces.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:50.320
That's not how the semiconductor industry works because to see individual atoms, particularly the way we do it

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.320
and the way many other groups in the world do it

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.120
it takes many hours to get good images

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.480
To form the components and pattern the wafer, you use something called photolithography

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.400
or something called electron beam lithography

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.400
and photolithography has been the standard throughout the industry for very verry many years

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.200
but it is, again, running out of steam.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.320
So you take the wafer, you coat it with a thin film of polymer or plastic

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.200
and then you put what is called a mask in front of it

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.280
or stencil basically. And then you shine light through that stencil

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.520
and then you expose the plastic at the surface in particular regions according to the pattern

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:31.760
and the important this is when this particular polymer is exposed to light, it becomes soluable

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.680
The regions that aren't exposed aren't soluable so then you can put it in an etch

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.680
and you can remove those regions where it's soluble and leave those regions where it's unsoluable

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.000
That's the fundamental process, that's the fundamental process in a nutshell

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.080
And do they do different layers of this as well?

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:55.480
So, it's extremely clever because you're limited by the natural wavelength of light

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.800
light has a wavelength and therefore that wavelength ultimately determines the feature size

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:10.920
and with the current processing which is about 14 nano-meters, they do something really really clever which is

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.640
they use one mask, expose, and then they put another mask and just offset it a little bit

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.040
which is really clever

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.920
and given this is 14nano-meters, when I say little bit, that's a tincy tiny bit

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.480
and actually getting those in registry is quite tricky

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.520
So, that's where the industry is at the moment

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.440
To go beyond that, really to get down to these features which are 10 atoms or a few atoms across

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.440
then you have to start thinking about lots of other issues and lots of other approaches

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.720
One way of doing that is to move to a much shorter wavelength

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.720
a much shorter wavelength means much higher energy

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.680
and we have something called Extreme Ultraviolet so that's far off the end of the Ultraviolet range

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:58.880
And you can get down to -or the standard they're aiming for is 13.5nm wavelength light

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:06.960
and that's quite high in energy. It's really high in energy

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.040
and that will enable you to get the feature size much much smaller

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.120
You can really push the resolution, you can really push the feature size down by using

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.200
instead of photons of light, using electrons

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.480
and you can squeeze the wavelength of electrons down much much smaller

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:26.280
the problem with that is it's a serial -with light you have your sample,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.200
you have your wafer and you just bathe it in light

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.440
with electrons, it's a raster beam

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.080
which means it is, instead of a parallel process, it's a serial process

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.840
which means it's incredibly slow

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.040
So electron beam gives you much better definition and much better resolution

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.680
but for the semiconductor industry, it's a real pain because it's so unbelievably slow

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.360
So... And for us, when we manipulate atoms

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.400
it's exactly the same process

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.920
we use a single probe, we bring it in close to a surface so we can see atoms

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.480
and we can manipulate those atoms and move them around, but it's excruciatingly slow because it's a serial process

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.800
This is the crystal structure of silicon. Just assume all the atoms are the same color

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.880
but each sphere here, each ball, represents a single silicon atom

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.240
and the silicon crystallizes in a form where you have these tetrahedrons

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.840
so if you take one silicon atom here, this purple one. It is connected to 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.680
and that's because in chemical terms, silicon has four valence electrons

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.160
It wants to form four valance bonds

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:37.760
We have these, really silly at times, frustrating; this is chemistry, this is physics. It's all part of one integrated hole

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.080
even computer science is part of that integrated hole, sometimes.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.600
...but that's sort of off the point of what we were discussing

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.400
It's fun, but just to show you in action that um...
