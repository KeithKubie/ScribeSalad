00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.800
In the next three quizzes, I'm going
to be challenging you to take advantage

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.290
of array methods, to programatically
create long chains of promises.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.670
Keep in mind that you want
the thumbnails to appear on the page

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.100
in the same order as they appear
in the search results, but, and

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.460
this is an important but,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.790
this does not mean that you need
to perform the request in series.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.690
There are different strategies for
controlling the order that

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.990
promises resolve,
which you'll be trying out soon.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.980
The keystone to all of these
strategies is the idea of a sequence.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.968
You'll need to create a sequence
of promises that are chained,

00:00:37.968 --> 00:00:39.310
one after another.
