00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:03.040
- [Voiceover] Triangle SAM, S-A-M,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.680
and this is one over here, S-A-M,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.880
is rotated 270 degrees,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.277
about the point four comma negative two.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.538
So, this is four comma
negative two right over here.

00:00:12.538 --> 00:00:15.579
Draw the image of this rotation
using the interactive graph.

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.179
We have this little interactive graph tool

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:18.200
where we can draw points

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.320
or if we wanna put them in the trash

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.800
we can put them there.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.899
The direction of rotation by a

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.739
positive angle is counter-clockwise.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.631
So, this would be 270 degrees in

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:29.511
the counter-clockwise direction.

00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:31.252
So, to help us think about that I've

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:33.512
copied and pasted this on my scratch pad

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.674
and we can draw through it

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:36.825
and the first thing that we might wanna

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.663
think about is if you rotate,

00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:41.558
I've talked about this
in the previous video

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:43.521
when we were rotating around the origin,

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.379
if you rotate something by,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.161
last time we talked about a
negative 270 degree rotation,

00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:50.960
but if we're talking about
a 270 degree rotation.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.740
If you imagine a point right over here

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.198
this would be 90 degrees, 180,

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:57.459
and then that is 270 degrees.

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:59.732
That is a 200 and 70 degree rotation.

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:01.881
We're going in a
counter-clockwise direction.

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:03.961
You see that that is equivalent,

00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.281
that is equivalent to a 90 degrees,

00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:10.059
to a 90 degrees clockwise rotation,

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:13.139
or a negative 90 degree rotation.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.579
And 90 degree rotations are

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.018
a little bit easier to think about.

00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:17.517
So, let's just, instead of thinking

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:20.299
of this in terms of rotating 270 degrees

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:21.411
in the positive direction,

00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:23.281
in the counter-clockwise direction,

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:25.120
let's think about, let's think about this,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.378
rotating this 90 degrees
in the clockwise direction.

00:01:28.378 --> 00:01:30.037
They are going to be equivalent.

00:01:30.037 --> 00:01:32.117
But how do we do that?

00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:34.117
Well, like we've done in previous videos

00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:36.749
what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna take each point,

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:39.720
let's say point, using
a color you can see,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.579
point M, I'm having
trouble switching color,

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.088
point M right over here,

00:01:44.088 --> 00:01:46.289
and I'm gonna construct a right triangle

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.148
between point M and our center of rotation

00:01:49.148 --> 00:01:51.580
where the hypotenuse
of the right triangles

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.358
is gonna be the line
that connects these two.

00:01:53.358 --> 00:01:55.621
So, let me draw that.

00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:57.198
So, that's the hypotenuse.

00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:59.899
Now, let me draw a right
triangle like this.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.417
So, it's gonna go, it's gonna be, like,

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:05.154
it's gonna look like that,

00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:07.936
and then it's gonna look like, whoops,

00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:12.117
that wasn't to press my,
the command button before.

00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:13.136
Okay, there you go.

00:02:13.136 --> 00:02:14.718
All right, so I have this right triangle.

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:18.594
So, you imagine, imagine
rotating this right triangle,

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:21.176
this magenta one that I just constructed,

00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:24.535
by negative 90 degrees,
by negative 90 degrees,

00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:26.957
or 90 degrees in the clockwise direction.

00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:29.737
Well, what's gonna happen
to each of these sides?

00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:32.248
Well, this side right over here,

00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:34.927
if I rotate it by negative 90 degrees

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:38.407
it is going to end up,
it is going to end up,

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:40.667
it is going to end up pointing up

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:42.746
and how long is it going to be?

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:45.978
Well, let's see, this
one is one, two, three,

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:50.427
four, five, six, seven units long,

00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:52.029
so it's still gonna be seven units long.

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:56.387
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:02:56.387 --> 00:02:59.887
it's gonna put us right over here.

00:02:59.887 --> 00:03:03.591
It is going to put us right over there.

00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:07.007
And then this side,
let me make this clear,

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:09.666
this side that I'm highlighting in green

00:03:09.666 --> 00:03:11.448
which we see are four units long.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:13.329
It forms a right angle.

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.849
It forms a right angle.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.249
So, if you were to rotate this,

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.165
the entire triangle 90 degrees
in the clockwise direction

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:23.386
well, then this is gonna go four

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:26.521
in this direction just like that.

00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:27.724
Just like that.

00:03:27.724 --> 00:03:30.663
And then your new triangle, the image of,

00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:31.924
I guess, what we just,

00:03:31.924 --> 00:03:33.585
this right triangle I've constructed

00:03:33.585 --> 00:03:35.581
if I rotate it by negative 90 degrees,

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:37.581
90 degrees in the clockwise direction,

00:03:37.581 --> 00:03:40.382
is going to look like this.

00:03:40.382 --> 00:03:42.261
So, after rotation, so what did I just do?

00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:43.942
I just took this, I just took

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:46.082
this triangle that I just constructed,

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:48.941
and I rotated it negative 90 degrees

00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:51.342
to get to this triangle right over here.

00:03:51.342 --> 00:03:53.921
And so, the point M,

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:55.850
its image after the 90 degree

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.930
rotation would be right over here

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.449
and I could call that,
I'll call that M prime.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.271
What I'm essentially going to do,

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:03.449
I'm going to do that for point M,

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:04.890
I'm going to do that for point A,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.428
and I'm gonna do that for point S,

00:04:06.428 --> 00:04:08.050
and I'm gonna connect the three,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.469
the M prime, the A prime, and the S prime,

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.450
and then that will give me the image,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.391
that'll give me the
vertices of my new triangle.

00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:17.570
The image of triangle SAM after rotation.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.631
So, let's keep going.

00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:22.489
Let's do this, let's do
this now with point A.

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:27.048
With point A then I can
construct another right triangle

00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:29.837
and I could do it, I could do it several,

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:31.952
I could do it several ways.

00:04:31.952 --> 00:04:33.088
Actually, let me just do it this way.

00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:35.731
Let me, let me draw it.

00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:37.507
I could, I could draw this.

00:04:37.507 --> 00:04:41.369
The hypotenuse we know
is gonna go from here to,

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:43.889
from point A to our center of origin.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.910
And I could draw a right
triangle that's up here like this

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.448
or I could draw a right triangle

00:04:50.448 --> 00:04:54.052
that is down here like this.

00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:55.707
Maybe I'll focus on this one.

00:04:55.707 --> 00:04:57.748
Let me draw this right triangle.

00:04:57.748 --> 00:05:01.608
So, this right triangle right like this.

00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:04.329
So, if I draw this right
triangle like this.

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:07.728
So, this side, let me do this in a color

00:05:07.728 --> 00:05:09.008
that I can see more clearly

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:12.908
or that is mostly this side.

00:05:12.908 --> 00:05:14.208
No, you won't be able to see that.

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:15.748
All right, I'mma stick with the purple.

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.507
So, this side right over here

00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:19.569
that I am drawing in purple,

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.309
if you rotate it clockwise
in the 90 degree direction

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:25.927
or negative 90 rotation,
well, it's going to,

00:05:25.927 --> 00:05:27.408
instead of being straight horizontal,

00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:28.748
it's gonna be straight vertical.

00:05:28.748 --> 00:05:30.909
So, it's going to be, it's going to be,

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:32.986
it's gonna overlap with
what we had already drawn

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:33.989
and how long is it?

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:35.787
Well, right now it goes from

00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:37.826
X equals negative five to X equals four.

00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:40.089
So, it's nine long and you can count that.

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.907
One, two, three, four, five,

00:05:42.907 --> 00:05:46.128
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:05:46.128 --> 00:05:47.648
or you could say it's two longer

00:05:47.648 --> 00:05:48.928
than what we had already drawn.

00:05:48.928 --> 00:05:49.874
So, let's see, if you,

00:05:49.874 --> 00:05:52.687
if you start Y equals
negative two and you add nine

00:05:52.687 --> 00:05:54.573
you're gonna get to Y equals seven.

00:05:54.573 --> 00:05:58.544
So, this is gonna go all the way like this

00:05:58.544 --> 00:06:00.814
and then, and then let's see,

00:06:00.814 --> 00:06:05.814
this side, this side forms
a right angle with it.

00:06:05.995 --> 00:06:09.934
So, if you, just gonna go like this,

00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:11.255
it's gonna be a right angle

00:06:11.255 --> 00:06:12.153
and how long is this?

00:06:12.153 --> 00:06:16.273
It's one, two, three,
four, five units long.

00:06:16.273 --> 00:06:17.365
So, now we're gonna go one,

00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:21.043
two, three, four, five
units in that direction

00:06:21.043 --> 00:06:24.883
and just like that we get to our A prime.

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:28.414
We get, we get to,

00:06:28.414 --> 00:06:31.884
we get to our A prime

00:06:31.884 --> 00:06:34.814
and we can draw the
hypotenuse of this triangle.

00:06:34.814 --> 00:06:37.062
So, let me see if I can draw it.

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:39.644
Press, I can only draw the straight line.

00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:43.174
All right, it's gonna look
like, gonna look like that.

00:06:43.174 --> 00:06:44.575
So, we know where the image

00:06:44.575 --> 00:06:46.432
of point M is after the rotation.

00:06:46.432 --> 00:06:48.912
We know where the image of
point A is after rotation

00:06:48.912 --> 00:06:51.413
and we see how these
triangles we constructed.

00:06:51.413 --> 00:06:52.993
We've just rotated them.

00:06:52.993 --> 00:06:54.663
We've just rotated them 90

00:06:54.663 --> 00:06:56.682
degrees in the clockwise direction.

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:58.943
Now, we just have to do this for point S

00:06:58.943 --> 00:07:02.033
and then we have the three
points for our image.

00:07:02.033 --> 00:07:06.895
So, point S, once again we can
construct a right triangle.

00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:08.093
Let's do that.

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:11.153
So, hypotenuse, we'll connect point S

00:07:11.153 --> 00:07:13.493
to our center of rotation,

00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:17.131
and I can do this several ways.

00:07:17.131 --> 00:07:20.341
Let me think about the best way to do it.

00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:22.490
Well, let me construct this right triangle

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.973
so it looks like this.

00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:28.473
And then looks like this.

00:07:28.473 --> 00:07:33.473
So, this top side, this
top side right over here.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.478
If I were to rotate it,

00:07:35.478 --> 00:07:38.999
if I were to rotate it
negative 90 degrees,

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:40.559
90 degrees in the clockwise direction,

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:41.839
where does that put us?

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:44.817
Well, once again it's gonna
put us straight up and down

00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:47.137
and this length is it goes from

00:07:47.137 --> 00:07:49.098
X equals negative three to X equals four.

00:07:49.098 --> 00:07:50.697
So, it's seven long.

00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:54.999
So, it gets us to this
point right over here.

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:59.718
Now, this side, let me be
careful when I just say this,

00:07:59.718 --> 00:08:02.197
and let me do it in a different color.

00:08:02.197 --> 00:08:05.036
This side over here forms a right angle

00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:07.297
and so it's, and if you
see when you go from here

00:08:07.297 --> 00:08:09.857
you go down so here you're gonna go left

00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:11.559
and you see that it's three long.

00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:14.617
So, it's three, it's three long.

00:08:14.617 --> 00:08:16.418
This is a right angle right over here

00:08:16.418 --> 00:08:18.756
and that gets us to our S prime.

00:08:18.756 --> 00:08:21.077
That gets us to our S prime.

00:08:21.077 --> 00:08:24.490
We can now draw the hypotenuse.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.742
So, notice this whole, like,

00:08:27.742 --> 00:08:30.617
kind of crazy complex that we have drawn

00:08:30.617 --> 00:08:31.478
of these different triangles,

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:34.158
I've just rotated the whole
thing by negative 90 degrees.

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:37.216
But this triangle that
we have, that we were,

00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:40.500
we had just made when you rotated it

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.378
maps to that one right over there.

00:08:42.378 --> 00:08:44.177
But now we have in our image our

00:08:44.177 --> 00:08:45.776
S prime, our A prime, and our M prime,

00:08:45.776 --> 00:08:47.017
and we can connect them.

00:08:47.017 --> 00:08:48.736
So, it will look like this.

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:49.982
So, let's just connect them.

00:08:49.982 --> 00:08:51.539
Connect the dots.

00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:56.539
So, that, and that, and that.

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:03.007
And so, you see, you might have
lost our original triangle.

00:09:03.007 --> 00:09:05.536
I'm just gonna shade it
in so you can see it clear

00:09:05.536 --> 00:09:07.958
although what we really care
about is mapping the points.

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.456
Mapping, actually, let me.

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:11.787
I don't want you to
think that we're mapping,

00:09:11.787 --> 00:09:14.896
that we're mapping everything in between.

00:09:14.896 --> 00:09:17.376
We're just mapping the points
that define the triangle.

00:09:17.376 --> 00:09:19.238
So, our original triangle
that we cared about

00:09:19.238 --> 00:09:22.107
was this thing that I'm
gonna draw really bold.

00:09:22.107 --> 00:09:24.119
It was this thing.

00:09:24.119 --> 00:09:27.275
And I'm gonna draw it really, really bold.

00:09:27.275 --> 00:09:29.116
And you rotate it by negative 90 degrees

00:09:29.116 --> 00:09:30.995
which is equivalent to positive 270.

00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:34.217
You could've rotated it positive 270.

00:09:34.217 --> 00:09:36.198
You could've rotated
it positive 270 to get

00:09:36.198 --> 00:09:38.438
to this other one right over here

00:09:38.438 --> 00:09:40.057
but it maps to this.

00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:41.678
This is its image.

00:09:41.678 --> 00:09:44.457
Now we just have to go
back onto the exercise.

00:09:44.457 --> 00:09:47.336
Now we have to go back onto
the exercise and put it in.

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:48.355
So, let's remember these points.

00:09:48.355 --> 00:09:52.115
We have the point eight comma five.

00:09:52.115 --> 00:09:57.017
So, we have the point eight
comma five in our image.

00:09:57.717 --> 00:10:02.596
We have the point nine comma seven,

00:10:03.426 --> 00:10:08.426
nine comma seven, and we have the point,

00:10:09.204 --> 00:10:14.155
and we have the point one comma five.

00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:18.551
So, we have the point one comma five

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:19.512
and now I just have to finish it

00:10:19.512 --> 00:10:21.333
by going to this point again

00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:22.075
and we're all done.

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:24.874
We've rotated it by 270 degrees

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.514
which is equivalent to a
negative 90 degree rotation.

00:10:27.514 --> 00:10:31.072
We can check that we indeed got it right.
