00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.365
So, we know you're at mile marker 210. But before you put your map away, your

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:11.408
friend sees another town located seven miles south of mile marker 234. So

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:15.544
what's the distance to this second town? Keep in mind that you want to find the

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:19.651
shortest distance to the town. When you think you have that answer, enter it

00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:26.586
here. Then, let me know if this town is closer than this town. If this town is

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:29.940
closer, chose yes, otherwise choose no.
