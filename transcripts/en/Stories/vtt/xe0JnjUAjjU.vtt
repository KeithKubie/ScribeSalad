00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:05.980
INTERVIEWER: So
here's your moment

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.910
of eerie beauty for today.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.240
The desolate landscape
and moody sky

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.670
accentuate the
wreckage of this plane,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.230
and set against this
vista is a couple just

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.100
barely holding hands.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.230
An old wreck like this hardly
seems like a romantic spot,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.060
and yet they seem lost
in a tender moment.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.246
So why this place?

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.110
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.585
The image was taken
by this couple.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:30.710
HALLDORA: Hi, I'm Halldora.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.030
HOBIE: And I'm Hobie.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.510
We are not only a couple,
but also a photo team.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.510
HALLDORA: This photo was
taken at Solheimasandur

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.881
on the south coast of Iceland.

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:40.630
INTERVIEWER: Halldora
and Hobie specialize

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.095
in wedding photos set against
the dramatic landscape

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:44.580
of Iceland.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.490
In this case, the couple in
the photo-- Amanda and Rich--

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.770
have traveled from Philadelphia
to celebrate their anniversary.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.430
They wanted to
document the trip,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.012
so they reached out to Halldora
and Hobie with a suggestion.

00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:56.595
HOBIE: I'd always
wanted to photograph

00:00:56.595 --> 00:00:57.952
a couple at the plane.

00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:00.860
So we were thrilled when Amanda
and Rich contacted us, and said

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.234
they were interested
in shooting there.

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:04.900
INTERVIEWER: The
weather-beaten wreckage

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.550
is a US Naval plane that
crash-landed landed on the site

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.460
in 1973.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.440
The abandoned fuselage against
the expansive, frozen black

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.250
sand beach made for a great
location for the shoot.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.820
And with some encouragement,
Amanda and Rich

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.140
climbed on top of the plane.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.546
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.530
HOBIE: Once they
were up there, they

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.321
were so immersed in
the view that they soon

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:25.840
forgot we were even there.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.330
They were truly
enjoying the moment

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.961
with each other, which made
for some spectacular photos.

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:31.460
INTERVIEWER: It's
moments like these

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.830
that make Halldora and
Hobie really appreciate

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.810
what they do for a living.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.560
HOBIE: Photography was
our common interest

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.680
that brough us together.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.120
Everything we do is
related to photography.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.320
We love exploring
new landscapes,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.960
searching for that
next amazing place

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.994
to photograph a couple at.

00:01:46.994 --> 00:01:48.910
HALLDORA: Photography
pushes us to go further,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.946
to never stop exploring.

00:01:50.946 --> 00:01:52.320
INTERVIEWER: And
there's no doubt

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.260
that the varied and dramatic
Icelandic scenery gives them

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.540
endless opportunities to capture
some really stunning images.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.040
HOBIE: Photographing
couples in love

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.680
in a country filled with
sparkling, white glaciers,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.270
black sand beaches, moss
covered lava fields,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.563
vivid northern lights,
and blue hot springs.

00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:10.979
There are few
places where you can

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.750
find both volcanoes and
glaciers, side by side

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.970
in the same country.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.680
Making Iceland commonly referred
to as the Land of Fire and Ice.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.269
There's no better
backdrop for a wedding.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.810
INTERVIEWER: If you
liked this video,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.470
be sure to check out this one
on extreme adventure racing

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.517
across Patagonia.

00:02:28.517 --> 00:02:30.600
SUBJECT 1: It just takes
my breath away every time

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.300
I go there.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.216
SUBJECT 2: And we've
climbed unknown mountains

00:02:33.216 --> 00:02:35.980
while racing, we've rafted
on our little Therm-a-Rests

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.232
down unknown rivers,
days without sleep.
