Now that we've completed the square, we've actually reached our goal. We have a

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:08.760
perfect square on the left, and a number on the right. This is an equation we

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.800
know how to solve. We can simply take the square root of both sides, indicating

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.608
the plus or minus here, and then solve for x. So you try finishing solving this

00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:21.929
equation. What would be the values for x? When you enter your answer, be sure

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.710
to use the plus or minus symbol. Good luck.
