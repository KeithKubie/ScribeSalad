THE AGE-OLD SCIENTIFIC MYTH
THAT SPIDER SILK

00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:11.067
IS STRONGER THAN STEEL,
IS COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE.

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.601

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:24.033

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.701
WHY GO TO THIS LENGTH?
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.834
THE FACT IS, THAT WHEN YOU'RE
TESTING STUFF IN SCALE,

AS LONG AS YOU ITERATE AND YOU
COME TO SOME GOOD CONCLUSIONS,

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:02.868
