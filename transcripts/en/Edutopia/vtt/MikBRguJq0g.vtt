&gt;&gt;Daniel Goleman: If I could
change one thing in education,

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:10.386
it would be making explicit
the now implicit understanding

00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:14.796
that the emotional atmosphere
of the classroom matters.

00:00:14.796 --> 00:00:17.866
It's not irrelevant; in fact,
it's essential to learning.

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.536
And the reason it's essential to
learning, from the scientific point

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:22.736
of view, is that the
emotional centers

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:26.616
of the brain actually can take
over the centers for learning,

00:00:27.116 --> 00:00:30.926
and so our attention goes from
what the teacher is saying

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:34.946
to that thing that's upsetting us,
and the failure to understand this,

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:38.386
I think, handicaps
education as a system.

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:42.796
So, if we were to make explicit
the fact that "yes" it matters

00:00:42.796 --> 00:00:47.096
that students feel safe; it
matters that students feel calm;

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.556
it matters that they're attentive.

00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:52.196
And they won't be attentive unless
they're calm and now that we're ready

00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:53.416
to learn, we can go ahead.
