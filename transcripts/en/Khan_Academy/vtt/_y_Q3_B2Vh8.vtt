00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:03.588
Now we mixed up things a little bit more:

00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:07.466
on the left side of the scale,
not only do we have

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.487
these identical unknown masses with mass X,
these three blue things,

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:14.087
we also have some of the 1kg masses
over here,

00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:16.498
actually, we have two of them.

00:00:16.498 --> 00:00:18.588
Now, we are going to figure out what X is.

00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:22.687
But before we even do that, I want you to think about a mathematical equation

00:00:22.687 --> 00:00:27.554
that can represent what is going on;
that equates what we have on the left hand,

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:31.620
with what we have on the right side of the scale.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.354
I will give you a few seconds to think about it...

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:37.620
So let's think about what we have on the left side:

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.020
we have 3 masses with mass X, so you can say
we have 3x

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.154
and then we have 2 masses of 1 kilogram,
so in total we have 2 kg. So + 2.

00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:57.354
So one way to think about the total mass on the left-hand side is 3x + 2.

00:00:57.354 --> 00:01:00.848
Three masses with mass X,
plus two kilograms.

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:02.938
That is what we have on the left-hand side.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:05.585
Now, let us think about what we have on the right-hand side.

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:07.154
We can simply count them:

00:01:07.154 --> 00:01:11.855
[counts to 14]

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:19.220
Fourteen blocks, each has a mass of 1 kg,
so the total mass will be 14 kg.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.620
And we see that the scale is balanced, not tilting down or upwards.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.666
So this mass over here must be equal to this total mass.

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:34.087
The scale is balanced,
so we can write an 'equal'-sign.

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:37.220
(let me do that in a white coulour,
I do not like that brown)

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.258
Now, what I want you to think about,

00:01:41.274 --> 00:01:44.890
and you can think about it either through the symbols or through the scales, is:

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.104
how would you go about --
let us think about a few things:

00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:54.090
how would you first go about at least getting rid of these little 1kg blocks?

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.557
I will give you a second to think about that...

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:01.107
Well, the simplest thing is:

00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:03.940
you can take these 1kg blocks off of the left-hand side,

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.098
but remember, if you just took these blocks off of the left-hand side,

00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:10.357
and it was balanced before,
now the left-hand side will be lighter

00:02:10.357 --> 00:02:13.757
and it will move up. But we want to keep it balanced so we can keep saying 'equal'.

00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:16.107
That this mass is equal to that mass.

00:02:16.107 --> 00:02:21.490
So, if we remove 2 block from the left-hand side,
we need to remove 2 from the right-hand side.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.490
So, we can remove two there,
and then we can remove two over there.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.340
Mathematically, what we are doing is:
we are subtracting 2 kilograms from each side.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.157
We are subtracting 2 from this side,

00:02:34.157 --> 00:02:38.909
So on the left-hand side we now have
3x + 2, minus 2

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.624
we are left with just 3x,

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:47.557
and on the right-hand side we had 14 and we took away 2 (let me write this:)

00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:53.023
we took away 2, so we are going to be left with 12 blocks.

00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:56.423
And you see that there, the ones that I have not crossed out, there are 12 left,

00:02:56.423 --> 00:02:58.957
and here you have 3 of those X-blocks.

00:02:58.957 --> 00:03:02.361
Since we removed the same amount from both sides,

00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:08.357
our scale is still balanced. And our equation:
3x is now equal to 12.

00:03:08.357 --> 00:03:12.690
Now, this turns into a problem very similar to what we saw in the last video,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.083
so now I ask you: what can we do to isolate one x,

00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:21.428
to only have one 'X' on the left-hand side of the scale,

00:03:21.428 --> 00:03:24.552
while keeping the scale balanced?

00:03:28.163 --> 00:03:30.629
The easiest way to think about it is:

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.154
If I want one X on this left-hand side, that is a third of the total X's here.

00:03:35.154 --> 00:03:38.963
So what if I were to multiply the left-hand side by one-third --

00:03:38.963 --> 00:03:43.745
-- but if I want to keep the scale balanced,
I have to multiply the right-hand side by one-third.

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:46.229
If we can do that mathematically,

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.563
Over here I can multiply the left-hand side by 1/3,

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:55.163
and if I want to keep my scale balanced I also have to multiply the right-hand side by 1/3.

00:03:55.163 --> 00:04:00.563
Multiplying it physically literally means: just keeping a third of what we had originally

00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:03.896
We would get rid of two of these.

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:06.029
If we want to keep a third of what we had here originally,

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.896
-- there are 12 blocks left over after removing those first two --

00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:15.429
so, 1/3 of 12: we are only going to have four of these little 1kg boxes left.

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:21.363
Let me remove all but four.
(so, remove those, and those...)

00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:24.659
And I have left [counts them] 4 here.

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.563
And so, what you are left with,
the only thing you have left,

00:04:27.563 --> 00:04:32.554
is this 'X' - I will shade it in to show this is the one we actually have left -

00:04:32.554 --> 00:04:37.058
and then we have these 1 kilogram boxes.

00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:40.866
You see it mathematically over here:
1/3 * 3x

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:45.763
-- or you could have said 3x divided by 3 --
either way, that gives us

00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:49.736
-- these threes cancel out, so that would give you an 'X'

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:56.633
and on the right-hand side: 12 * 1/3 - which is the same as 12/3, is equal to 4.

00:04:56.633 --> 00:05:02.600
And, since we did the same thing to both sides, the scale is still balanced.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.894
So you see that the mass of this thing must be the same as the mass of these 4 left-over blocks.

00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:10.829
x must be equal to 4 kilograms.
