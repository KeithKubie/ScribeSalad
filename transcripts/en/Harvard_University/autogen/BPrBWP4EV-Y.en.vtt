exactly
 

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:10.710
exactly
so I'm wondering if in the tradition of

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720

so I'm wondering if in the tradition of
of economic reparations for those

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:14.950
of economic reparations for those
 

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:18.790
of economic reparations for those
japanese-americans who who were unable

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:18.800
japanese-americans who who were unable
 

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:22.420
japanese-americans who who were unable
to work and earn money while they were

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:22.430
to work and earn money while they were
 

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:25.030
to work and earn money while they were
in internment camps during World War two

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040
in internment camps during World War two
 

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.600
in internment camps during World War two

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:28.610
and so that those economic reparations
 

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:31.600
and so that those economic reparations
were paid out an average of $20,000

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:31.610
were paid out an average of $20,000
