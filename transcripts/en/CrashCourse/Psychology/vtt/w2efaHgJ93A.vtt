00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.069
If you saw our last lesson on psychotherapy
you might be wondering: What happened to Bernice?

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.400
Has she found a way to manage her depression?
Is she still wracked with anxiety?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.080
Well it's really nice of you to ask. And I'll
tell her you said, "hi." But for our purposes

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.070
as students of psychology, the bigger question
arising from Bernice's case is "has psychotherapy

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.740
helped?" and just as important, "how can we
tell?"

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.950
Well believe it or not, one of the main ways
experts use is to simply ask the client, and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.590
see how they say they're doing.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.150
Is Bernice out of bed, and living her life?
Did she make it through mid-terms without

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.719
spiraling into a crisis? And did she take that
plane trip to Baja to party with her girls?

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.960
As a clinician, that would all be useful to
know, right? But the key is that we want to

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.269
ask these questions in a scientifically rigorous
manner, so that we really know a treatment

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.030
works, rather than just extrapolating from
individual cases.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.269
And there's also a whole other category of
treatment that's pretty different from the

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.940
talking and listening that goes on in psychotherapy.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.200
These are as much medical intervention as
they are psychological science; the biomedical

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.880
treatments. These can be as common-place as
medications like Zoloft or Lithium, or a bit

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:06.880
more unusual and invasive like magnetic stimulation,
neural implants, or even electroshock therapy.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.080
And YES, it's still a thing.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.460
Healing a troublesome mind isn't like healing
a broken arm. So one of the challenges that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.829
psychologists face is simply knowing whether
they're doing their job, and doing it well.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.229
The methods psychologists use to assess how
effective treatments are mostly involve client

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.979
and clinician perceptions along with outcome
research. Client perceptions are just what

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.869
they sound like, you see a therapist, and
someone asks you how you feel after your treatment.

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.129
It varies by treatment, but client perception
tends to be pretty rosy. One study found that

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:49.479
89% of folks said that they were at least
"fairly well satisfied" with their treatment.

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.390
But of course, perceptions are inherently
subjective, and some believe that the therapeutic

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.310
relationship lends itself to a positive bias
in client reviews. Basically, if you're sticking

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.770
to your treatment, you probably like your
therapist.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.300
Clinician perspectives can be similarly skewed,
not only in terms of a self-serving bias,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.790
but also because they may not be around to
see a client's future relapses or setbacks

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.470
in mental health. A patient could see ten
therapists over time, feel better at the end

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.370
of each treatment, but keep struggling over
the long term, even though each

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.580
therapist thought the treatment was a success.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.320
So, can we objectively measure how well
psychotherapy works? Well, we have treatment

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.720
outcome research, a way of systematically measuring
which therapies work best for which problems.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.860
And the gold standard of treatment outcome
research is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.170
If you will remember your research methods,
you'll know that RCTs generally require randomly

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.840
selected and assigned participants, a control
group, and at least one experimental group

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.700
that receives the treatment. This design accounts
for individual differences between people

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.200
and other extraneous factors, so that we know
that if people in the experimental group get

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.180
better and people in the control group don't,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.320
it was truly the therapeutic intervention that made the difference.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.460
And once enough researchers have run their
own RCTs, you can gather data via meta analysis,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.440
measuring results across multiple trials to
see basically whether a treatment works, and

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.190
how well it does, across a variety of settings.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.090
Two important terms you should know here are
effectiveness and efficacy. Effectiveness

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.980
is whether or not a given therapy works in
a "real-world setting," whereas efficacy is

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.120
whether a therapy works better than some other,
comparable intervention, or a control. Both

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.950
terms matter, and you'll wanna get them straight,
if you're tryin' to parse the research literature.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.050
Dozens of studies have confirmed that psychotherapy
is both effective and efficacious. While controls,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.000
usually people who don't get any therapy,
often do get better on their own, those in

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.120
psychotherapy usually improve faster, and
with a significantly lower risk of relapse.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.720
However, and try not to look too shocked when
I tell you this, there is a lot of argument

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.480
about which therapies work best.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.220
In some cases, like phobias, there are clear
winners, behavior therapy for instance. In

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.710
others, like major depressive disorder, there
are cognitive, behavioral and psychodynamic

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.060
interventions that have all been successful
in RCTs. And while a lot of psychologists

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.070
seem to get a kick out of arguing about which
therapies are better than others, there do

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.860
seem to be some common factors that unite
the more effective ones.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.590
A big one is simply instilling hope, helping
demoralized clients regain hope that things

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.320
can, and will get better. There is also the
value of getting a new perspective, learning

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.090
that there is a plausible explanation for
your troubles, and finding a new way of looking

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.340
at yourself, the world around you, and what
your future might look like. And across the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.010
board, any good therapist provides genuine
empathy within a trusting, caring relationship.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.470
They seek to listen, and understand and not
judge, and offer clear and positive communication.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.220
But psychotherapy, or talking it out, is just
one way to treat psychological disorders.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.930
Quite often, biomedical therapies are an option,
sometimes for the more severe disorders, but

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.670
in many cases, in combination with psychotherapy.
Biomedical therapies aim to physiologically

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.600
change the brain's electrochemical state with
psychotropic drugs, magnetic impulses, or

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.570
even electrical currents and surgery. As you
might expect, pharmacotherapy is by far the

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.060
most widely used, that's the one where you
just take drugs. Psychotropic drugs are just

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.580
any pharmaceutical that affects your mental
state, the most commonly used ones fall into

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.220
four major categories; antipsychotics, anxiolytics,
antidepressants, and mood stabilizers,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.520
each aimed at a specific family of problems.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.380
Antipsychotics are used to treat schizophrenia
and other types of severe thought disorders.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.380
Most of these medications alter the effects
of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.590
by blocking its receptor sites, and blocking
its uptake. This is based on the assumption

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.389
that an overactive dopamine system contributes
to schizophrenia, but, like many psychotropic

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.149
drugs, antipsychotics come with nasty side
effects.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:46.780
Anxiolytics, or anti-anxiety meds, usually
work by depressing activity in the central

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.930
nervous system, much like a stiff drink might.
For this reason, and others, it can be super

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.250
dangerous to mix certain anxiety meds with
booze. Also, letting your nerves mellow out

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.690
can feel so good that patients may risk becoming
addicted to some anxiolytics.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.620
Antidepressants are used to treat depression,
as you might expect, but also a number of

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.210
anxiety disorders. Each type is thought to
work a bit differently, mainly by altering

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.910
the availability of various neurotransmitters,
like serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.250
which in turn appears to help with mood and
anxiety problems. Some of the most common

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:24.169
are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors,
or SSRIs, like Zoloft, Paxil, and Prozac,

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.500
which partially block the normal re-uptake
of serotonin. This makes it more available

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.870
to the synapses, which, hypothetically at
least, allows its mood-enhancing effects to

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.460
kick in. Current research suggests that the
use of antidepressant medication is most effective

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.060
when combined with psychotherapy, which makes
a lot of sense, and the same goes for a number

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.020
of other psychological disorders.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.410
It's worth pointing out here that some meta-analyses
suggest that antidepressants aren't any more

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.980
effective than psychotherapy when symptoms
are mild to moderate. One meta analysis that

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.380
riled people up in recent years even suggested
that antidepressants are no better than a

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.250
placebo in those cases. So psychotropic drugs
can help, but sometimes you also need to start

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.590
exploring the root causes of your issues and
reevaluate how you deal with them, which is

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.570
what psychotherapy is perfect for.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.540
Bernice, for example, probably would have
benefited from both talk therapy and a dose

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.590
of anxiolytic or antidepressant meds.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.900
The last big psychotropic drug group is the
mood-stabilizers. They can be extremely effective

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.040
in smoothing out the highs and lows of bipolar
disorder. Simple salts of Lithium were the

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.580
first of these drugs used, and they remain
in widespread use today. Dr. Kay Redfield

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.820
Jamison, who we talked about a few weeks ago
has said that Lithium "prevents my disastrous

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.180
highs, diminishes my depressions, gentles
me out, keeps me from ruining my career and

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.160
relationships, keeps me out of a hospital,
and alive."

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.840
And while drugs are the most popular biomedical
treatment, they aren't the only kind. For

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.729
one, there's electro-shock therapy. Now, hear
me out, this does carry a long history of

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.419
negative connotations, like of people being
strapped down and shocked into mental oblivion,

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:56.559
but the technology has made a comeback, and
can actually be quite effective in treating

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.760
severe, treatment-resistant depression. It's
properly called electroconvulsive therapy,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:05.660
or ECT, and it involves sending a brief electrical
current through the brain of an anesthetized

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.419
patient. This excites the neurons, causing
them to fire rapidly, until the patient goes

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:15.010
through a small, controlled seizure that lasts
about two minutes. And we're not exactly sure

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.590
why this helps to relieve negative symptoms, but
there are several theories that are being pursued.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.620
One suggests that the resulting seizure beneficially
alters neurotransmitter activity in areas

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.180
of the brain associated with moods and emotions,
effectively jumpstarting a severely depressed

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.479
brain. Another theory suggests that these
electrical impulses modify stress hormone

00:08:33.479 --> 00:08:38.099
activity in the brain, which we know could
play a role in sleep, energy, appetite, and

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.219
mood. ECT may also re-activate previously
dormant or suppressed neurons, or possibly

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:49.559
stimulate the growth of new ones in key brain regions,
helping the brain regain some level of lost functioning.

00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:53.779
There are a couple of other brain-stimulation
treatments, too, that are more gentle. One

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:59.319
is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,
rTMS, which involves the painless application

00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:05.319
of repeated electromagnetic pulses. Another,
deep-brain stimulation, DBS, is more invasive,

00:09:05.319 --> 00:09:09.990
and calls for surgically implanting a kind
of "brain pacemaker" that sends out electrical

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.639
impulses to specific parts of the brain. Despite
all the new research and often positive results

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:20.129
around rTMS and DBS, we're still sorting out
how these treatments work to heal the brain

00:09:20.129 --> 00:09:26.140
and mind, but they're hypothesized to jump-start the
neural circuitry in a depressed brain, similarly to ECT.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.300
So you'll notice that all these options come
with certain risks, and really no treatment

00:09:30.309 --> 00:09:35.649
is entirely risk free, perhaps not even psychotherapy.
But we should also note that some of the less

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:40.089
severe manifestations of psychological disorders
may be improved with pretty simple lifestyle

00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:44.579
changes. Thirty to sixty minutes of daily
aerobic exercise has been shown to be as effective

00:09:44.579 --> 00:09:49.459
as antidepressant medications in research
on mild depression. Just remember those words;

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:54.220
"daily" and "aerobic." Adequate sleep, social
interaction, and good nutrition also all play

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.600
a part in managing moods. In other words,
general healthy living helps. There's an Old

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.009
English proverb that says "different sores
have different salves" and the same is true

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:06.800
here. What works for one person may not work
for another, and sometimes a few different

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.249
kinds of intervention might be needed all
at once.

00:10:09.249 --> 00:10:13.579
Today you learned how client and clinician
perceptions, outcome research, and meta-analytic

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:18.589
reviews work together to determine the efficacy
and effectiveness of psychological treatments.

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:22.559
You also learned how biomedical therapies
work, including the four major families of

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:27.389
drug therapies, along with electro-convulsive
therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:32.619
stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. And
also how lifestyle changes and general healthy

00:10:32.619 --> 00:10:34.420
living can improve mental health.
