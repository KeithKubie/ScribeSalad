Okay, tonight I want
to dedicate this first act

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.938
to talking about a subject
that I don't think

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:07.206
we pay enough attention to

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.641
because of the craziness
of our world.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:10.543
I'm talking about wildlife.

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:13.946
Now, it's upon us to be stewards
of these creatures

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.515
who really have no...

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.117
I'm just kidding.
We're talking about Trump.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.086
-(cheering, applause)
-Come on, guys.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.788
It's Trump.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.957
All right,
roll the Unblackening.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.359
♪ ♪

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.328
(roaring)

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.598
(roaring)

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:38.571
So wrong, so wrong.

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:40.239
Okay, funny story--

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:42.008
couple weeks ago,
we were all saying,

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.211
"Man, Trump just criticized
the family of a fallen soldier?

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.913
"What?

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.582
There's no way he could do
anything worse than this."

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.986
He did.

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.656
Hillary wants to abolish,
essentially abolish,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.558
the Second Amendment.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.694
If she gets to pick her judges--

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:03.563
nothing you can do, folks.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:04.931
(crowd clamoring)

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.732
Although, the Second Amendment
people, maybe there is.

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't know.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.735
AUDIENCE:
Ooh.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:12.305
Yup, that's right. Donald Trump
not so subtly hinting

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.874
that gun rights activists
should "do something"

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:18.444
about Hillary Clinton.
Really? You're joking about

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.813
your political opponent
being whacked.

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:23.382
Okay, guys,
I used to think rational,

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.185
well-intentioned people could be
on opposite sides of the aisle

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:28.688
and intelligen...
intelligently debate the merits

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.023
of both governing philosophies.
But you know what?

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:32.725
At this point,
if you vote for Trump,

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:36.095
you're just a dick.
Seriously.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:38.131
(cheering, applause)

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:40.500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.136
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:46.639
I hope you get destroyed
by a horse-sized duck.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:47.840
How about that?

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:49.208
(cheering, applause)

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:50.476
How about that?

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.677
That's all I'm saying.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.647
No, horrible thing to say.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.150
It's an inside joke.
I apologize.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.218
No, because there's
no possible way

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.454
this can be
misinterpreted, right?

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.189
Okay, let's hear from Trump's

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:06.726
chief spokesgoblin,
Katrina Pierson...

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.728
and join me
as I watch in amazement

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.664
as the (bleep)
pours out of her mouth.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:14.033 line:0%
Mr. Trump was saying
exactly what he said.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.569
He was talking about
Hillary Clinton and gun control.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.371
But, Katrina,
he was talking about

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:21.007
what Second Amendment activists
could do

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.709
to stop her if she won.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:25.344
PIERSON:
Well, no, that's-that's actually

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:26.646
not what he was talking about.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.616
Okay, let me stop you
right there. (bleep) you.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.553
That<i> is</i> what he was
talking about.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.755
I don't care how convoluted
your explanation is.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.490
We're not stupid.
We can hear.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.058
Stop trying to explain him away.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.861
But it wasn't just her trying
to force-feed us this turd taco.

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:43.729 line:0%
You're treating
Mr. Trump's words like he is

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:46.599 line:0%
the most articulate person
who's ever graced our ears

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:48.868 line:0%
with his words,
and-and that is not true.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.637
But... So, let's say that
he was an-an English professor

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.040
with a PhD in-in grammar.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.977
Okay...

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.745
First of all,

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:01.514
you can't get a PhD in a subject

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.783
that's taught
in the fifth grade, okay?

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.218
Okay? Okay...

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.286
That's like getting
a bachelors of science

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.622
in kickball or something, right?

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.023
And, second, just to be clear,

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.359
your argument is that Trump
is so incoherent

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:15.061
he can't be held accountable

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.697
when his words might
constitute a federal crime.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.900
And, of course, what defense
of Trump would be complete

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:24.370
without the human embodiment
of impotent rage himself,

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:26.405
Rudy Giuliani?

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:28.341 line:0%
You know how speeches go.
He was talking about

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.143 line:0%
how they have the power
to keep her out of office.

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:33.546
The first time that any of us
had any idea that

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:34.847
that is way it was interpreted

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.950
is when the Clinton spin machine
interpreted it that way.

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:40.319
The Clinton spin machine
spun it out.

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:41.754
Clinton spin machine?

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.689
That sounds like a line
Bill would have used

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:45.691
in the '90s, right?

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:48.361
"Hey, you want to ride
the Clinton spin machine?"

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.763
Right? I'm just sayin'.
I'm just sayin'.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.498
-Sounds like it.
-(cheering, applause)

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:55.601
But...

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:58.104
It's... We're maybe
doing those jokes

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.673
for the next eight years.
That's really sad, right?

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:03.909
But once again, it's acting like
we can't hear something.

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:07.813
Like he's blaming<i> us</i> for hearing
exactly what Trump said.

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:10.616
Here's what gets me about this,
okay? Giuliani is...

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.085
he's here diminishing the power
of Trump's words,

00:04:13.118 --> 00:04:16.188
but he's not always
so calm about language.

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:18.524
We've had, from on top,

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:21.994
a lot of divisiveness and
a lot of anti-police rhetoric.

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:24.330
There's a target
on police officers' backs

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:26.999
is because of groups
like Black Lives Matter

00:04:27.032 --> 00:04:30.670
that make it seem like
all police are against blacks.

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:33.139
Okay, so when Trump calls
for the violent death

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.207
of his opposition,
that's just Clinton spin.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.676
But when
it's Black Lives Matter,

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.077
they're literally killing people

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.580
with the power of their
"hypnotizing Negro language."

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:44.083
Look, the difference between
a random protester

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.585
and someone running to be
the leader of the free world

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:49.322
is that once you're president,
everything you say has meaning.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:50.589
I'll-I'll show you
how this works.

00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:51.924
Okay, look,
here at<i> The Nightly Show,</i>

00:04:51.957 --> 00:04:53.592
I-I mean, I'm the boss, right?

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.662
I'm kind of "the president"
of this show, if you will.

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:58.531
Right? You know what I mean.
Okay, now, look,

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:00.666
Rory Albanese
is my executive producer.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.602
Oh, hey. What's up, Larry?
Hey, great show so far, boss.

00:05:03.635 --> 00:05:05.604
Thanks, Rory.
I appreciate that, man.

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:08.007
-Killing it, killing it.
-Now, I might be a little upset

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.609
at Rory one day, just talking
off the top of my head,

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:12.011
"Man, I can't stand Rory.

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:14.480
Sometimes I wish somebody
would just make him go away."

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:16.816
Now, because I'm the boss
and I have influence,

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.152
-those words mean something.
-(Albanese yelling)

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:22.154
Oh, my God, what...
what-what's going on?

00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:23.823
Holly, what the hell
are you doing?!

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.891
-What the hell are you doing,
Holly?! -Holly!

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:27.426
(Albanese yelling)

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:29.228
Larry said you needed to die!

00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:31.230
What the hell?! Stop it!

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:32.498
-Stop it!
-(grunting)

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.300
Holly, Holly! Leave him alone!

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.568
It was just words!

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.370
-Oh.
-(groans)

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.438
-Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
-Yes.

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:41.774
I, uh...
Your words are so powerful.

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:43.776
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.512
-You know, I was influenced.
-Exactly.

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:49.048
-Yeah. -Well, you know what,
Holly, when you put it that way,

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.384
-actually, it's fair.
What you did is fair. -Oh.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.352
(applause)

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:56.288
Good job, guys! Good job.

00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.958
That's the power of<i> my</i> words,
and I'm on basic cable.

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.626
So I don't care how much
they try to spin this--

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.028
stop being so careless
with your language. All right.

00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:05.231
Okay, here
to explain himself...

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:06.966
(chuckles)

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:10.302
Here to explain himself--
that's right-- is Donald Trump.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:12.805
(cheering and applause)

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:15.141
All right. Okay.

00:06:15.174 --> 00:06:18.144
Thanks for coming, uh...
thanks for coming, Donald.

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:19.645
Now, I have to ask you directly,

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:22.047
did you
or did you not basically call

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.983
for the assassination
of Hillary Clinton yesterday?

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.051
Look, come on, Larry,
look, did I "use"

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:29.588
the word "assassination"?
I mean, no, I mean, come on.

00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:32.925
I just said there was something
people who believe in,

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.927
you know, the good amendment,
the-the one, uh,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.929
with the guns...

00:06:36.962 --> 00:06:38.798
The Second Amendment?

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:42.001
Oh, God, leave it to a black
to know everything about guns.

00:06:42.034 --> 00:06:44.003
-I mean, come on.
-What the (bleep)?

00:06:44.036 --> 00:06:46.939
So unbelievably typical, okay?

00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:50.276
I just said there was something
people who believe

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.745
-in the Second Amendment
could do, okay-- -Uh-huh.

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:55.481
get out to vote, write letters,
or do whateverly...

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:59.985
heavily armed, angry mobs do,
okay? Whatever that is, okay?

00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:03.456
-It's a free country, no thanks
to Obama, okay? -Tha...

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:05.191
But I'm supposed to guess
what they're gonna do?

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.126
-Come on. I mean, give me
a break. -I feel... Look,

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:08.661
I feel you know
exactly what you meant,

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:11.597
and my fear is that<i> they</i> knew
exactly what you meant.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.599
Come on, look, it was a joke.

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:16.268
I mean, I get it.
You don't know what a joke is.

00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:19.071
Believe me, I've watched
this show. It's awful, okay?

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:21.474
It's a complete disaster.

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.477
-But, uh, I am an entertainer,
okay? -Really?

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.012
So, look, I'll actually write
a joke right now.

00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:28.614
Watch this.
It's gonna be hilarious.

00:07:28.647 --> 00:07:30.282
Here we go.
(clears throat)

00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:32.284
Knock, knock.

00:07:32.317 --> 00:07:34.153
-Oh, God.
-Knock, knock.

00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:36.489
-Fine. Who's there? -Excuse me,
don't interrupt, okay?

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:38.691
What? You said "knock, knock."

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:40.960
I want an answer, Donald.
Did you or did you not

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.428
basically call
for the assassination

00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:43.929
-of Hillary Clinton?
-You know what, I don't need

00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:45.598
-to answer that, Larry.
I really don't, okay? -Please...

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.466
Matter of fact, I'm tired
of this political correctness

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:49.268
in America today.
Back in the day,

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:51.470
a politician
could actually straight-up shoot

00:07:51.503 --> 00:07:54.406
a political rival,
and I know because I saw that

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.776
in<i> Black Hamilton,</i> okay?

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:01.146
<i> Black Hamilton?</i>

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:04.950
Wait, first of all, it's
just called<i> Hamilton,</i> all right?

00:08:04.983 --> 00:08:06.952
And that's your takeaway,

00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:08.754
that we're
too politically correct today

00:08:08.787 --> 00:08:11.156
and we should be shooting people
we disagree with?

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:14.360
-God, that would be great,
right? Unbelievable. -No!

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:16.562
Look, but don't put words
in my mouth, Larry, okay?

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:19.131
-I'm only joking or
I'm improperly implying -I'm...

00:08:19.164 --> 00:08:21.066
or saying one thing
while meaning another.

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:23.669
It's called being entertaining,
okay?

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:25.871
Okay, fine. Well,
when are you gonna stop trying

00:08:25.904 --> 00:08:28.040
to be entertaining and
start trying to be presidential?

00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:30.109
When I become president, okay?

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:33.779
That way, whatever I do
is gonna be presidential, okay?

00:08:33.812 --> 00:08:35.714
-Stupid question.
-All right, Donald...

00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:38.613
Donald Trump, everyone.
We'll be right back.
