1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.820
[inaudible] listening to radio lab radio show from [inaudible].

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.390
W.

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.000
N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

4
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.440
This is radio lab podcast. Oh, does that how it usually works,

5
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:23.220
do you say the podcast? Yes. No, it just sounded,

6
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.880
sounded so different to different, something just got some sweat.

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.620
That's really how we did it. We could try. We could just do this,

8
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.610
do it differently. Let, I'll try to go first. [inaudible] shock. Yeah. Okay.

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.570
Do it. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich from jet. Have him ride. I am,

10
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:41.610
this is radio lab, the podcast,

11
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.780
and on this podcast we are going to have a conversation. Not,

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.470
not an easy conversation. I wouldn't say nope.

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.430
It begins really with a difficult question.

14
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.580
Maybe the most difficult question a person can be asked and uh,

15
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.100
asking for us as our producer Sean Cole. Well, this,

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.040
this story starts with a Dr. Guy named Joseph Gallo. Hello.

17
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.720
Can you hear me, Joe? Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah, he's a real sweetheart. Actually.

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.670
I feel like a celebrity. You're sending a sound person here. Joe's an MD,

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.533
but, um,

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.170
he's also a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and he's been

21
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.150
working on a study that I,

22
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.580
I just frankly find totally fascinating. Let me, yeah, let me,

23
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:26.700
if I rambled, just stop me. But, so here's the story.

24
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.140
A long time ago in the 1940s and early fifties,

25
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.090
Johns Hopkins launched something called the precursors study and all of these

26
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.250
graduating medical students,

27
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:43.251
1,337 students signed up between 1948 and 1964.

28
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.680
And every one of them agreed to be poked, prodded, examined, up and down.

29
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.970
You know, their blood pressure, their way asked all these questions, habits,

30
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.980
how much exercise they took. They did a Rorschach ink blot test.

31
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.900
Wow. And what was the point of this study? Well,

32
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.930
originally it was just to pinpoint the precursors to heart disease,

33
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.931
but over time the study went way beyond that and the researchers started asking

34
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.670
all sorts of other questions, questions about to oppression, anxiety,

35
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:18.150
50 years of the study and the doctors are getting older and older and support

36
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.080
retirement at a certain point. But 15 years ago,

37
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.910
Joe and the other researchers start to ask these doctors about death.

38
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.350
So if you, if you have that paper in front of you, yeah, hang on.

39
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.550
Essentially what they did was they presented the doctors,

40
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.160
many of whom are now in their sixties,

41
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.880
seventies and eighties with the following scenario. Dario was there, it says,

42
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.010
it says, and it goes something like this.

43
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.490
So say you have brain damage or some brain disease that can't be cured.

44
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.560
You can't recognize people, you can't speak understandably.

45
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.980
And um, you're in this condition for a long time. Like your brain dead.

46
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.510
Well you're not brain dead,

47
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.430
but it kind of describes maybe a scenario that's like severe dementia and then

48
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.020
it says, indicate your wishes regarding the use of each of the following medical

49
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.130
procedures. There's a list, 10 CPR, [inaudible] fluids,

50
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.020
major surgery. This is a bunch of them.

51
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.790
So the question they're asking is if like, if,

52
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.200
if I'm in this terrible situation, would I, would I want these things?

53
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.430
Would you agree to have these things done to you if it came down to it? Okay.

54
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.760
So how so what would you say as an example,

55
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.790
you're asking us now and I also put the question to a bunch of people in the

56
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:37.430
street, or my name's Sean column reported with [inaudible].

57
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.390
Give me words to like, so CPR for example. So your heart stopped CPR.

58
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.420
Would I want CPR? Yes. I want somebody to do that. Yeah, sure. Yes.

59
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.030
Well, yes. It seems like a no brainer. What about mechanical ventilation?

60
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.150
It's a breathing machine. A breathing machine.

61
00:03:53.151 --> 00:03:57.590
You're going to die if you don't get it. Well maybe then. Yes. Yeah. Okay.

62
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.240
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't say don't do it. Yeah. You remember all of them?

63
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.090
Kidney Dialysis, dialysis. Yes.

64
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.720
So a feeding tube? Yes. Yup. Major surgery.

65
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.011
I don't know.

66
00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:17.180
Like a gallbladder operation if we're just talking about the gallbladder. Sure,

67
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.320
yeah. Antibiotics. Yeah, totally. Sure, sure.

68
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.350
Ivy hydration. Yes. You would want all that? Yeah. Yes,

69
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:30.430
yes and yes. That's what most people say they want most everything. I mean,

70
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.450
maybe not some of the super invasive stuff, but generally, yes. Okay.

71
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.470
On the other hand, you asked the doctors what they want, same situation,

72
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.250
brain dead or brain injured, whatever. Do they want CPR?

73
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.870
90% say no. They would not want CPR. Really.

74
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.240
90% no. Yeah,

75
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.660
I'm I and I asked a bunch of doctors at a vascular health conference here in New

76
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.910
York, the following medical procedure, they said the same thing. A CPR,

77
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.100
no CPR, no, no CPR,

78
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.660
no CPR and almost 80% ventilation.

79
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.200
No or dialysis? Definitely not. Oh No, no.

80
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.120
80% would not want surgery. No.

81
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.050
80% will not want invasive testing. Oh No.

82
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.740
I'm almost 80% wouldn't want a feeding tube. What were blood products?

83
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.100
No antibiotics. 60% say no.

84
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.430
Ivy hydration, about 60% say no. They don't probably know.

85
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.020
And then pain medicine is the one that's a bit different.

86
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.800
The actual item on the survey reads, would you opt for pain medications?

87
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.880
Even if they dull the consciousness and indirectly shorten my life, they are.

88
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.170
80% of them say yes, yes, yes,

89
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.790
absolutely, yes. More. Thank you, Lee. Yes. Yes. Medication. Yes.

90
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.780
So pain medication is all all they want for the most part. Yeah.

91
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.290
Why would there be such a big gap between the,

92
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.980
between doctors and patients in terms of how

93
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.240
<v 2>they wanted it in their life? Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.400
<v 0>Well, hi, is that you? It's me. Great to meet you, Sean.</v>

95
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.220
How are you doing?

96
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.040
It started to become clear to me when I talked with Ken Murray,

97
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.550
he's also a doctor and you're in your doctor White's here.

98
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.960
I thought I'd impress you.

99
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.980
I met up with him at a hospital and in Los Angeles he's written a bunch of

100
00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:20.730
articles now about how doctors want to die. Exact question was asked.

101
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.490
So I asked him like, why is there this difference, you know,

102
00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:25.290
particularly with something like CPR,

103
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.940
<v 2>what is it that doctors know that we're not aware of? Well,</v>

104
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.750
we,

105
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.750
we know that CPR is basically pretty terrible as an intervention.

106
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.030
It basically doesn't work very well and um,

107
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.850
and people just don't believe that.

108
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.860
They just can't believe it and for very good. The reason why [inaudible]

109
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.650
<v 0>there was a study done in 1996 about how many people survive CPR intervention on</v>

110
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.190
er, Chicago hope rescue nine one one is 96.

111
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:04.150
Those are hot shows. Then,

112
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.080
and so the researcher watched all of these medical dramas and recorded,

113
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.620
<v 2>the result was, come on, you can do it. Come back to a stock, do it.</v>

114
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.940
Come on dude. [inaudible] book.

115
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.220
And the answer was 75% of the time people,

116
00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.830
okay, get the oxygen easy or revived easy bus.

117
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.850
It works. 75% of the time, easy breaths.

118
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.050
The actual number is more like eight,

119
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.440
8% roughly 8% survive to at least a month.

120
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.140
And, and in fact it's worse than that. Here's how that 8% breaks down.

121
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.850
Oh, when you actually break it down,

122
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:50.851
there was a fellow who did a study in 2010 he looked at 95,000 cases.

123
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.901
Uh, actually more than that.

124
00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:55.780
And I think it was all the cases in Japan that year.

125
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.380
And what he found was that all about 3% had what you would call a good outcome

126
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.530
that is returned to a meaningful quality of life.

127
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.600
You and me sitting here talking and eating sandwiches,

128
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.810
exactly about the same number,

129
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.770
3% or so ended up in a chronic vegetative state,

130
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.650
not quite brain dead, but pretty close.

131
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.210
And the final 2% or in some sort of intermediate level,

132
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.890
not good, but they weren't calm, atos, everybody else was dead.

133
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.620
That's the reality of it. And, and we physicians,

134
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.520
we know that we've actually done CPR.

135
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.470
We have actually laid hands on the chest.

136
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.220
<v 0>Here's something I didn't know. Ken says it when when you do CPR,</v>

137
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.250
you often end up cracking the person's ribs and you had that according to Ken is

138
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.160
kind of mild in terms of some of the things

139
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.720
<v 2>that doctors put patients through.</v>

140
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.830
I think a lot of times we're doing things to people that we wouldn't do to a

141
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:05.940
terrorist. Is that true or is that overstated?

142
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:10.020
I'm not kidding. Like what kinds of things? Well,

143
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.090
paralyzing somebody so that you cannot move,

144
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.260
which you generally have to do when you put a person on a ventilator,

145
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.510
a breathing machine, a respirator.

146
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:26.220
When you put somebody on one of these machines, it breathes for you.

147
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.080
But the problem is you will fight it because you'll have your own rhythm.

148
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:35.610
So what happens is you have a person that is fighting, fighting, fighting,

149
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:39.330
fighting, and, and you can't get air in. And out of them.

150
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.250
So you paralyzed them

151
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.750
<v 0>so they stopped fighting. You know, they can't move,</v>

152
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.950
but it doesn't mean they're asleep. They're not asleep.

153
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.520
They are completely helpless. Um,

154
00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.720
and yet they're aware of everything that's going on around them. Um,

155
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.660
so it sounds nightmarish actually. Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.800
Ken took me through a bunch of different situations from congestive heart

157
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:08.710
failure to lung disease and pancreatic cancer where he feels basically that the,

158
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.830
the treatment is like worse than the actual disease of what you have.

159
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.650
It may be prolonging, but not for very long.

160
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.930
And the life that you have left is misery.

161
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.730
Right, right. In fact, Ken says the colleagues of his other doctors,

162
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.900
they'll turn to me in the ICU and they say, if you find me like this, kill me.

163
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.730
And they're not kidding.

164
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.930
He says there were doctors who were medallions with the words no code stamped on

165
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:40.790
them, which just means don't resuscitate me.

166
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.550
He's even seen tattoos that say no code.

167
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.460
<v 3>Okay. Can I talk to you now? Yes.</v>

168
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.250
Do you have any idea? Come on. Turn that off. Hey John,

169
00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:55.640
can I just record for one second? Yeah.

170
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.650
Because while you were reporting this piece,

171
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.720
a very strange coincidence happened to me.

172
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:04.721
I was visiting my dad and a after dinner one night he sits me down and he says,

173
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.090
I have something important I want to tell you. Yes,

174
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.650
I've signed an advanced directive. Basically means if I end up in the hospital,

175
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.630
a terminally ill or something, I don't want a lot of medical stuff done to me.

176
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.550
I had not told him about your story at all. Really? Yeah.

177
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.650
So it was just out of the blue and he shows you a piece of paper or no,

178
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:27.380
not then, but I uh,

179
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.770
just saw him a couple of days ago and asked him to read it to me because I

180
00:11:30.771 --> 00:11:33.110
hadn't actually seen it yet. What is, what does it say?

181
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.050
<v 4>Yes,</v>

182
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:39.050
I did directed medical care be withheld or withdrawn and that I be permitted to

183
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:42.900
die naturally with only the administration of medications. Right.

184
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.600
I can just give a little bit that paragraph.

185
00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:48.680
I authorize the withholding of artificially provided food,

186
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.740
intravenous fluids and other nourishments.

187
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.680
If I cannot give directions regarding my medical care and tend to my family and

188
00:11:55.681 --> 00:12:00.490
physicians honor this declaration as the final expression of my legal right to

189
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:05.050
refuse medical care and I accept the consequences of that refusal. Yeah. Huh.

190
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.620
Okay. So pain medication is all you really want? Yeah.

191
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.330
To keep me comfortable. So th, uh,

192
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.520
was the same as like the baby's crying. So you, it sounds like,

193
00:12:16.521 --> 00:12:19.820
why wouldn't you want, um, artificially provided food,

194
00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:23.940
intravenous fluids or other nourishment? That's my choice. I know,

195
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.500
but that doesn't sound like it's that much of, um, intervention really.

196
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:30.830
It is an intervention to sustain life on necessarily.

197
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:35.180
If I should ever have a terminal condition,

198
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:40.750
would you want CPR done? If I have a choice to answer, there's no hmm.

199
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.630
But wouldn't you want Monterey to be in a position where we can make the

200
00:12:44.631 --> 00:12:47.060
decision? I mean, uh,

201
00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.630
what if you conflict like that?

202
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.600
<v 3>She, she feels one way. I feel another, yeah, he told me,</v>

203
00:12:53.601 --> 00:12:56.540
this is one of the worries that doctors have, uh, that you know,

204
00:12:56.541 --> 00:12:59.600
they'll have talked to the patient or the patient's family explained the

205
00:12:59.601 --> 00:13:03.560
situation carefully and everyone's agreed, no more interventions. But then,

206
00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.970
uh, a random family member will just show up, you know, like a cousin or a,

207
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:12.980
an a strange son or daughter maybe carrying a lot of guilt and they're like, no,

208
00:13:12.981 --> 00:13:15.340
doc, you have to do whatever it takes. Right?

209
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.430
<v 4>At the end of the day,</v>

210
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.220
I give the option to the patient and to the family to make a decision.

211
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.950
That's what I have to do.

212
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.570
Except in this case and the patient is him with a t v by having this means we

213
00:13:29.571 --> 00:13:32.420
have to honor this, right? We can't, we can't have our own feelings about it.

214
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.180
You're going to have your own feelings, but you still have to honor this.

215
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.010
But it is the thing that gives me pause is that, I mean, you're a,

216
00:13:40.011 --> 00:13:40.791
you're a doctor.

217
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:45.791
Your job is to prolong life and to sustain life and you choose not to when it

218
00:13:47.121 --> 00:13:50.990
comes to your own life. Nobody has said, my job is to sustain life.

219
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.020
My job is to sustain life. One, it is possible.

220
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.800
It is not sustained life run its few time and if you're going to sustain my life

221
00:14:02.001 --> 00:14:05.660
on a respirator, I don't want it. That kind of life.

222
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.363
I do not want

223
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.010
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

224
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:10.843
<v 3>more than anything.</v>

225
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:14.960
That thing he wanted to make sure of is that he does not die in a hospital.

226
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:21.060
He definitely does not want to die at the place where he works. That's,

227
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.300
that's something that came up a few times among the doctors at the conference

228
00:14:24.301 --> 00:14:24.840
that I went,

229
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.660
<v 6>no, I think I don't want to die in a hospital bed.</v>

230
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.410
This is Tim Ryan, a resident at Cleveland Clinic. Why not? A?

231
00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.160
Because I see patients and patients' families, uh,

232
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:42.790
suffer tremendously and I think we do a poor job of communicating futility

233
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.793
today.

234
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.900
I don't know how to communicate that effectively.

235
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.330
I don't know how to do it better.

236
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.110
It's a difficult thing to bring up to the family. You know, how,

237
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.890
how do you tell them your grandfather is not going to get better?

238
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.160
We can keep them alive for a few weeks or a few months,

239
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.480
but he's probably gonna have a tracheostomy and a feeding tube,

240
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:13.930
a catheter in his bladder and then he'll get bed sores and slowly deteriorate.

241
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.660
I think we can focus on, you know,

242
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.030
extending a life that has some quality so they can interact with their family.

243
00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:25.430
But you know, once, once that's gone,

244
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:30.200
I don't know that we do much benefit. Sounded Great. That was perfect.

245
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.110
Why didn't say that? Um, I dunno.

246
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.730
You have to have a sense that people want to hear that no one would want to hear

247
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.860
that. I, they would want [inaudible] but it's a little bit presumptuous.

248
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.090
<v 3>You know, you, I mean you can't tell someone not to hope.</v>

249
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:51.690
You can't pressure them to just let go of their loved one and obviously you

250
00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:55.270
can't refuse to provide care.

251
00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.360
Do you know the, um, there is one thing that struck me that talking to my dad,

252
00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:04.710
there's a question that patients will sometimes ask that can be a kind of bridge

253
00:16:04.711 --> 00:16:07.560
between doctors and patients. Um, very often he says,

254
00:16:07.561 --> 00:16:09.900
when people are in the middle of this decision spending,

255
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.190
they'll turn to him and they'll say, doc,

256
00:16:11.191 --> 00:16:15.270
what would you do if this was your mother or father, you know? And he says,

257
00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:16.890
when they ask the question that way,

258
00:16:16.891 --> 00:16:19.350
it creates an entirely different conversation. He can say,

259
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.890
here's what I would honestly do. Or in fact, and I did not know this, do this.

260
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.420
<v 2>Here's what I actually did.</v>

261
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:30.630
It happened with my parents when my father fell ill and developed complications

262
00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:33.370
as a result of the fall.

263
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.000
He says he called the doctor and told him no more medical interventions and he

264
00:16:37.001 --> 00:16:40.420
ended up dying comfortably. Same thing happened with my mother.

265
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.250
I had discussed it with my mother and my father when they were not sick.

266
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:46.900
This was a plan.

267
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.210
I can tell you in 9% of the patients that I see,

268
00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.250
such planning doesn't happen.

269
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.170
I had a habit for most of my career when I'd have a new patient come in,

270
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.890
particularly over the age of 50, I'd ask them, hey, how do you want to die?

271
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.370
And this is Ken Murray again. You know, a lot of, a lot of them, you know,

272
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.630
you give me kind of a funny look,

273
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.430
that's an odd question for a doctor to be asking me. I said, what? You know,

274
00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:13.810
it's the one thing I'm,

275
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.500
we can be sure of that it's going to happen eventually and a,

276
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:22.480
I want to make sure it happens the way you want. And um, and so people,

277
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.710
you know, the typical answer is wad like to die in my sleep. You know,

278
00:17:26.711 --> 00:17:27.544
painlessly

279
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.660
<v 6>the fastest way was out any pain, peaceful without pain and was friends,</v>

280
00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.350
<v 2>which is how most people answer the question.</v>

281
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.440
Doctors and non doctor with the least amount of pain and not drag it on swiftly

282
00:17:39.661 --> 00:17:43.380
and painlessly. But what is that mean? What,

283
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.360
what actually is that? That's usually, um,

284
00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.740
a attack

285
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.450
<v 0>or stroke, something of that nature that happens just like that.</v>

286
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.363
And you're gone.

287
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.780
And that's what we and our doctors are essentially doing everything in our power

288
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:09.450
to avoid. So like when you ask people in the abstract,

289
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:13.170
they're saying, how do I want to die peacefully? I want to die peacefully.

290
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:14.760
I wanna die in my sleep and everything like that.

291
00:18:14.761 --> 00:18:17.310
But when you ask them the specifics,

292
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.840
you hear no pound on my chest, stick a tube down my throat.

293
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.750
So it's this paradox of sounds. Do you like a paradox? But think about it,

294
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.050
right?

295
00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.230
<v 2>It is. It could be if it's so,</v>

296
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.300
so healthy to do both. Even at the same time,

297
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:38.301
it's healthy to want to stay and it's healthy to,

298
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.650
to know how to be ready to go.

299
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:46.010
I was listening to a fresh air sort of retake and they had Maurice Sendak on the

300
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:50.550
air who died not too long ago before he died. He was on fresh air.

301
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.100
It's an amazing interview. Yeah.

302
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.920
And Terry Gross was talking to him and he's sitting there in his Connecticut

303
00:18:55.921 --> 00:19:00.620
House looking out the window at a tree and he says, ah, to Terry. I,

304
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.540
I am so in love with the tree.

305
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:10.370
And the beauty of it and my chance to keep it company just a little while longer

306
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:15.910
and I want to stay and every extra day I get is a day that's precious to me and

307
00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:19.250
makes me want to stay even harder. Buddy says to Terry,

308
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.200
I am ready to go when it's time I've made myself ready.

309
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.453
And that,

310
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:31.180
that compromise you make with yourself to love it with your whole soul and yet

311
00:19:31.791 --> 00:19:32.690
at the same time say,

312
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.720
I'll know when it's over and I'm composed enough and prepared enough to take my

313
00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:41.450
exit. That's, that's what a good death is.

314
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.250
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

315
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:58.220
<v 0>uh, thank you Sean. Cool. You're welcome. This is Sean calls. I mean,</v>

316
00:19:58.221 --> 00:19:59.260
it's not his last appearance yet,

317
00:19:59.261 --> 00:20:01.730
but this is the last time he's on our full paycheck. Yeah.

318
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.340
Going off to host many things and be recorded in other places. Yes.

319
00:20:05.341 --> 00:20:09.440
It is a kind of death. Really. Yes. Nothing good that though.

320
00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:12.380
It means Sean that you get that you come back here regular. Well,

321
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:13.310
I will haunt you all.

322
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.600
You better special thanks to everybody at the UV symposium on vascular health

323
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.830

324
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.190
