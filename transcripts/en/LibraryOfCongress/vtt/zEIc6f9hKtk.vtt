00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.060
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Stillo: So welcome
everyone to our Thursdays

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.720
at Three talk here
in Rare Books.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.230
We are very delighted to
have you here this afternoon.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.680
Today, we have Alexander Knirim.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.420
We're still working on his last,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.550
I am still working
on his last name.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.050
He's a doctoral student
at the Department

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.080
for Early Modern History at the
University of Beirut in Germany.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.420
He currently occupies the
position of Bavarian Fellow

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.920
at the Kluge Center
here at the Library,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.560
and I have to say he has
been truly a delight to work

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.120
with over the last couple month.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.530
So you are in for a treat.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.500
Alexander's work focuses
largely on Atlantic history

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.490
in the 19th Century,
particularly German communities

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.950
in British North America
in the early United States,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.730
and thinking about the way

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.380
that print media impacts those
communities, and his project

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.750
for Kluge is entitled
German Imprints

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.410
in British North America
in the 18th Century

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.110
and the Construction of a
German-Speaking Community.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.720
What I find so exciting
about Alexander's work is

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.310
that it offers us, I think, a
new vantage from which to look

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.380
at really familiar
material, right.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.580
We think we know about almanacs,
right, and Alexander is here

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.440
to teach us more about things
that we feel familiar with.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.800
Shamefully, I have never really
stopped to think about the role

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.510
of German almanacs in
colonial America, shamefully.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.450
So when he told me
about his research,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.860
I was tremendous excited
about the possibility,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.630
for him certainly and what
he can uncover, but again,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.740
selfishly, what we can learn
about our own collections,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.010
thinking about them
in this new way.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.910
So we're very pleased to be
able to give Alexander a place

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.670
to discuss his ongoing
projects and to get feedback

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.710
from such a wonderful and
knowledgeable audience

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.720
that we have here for
the Thursdays at Three.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.110
So just very quickly
a few organizational

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.830
and procedural points.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.280
I realize that most of you
are veterans of our Thursdays

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.250
at Three talks, but
for those of you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.620
that are new, just
a couple things.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.100
Alexander will speak
for about 40 minutes,

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.600
and after which we
will take questions.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.670
I realize that we are
all tremendously eager

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.170
about the 18th Century,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.510
but if we could please keep
the questions until the end,

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.870
that would be terrific.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.670
It'll keep us on schedule.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.930
We do have several items that
are out for display that have

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.530
to do with Alexander's research.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.660
Again, as I say, we are
excited that you are excited,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.850
but let us handle the material.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.640
We will turn pages for you, and
we will share as much as we can.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.510
With that, please help
me welcome Alexander.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.050
[ Applause ]

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.350
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: Stephanie,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.000
thank you so much
for those kind words.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.490
I try to keep up to them.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.200
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.160
I'm very glad to be
here at the Rare Books

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.410
and Special Collection
Division of the Library

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.700
of Congress today presenting
to you a talk title,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.240
Before you Read, You Should
Look, Front Cover Images

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.660
of German Almanacs
in Early America.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.850
What I'm going to do in the
next 45 minutes is to present

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.890
and compare front cover images

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.140
of German language almanacs
printed before the end

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.650
of the Revolutionary War.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.580
Before I start, I want
to thank Michael North,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.270
who suggested the talk in the
first place, and Eric Fraser,

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.480
who was extremely helpful
with any questions I had

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.080
in the course of my research.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.310
I also want to thank all the
staff of the Rare Book Division

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.520
who were so supportive, and
if I would thank everyone

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.930
in the way they deserve, we
would celebrate Christmas

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.920
in here, so I skip
that a little.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.250
For everyone who never
has done research

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.070
in the Rare Book Division, I
just want to encourage you to go

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.370
and use the wonderful
materials they can offer you.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.710
I also want to thank
the John W. Kluge Center

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.510
and the Bavarian American
Academy in Munich, Germany,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.070
which offered me the opportunity
to come to Washington.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.900
Here, your eyes see for the
first time an almanac usable

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.600
for this part of the
world but produced

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.450
after the German have it,
which I hope in this county,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.640
which is so far away from
our homeland it's going

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.050
to be not unpleasant.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.540
Those are the words which
whom the first German language

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.410
almanac announced
it's appearance

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.940
in the British colonies
in North America

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.350
until the title [foreign
language],

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.930
what can be translated as the
German [inaudible] carrying

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.120
with it the moral calendar .

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.180
This was in 1731, and at the
end of the Revolutionary War,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.880
over 50 years later,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.790
German language almanacs
had become well established

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.540
calendars in the then freshly
forged United States of America.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.920
The path from a British to
the [inaudible] was rocky

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.370
and especially in
the time around

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.100
and after the war a
controversial one.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.050
But, nevertheless, almanacs
survived and played as well

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.890
in the 19th Century a key
roll in American history,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.640
and they have done
so until today.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.840
But while many of you know
Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.190
Almanac, most of you
are probably not aware

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.020
of German language almanacs

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.000
and their publication
history in North America.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.980
What defines a German
almanac in the 18th Century?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.400
What made it German
rather than British

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.600
or British North American.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.680
First of all, they were
published in German.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.730
The other important thing is
that they followed the design

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.060
of almanacs produced in the
German-speaking territories

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.780
in Europe so that German
settlers could easily handle the

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.320
almanacs calculated for the
new lands they were going

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.620
to live on.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.490
It is also worth mentioning that
all German almanacs were printed

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.640
in Fraktur, a typical type,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.090
a typical German
type for this time.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.220
English settlers in many
cases were using Ithaca.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.840
Benjamin Franklin, who printed
in German as well as in English,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.420
obtained some German
meaning Fraktur types

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.350
to print German books and
pamphlets in the style

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.510
that Germans were used to.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.620
And even then, it was hard
for him and his associates

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.380
to compete with printers
like [inaudible],

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.730
which were the most
serious competitors

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.780
to Franklin's press
regarding German settlers.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.720
About nine German
almanacs were produced

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.950
in North America before the
end of the Revolutionary War.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.670
Of course, they didn't
appear all at once

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.580
and while some were printed
annually for decades,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:35.890
others were only
published for a short time.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.580
Finding those almanacs
today is not always easy.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.770
Almanacs could be produced
at relatively low cost

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.800
and were often thrown away after
the year they were printed for.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.630
And for some almanac
series, it is impossible

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.380
to reconstruct the
whole circulation.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.450
Another problem is
that sometimes the name

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.910
of an almanac changes
slightly although layout

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.480
and printer say the same.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.220
What appears to be a new almanac
is sometimes an older one

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.640
with a slightly different name.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.950
Let me give you an example.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:15.610
One almanac in 1778 is
named [foreign language],

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.050
brand-new North American
calendar, and two years later,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.880
the name is [foreign language],
so brand-new, improved

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:29.890
and reliable North
American calendar.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.570
The changes are not
large, I have to admit,

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.660
but in the Library
catalogue, you are not able

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.280
to find the almanac
without the proper name,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.270
and cataloguers often have not
recognized that these almanacs

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.580
with different titles are
part of the same series.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.980
Almanacs were widespread and
produced in large numbers,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.490
and together with
nongovernmental texts,

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.950
they were commonly among the
first publications of printers.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.980
Over the last 20 years,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.360
researchers have
analyzed almanacs

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.530
from various perspective,
discussing the shift

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.440
of language, grammar,
and the different topics,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.190
which were discussed
in those almanacs.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.300
Today, I am going to pursue a
different angle, the development

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.000
of the front covers of German
almanacs in the 18th Century.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.910
What we have here on this
slide, is the first cover

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.290
of the [foreign language].

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.050
As you can see short
titles were [inaudible].

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:34.770
So 1778, and what we see
here is a typical title page

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:41.550
of an almanac, which commonly
appears as the third page,

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:48.110
if we count the front
cover as page one,

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.200
giving us the full
title, the year,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.400
how many days this year has.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.240
So if it is a common year, 364
days, or a leap year with 366.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.530
We can also find the
number of the issue,

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.720
the table of contents,
the place it was produced,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.040
who produced it,
and in many cases,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.780
there's also an indication

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.230
of where you can find it other
parts of British North America.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.770
Obviously, a lot of those
details are missing here

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.840
in this example, and
the explanation is

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.190
that this is not the title
page but the front cover.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.860
On this cover page, the printer,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.880
Matthew Barctus [phonetic]
apologizes to the reader

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.300
and promised to offer a proper
front cover in the next issue.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.550
The excuse he gives
to you, the reader,

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.580
is that the engraver was not
able to finish the cover page

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.220
in time, so he only could
publish it in a plain font.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.230
What Barctus mentioned here
explicitly copper engraving,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.100
we should be aware that in
the British colonies different

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.540
styles of engravings were used.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.470
Copper engravings, which
were produced for instance

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.390
by Matthew Clarkson on Second
Street in Philadelphia,

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.900
they are very rare
at the period.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.590
Far more common were
woodcuts, a technique,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.970
which was broadly used
in the United States

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.080
after the 20th Century.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.740
This almanac, which is dated
1718, is the earliest issue

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.030
with the proper front cover,
which can be found here

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.940
in the Rare Books Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.400
Matthew Barctus obviously
got his engraving,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.390
and really it is
an interesting one.

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.670
What we can see here
is the following.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.390
A man, having only one healthy
leg and the other one replaced

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.030
by a wooden stick is
delivering a sealed paper

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.420
to two people while
leaning on a spear.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.830
On it's back, he has a bag.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.990
The person, who seems
to receive the letter,

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.880
appears to be a man dressed
like aristocrat of the time,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.550
wearing a wig and holding
a stick in his left hand.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.360
In the front, we
can see a snail.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.950
The other person is a woman,
maybe also wearing a wig

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.370
and a long robe, which
is falling on the ground.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.420
And if you think that this
person is not like a woman

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.030
to me, let me show you
this almanac printed

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.060
in German in 1816.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.490
As you can see, the
persons look very similar

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.550
to the ones we have seen
before in the one from Barctus,

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.820
and even though we have more
people receiving the letter

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.520
in this example from 1816,
here we can easily determine

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.480
that person we can see on
the front cover is a woman.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.270
But, let us go back
to the one from 1718.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.950
The title of this almanac is
written on the front cover

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.250
as [foreign language].

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:59.110
And above the delivery man,
you can read [foreign language]

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:04.750
which can roughly be translated
as the lame messenger.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:09.300
The [foreign language] was one
of the most successful almanac

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.570
in the region between
modern Switzerland,

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.800
southern Germany, and France.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.520
The first one was established
in 1677, and afterwards,

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.040
many other almanacs were
produced under the same name,

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.810
and the tradition
goes on until today.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.990
With that in mind, the
image Barctus has chosen

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.720
for his almanac has to be
considered as a common topic

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.900
for many German settlers
arriving in North America.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.330
[Inaudible] as many
German settlers

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.440
in the 18th Century came
from southwestern German

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.410
where this kind of
almanac was popular.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:52.130
Even though there's an ongoing
discussion about the use

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.140
and the development of
almanacs like [foreign language]

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.440
in France, Germany,
and Switzerland,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.020
the impact of the front covers
of German almanacs produced

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.020
in early America have not
been discussed in detail aside

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.790
from some remarks by
[foreign language]

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.090
and [foreign language].

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.740
And, as the front
cover image combined

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.380
with the title is
quite a popular one,

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.370
I'm going to show you that even

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.870
without the title we can find
images that have recourse

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.170
to the [foreign language].

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:33.470
In 1739, Kristof Saur started
his almanac called the [foreign

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.720
language] without
the front page.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.840
And this is not a good example.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.000
I used this one from 1747.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.470
And the front cover
itself was added

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.920
to the almanac five
years earlier in 1742,

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.440
so before that in the first
three years there is simply no

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.780
front cover.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.710
It became one of the most
successful German almanacs

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.530
in the 18th Century in
British North America.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:06.790
Saur Sr. and his son, Saur
Jr., are both crucial figures

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.890
when we talk about German
printers at that time.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.110
Not just because the
almanacs were one

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.510
of the most successful German
printings in the colonies

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.050
with a circulation up
to 10,000 per year,

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.670
but also because
of the influence

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.950
on the German settlers living
not only in German-where

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.670
but elsewhere in
Pennsylvania and beyond.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.710
As we mentioned earlier,
first the father

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.190
and then his son had a long-time
rivalry with Benjamin Franklin

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.140
and some of his fellow
printers in Philadelphia,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.820
partly because Franklin
accused Saur

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.830
of not wanting German
settlers to assimilate

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.820
into British American society.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.970
You have to be aware that in the
second half of the 18th Century,

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.670
about 50 percent

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.600
of the Pennsylvania
population was German

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.960
or at least trace their origin
back to German ancestors.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.600
By way of comparison, in
the U.S. Census of 2000,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:12.010
about 15 percent of all
Americans had German ancestors.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:17.650
And as we have introduced the
two printers, Saur Sr. and Jr.,

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.580
already, we're now
going to take a look

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:25.400
on the almanac [foreign
language] calendar.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.710
What we can see on this slide
is one of the first issues

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.970
of the [foreign language]
calendar,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.420
and what we can observe
at the first glance is

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:40.780
that we have much more going
on here than we have seen

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.990
on the two almanacs before.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.240
We can divide this almanac
roughly into three sections.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.870
One, is the scene in the front
of the almanac, the depiction

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.620
of the city and finally
the section showing us

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.200
in the heaven.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.150
What we see in the front is a
scene where two people meet.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.470
One of them seems to
be arriving by ship

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.270
and was just brought
ashore in a small boat,

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.670
which is now tied to a pier.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:15.360
He is handing over a
letter to the other person,

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.530
who is very difficult
to identify.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:24.030
He or she, that is not clear,
is wearing a long robe, a hat,

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.440
which is not so familiar,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.980
as for instance the
tricorn the other man wears,

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.600
and in the left hand, she
or he is holding a stick,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.930
receiving the letter with
his or her right hand.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.940
While the letter is passed over,

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.780
the man who is delivering
it points with his left arm

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.090
in the direction
of the countryside.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:50.210
In the front, we
can also see a dog.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:54.130
What is the lands
the man is pointing?

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:57.160
The answer to this
question is giving us

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.930
from the city in the background.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.920
The city we see is Philadelphia,

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.300
and it is particularly
interesting to observe

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:10.640
that the development of the
city was shown to us by Saur.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:16.370
First, the senior, since 1758
his son going by the same name,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.570
taking the development of
the city into consideration,

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.360
adding new churches
and buildings

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.970
in the 1760's and 1770's.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.860
But I will come back to
that in a few minutes.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.210
Let us finish the general
depiction with a look

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.800
at the upper part
of the front cover.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.260
Occupy nearly half of
the available space,

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.700
what we see is a cloudy sky

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.520
and to Hermes holding
a [foreign language].

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:49.040
It looks like Hermes is walking
on a rainbow and has more wings

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.480
on his feet, hand, and hat.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.610
His hands, in his hands,
he is holding a banner

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:56.590
that is flying over his hat.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.040
The banner shows us after
1760 different messengers

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.000
in different issues
of the almanac.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.750
On the right side, we
see the sun shining,

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.130
and on the left side, we see
clouds, and in later examples,

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.240
we find they are the moon
and the stars shining.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.930
Let us know analyze this
type of page step by step,

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.250
starting with the front area.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.800
When we look at the different
topics presented to us

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.550
by the printer, it
seems to remind us

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.230
of the front cover
we've seen before.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.410
The handing over of the
letter, the [inaudible]

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.910
and partly even the clothes

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.620
of the people involved
looking a lot like some

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.840
of the elements we saw in
the [foreign language],

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.390
but we are missing
one important,

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.490
very important feature,
the wooden leg.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.610
So what do we have here?

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.930
How can we explain what the
printer is presenting to us?

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.430
Is there a connection to
other German almanacs?

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.510
We can assume that
Saur Sr., who was born

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:07.450
in German near Heidelberg
was familiar with the concept

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.950
of the [foreign language]
or the [foreign language].

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.520
At least this type of almanac
was widespread in the region

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.350
in the 17th and 18th Century.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.790
Using a familiar image
to sell a German almanac

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.880
to German settlers in
the British colonies

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.540
in North America was
a smart thing to do.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.230
Many of the early settlers
came from the western

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.040
and southern regions of the
German-speaking territories

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.000
in Europe, and for that reason,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.970
we're probably familiar
with the concept.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.860
The image of the [foreign
language] became popular

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.610
after the 30 Years War in
the 1600's when many wounded

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.920
or maimed soldiers
were used as messenger.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.030
Although they were far
slower than the messengers

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:53.130
on horseback, they were at the
same time considered as carriers

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:57.410
of true messages that
everyone could rely on.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:01.280
So, using a familiar
image for the illustration

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.440
of an almanac is smart.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.520
People could recognize
the affiliation

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.270
and would probably
feel attracted by it.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.470
If there were a wooden
leg in the image,

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.980
the explanation would be easy.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.170
Sadly enough we don't have it.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.150
For that reason, a direct
connection between the ink

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.060
and the border in Saur's
almanac seems unlikely,

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.260
but aside from the
question of the wooden leg,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.590
the layout strikes as familiar.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.770
Could there be a connection
to the ink in the border

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.210
without him being present?

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.730
It must be admitted that the ink

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:39.120
in the border was not really
relevant to the delivery of news

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.740
in the British colonies where
most news arrived by ship.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.300
The whole narrative
of a wooden leg seems

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.340
to be redundant regarding the
fact that it makes no difference

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.890
when you are using a ship if
you have a healthy, wooden,

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.120
or even no leg at all.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.680
Another explanation could be the
hope for peace in the colonies.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.110
When Saur started his
almanac in the 1730's,

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.090
there was still an ongoing
discussion about the defense

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.530
of the colonies in which
Saur and many Germans

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.020
around him stood
close to the Quakers

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.900
and their pacifist approach.

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.890
As far as we know,
Saur was clever enough

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.650
to use a familiar concept

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.070
without explicitly
showing the part

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:29.450
which would contradict his
idea of a peaceful society.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:33.660
In the end, we cannot be certain
whether Saur really used the

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.760
concept of the ink and the
border to better his chances

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.660
of selling the almanac.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.480
The very idea of a messenger
delivering news is omnipresent

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.210
in the context of the front
cover, but if it was connected

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.380
to the ink in the border
or an enhancement of it,

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.060
is a question probably
were never going to answer.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.050
Let us know take a
closer look to the city.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.190
As mentioned before, the front
cover shows us the skyline

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.490
of Philadelphia.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:08.920
But what is really interesting
apart from the simple view is

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.980
that Saur's adjusted
the skyline over time.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.990
After the first almanac was
produced Saur Sr. states

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.100
with the first layout
until his death in 1758.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.200
His son then started
to make small changes.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:30.640
First, in 1760, so he added
some buildings to the city,

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:37.050
highlighted here, and in 1770,
he redesigned some buildings,

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:41.030
so changed the shape
of the steeples.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.530
But let us focus on
the city itself first.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.900
Up to 1760, the front
cover looked

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.980
like we have seen it before.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.250
The city was now shown
in a detailed way.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:59.380
We can see two towers or
steeples and two paths leading

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.480
to the point where we,
the observer, stand.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.440
At the time when this
front cover was used,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.870
there simply were not
many buildings to display.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.110
Only a few had been built when
the front cover first appeared

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.850
at the beginning of 1742.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.320
At that time, [inaudible]
produced from a woodcut

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.930
which was most likely
made by Saur himself.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.450
The steeple tower on the left
is probably the state house,

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.510
which later, after
the declaration

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.020
of independence [inaudible]
was called independence hall.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:38.450
The structure started in 1732
and was finished in 1741,

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.320
so very close to the publication
of the first front cover.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.070
Even though the famous bell was
not added before the 1750's.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.920
The staple on the right side
is most likely the first

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.890
Presbyterian Church
in Philadelphia.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.140
We don't have any other
map of the 1740's,

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.630
which can prove my
hypothesis, but in comparison

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.930
to the front cover as it
appears in the 1760's,

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.370
the towers are still displayed.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:11.670
So they are taken with
into the new design.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:15.470
This offers us the opportunity
to compare the front cover

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.880
with this map, which
was drawn 10 years

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:24.230
after the first almanac was
published in the 1750's.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.590
We can assume that Saur stayed

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.600
with the two buildings
he included

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.690
in the issue before the
1760's, and when we look

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.840
on the map produced by
George Heeb [phonetic]

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:41.610
and Nicholas Scull, here in a
reproduction from the 1900's,

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.480
which shows not just the
skyline of Philadelphia

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.410
but also explains what churches

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.980
and important buildings
we can see.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.340
We are able to determine which
steeples are shown to us by Saur

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.850
in both almanacs,

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.980
and considering the time the
buildings were constructed

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.600
and their appearance
in the city,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.520
we can identify the State House

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.880
and the First Presbyterian
Church

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.700
as the two prominent buildings
on the front cover up to 1759.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.410
One of the other
steeples appearing

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:21.330
after 1760 can easily be
recognized as Christ Church,

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:25.140
since we know that this was the
tallest building in Philadelphia

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.050
and in fact in North
America at the time.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.050
That leaves one tower
or steeple unidentified.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.870
Though we can be quite confident

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.860
about the ones we have
identified so far,

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.720
the fourth one is much more
difficult, and we are not able

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.050
to state whether it
is the court house

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.310
or the Quaker meeting house.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:52.250
But we have to admit that Saur's
front cover lacks the accuracy

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.310
for us to be sure which steeple
belonged to which church.

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.700
We can narrow it down and
build a coherent argument,

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.520
but as Saur never stated himself
what he intended to show us,

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.110
we have to be very careful
regarding appearances

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.110
of the city.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:16.150
If we now look at the front
cover as it appears after 1770,

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.770
we can see that the number
of towers is still the same,

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.490
but the design has changed,

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:24.730
and there is no path leading
any longer to the two people,

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.730
which we can spot in the front.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.600
But we see that the harbor has
grown, and we have more docks

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.160
between the meeting
point and the city.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.380
The last front cover was
probably not produced any longer

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:43.070
by Saur Jr. himself but by
Justice Fox, who was apprentice

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.260
and worker in the Saur
Press and besides his skill

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.370
in producing woodcuts, he was
also the one producing the ink

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.580
for the Saur Press, ink
which was still famous

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:57.840
at the beginning of
the 19th Century.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.000
Now we take a look on the
top of the front cover.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.460
As pointed out before, it
changes over the time slightly,

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:12.150
and the banner, 1760,
and the night sky, 1770,

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.140
were included up to 1770.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:20.380
But most importantly we have
Hermes, and not an angle

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:24.010
as Everan H. Castle [phonetic]
has described it in one

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:28.920
of the first analyzers
of this almanac in 1882.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.080
Hermes as a symbol can be
found quite often in almanacs

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.280
in British North America.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:39.310
Safe travels through the
countryside and most importantly

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:43.060
over the ocean were crucial
to the life of the people

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.800
and the Hermes is the symbol
for traveling and for trade,

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.440
so it was an important
reference.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.740
We have to be aware

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:55.620
that although one hand
reached the colony safely,

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.750
it didn't necessarily mean

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.770
that one would never
cross the Atlantic again

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.420
or that one wouldn't need people

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.480
to cross it [inaudible]
directly or indirectly.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.740
For printers and for any other
settlers, trades were crucial

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.000
because almost everyone
in the colonies relied

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.060
on goods coming across
the Atlantic.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.650
Saur himself relied on
special paper from Europe

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.830
because he tried to
establish a colored almanac,

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.400
which required different
kind of paper

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.930
that was not produced
in the colonies.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.000
Also, regarding news,
all the settlers,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.320
not only in Pennsylvania,
relied on the ocean.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.430
Almost all the information
coming

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.990
into the colonies was
brought in by ship,

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.770
even to some extent
news from Boston

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.440
or New York were
shipped to Philadelphia.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.600
News often travelled
faster via ship.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.850
And as well, these ships coming

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.550
from the West Indies brought
news and goods, which were sold

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.580
in British North America.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.380
In Henry Miller's
newspaper, the [inaudible],

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:08.430
approximately 40 percent of
the newspaper was reserved

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.960
for advertisements of all
kinds, and many of the goods,

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.350
like sugar or rum
that were imported

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.190
from the Caribbean Isles.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.160
Safe travels were a thing
everyone should wish for,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.350
and settlers in the British
colonies were particularly

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.770
relying on that.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.980
What is missing from the
cover at least with respect

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.510
to other almanacs is a zodiac.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:35.520
The zodiac can be found
on many other almanacs,

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.030
and we cannot determine
why Saur excluded it.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:42.140
One explanation could
be his religious belief,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.470
but we lack any information
in this regard.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.350
But as we missed the
zodiac, we have a rainbow

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.610
that the Hermes seems
to walk on.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:56.400
The banner we can find since
1760 do not change from issue

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.660
to issue but were
changed according

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.510
to events happening
in that time.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.540
It starts with [foreign
language],

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.870
wars and rumors of wars.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:14.600
In 1765, it reads [foreign
language] and in 1767

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.870
with the end of the
struggles after the French

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.640
and the Indian War, the motto
said [foreign language] hopes

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.860
and better times.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.660
As already pointed out,

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.930
afterward Saur changed motto
back and forth in accordance

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.970
with the political situation.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.420
Now that we have talked about
the [foreign language] almanac,

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.370
we will take a look on
the [foreign language]

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:44.000
from Enrique Miller
or Henry Miller.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.130
A printer originally
from Switzerland

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.780
who crossed the Atlantic
several times and lived as well

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.170
in London for a couple of years.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:58.770
The first example was
published in the year 1763

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.920
in Philadelphia, then still

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.220
under the name [foreign
language].

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:11.740
The front cover appears for the
first time in 1767 at least here

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:13.600
in the Rare Books
Division of the Library

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.900
of Congress and is on display.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.760
Miller was one of the
first important printers

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.060
in Philadelphia.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.060
He published in both
English and in German

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:27.630
and offered translation
into French and Dutch.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:31.260
The front cover from this
almanac reminds us partly

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:33.460
of the front cover of
the [foreign language]

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:37.300
but from a different
perspective.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:42.240
While Saur with whom Miller
was not particular friends

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.710
and in fact Miller brought
forward public accusation

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.750
against Saur, calling him
pedantic and boastful,

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:55.070
while Saur shows a view
from north of Philadelphia,

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.720
Miller shows us the
one from the other side

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.670
of the Delaware River.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:03.980
Although the view seems not
to be 100 percent accurate,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.850
on the front part of
the cover, we can see,

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.060
we look very closely,
a pier of a ferry.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:14.700
It's hard to see, which appears
to be one of the two ferries,

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.560
I have a closeup here, still
then it's very difficult

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.970
to realize, which
appears to be one

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.950
of the two ferries
crossing the Delaware River

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.310
from New Jersey to Philadelphia.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:32.640
We can see both of those fairies
in this map from Nicholas Scull,

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.000
one of the most cartographers
for Philadelphia

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.240
and the entire region
up to the 1760's.

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.530
Though the map was published
in 1762, the very year

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.620
when the almanac was
produced for the first time,

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:52.890
Scull died in 1761, one year
before the map was published.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:58.070
It is probably Daniel Cooper's
ferry, which you can see here.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.610
When we compare the
perspective from the map

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:04.330
and the front cover, it
seems to be about right,

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.340
but the really important
reference

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.590
for this front cover image
is another map by George Heeb

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.140
and Nicholas Scull
from the 1750's,

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.950
which we have seen
before, an eastern prospect

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.530
of the city of Philadelphia.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:21.760
If we compare the front cover,

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.790
we realize that Miller took
almanac everything from the map

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.850
of Heeb and Scull,
and since we know

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:34.070
that Miller advertised the
shop of the editor of this map,

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.160
Matthew Clarkson, we can
conclude that Miller was aware

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.610
of this map and for that
he used it as inspiration

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:45.800
or maybe even [inaudible]
produced by Clarkson.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.550
Although we have to remember
that the map with the skyline

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:54.110
of Philadelphia was drawn in
Philadelphia but sent to English

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:56.230
and printed there,
the front cover

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:59.660
of the almanac was
produced in Philadelphia.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:02.890
So what is then comparable?

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.950
As we can see, the ferry
[inaudible] can be spotted

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:08.280
in both images.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.970
Here we have it.

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.600
Also, the river, here again.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.540
Also, the river with it's
ships looks familiar, and then,

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:20.200
of course, there is the
skyline of Philadelphia.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.050
Even though the front cover of
the almanac is not an exact copy

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.870
of the map, we can
compare the elements

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.440
of the scenes one on one.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.290
What we see is from
left to right.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:36.780
The State House Quaker
Meeting House, courthouse,

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.010
the Christ Church, again

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:43.250
as the largest building
it's quite recognizable,

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.780
then followed by the Academy,
the Presbyterian Church,

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.650
and the Dutch and
Calvinist Church.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:54.660
Also, we can spot the High
Street or Market Street,

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.480
which gives us the
opportunity to identify the rest

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.110
of the city bridge, and
while we do that, about here,

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.740
where the yellow or orange
arrow is, is the printing shop

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.580
of Henry Miller, so the
printer of this front cover.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:14.880
At the top of the almanac, we
can see, as we have seen it

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.940
at the [foreign language]
day and night.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.340
On the left side,
the sun is shining,

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.070
and at the top right corner,
we have the moon and the stars.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.330
Between those, we
can see the sky

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:32.130
and the zodiac showing us
the ram, the bull, the twins,

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:35.220
the crab, and the
lion, so he lists them

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.760
in the chronological order.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.260
Unlike the Saurs, Miller
stayed with the arrangement

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:48.150
of the front cover for the whole
time he published his almanac.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.260
This one probably
looks familiar.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:55.170
The next almanac was
produced in Philadelphia

00:36:55.170 --> 00:37:01.990
by Anthony Armbruster in
the 1750's and 1760's,

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.270
and it's called [foreign
language].

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:09.010
It first was produced by
Armbruster in Philadelphia

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.970
and after his death by
Francis Bailey in Lancaster.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:16.090
Armbruster was supported
by Benjamin Franklin.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:19.650
Not only with advice but
in particular with money,

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:21.360
as we can see on the contract

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:24.330
between the two concerning
a loan Franklin gave

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.870
to Armbruster.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:30.170
The example we see here
is from the year 1753,

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.580
and as we can observe,
it defers in many ways

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.400
from the almanac we
have seen so far.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:41.050
At the first sight, this
almanac has little in common

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.420
with the ones we saw before.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.360
A lot of different
scenes are taking place,

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.030
and as we have done
before, I want to start

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.810
with what is happening
at the front.

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:57.790
We have two people who look like
they are arriving in a country.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:02.530
The one in front looks like a
typical gentleman of that time,

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.740
and we have seen something
comparable before when we look

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.820
at the almanac of Saur.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:12.550
It appears to be a European, and
it's looking in the direction

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.470
of the countryside
in front of him,

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:18.280
which lies on the
right-hand side.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.910
He seems to cover his eyes,

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:26.590
and in his left hand he
holds a book, which is open.

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:30.770
Behind him, we spot what appears
to be a woman depicted like,

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:34.130
and I have to put as
many hyphens up as I can,

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.110
Indians are from
time to time depicted

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.340
in European images of that time.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.080
She is barefoot and wears
no shirt, and she appears

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.820
to have [inaudible]
around her body and ankles.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:50.680
A rider seems to approach
both, offering them a paper

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.670
on which is written
calendar in German.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.820
In contrast to the content
of the [foreign language],

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.900
the rider indicates that the
almanac contains information

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.300
which are far more topical
than the news delivered

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.600
from [foreign language].

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.550
Another hint given by
the rider could indicate

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:14.910
that the intended audience
of the almanac in contrast

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:17.570
to the [foreign language],
which was considered an almanac

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:21.040
for common people or peasants,
the rider could be seen

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.070
as an indicator that
the almanac was designed

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.400
for a more sophisticated
readership,

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.250
the horse contradicts
the snail we have seen

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.230
on the [foreign language]
as a symbol for slowness

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:36.920
and also steadiness,
and as we have seen it

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.740
at the cover of Barctus.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.400
Behind the rider, we see a
few ships along the coast,

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.690
and on the left side
is a ruin and a statue.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.370
The ruins though do not
strike us like lost cites

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.160
from precolonial times
but rather remind us

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:00.170
from idolized ruins we can find
in central Europe in the middle

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.840
of the 18th Century, trying
to imitate and idolize

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.100
to those in Italy and Greece.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:09.870
There are several possible
explanations of these ruins,

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:14.660
but as they remind us of
imagined ruins built south

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.880
of the alps, it could also be a
reference to cultures in Central

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.420
and South America, again
in an idolized way.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:26.800
What makes this slightly
more plausible is the village

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:32.610
of natives in the background,
which is presented to us

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.880
with a wooden house
and an Indian in front

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.260
of the village only wearing
what appears to be a grass skirt

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.660
and having a bow in his hand.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.410
The Indian seems to point in
the direction of the city,

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:51.490
which can be described as
a Christian city in light

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.900
of the crucifixes on top
of some towers or steeples.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.950
In the front of the city,
we see a fortification.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:04.500
As we know that Armbruster
printed in Philadelphia,

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:08.590
we now could assume that this
is an image of that city,

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.480
but it does not seem possible
to prove this hypothesis.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.940
We know that there was a
battery in front of Philadelphia

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.420
down the Delaware River,

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.600
and Indians were also living
west from Philadelphia.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.900
We could reach though,
the conclusion

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.390
that we are again
seeing Philadelphia

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.490
on this front cover.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:33.600
But we don't have the same
reliable source to prove it

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.460
as we have with the
almanacs from Saur and Miller

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.570
and the map of Heeb and Scull.

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:46.930
Looking into the sky, we
have an angle, and not Hermes

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:49.730
as we've before,
blowing a trumpet

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.600
from which comes the word
[foreign language] or peace.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:57.400
The words coming out of the
trumpets were changed from time

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.580
to time as we have see it
in the [foreign language]

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.230
with the banner over
Hermes, but I will come back

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.170
to this in a few seconds.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.780
On the left side, we see the
moon, representing the night,

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:14.230
and on the right side the
sun, representing the day.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:18.140
We also have a zodiac showing us
again the beginning of the cycle

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.670
as we have seen it before.

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.340
But I want to concentrate on the
[foreign language] for a moment.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:29.030
The [foreign language]
shows us a man in profile.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.340
He is crowned with something
looking like a [inaudible]

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:37.060
and around him we can
read [foreign language],

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:40.030
so George II, king of Britain.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:44.590
But let us compare this
one from the 1750's

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:48.680
with a later version from 1779.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.270
What we have here is the
same front cover used

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:55.430
as Armbruster's death by Francis
Bailey, who was printing it

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:59.430
in Lancaster and not longer in
Philadelphia, and we realized

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.850
that this is exactly
the same image

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.210
as we have seen before
except that the writing

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.560
around the hatch of George
isn't there any longer.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.680
And we see beside him
the word Washington.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.110
[laughter] And the angel
proclaims [foreign language],

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:23.350
the father of this country.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:29.810
In 1783, though the
writing is completely gone

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.410
and the angel states
[foreign language]

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:35.030
as Saur's Hermes has
shown us on his banner

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:40.780
in the 1760's during the
French and Indian war,

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.290
now of course referring
to the Revolutionary War.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.420
In conclusion, we can
see that the front covers

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.590
of German language almanacs
in the British colonies

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:54.610
in North America
address the wide variety

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.330
of images, themes and topics.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.920
That Philadelphia has such
a huge impact on several

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.260
of these almanacs is
understandable considering the

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:08.300
important role the city and
it's harbor have for immigrants,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.280
particularly for
immigrants from Germany.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.690
Almanacs were widely distributed
among German settler, and many,

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:19.000
although they were living
and working on new land,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.680
remembered their
homeland and wanted

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.520
to have something
familiar to read.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.730
It is not a coincidence that
all the almanacs presented today

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:31.300
defer in their appearance from
the ones printed in English,

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.840
as we have seen for
instance looking

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.390
on Franklin's Poor Richard.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:38.340
The collection to the origins

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.360
of German American settlers
can be grasped in many

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.270
of those pictures, referring
to German heritage not only

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:50.940
with the use of German
language but also quoting images

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.390
from almanacs printed
in German territories.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.780
But interestingly enough,
the images offered to us

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.090
by those almanacs, whether
in fact it's Philadelphia

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.980
or the coast with Indians

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:05.550
and ruins are all
leading the settlers

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.250
in one direction, into America.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:10.510
Thank you very much.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:21.040
[ Applause ]

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.770
&gt;&gt; We have time for a
couple of questions,

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.500
and then people are invited
to come and take a look

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.860
at the various scenes in
Philadelphia in manuscript.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:31.000
You can understand why
it is such a joy to them

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.630
in our reading room because
you could remained occupied

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:36.780
with one almanac for hours.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.220
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: Is
this an invitation or?

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.520
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:41.820
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: Oh, okay.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:46.080
&gt;&gt; So if you have questions,
please raise your hand.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:53.370
&gt;&gt; I was struck by the amount
of British imagery that appeared

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.880
in the ship, where the
[inaudible] coming off the ship,

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.190
there's a [inaudible]
in the background,

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.950
and then of course later
as he's coming out,

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:06.000
George II is given
a prominent place.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.590
What can we learn from that
about the sense of identity

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.210
in these communities, and
these were obviously people

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.660
who were still very connected
to their German heritage,

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.110
and yet they [inaudible] symbols

00:46:17.110 --> 00:46:19.990
of the Britishness
in their depicture.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:21.290
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim:
They most certainly do.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:25.950
So what happens is, that
is the main question

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.530
of the whole project I'm
working on is the question,

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.570
what are those settlers
feeling like.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.460
So they obviously are
not any longer German,

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.850
but they are mostly
referred to as citizens

00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:41.210
of the British crown, and
they saw themselves as well

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:45.400
as such citizens,
but the reference

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.590
of the Germaness is mostly
an outside perspective

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.900
so many people refer to them,
many British people refer

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.200
to them as the Germans,

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.470
on the other hand among
themselves they were far more

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:02.040
discussing what really they are,
but it's true, they are often,

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.960
when they speak to a
[inaudible] and also

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.550
to other people referring
to themselves

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.410
as people of the British crown.

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.860
And Saur, for instance, was
very supportive at the beginning

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.760
of the Revolutionary War
of the British side and not

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.940
from the ones of the
revolution years.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.910
So that is, that is why that
is so common [inaudible]

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:26.550
as well a lot of British
ships which were used

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.360
to bring over German settlers.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.990
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim:
But the German crown,

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:37.410
[inaudible] British
crown is German.

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:40.340
Everyone from Wartenberg
would contradict

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:41.720
that pretty much, yeah.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.800
So that is the whole problem
we have to address when we talk

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.990
about that time, we
have no Germaness.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.790
So and then people from Anova,
it's not the same as someone

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:54.360
from Prussia, and from
Wartenberg, or from Bavaria,

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:59.410
so there were various lines,
and language is one binding part

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.620
of it but not the only one.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.120
&gt;&gt; But the [inaudible] of the
German states was according

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:10.470
to the religion of the ruler,
and the Germans are much more,

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:15.830
you know, akin to the rule,
and if the ruler is the crown,

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:18.690
there is risk to the
ruler who is the crown.

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:21.560
I mean the Germans
are, you know, very,

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:27.080
very much into who is in charge.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.500
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: Yes, they
are, and the [foreign language]

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:35.210
from 1555, which you're
referring to, is an act of law,

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.600
which actually made
some people move

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.330
because the religion
changed sometimes.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:41.630
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:43.900
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: But I
would contradict that as someone

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.550
from Wartenberg or from
Bavaria would see a king

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:53.040
from Anova sitting on the
British throne as his ruler,

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:55.750
I would contradict that.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:59.470
&gt;&gt; Because they were able
to get out of Wartenberg

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:00.770
because of the [inaudible].

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.070
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: Saur did.

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:07.430
&gt;&gt; Yes, they were able to get
out because of the machinations

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:11.980
within the crown and the fact
that they were getting them,

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:18.040
the Protestants,
to Pennsylvania.

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.340
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: Yes.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:22.510
That is another part of the
story of why William Penn is

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:26.980
so important and the Dutch
people are so important as well,

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.640
but as said before, someone
who lives in Wartenberg,

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.320
he probably could be aware
of the ruler of Britain,

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.210
but that is not for him a way

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:40.570
of being attached
to him in any way.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:41.870
&gt;&gt; May I [inaudible].

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:43.170
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: Yeah?

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:44.470
&gt;&gt; Just say I'm [inaudible]
and very curious about the idea

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:45.770
of the lame messenger.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.070
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: Yeah.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:49.760
&gt;&gt; Could you tell us a little
bit more about this idea

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.810
of a snail in the messaging.

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:55.680
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim: So as I
said, when a messenger comes

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.340
up after the 30's Years War
when part of Central Europe are,

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:03.900
yeah, destroyed, and wounded
and maimed soldiers are use,

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.310
the snail is also as the hare
is a reference for fast news,

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:11.710
the snail is a reference
for steadiness, you can rely

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:15.590
on those informations because
they travelled so slowly

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:20.610
that when they would be wrong,
the information would have got

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:24.380
to you probably before the
actual information had reached

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:27.520
you, so that is why it was so
important and what we can see

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:31.590
at least when we look at
those in German and France,

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:37.080
that those were then created
also for not so wealthy people,

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.600
we can see that from
the information given

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:40.990
within the almanac.

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:45.280
So it was more information
of how to harvest corn,

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:46.750
for instance, and not so much

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:48.630
on [inaudible] questions
and anything else.

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:51.140
&gt;&gt; I'm going to ask
the last question,

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:52.440
and then we'll make
time for people

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.350
to have a chance to
see the material.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:57.590
This is more about the
production of the pieces.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.890
From what they look like,
they look like woodcuts, yes.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:03.830
Have you ever seen, are the
dates and the lettering done

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.660
with [inaudible] are
they dropping the dates

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:11.970
of the almanac in type for one
year and then, so that balloon

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:14.380
that says 1779 or
whatever [inaudible].

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.680
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim:
It's mostly spared

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.060
and then put there
afterwards, yeah,

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:19.330
so they can use the
same font cover over

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:20.630
and over again without--

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:21.930
&gt;&gt; Making it a double
impression--

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:23.230
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim:
Yes, exactly.

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.530
&gt;&gt; I think [inaudible].

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:25.830
&gt;&gt; Alexander Knirim:
So the space is there,

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:27.270
and then they can print it in.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:28.590
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:32.510
So I think, let's first
thank our speaker and then--

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:37.870
