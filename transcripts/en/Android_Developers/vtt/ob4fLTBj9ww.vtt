NISHANT PATNI: My
name is Nishant Patni.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.350
I'm the founder and
CEO of Hello English.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.380
It's an app that helps
millions of Indians

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.690
learn English in a
fun and engaging way,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.100
using gamification.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.130
The idea of Hello English
came about when I was actually

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.300
studying in China and
trying to backpack

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.860
around surviving as a vegetarian
without speaking Mandarin.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.110
It made me realize that
the problem was far worse

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.950
for Indians trying to learn
English, a language which

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.160
has become critical to
professional success today.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.200
India is a bountifully
diverse country,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.370
with 22 languages recognized
by the government.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.360
But English is the
preferred business language.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.075
All large businesses
prefer to use English.

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:45.700
PRANSHU BHANDARI:
I'm Pranshu Bhandari.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.550
I'm the co-founder
of Hello English app.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.970
We wanted to make
English learning

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.850
fun, convenient, and affordable,
because it could really

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.770
empower millions
of Indians to be

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.200
able to learn English
right on their smartphones.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.190
Hello English supports over 15
Indian languages, 12 of which

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.580
have native phone
support on Android.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.730
A key goal of the app is to
help people speak in English,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.430
and Google's text
to speech engine

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.310
makes it quite easy for us.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.100
Ever since they introduced
the Indian English accent,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.730
our weekly retention
rates grew by over 18%.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.190
Our users face
certain typical issues

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.120
quite early on-- poor
internet connectivity devices

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.750
with low storage capacity,
low processing power.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.360
We decided to focus
our efforts entirely

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.740
on optimizing our
app for these issues.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.690
We discovered that Google has a
bunch of tools that can really

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.930
help developers to optimize
their apps for emerging

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.260
markets like India.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.630
We reduced the app
size from 16 MB

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.160
to 9 MB, which immediately
reduced our uninstall rate

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.590
by 15%.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.130
Also, the majority of
the features of the app

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.222
can actually work
without any internet.

00:01:53.222 --> 00:01:56.060
NISHANT PATNI: Today, we have
more than 13 million people

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.200
who are learning English
on Hello English,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.040
from not just India
but around the world.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.190
We [INAUDIBLE] to
expanding geographically

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.755
into several of the emerging
markets which face a similar

00:02:06.755 --> 00:02:08.449
need to learn English.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.120
More than anything else, we're
encouraged by the stories

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.380
that we hear from our learners
and how our efforts are

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.940
transforming their lives.
