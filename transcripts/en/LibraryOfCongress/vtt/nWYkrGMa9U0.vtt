&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:46.500
[ Music ]

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.400
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
We're talking with Brett Dean,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.680
composer, violaist, and conductor.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.170 position:56%
You are just the most perfect person
to tell us about all things viola,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.980
but anyway it's very exciting
for us to present you here

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.900
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.610
As both a composer and a performer,
your new work, Rooms of Elsinore,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.850
in a co-commission with
the Library of Congress

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.690
and the Santa Fe Chamber
Music Festival.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.470 position:56%
We're looking forward to hearing the
premiere and we're also delighted

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.060
that you're going to be playing
on our viola collection item.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.310
So, tell us a little bit
about how did that happen.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.960
How did you become a violaist, a
composer, a composer for the viola?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.690
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, I started
on violin, as most kids do,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.510
and changed to viola when
I was in secondary school.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.380
When I was sort of big enough
to hold the viola, as it were.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.230
And my first teacher in--
this is back in Brisbane--

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.580
was herself a viola player

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.610
and so recognized not only
something physical about, you know,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.460
how it might suit me, but also--

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.640
it's a very different
temperament too.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.040
Viola attracts a different
kind of musician.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.380
I mean we're often
the butt of jokes.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.260
We won't go there.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.790
I mean I quite like the older
jokes, to be honest with you.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.600
I think it's nice to be able to--

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.610
nice to be able to laugh at
oneself a little, but I think also,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.570
you know, it's an instrument
that because it's an inner voice,

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.390
it's like being in the engine room.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.210
And I think that's perhaps why
there are an unusually high number

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.220 position:56%
of viola-playing composers or
composers who also played the viola.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.350
For me personally, when I
spent 15 wonderful years

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.610
in the Berlin Philharmonic
Orchestra,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.670
it was just the greatest
place to sit

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.620
and watch all that was happening.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.360
And I hadn't really started
out then as a composer.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.110
Composition came quite late in
the day, really, but as I got more

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.750
into it, I was just sort of, you
know, each day at work was a chance

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.570
to sit and observe and learn from
all these great players around me.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.500
And with a viola sectional, so
in Berlin, sitting on the outside

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.880
of the string section opposite the
first violins, you had this sort

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.390
of sweeping gaze across
the orchestra

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.250
and it was incredibly invigorating
and inspiring, you know,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.690
to sort of go along to work and
learn from what I saw around me.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.990
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Right.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.100
So, you started out on
violin and went to viola.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.620
What do you think was the reason
for that and was it a sound?

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.510
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well,
I mean, as I said,

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.530 position:56%
my teacher could recognize something
about my personality that she felt

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.410 position:56%
as a viola player herself would suit
a viola and I have to say, you know,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.450
I was enjoying playing the violin,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.410
but I think she could recognize
that, you know, there was--

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.990
I got to a certain level and this
was the kind of change I needed.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.260 position:56%
Early into secondary school, a great
opportunity above all to play lots

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.560
of chamber music--
because you're always

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.320
in high demand as a viola player.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.710
Even then and in-- even
in far-away Brisbane.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.900
You know? Viola players
weren't that many of them

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.090
and so there was always lots to do.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.010
Even, you know, in school age and
so I relished that opportunity

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.470
and really just went for it.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.470
And, yes, there was something about
the distinctive sound of the viola

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.970
that I really got into then.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.340
It wasn't, you know,
the shrill high violin.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.420
I love the cello as well.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.950
I mean I love all the
string instruments,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.660
but there's something quite
distinctive and unusual

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.540
about the viola, temperament
but also color of voice

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.790
that really appealed to me.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.460
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Then, as a composer,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.200 position:56%
are you finding that's informing the
viola works-- that special sound,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.430
like, instead of writing
for a violin

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.410
in the piece that we'll be hearing?

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.710
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Sure.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.550
I mean having said that, a lot
of it's quite high and I love,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.460
actually, the high
register of the viola.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.040
I've written quite a bit for
viola and some violaists say well,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.860
why don't you just write it for a
violin, it's in violin register,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.330
but it's a completely
different sound

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.150
to a violin in the same register.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.720
And I mean I love playing on
the C string as well and going

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.120 position:56%
down into the depths of the
instrument, but I do like, you know,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.440
finding the extremities
of any instrument, really.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.610
But also, you know, in this case,
the extremities of the viola.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.350
To sort of take it out
of its comfort zone, too.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.650
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
So, in the piece,

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.950
in the commissioned piece, is
there anything you're finding

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.270
with this instrument that
you can do or you can't do?

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.980
Like, tell me how that sort of--

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.190
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, I mean we only
got to know each other yesterday

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.470
and so, you know, it's
still a getting to know you,

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.960
getting to know all
about you situation.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.250
And, to be honest, at first,
I was toying with the idea

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:31.230
of playing the Schumann only
on this wonderful instrument

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.990
and then playing my
piece on my own viola.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.680
But, apart from the fact
that they're quite different,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.690
it was just so wonderful.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:47.820
Right from the outset I felt this
clarity and this beauty of sound.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.560
You know, I really
like my own instrument.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.470
It's a modern German viola
made for me about 20 years ago

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.260
by at the time a very young maker
called Kevin Gentges in Berlin.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.330
But, of course, this sort
of teaches me something else

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.500
about the instrument, its
potential, its characteristics,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.710 position:56%
and about my own playing that I'm
just really enjoying the experience.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.080
It's something so different.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.870
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
This viola has been on loan

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.400
to the Library of Congress
since 1977.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.250
It was built in 1690, a part of a
commission for the Medici family.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.690
So, we've been fortunate.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.940
We have two here at the
Library of Congress,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.170
but this one in particular, I'm
curious to hear a little bit more

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.940
about your thoughts in
the piece and why you--

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.580
what the sounds are
that you're thinking

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.510
and if you want to
at all demonstrate.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.810
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.110
Well, I mean it's quite an
early instrument then, 1690.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.590
I mean the other one
is later, is it?

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.370
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
The other one is 1727.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.670
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Right.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.970
Yeah.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.270
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Quite a lot later.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:54.570
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: The Golden Age.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.860 position:56%
So, yeah, I'd really love to compare
sometime, but look, it's fascinating

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.210
in that although it's so
different to my own instrument,

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.980
it has a similar measurement,
overall length,

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.370
so that has made it a
little easier to sort

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.750
of negotiate right from the start.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.240
It's-- the thing about
violas generally is

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.960
that there's no standard
size, of course.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.150
It's not like violins and celli
that more or less have a kind

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.790
of accepted standard size.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.480
Violas differ hugely.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.410
You know, I wonder also whether
this may have been changed

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.830
in size over the years.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:44.460
It was certainly not uncommon for
violas to be huge and cumbersome

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.350
and then over the years
have been reduced in size

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.380
to make them more playable.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.890
Having said that, it looks,
you know, it looks so perfect

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.460
in its dimensions, it's quite
possible that it belonged

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:00.370
to the slightly smaller
category of violas where--

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.490
at a time where their
differences were massive.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.600
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
And, also, why it left the--

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.760
it was part of a quintet
that was commissioned

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.440
and it was sold off in 1803.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.100
Went to England and then
to France, back to England,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.940
and then came to America
in about 1925.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.650
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: A quintet
of string instruments?

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.020
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Of Stradivari instruments.

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:23.990
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: So, was that two
violins, two violas, and a cello?

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.290
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Right.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.590
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: And
I'm pretty sure then

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.730
that this perhaps was
the smaller of--

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.550
the other one was going
to be much bigger.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.850
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Right.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.900
So, I don't know why it was
broken up and why it's here,

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:44.150
but we're fortunate to have it
on loan to us and available.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.870
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, I mean
there's one thing that--

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.520
there's this moment-- there's
this moment that keeps recurring

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.510
as a kind of motto in
my piece, which is this.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.180
[ Music ]

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.210
This sort of broken
arpeggio I think.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.770
And I must say, with this
instrument, it sits kind of nicely

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.330
on the hand, which can--
with a really large viola,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.520
you'd have to have
a very nice big hand

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.040
to manage it going
up to a high C sharp.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.230
So, you know, it's working
out nicely for me thus far.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.240
It takes a little bit of getting
used to, in this instance,

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.410
quite a different sort
of C string sound.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.510
And I notice that--

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:35.640
[ Music ]

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.180
Which I sometimes admit
I have to do, you know,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:44.000
on my modern instrument to
really get it to give everything,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.200
that doesn't work with
an instrument like this.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.130
It needs caressing
in a different way.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:53.060
Partly also because it has
so much clarity anyway.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.110
[ Music ]

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:59.650
You know, it has this sort of--
it speaks very immediately.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:04.880
And, yeah, I mean I'm finding it
really thoroughly fascinating.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.440
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: So--
and you're liking the C string?

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.740
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.900
I mean the C string takes a little
bit of getting used to and, I mean,

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:19.510
on my instrument-- this is a
moment from a Hindemith concerto.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:25.100
[ Music ]

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.400
It's a moment that, you know,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.520
on my own instrument, I
really kind of dig in.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.510
Here, I feel with this
instrument it--

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.690
[ Music ]

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.820
It sort of responds better if
you just give it a bit more space

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.000
and bow transport and
don't hit it as hard.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.760
And, you know, 24 hours into our
relationship, I'm still getting

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.270
to know how to bring out
the best in this instrument.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:58.050
And, you know, players will spend
a lifetime with an instrument

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:02.620
of this quality and still not get
to know all that it can offer.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.730
So, it's all too--
it's all too brief.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.790
I want one.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.280
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Well, fortunately you'll be here

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.340
for a few more days with it.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:19.180
I mean can you really tell the
differences in your instrument,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.140
this one, and then how
you're going to apply that to

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.350
which piece you're picking
and what you're composing for?

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.750
I mean--

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.050
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, of course,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.880
as far as the composition itself
is concerned, I was sort of working

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.680
on my own instrument and wasn't
really thinking about playing it

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:42.660 position:56%
on something as glorious as this and
at the time also I wasn't even aware

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.510
of the Strad being part
of the deal, as it were.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.810
But--

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.110
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
But you had played on another--

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.820
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: I have
played on a Stradivarius.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.660
The so-called Gustav Mahler viola,

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.160
which was also a wonderful
experience.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.880
That's quite some time ago,
probably almost 20 years ago,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.560
with a group of string players
from the Berlin Philharmonic

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.020
and everyone except
the double bass player

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.710
because there isn't a
Stradivarius double bass,

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.070
but everyone was playing
Strads on a tour of Japan and,

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.050
you know, incredible sound.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.300
They were, I guess, also in
different states of repair

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.110 position:56%
and care and, you know, to
maintain an instrument like this is,

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.580
you know, as you know,
it's a full-time thing.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.760
You know? It needs constant
attention and, you know,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.670 position:56%
care and so with so many instruments

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:46.410
that was sometimes a little
varied in response and so on.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:52.180 position:56%
But, nevertheless, as a general
ensemble sound, to have just nothing

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.300
but Strads on the stage
was quite something.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.870
One of the-- one of the
frustrations, I guess--

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.410
and this is-- this is an aspect
of the profession in many ways,

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.890
but particularly in an instance
like this, playing on an instrument

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.980 position:56%
like this for such a short time, I'd
really love to be cloned and be able

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.180
to go out and have a
listen while I'm playing.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:18.870
You know? Because that would
also just tell me so much

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:24.320
in such a quick time to really
know how it's-- how it projects.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:31.310
But it seems to uncannily
sort of have--

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:33.620
well, I mean that's the great
thing about these instruments.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.480
They really do project in a
way that you can't always tell

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.810
under the ear or, you know,
right on top of the instrument.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.590 position:56%
And I think that's, you know, one
of the things that really, you know,

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:51.560
shows the true quality of an
instrument is its ability to carry.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.820
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: So,
tell me about your inspiration

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.180
for the piece and the sound of
the viola and how that works.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.320
I mean what inspires
you, in general?

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.110
Does sound inspire you?

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.410
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Oh, absolutely.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.010
I mean sound itself is
the stuff of it, really.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.360
I mean, for a painter, it's color.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.200
I use that similarity
quite deliberately

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.520
because my wife's a painter and
so we talk about this quite a lot.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.370
And yet there are sort
of things that are very--

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.880
that are common to both
of our undertakings,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.090
namely, you know, color itself.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.400
Sound has color.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.240
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: And
some musicians see in color.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.540
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Absolutely.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:40.650
Yeah. Well, I'm not synesthetic,
but nevertheless, I, you know,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.950
I can sort of see where
that comes from.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:50.160
I mean composition itself, the way
a painting is structured, you know,

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.520 position:56%
I've learned so much from being with
a creative artist for so many years.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.080
In this particular instance, the
piece that we're doing on Saturday

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.980
and is being commissioned
by the library is part

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:10.880 position:56%
of an ongoing fascination and
immersion into Shakespeare's Hamlet,

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.640
which is culminating in just
a few weeks in the UK in June

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.330
with the premiere of a Hamlet opera
that I've written for Glyndebourne.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.910
And so, in even taking
on this commission,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.090
I said right from the start
that I'd love to do this,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:35.300
but I have to say I'm going to be
so deeply into Hamlet that is it OK

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.740
if it's kind of based on the
same-- the same material and so on.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.930
Which, you know, thankfully it
was fine with the commissioners

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.060
and with yourselves at the library

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.580
and with the Santa Fe
Chamber Music Festival.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.280
And indeed, it's kind of gone
its-- very much its own direction,

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.450
nevertheless using, you
know, tunes from the score.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:06.560
In this instance, what I've done
is also tried to conjure something

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.760
of the spaces in which
the drama unfolds.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.350
So, the piece is called
Rooms of Elsinore.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.540
While I was working on
the opera for, you know,

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.520
best part of a three-year
period, I had on my-- on my-- in--

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.550
on the walls of my studio, I had
a whole series of photos taken

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:29.040
at so-called Elsinore or
the Kronborg, north of--

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.700
yeah, North of Copenhagen
in Denmark.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:39.060 position:56%
And not that-- certainly, I'm pretty
certain even though I haven't seen

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.360
all of the costumes or anything,

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.210
but it's not necessarily
a period costume drama

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.510
that is being presented.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.320
The director is Neil Armfield,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.860
wonderful Australian
theatre director.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:55.530
Nevertheless, it was fascinating
having done a tour of the castle

00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:02.160
to have these photos particularly
placed chronologically as far

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.290
as the unfolding of the drama
was concerned for myself

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.380
and for my librettist
Mathew Jocelyn.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:16.630
And also I had this map of-- taken
from the sort of tourist guide.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.940
And so, what I've tried to do
is make a kind of guided tour

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.230
of the space and we enter
through the dark gate

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:32.320 position:56%
into the four-gate courtyard, then
to the platform where, first of all,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.890
Horatio and Marcellus and later
Hamlet himself sees the ghost

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.370
of the old King Hamlet.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:44.320
Through to the king's chamber and
eventually to the queen's chamber,

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:51.750 position:56%
out through the chapel, and closing
with a sort of bird's eye view taken

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.800
from the so-called
trumpeter's tower.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:01.600
So, in using moments
from the actual opera,

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.160
it nevertheless has its
own dramaturgy, really.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.340
And we're also just
getting to know it.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.150
Juho and I just started
work on it today.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.850
Juho Pohjonen, a wonderful
Finnish pianist.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:21.650 position:56%
So, it's, you know, it's a
fascinating bit of discovery for us.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.490 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: And then
to add another instrument into it.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.190
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: And then a sort of
whole different dimension as well.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.880
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Is that daunting?

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:37.070
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Look, I must say I
was a little concerned because--

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:43.650
I mean pianists have to-- they
live their lives doing that and,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.240
as Juho said earlier, and of course
if it's not a good instrument,

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.240
then you've got an excuse.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.150
I don't have any excuses here,

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.830
but getting to know a different
instrument for a string player,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:02.290
as I said, you know, we create real
relationships with the instruments

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:08.290
that we have under our chins
and just to sort of get

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.630
to know a new instrument and three
days later play a concert on it,

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.560
it's something that, you
know, is-- can be daunting.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.970
I'm thrilled with how
we're getting on so far.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: So, it's
been-- it's not been that difficult.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.380
It's been an easy introduction.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.130
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah and also
I'm glad that I came, you know,

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.140
a day earlier than
originally planned

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.140
so that we had a bit of,
you know, time together.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.000
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Right.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.960
I mean we're lucky
here at the library

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.210
that we do have these
instruments here.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.850
We have this amazing concert hall.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.270
We have the music here and
we have composers, like you,

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.990
we commission music
and we keep the music.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.290
It is-- it is wonderful.

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.830
We do have to preserve the
instrument too, though,

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:57.600
so sometimes, you know,
balancing it out and--

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.340
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah, I can imagine.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.630
But it's so great that
they get played.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.930
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bradford: Right.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.290
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: That is
part of their health--

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.710
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bradford: And
that's what the first bequest

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:11.370
in 1935 with the five Stradivari
instruments was to be played.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.220
To be heard by the public.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:19.940 position:56%
And that's what we do and the Tuscan
Corporation, which has graciously,

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.500 position:56%
generously lent us this since 1977--
at first for the Julliard Quartet

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:28.440
who was on residence
here for a long time.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.610
They also, you know, wants
to be played and to be heard

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:37.340
and so we endeavor to do
that as much as possible.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.040
I'm wondering, in the
world of composition

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.340
and viola playering [phonetic]--

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.220
playing, are there more pieces
being written currently?

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.340
Are there more violaists?

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Oh, look, I think the
wonderful thing about the viola--

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.070
I mean in the same way that there
is no sort of standard size,

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.010 position:56%
there's also no standard repertoire.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:03.980
You know, we don't have dozens of
sonatas by Mozart or Beethoven.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:10.350
We don't have concertos by
Brahms and Sibelius and so on.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:15.070 position:56%
And so, in many ways, the repertoire
is still coming into fruition.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:20.570
It's so wonderful to know
that Hindemith played

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.230
on the stage of the Coolidge Hall.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:26.200
One of my great heroes,
particularly in that first time

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.530
where I was changing to viola
and then following that sort

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.710
of getting more and
more into composition.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:37.070
He was certainly, you
know, one of my heroes.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:42.550
And, you know, the great work
that he did for the instrument.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.140
So, I mean it is still--
it's still coming into focus,

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.240
but I think because of that
there is this fascination with it

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.330
because it's kind of
unfinished business in some ways

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.200
and no one quite knows
where that can lead to.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:04.710
So, I mean I'm thrilled also to be
doing my bit and with this piece

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.120
for viola, it-- alongside
two pieces for solo viola

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.310
or viola concerto trio
with clarinet and piano.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:20.030
Yeah, I mean it's also been-- there
have been very important key works

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:24.940 position:56%
for myself on my path as a composer.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.660
Largely because also they're pieces
that I've been able to play a lot,

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.200
so it's sort of been part of
embedding that relationship

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.010
of what it means to be
a performing composer

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.600
and playing your own
works regularly.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.130
I think that's been an
incredibly important thing for me.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.430
Also, to have calling
cards of pieces

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.910
that you can take around the place.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.160
A bit like a traveling salesman.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.290
And, I mean, the viola concerto

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.870
in particular has just been
a fantastic way to make music

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.130
with orchestras all around the
world and different conductors

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.610
and the solo pieces as well have
been, you know, really important

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:06.440
to take to festivals and be able
to say this is really who I am.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.720
You know? This is the instrument I
play and this is what I want to say

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.420 position:56%
with that instrument and they're
pieces that have been particularly--

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.840
for that reason, particularly
important and dear to me.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:24.130
So, I hope that this new piece
gets a few outings as well,

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.770
because so far it's-- I mean
it's challenging to play.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.570
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Is it
challenging to write for a viola?

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:37.610
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: It-- look, it
has its challenges for sure.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:43.230
The viola concerto has been-- is
a particularly challenging genre

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:49.370 position:56%
because in the way that it sits,
you know, sort of more in the middle

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:53.330
of the overall register of an
orchestra, it's difficult to sort

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:57.960
of make space for it, but make
space for it you need to do

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.710
so that it can be heard in
a setting with orchestra,

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:07.930
and so that's been part of
the learning process too.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.230
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
You know,

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.000
there aren't many extant
Stradivari violas.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.300
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: No.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.750
While we're talking about
that, how many are really?

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.050
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Maybe 10.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.630
Maybe, you know, give or take.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.930
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:21.520
And I mean the ratio between
violas and violins was something--

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.380
eight violins to every
viola or something.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.680
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: Right.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.950
I think there's extant
maybe over 600 violins.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.250
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Oh, really?

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.550
As many as that?

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.850
Right. Yeah.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:40.800 position:56%
I mean the repertoire for the viola,
yeah, I mean it's a niche part

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:46.220
of the repertoire, but I think
because, as I was saying earlier,

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:51.770
it's still kind of coming into
fruition, it does fascinate people.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:57.460
Certainly, you know, the
Viola Fraternity as a group

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.870
of players themselves are I think

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.580
by definition just much
more open to new music.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.880
We have to be.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.540
You know? It would be
silly not to be open to it

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.480
because that's the future
of the instrument too.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:18.230
You know, as I say, we don't have
the great cannon of solo repertoire

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:23.390
to rest on and fall back on
in the same way as the cello

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.760
and in particular the violin.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:32.010
So, you know, I think it-- that is
also something of the difference

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:38.010
in attitude and personality
of violaists.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.350
You know? We're much more keen
to explore new repertoire.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.650
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
We did commission a piece

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.050 position:56%
for viola a couple of years ago too.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.830 position:56%
Actually, for this one, do you mind?

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:52.660
I don't know if you
want to consider that.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.630
What about composing for a
particular instrument or a viola?

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.500
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: A particular
make of instrument?

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:04.480
Yeah, well, that-- that's something
that I haven't necessarily done

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.990
that much of, except of course--

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:11.840
and this is then going into
very much the time of today--

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.000
writing a piece for electric violin

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.510
and a very particular
sort of electric violin.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:22.070
I've had six strings and had a
very particular pick up piece

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.020
that in fact includes a
moment where the soloist--

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.550
it was written for the great
Australian violinist Richard

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.800
Tognetti who is the
artistic director

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.100 position:56%
of the Australian Chamber Orchestra.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.250
And at one point he just
blows across the strings,

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.500
which not every electric
violin can do and so

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.750
that was very custom-built.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:45.230
Also, all the effects
were custom-built

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.760
around improvising
together with Richard

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.960
on the material used for the piece.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.710
So, that was-- that was
a case in point, yeah.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.010
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford: OK.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.880
And getting back to
sound, perhaps we could end

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.250
with a new sound you've discovered
or something you're hearing.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:10.790
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well, I mean
there's one moment in my piece

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:14.290
which has a lot of what
I call angled tremolo

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.510
or brush tremolo, which is--

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:25.040
[ Music ]

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.540
Which of course isn't what a
Stradivari viola was built for--

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:35.130
not in 1690, but it-- I kind of
like, you know, the fact that,

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.330
you know, to-- the chance
to get some different

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:43.240
and extended techniques and
try them out on a 1690 Strad.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.950
It's kind of cool.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.440
You know? It keeps it alive, too.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.510
Yeah, it has a wonderful
sweetness too up here.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:29:00.290
[ Music ]

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.590
It's just a very--

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.890
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
It really does.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:04.190
Could you play that a little more?

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.990
That was very-- really was sweet.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:16.280
[ Music ]

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.580
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.050
I mean it's just a beautiful,
beautiful thing to play on.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.350
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Well, thank you very much.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.650
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: My pleasure.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.950
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
I'm looking forward

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.250
to hearing your commission.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.090
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Well-- and thank you
to the library for this wonderful--

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.390
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
And to the Tuscan Corporation.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.100
&gt;&gt; Brett Dean: Yeah, indeed.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.820
It's a joy.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.150
&gt;&gt; Carol Lynn Ward-Bamford:
Thank you.

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.810

of the Library of Congress.
