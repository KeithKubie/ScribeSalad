00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.000
Trevor, Devin, welcome
back to the forge.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.210
You've had five days
at your home forges

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.210
to work on your finale weapons.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.380
Trevor, how did it go?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.710
It went pretty good.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.210
It was long days,
a lot of hard work.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.000
It's a 115 layer damascus.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.330
Three steels.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.080
The guard is
constructed out of steel

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.080
I had left over from the blade.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.420
Great.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.210
Devin, tell the judges
about your blade.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.750
Unfortunately, it's
the second blade I made.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.750
The first one developed
a lot of cracks.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.080
I used a 5160
single steel blade.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.330
It has a bronze guard,
and a brass clamshell.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.250
I feel great.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.710
This is awesome.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.080
Well, gentlemen, your
blades look beautiful,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.880
worthy of hanging on the walls.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.920
However, they still
have to be tested.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.750
Up first, the kill test.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.330
Doug?

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.670
The sawback hunting sword.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.750
As the name implies,
it's used for hunting,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.540
to hunt for the kill.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.420
I'm gonna take your weapon
and deliver lethal blows

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.080
on this ram carcass.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.120
Trevor, you're up first.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.120
You ready for this?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.040
Yes, sir.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.420
Let's do this.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.080
My heart is pounding, all
I can think is don't break.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.920
Don't break.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.460
Yes!

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.420
All right, Trevor.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.620
First up, the balance of
this weapon is beautiful.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.790
It feels like you
can move with it.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.380
It thrusts, it's sharp, and the
first cut alone, it lacerated

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.920
the carcass of the deer.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.330
The second one-- the third
one was pretty much just

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.960
to finish it off.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.330
When I grab onto your
handle, it feels comfortable.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.290
I can tell where the edge is.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.670
Now, there's one area
right here where there's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.790
a little bit where the
edge rolled, because it

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.750
would hit thick spine.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
But overall, your
weapon, sir, will kill.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.120
Thank you.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.620
All right, Devin,
it's your turn.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.330
You ready?

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.080
I'm ready.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.080
Let's do this.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.670
Good luck.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.580
Oh, boy.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.460
I feel great.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.830
I feel really excited.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.250
I'm hoping that I can
at least one up him,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.290
and get it in three strikes.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.620
[clattering]

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.500
Oh, man!

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.880
[sigh]

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.710
Dude, I'm sorry.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.210
Well, Devin, first up,
aside from the obvious,

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.790
I must say that that's
a beautiful handle.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.790
Thank you.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.210
It feels good in the hand.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.290
Quality stuff.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.040
Your blade broke.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.790
Look at the grain structure.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.880
In your grain structure over
here, it shows that it's rough.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.330
Looks like sands on the beach,
so that's a heat treat issue.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.170
So I really appreciate that you
brought us a beautiful sword,

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.250
but it had a critical failure.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.250
It broke.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.080
Devin, I'm just
going to be direct--

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.710
your blade has suffered a
catastrophic weapons failure,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.330
and can't continue with testing.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.000
In other words, it
doesn't make the cut,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.420
and I have to ask you to
please leave the forge.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.540
Thank you.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.540
I came in here looking
for the hardest,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.250
craziest challenge I could
get, and I think I got it.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.750
Winning would have been great.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.830
Second place, I'm fortunate.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.750
Fire-- I'm happy with that, too.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.210
It's been one hell of a ride.
