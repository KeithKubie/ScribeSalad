MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.140
Next up, we have a
session on Analytics

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.220
by Dan Waisberg, who
is super-passionate

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.210
about analytics, data
visualization, data-mining,

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.240
anything where he can
figure out what's actually

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.500
going on behind the scenes.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.209
And if any of you ever launched
a game without analytics in,

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:23.500
he'll probably be really angry.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.084
Here's Dan Waisberg.

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:29.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.650
DANIEL WAISBERG: Thank you.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.430
So I'm the Analytics
Advocate here,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.720
and more than-- I
like data very much,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.270
but I like people to
use data, and my job

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.240
is to help people make
better decisions using data.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.530
And every time that
I think about data,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.300
I like to think about, how
does it look like in real life?

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600
And if we can play
this video, please?

00:01:00.856 --> 00:01:02.844
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.350
-People that bought olives
also bought Chardonnay.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.290
-Oh, all right.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.520
-78% of the people who
need Chardonnay also

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.154
bought "What to Do When
He's Not That Into You."

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:26.150
-Well, I'm just wanting
to get some olives, so.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.370
-Why not buy all three?

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.870
-Oh yeah.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.286
-Because I don't
really need them.

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:32.100
-It'll give you a total
saving of seven pence.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.645
-I think I'll still
pass, actually.

00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:34.690
-Just some wine then.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.190
-No.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.690
Sorry.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.570
I didn't-- no.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.306
Excuse me.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:38.910
Excuse me.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.800
I'm, I'm not buying this wine.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.281
-You sure you want to remove
that item from your basket?

00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:43.780
-Yes.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.325
-Why not try something new?

00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:51.950
-What, and buy
something totally random

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.660
that I've never shown
any interest in?

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.760
-Wills and Kate memorial mug?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.260
-Yeah, OK.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.060
I'll take the mug.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.660
Obviously I'm joking, aren't I?

00:02:14.735 --> 00:02:16.670
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.270
DANIEL WAISBERG: That's how our
users, they feel very often,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.470
and sometimes we're just
trying to help them,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.250
but sometimes we
annoy them, and I

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.360
think Analytics is a
great way to understand

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.180
when are we annoying them
and when we are helping them.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.230
And another example that I
like-- so if you were-- I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.350
mean, let's suppose you
have an offline store,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.120
and you want to know what's
going on with your users,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.180
and you just stand in front
of your store and count people

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.100
coming in.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.950
What kind of things
they're looking at,

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.340
what kind of transportation
they're coming with.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.800
And then you would come up with
a table like this one, right?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.320
You have users, people.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.240
You have your app,
which is a store.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.640
You have device, vehicle.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.600
And then you could
start understanding more

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.230
about these people.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.070
So people coming using--
people coming with trucks,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.150
they bounce a lot
because maybe you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.860
don't have a parking
lot for trucks.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.840
But then you see
that those that do

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.070
manage to find a parking
place, they buy a lot of stuff

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.900
from the store.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.180
So you could optimize your
store for trucks, right?

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.790
And the same with devices.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.260
On the-- with apps.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.690
And I just moved to
the UK one year ago,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.510
and this winter, we
did a trip to Wales.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.100
And that's a very nice place.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.140
And we went to
one of these pubs.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.180
And I was struck
with this quote,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.890
"You're a stranger
here, but only once."

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.040
And I think that's the ultimate
objective of Analytics,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.160
is to understand people
from the first time

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.580
that they come to the app, or
to a website, or to any place.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.390
Because they're
giving us so much

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.910
information about what they're
doing, what kind of things

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.740
they like, where
they're coming from.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.150
So we could use this
information to provide a better

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.890
experience for the users.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.330
And so, just to summarize,
the two most important things

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.360
on Analytics is, first
of all, uncovering bugs

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.380
and opportunities.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.990
So like the example
with the trucks, right?

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.860
We're uncovering something,
that the app is not

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.950
working for version
Android 4.1, or whatever,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.630
so we have to fix this bug.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.340
And then learning valuable
and actionable information

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.110
about the users,
something that you

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.480
can use to make the
experience better.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.710
So I'm going to try to
provide a few techniques to do

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.950
that with Analytics.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.300
And the first one that I think
is the single most important

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.380
thing on Analytics
is segmentation.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.120
And I'm going to use two case
studies from LEGO building

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.550
that I think exemplify very well
the two types of segmentations

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.140
that we have.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.160
Because, after all, data
is just like bricks.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.670
You can use bricks to
build different things,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.990
and data is the same.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.910
We got this set in January,
and it has 3,803 bricks,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:20.070
and I think it is the
largest LEGO set on Earth.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.130
And we were thinking
about-- would it

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.080
be easy or hard to build it?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.160
And we were very
surprised when we

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.690
opened the box--
it's a huge box--

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.710
and then you have
four boxes, right?

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.806
One through four.

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:34.660
Of course, you'll
open number one first.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.580
And then you get dozens
and dozens of plastic bags.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.510
And then, when you open
those plastic bags,

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.650
they have even
smaller plastic bags.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.480
So LEGO, they did all
the heavy-lifting for us,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.650
so that we can accomplish
the mission, which

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.601
is building the Death Star.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.100
Right?

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.600
So they're doing
something-- they're

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.290
planning for us to
accomplish a mission, which

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.420
is build something.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.880
Second case study
is Angry Birds.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.320
Now my son likes Angry
Birds, and he likes LEGO,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.250
so it's very natural
that he would

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.450
want to build Angry
Birds out of LEGO.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.884
And if you go to your
LEGO room, and you

00:06:11.884 --> 00:06:14.300
find something like that, it's
pretty impossible to build.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.080
Because for every red brick,
it will take five minutes,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.130
and you know it would
end up taking weeks

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.740
to build a red Angry Bird.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.850
But if you have something
like that-- by the way,

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.510
this is the LEGO Factory,
and the actual set designers,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.560
they sit on those
places, on those tables

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.890
and they-- everything
that they need,

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.430
they know where to find, right?

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.600
So when they have an
idea, they're not,

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.590
they're not organizing these
for a mission-- like the Death

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.770
Star-- they're organizing these,
so that they can find whatever

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.950
they need when they
need it, on the fly.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:55.080
This is what you come up
with, LEGO Angry Birds.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.930
And how this relates
to Google Analytics--

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.210
so I believe that segmentation
can be divided into two.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.580
So it's Mission-Driven
Segmentation and On the Fly

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.980
Segmentation, and I'm
going to show here

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.537
a few examples on how to do
that on your Google Analytics.

00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:15.870
So first of all, Mission-Driven.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.740
So the number one technique
is creating views.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.930
So we have this-- if you
logged into Google Analytics

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.160
for an app, you would see
something like that, right?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.240
New Users, Active Users, Top
Devices, Country, and this

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.570
is very nice, very beautiful.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.040
I love the UI, but it's not
very actionable as it is.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.120
So we have to do
some segmentation

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.170
to understand better.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.980
If, for example, I am
responsible for my app

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.000
in the US, and there's
someone else for the UK.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.050
So I'm going to look every
day, maybe every week,

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.750
I'm going to look for
the US numbers, right?

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.220
And I don't really care
about the UK numbers.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.280
Maybe once a month I
want to compare them,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.150
but on a daily basis, I
want to know about US.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.280
Now, if that is the case,
every time that I get here,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.730
I have to segment, right?

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.690
I have to start a
new segmentation

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.610
and start looking into the data,
but I can do that, so that,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.550
if I create a View, every
time that I log into Google

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.150
Analytics, I'll see
just US users of my app.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.640
So it's very easy.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.520
You go to admin.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.950
You'll see all your views, and
then you create a new view,

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.539
and then you can
create a filter.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:37.400
And filters you can create for
anything on Google Analytics,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.070
or for most of the dimensions.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:42.756
And here, for example,
you can create a view just

00:08:42.756 --> 00:08:44.630
for an app version--
for example, app version

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.240
number two-- and you're
very focused on looking

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.406
at the difference
between the versions,

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.030
and then you can
create different views

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.410
for different versions.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.065
So that's number one, and
there's a big advantage of it

00:08:58.065 --> 00:09:00.120
is that it saves a lot
of time, so instead

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.800
of every time that you're
going to Google Analytics,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.580
you segment the data,
you can plan for it,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.600
so that it's segmented
when you need it.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.260
Now Mission-Driven number two.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.830
Most people know this
woman, a princess,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.030
and so every person has
three types of identifiers.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.700
So the first one is a
personal identifier.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.140
So it's something that we carry
with us throughout life, right?

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.180
Our gender, the color of the
skin, the color of our eyes,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.160
so things that we don't change
every day, or every week,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.400
or every year.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.580
And then there is
daily identifiers,

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.230
which are things
that we start them--

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.460
we start the morning with
them-- like our hair,

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.589
or makeup, or earrings--
and then we keep them

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:49.130
until the end of
the day, and then we

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.200
change them for tomorrow.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.050
And then there are the
ambient identifiers,

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.200
which are things that we
change every time that we

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.540
get into a new ambience--
things like coats,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:06.200
or sunglasses, or guns, for
those of you who like it.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.630
And Google Analytics is
divided in the exact same way.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:14.730
We have Visitor Level custom
dimensions, which are things

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.490
that we want to measure
across visits, right?

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.790
So if someone purchases
something on the app,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.030
I want to know every time
that this person comes back,

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.940
that this person is
a returning buyer.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.060
Or this person is, for example,
a specific type of visitor,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.340
if we have this on your game.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.960
And then you have Visit,
or session, Level custom

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.990
dimensions.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.600
So if you have-- when
someone opens an app,

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.160
sometimes you have a promotion,
promotion of the day--

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.470
you can try
different promotions,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.930
and then see which
one drives purchases.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:51.430
Right?

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.890
And then this is relevant
just for the current visit,

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.960
so you don't want to keep
that for the next visit

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.500
as well, because it probably
doesn't affect the next visit

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.390
purchase.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:05.242
And then you have Page Level,
screen level, dimensions,

00:11:05.242 --> 00:11:07.700
which are things that, if you
have different games that you

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.640
want to group, things that
happen on different games,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.780
you can use the screen level.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.670
Now this has a
very big advantage

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.940
that you can use your
own definitions, right?

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.050
So if you have different
types of players,

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:26.300
you want to see those players
listed on Google Analytics,

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.300
and you can segment behavior
on Google Analytics based

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.140
on your own definitions,
which is a great advantage.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:41.250
Now, let's talk a little bit
about On the Fly Segmentation.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.790
And just-- the Mission-Driven
that I just spoke about

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.190
is something that I
have to plan for, right?

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.810
So something that you
have to talk to people,

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.610
and you have to-- you start
collecting this data just

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.850
from the moment that
your implement them.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.040
So that's very important
differentiation.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.600
Now On the Fly
Segmentation is something

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.200
that you just had
an idea, and you

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.640
want to see data for this idea.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.190
So if your data is organized,
you can find this information.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.790
And again, we're going
to use User Segments,

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.600
and if you log into
Google Analytics,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.450
you'll see the
same screen, right?

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:27.150
Now you have-- you want to see
people's behavior by an app

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.250
version, for example, that
I don't have a view for.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.570
You can open on
the orange arrow.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.180
Then you'll get this
interface, which

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.510
are-- those are the default
segments for mobile apps,

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:50.710
and basically, if you click here
on-- right I-- Tablet Traffic,

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.210
right?

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.610
You want to just, say,
people coming from tablets,

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.920
and then, you see all the
reports based on tablets,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.310
so the behavior for
people using tablets.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:07.000
Now you can also create
segments, so when you open it,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.130
you will see that you have all
these dimensions that you can--

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.710
segment dimensions and metrics
that you can segment by--

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.640
and you can choose from a list
what kind-- so you want people

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.750
that, for example, came
to the web, to the app,

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:27.040
at least three times and spent
$50 across these three visits,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.310
and you want to
see their behavior.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.630
So that's a great way
to segment traffic,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.930
and this is really not something
that you can build in advance,

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.090
so that's something On the Fly.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:46.320
And the big advantage of
this On the Fly Segmentation

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.420
is-- first of all,
it's retroactive,

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.370
so you can see for
past behavior as well.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.000
And we also have a
Solution Gallery, which

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.650
is a place where you can
download segments from,

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.630
and you can also
upload segments to,

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.300
and you can use the same
segments that your colleagues

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:08.260
are using, so it's
a very scalable way

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.900
to segment behavior.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.760
And I like very much
this quote by Brandeis,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:28.940
which is, "I abhor averages--"
All right, six meals one day

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.890
and zero the next is
not the same thing

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.490
as three meals one day
and three meals the other.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.020
So if you do not
segment your traffic,

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.830
you're getting a very wrong
idea of what's going on.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.870
So it's really, really important
to have segmentation in place.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.390
Now let's go through
a few reports

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:51.430
that I find especially
insightful when

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:57.800
we talk about
analyzing app behavior.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:06.320
And you can read
the-- so we have

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.480
to focus on the
right users, right?

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.940
That's, I think, the
single most important thing

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.360
on-- when we're dealing,
analyzing behavior

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:19.400
on our apps-- is to focus
on the right people.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.070
And there is this report,
which is very nice.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.940
It looks beautiful.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.670
I like the charts, and
one very interesting thing

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.120
when you look at it--
that's the Loyalty Report--

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.340
is that, for example,
you can find things

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.020
like on the third
session, we can see a drop

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.860
in conversion rate, conversion
rates, which is amazing.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.410
I mean there's
almost 60% conversion

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:46.210
rate on the second session,
and then it drops to 22,

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.760
and then it goes up to
50, and then 30, 43, 32,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.350
so there is something very
wrong about the third session.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.230
Maybe there is some
kind of pop up,

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.790
or something, that
is going wrong,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:02.790
so that's a great way
to find where to focus.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.070
So we are losing people on
this, on the third session,

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.070
and maybe there is something
that we are doing wrong there.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.150
And another one is how
to prioritize, right?

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.330
And this is-- I'm sorry.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.910
I'm just going back.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:22.330
Oops-- Yeah so, if you
go to Audiences, and then

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:27.240
Devices and Network, Devices,
Operating Systems, Conversion.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.450
That's a bit long, but you can
drop me an email afterwards,

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.150
and I'll just send you a link.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.310
I'm sorry.

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.750
I think I-- Yeah, no.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.720
I was trying-- OK.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.050
I'm sorry.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.080
So the previous report, it's
just some Behavior, Behavior,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.070
and then Loyalty.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.070
So that's the way you find
this, the Loyalty Report.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.320
Now the next one is how
do we prioritize issues.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.680
And here you can
see in our table

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.730
with operating system versions,
so this is Android, right?

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.510
4.3.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.190
4.4.

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:07.020
And this is the average of the
conversion rate on the website.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.960
Now what we can see is that 4.3
is 0.77% above the average when

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.250
it comes to conversion
rate, but then we

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:24.690
can see that 4.0.4 and 4.0.3,
we have significant drop

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.170
in conversion rates as well.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.200
So that's a good
way-- should we invest

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.740
in supporting those
versions, and then you

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.740
should look at how many
people are using them,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.620
and then you can do
the math by yourself,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.730
if you should or
should not-- but that's

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.710
a great way to understand how
to prioritize those issues based

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.000
on conversion rates.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.190
And our last one
is Behavioral Flow,

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:58.300
and this is great
to see where you

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.700
have bottlenecks on the app.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.300
And you can see, for
example, here I'm

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.590
segmenting by app
version, so those

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.770
are the app versions
that I have.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.490
And then you can
just click and see

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.880
the flow of your visitor
based on app version,

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.770
and you can see what
kind of bottlenecks

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:15.730
you have on the app.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.130
Now some take aways.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.620
First of all, plan
for segmentation.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.980
I think it's really important
to see it with everyone--

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.940
the company, understand-- what
each person needs in terms

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:36.606
of Analytics, so if someone
uses only, as I mentioned, US,

00:18:36.606 --> 00:18:39.120
is responsible only
for US traffic,

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.930
or for a certain campaign,
or for a certain version

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.210
of the app, you can create
a view for this person,

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.020
or for this department, so
that the person doesn't have

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.350
to spend so much time every
time that he or she comes

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.200
to Google Analytics.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.260
Segment like crazy.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.490
I think segmentation is the
most important thing when

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.037
it comes to Google Analytics,
so it's really important

00:19:00.037 --> 00:19:02.370
to segment every time that
you come to Google Analytics,

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.790
so that it can understand
behavior in a better way.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.180
Focus on the right users.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.270
Prioritize development
by conversion.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:18.790
I think it's a great way
to look at prioritization.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:23.640
And optimize users'
experience using Analytics.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.900
Now, before I end.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.200
First of all, thank
you, Rupert Whitehead,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.720
that put together the event,
which is very successful event.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.100
And second, one of the things
that Rupert mentioned to us

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.980
was that we should think
about what kind of feedback

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.260
we'd like to get from you.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.410
So I would really love to
talk to each one of you,

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.510
after the talk, about
those three things

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:51.420
that I would like to understand,
how you use Analytics.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.190
So which kind of
report, or feature,

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.580
would help you make better
decisions using Analytics?

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:02.750
Who in your organization uses
Google Analytics, and are there

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.620
enough customizations
for different people that

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.371
use Analytics?

00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:07.870
