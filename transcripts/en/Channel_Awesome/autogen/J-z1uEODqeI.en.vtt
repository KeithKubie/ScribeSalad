00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
the original Tom and Jerry was MGM so
 

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.810 align:start position:0%
the original Tom and Jerry was MGM so
would<00:14:36.170><c> think</c><00:14:36.380><c> that</c><00:14:36.530><c> somehow</c><00:14:36.770><c> in</c><00:14:37.100><c> general</c><00:14:37.610><c> yeah</c>

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:37.820 align:start position:0%
would think that somehow in general yeah
 

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.710 align:start position:0%
would think that somehow in general yeah
that's<00:14:38.060><c> true</c>

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's true
 

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.780 align:start position:0%
that's true
yeah<00:14:38.960><c> they</c><00:14:39.380><c> did</c><00:14:39.620><c> it</c><00:14:39.830><c> the</c><00:14:39.980><c> force</c><00:14:40.250><c> of</c><00:14:40.400><c> it</c><00:14:40.520><c> maybe</c>

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:40.790 align:start position:0%
yeah they did it the force of it maybe
 

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
yeah they did it the force of it maybe
maybe<00:14:41.060><c> it</c><00:14:41.210><c> was</c><00:14:41.360><c> MGM</c><00:14:41.840><c> but</c><00:14:42.380><c> I</c><00:14:42.530><c> don't</c><00:14:42.950><c> remember</c>

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.250 align:start position:0%
maybe it was MGM but I don't remember
 

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.310 align:start position:0%
maybe it was MGM but I don't remember
because<00:14:43.940><c> it</c><00:14:44.060><c> wasn't</c><00:14:44.420><c> a</c><00:14:44.480><c> good</c><00:14:44.690><c> movie</c><00:14:45.080><c> okay</c>

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%

you're<00:14:45.530><c> sayin</c><00:14:45.890><c> I</c><00:14:46.040><c> that</c><00:14:46.430><c> would</c><00:14:46.550><c> be</c><00:14:46.670><c> the</c>

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:46.790 align:start position:0%
you're sayin I that would be the
 

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.550 align:start position:0%
you're sayin I that would be the
