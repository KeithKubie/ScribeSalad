00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.470
Actors are required to call upon a variety
of skills and abilities when working on a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.470
movie.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.470
Depending on the role, they will have to display
dramatic range, showcase their comedic timing,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.470
or show off their physicality.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.470
And as it turns out, some of the biggest names
in Hollywood are multi-talented people who

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.700
can do much more than just act.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.920
Everyone needs a hobby, and some turn to martial
arts to stay and shape or even prepare for

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.920
a role.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.920
It’s common knowledge that stars need to
undergo extensive training before taking on

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.920
an action movie, but there are those who take
things to the next level.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.540
Here are 10 famous actors you didn’t know
had serious martial arts skills.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.910
Jason Statham

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.840
Statham has emerged as one of the best badasses
in modern action cinema and has definitely

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.320
carved out a niche for himself.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.610
Given his reputation, it shouldn’t come
as any surprise that Statham is proficient

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.610
in martial arts.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.500
In fact, he’s on the same skill level of
some MMA fighters, meaning he could easily

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.130
throw it down in the octagon if he wanted
to.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.190
Kickboxing is his specialty, but Statham is
also trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and all

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.120
this knowledge has gone a long way in advancing
his acting career.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.490
Statham is famous for doing his own, unchoreographed
stunts, and he’s showing no signs of slowing

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.500
down.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.540
Wesley Snipes

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.060
As one of the first modern comic book movies,
the original Blade had to bring something

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.030
exciting to the table to wow 1998 audiences.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.070
The ace of their sleeve was star Wesley Snipes,
who was perfect for the lead role.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.280
Snipes has been training in martial arts since
he was 12 years old, earning a 5th dan black

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.240
belt in Shotokan karate and a 2nd dan black
belt in hapkido.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.000
He has also trained in a variety of other
disciplines, including kung-fu, Brazilian

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.420
jiu-jitsu, and kickboxing.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.750
Though Blade was the best showcase for these
abilities, Snipes has put together a great

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.590
résumé of action films that prove all that
training didn’t go to waste.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.590
Taylor Lautner

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.340
Lautner first emerged as the heartthrob for
Team Jacob enthusiasts everywhere, but the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.229
actor is more than just a pretty face.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.780
He began training in karate when he was six
and received a black belt at age eight.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.659
He was even ranked number one in his category
by the American Sports Karate Association,

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.400
so his life could have turned out very differently
if he didn’t turn to acting.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.480
His martial arts skills have helped him in
films like The Adventures of Sharkboy and

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.520
Lava Girl and were of great assistance while
training for Twilight.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.090
Lautner hasn’t done much since Twilight
ended, but maybe he can find some use for

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.550
his karate soon.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.550
Michael Jae White

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.870
White’s screen presence can come across
as physically imposing, even when the role

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.870
is just to sit still and listen to the Joker
in The Dark Knight.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.599
A major reason for that is because the actor
is an extremely dedicated and gifted martial

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.599
artist.

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.020
He has no fewer than eight black belts in
shotokan, taekwondo, kobudo, goju ryu, tang

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.290
soo do, washu, and kyokushin.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.180
White has also been training in jiu-jitsu
since the age of seven.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.379
This impressive skill set has popped up frequently
in his career, including films like Exit Wounds,

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.950
where White starred with Steven Seagal.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.430
With everything he knows, directors should
find plenty more parts for him.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.430
John Cusack

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.760
When you think of John Cusack, the first movies
that come to mind are 1980s touchstones like

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.069
Stand By Me, Sixteen Candles, and Say Anything
– not exactly what you’d call action films.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.430
But it was Say Anything that introduced the
actor to the world of martial arts.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.079
While preparing for that film, Cusack took
up kickboxing because the character he played

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.409
was an aspiring kickboxer.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.959
He continued training for more than two decades
afterwards and now holds a level six black

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.379
belt in trainer Benny Urquidez’s Ukidokan
kickboxing system.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.919
Most of his roles haven’t featured this
aspect of his life, but maybe Cusack will

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.540
get a chance to show off his skills in the
future.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.540
Ashton Kutcher

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.849
Ashton Kutcher seems like a goofy, easygoing
guy, but he could probably beat you up if

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.159
you rubbed him the wrong way.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.099
As part of his healthy lifestyle, Kutcher
trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, even traveling

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.689
to the country several times to practice his
methods.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.730
Under the guidance of trainer Ricardo De La
Riva Goded, Kutcher has achieved a black belt,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.879
illustrating his supreme dedication to the
craft.

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.450
The actor has mostly made comedies during
his time in Hollywood, but if he ever wanted

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.059
to branch out into action, he could surely
put a strong demo reel together and make a

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:40.950
lasting impression.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.719
Ed O’Neill

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:47.219
Famous for roles in sitcoms such as Married
With Children and Modern Family, Ed O’Neill

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.700
introduced himself to even more people this
past summer when he voiced the lovable octopus

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.139
Hank in Finding Dory.

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.930
His characters don’t usually fall into the
action realm, so it may come as a shock that

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.790
the quintessential TV dad is a skilled martial
artist.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.569
O’Neill has trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu
for the last 22 years and received his black

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.749
belt back in 2007.

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:07.670
He called it the greatest achievement of his
life, apart from his children.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.919
He’s been nominated for two Golden Globes,
so that shows just how important martial arts

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.489
are to him.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.489
Keanu Reeves

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.739
One of the more famous lines in The Matrix
is Neo proclaiming, “I know kung-fu,”

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.150
and Keanu Reeves could give his iconic character
a run for his money.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.470
Getting hooked on martial arts while prepping
for the first Matrix film, Reeves has trained

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.470
in jiu-jitsu, wushu, boxing, and krav maga.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.200
These talents have unquestionably helped him
as he emerged as one of the leading action

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.530
stars of his generation.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.310
Reeves loves doing his own stunts, and being
in peak physical condition allows him to do

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.310
so.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.120
He’s also had to train in judo and karate
for more recent roles like John Wick, so he’ll

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.850
just keep adding to his repertoire.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:49.850
Hugh Jackman

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.160
Jackman is a man with a plethora of gifts.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.280
He’s naturally charming, can belt out a
tune or two, and transform himself into a

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.570
homicidal mutant for the X-Men films.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.120
Jackman’s most famous role is of course
Wolverine, and his training regiment for getting

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.020
into the proper shape has become almost as
legendary as his performances.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.540
Jackman’s extreme commitment to the part
means he’s always game to do his own stunts.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.480
He doesn’t put himself through all that
work just for a stuntman to take the spotlight.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.620
Jackman has studied martial arts techniques
to help better Wolverine’s movements in

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.700
action sequences.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.650
With only one film left before he steps away
from the franchise, we’ll be sad to see

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.830
him go.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.150
Chloe Grace-Moretz

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.900
This youngster splashed onto the scene when
she took on the role of Hit Girl in Kick-Ass,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.730
and she wasn’t going to back down from the
challenges of the part.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.490
While preparing before filming, Grace-Moretz
trained with none other than Jackie Chan’s

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.800
stunt crew for three months.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.180
That sounds like good company to have, and
the results definitely paid off.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.000
During production, Grace-Moretz was able to
do a majority of her own stunts on location,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.080
giving her performance an authenticity that
would have been difficult to replicate with

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.080
a double.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.710
After watching the film, we don’t want to
mess with Hit Girl or Chloe.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.610
Neither would end well.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.330
These are just some of the actors who have
become skilled in martial arts – be it for

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.530
their own interests or a particular role.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.710
Which ones did we miss?
