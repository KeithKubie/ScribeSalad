RETO MEIER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.960
My name is Reto Meier, and
welcome to "This Week in

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.310
Android Development,"
November 16, 2012.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.600
We've had a huge couple of weeks
in Android Development

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.100
developments, so this week's
episode is stuffed fuller than

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.790
the turducken I'll be feasting
on next week at Thanksgiving.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.290
Earlier this week, lightning
reflexes and nerves of steel

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.280
were prerequisites for picking
up a shiny new Nexus 4, 7, or

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.290
10 when the latest members of
the Nexus family appeared,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.180
albeit briefly, for sale
on Google Play.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.590
You can't have a new framework
without a new API to go along

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.650
with it, so Tuesday also saw the
grand unveiling of Android

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.330
API level 17, featuring the new
Daydream API, lock screen

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.870
widgets, and improved render
script computational

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.280
performance.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.020
A new API is no fun without a
set of new tools to use with

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.250
it, so don't forget to check out
the latest tools revision.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.950
That's R21 for those
keeping count.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.040
That's also available
for download now.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.810
It features the incredibly cool
multi-config editor, more

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.170
app templates, and the new UI
automated test framework.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.920
If all of these new releases has
inspired you to hone up on

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.860
your Android development skills
but you're not sure

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.850
where to start, check out the
newly rearranged Android

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.430
training on the Android
developer side.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.700
It's been a busy few weeks for
Android Developers Live, too,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.630
with the premiere of "Table
Flip" with me.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.540
The first episode focused the
dark heat of a thousand dying

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.740
suns at apps with
exit buttons.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.440
Check out the YouTube
video to learn why.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.640
Later that week, Ian and I
looked at instant messaging

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.590
apps on "The App Clinic" before
Roman, Nick, and Adam

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.990
took their take on what it takes
to make the ultimate

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.640
unified messaging app.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.990
They also invited the Android
design community to become

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.000
part of Android Design In
Action, starting with the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.500
community hang out
and an Android

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.640
design stencil giveaway.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.490
Then earlier today, I flew solo
for a personal fitness

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.180
app clinic, the irony of which
cannot possibly be

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.225
understated.

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:47.620
We're taking a break next week
as we search for Ian, who's

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.970
review of one of the less
well-reviewed GPS tracking

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.520
apps has resulted in him being
lost in the backwoods of the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.420
Sierra Nevada forests.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.450
Then we'll be back after
stuffing ourselves stupid with

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.870
Thanksgiving fare.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.860
Want to help us decide
which apps to review

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.030
when we come back?

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.020
Check out our Trello board at
bit.ly/AppClinicTrello to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.130
nominate your apps and
cast your votes.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.310
We'll have an abbreviated lineup
on Android Developers

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.990
Live next week, as most
of our team is

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.380
traveling, cooking, or eating.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.410
But don't forget you can find
the complete schedule for next

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.370
week's live shows at Google
Developers Live.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.790
Today's live wallpaper was
Fancy Falling Quads from

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.200
leihwelt.com, and know that if I
didn't know better, I'd hang

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.610
my hat right there.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.370
My name is Reto Meier,
thanks for watching.
