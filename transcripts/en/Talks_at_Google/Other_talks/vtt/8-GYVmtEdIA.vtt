00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.260
&gt;&gt;presenter: It's a great honor today to introduce
Rainn Wilson, the co-author of "SoulPancake,"

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.370
and you also may have figured out he also
plays Dwight from the series "The Office."

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.730
I'd like to read a quote from the introduction,
just to set the stage for him. "I believe

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.710
art and its expression are the same as faith
and its expression; science, too, for that

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.550
matter. And quite frankly, everything that
urges us to create, to love, to think deeply,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.180
to breathe in the moment, to be of service
and to be human." Also joining us is Rainn's

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.160
friend and to help us guide us all in this
quest and discussion is Will Eno, who is a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.680
Guggenheim Fellow and also a finalist for
the 2005 Pulitzer Prize in Drama. His new

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.420
play, Middletown, was the winner of the 2010
Horton Foote Award and premiered at the Vineyard

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.280
Theatre in New York this November. The authors
will also sign books after the talk, but no

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.530
memorabilia, please. And for the Q and A period,
please use the microphones queued up in either

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.149
aisle way. Don't shout from your seats. Without
further ado, ladies and gentlemen, please

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:11.180
help me in welcoming Rainn and William to
Google New York.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.310
[applause]

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.690
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah! Yeah!

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.080
[applause and cheering]

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.210
What?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.610
That's what I imagined a motivational speaker
would do.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.610
[laughter]

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.110
&gt;&gt;Will: That is nice, funny. It's very nice
to be here. I'm a tiny bit nervous; I don't

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.960
normally do things like this and I might have
killed a cop on the way over here, so I'm

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960
a little uneasy.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.960
[laughter]

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.200
But it's very nice to be here. I've known
Rainn for 20 years and looking around, I see

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.829
a lot of youngish people and I just was thinking
it's good to keep in mind that you do end

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.110
up, if you're friendly and you live and you
don't die, you end up knowing people for 20

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.110
years and--

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.110
[laughter]

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.550
so, if you're loving and good, as Rainn has
always been, then people remember that for

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.200
20 years. And I'm sure--

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.590
&gt;&gt;Rainn: I have not died in the last 20 years.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.590
[laughter]

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.590
&gt;&gt;Will: I know. Twice.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.590
[laughter]

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.590
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.330
[Rainn laughs]

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.190
&gt;&gt;Will: But, how about, you touch on it quite
a bit in the introduction, but how about talking

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.540
a little bit about other places that you've
been in your life, other than where you are

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.790
now, with respect to the world and big things.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:51.129
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Well, that's an interesting segue.
I was not always amazing.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.010
[laughter]

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.209
By the way, I had to; I had to go to AskJeeves
to find out where this place was.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.870
[laughter]

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.680
And that, no, I had to actually call my butler,
Jeeves--

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680
[laughter]

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.650
who was on my plane and he was, he asked my
pilot to punch it in. Anyways, they eventually

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:31.561
Googled it and I got here. I, yeah, OK, how
do I answer that question? I believe that,

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.349
and I talk about this in my introduction to
the book, which is only the tiniest fraction

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:45.300
of what "SoulPancake" book is, but as I, at
the ripe old age of 44, when I look back on

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:56.709
my life, I see it as one enormous creative
and spiritual journey. And it's been quite

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.750
a miraculous ride and somehow or other I've
ended up here at the Google headquarters talking

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.810
about a book. How's that?

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.090
&gt;&gt;Will: It's good. It's good.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.090
[laughter]

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.290
So, Rainn is a deep and dark and full sort
of figure, so I'm sure we're gonna get into

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.809
some difficult stuff, so I just want to start
that by definition of terms.

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:21.809
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Ok.

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:27.860
&gt;&gt;Will: Webster's Dictionary defines a pancake
as a thin, flat cake of batter cooked in a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.200
pan, or on a griddle, a griddle cake, a flapjack.
Do you agree?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.430
&gt;&gt;Rainn: I agree. I think--

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.880
[laughter]

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.059
I think that definition pretty much sums up
what a pancake is all about, so--

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:43.059
[Will laughs]

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:44.139
&gt;&gt;Will: It does, yeah.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.059
&gt;&gt;Rainn: yeah. We'll go with that.

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:50.469
&gt;&gt;Will: All right. So, the book, in a great
way, the book, it's--

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.230
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Are there any questions?

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.259
[laughter]

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.379
&gt;&gt;Will: And this is great, but can we get
four of those Google phones up here? Is that

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:00.889
possible?

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.930
[Rainn laughs]

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.629
The book is a, it's absolutely a destination.
You can have it sitting on your table and

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:14.889
you can go into it, but then it also it's
a starting point, it's a really, really great

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.960
thing. It's like a very gentle game of truth-or-dare,
or something like that; that people can kick

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.960
around with.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.680
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah. The book is many things and
it has essays in it-- little ones. It has

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.050
lots of heart in it; it has many of life's
big questions, which I'll get to more later

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.159
as I talk about artistic and spiritual journeys,
creative journeys, technological journeys.

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.669
&gt;&gt;Will: You're gonna talk about that, really?

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:43.669
&gt;&gt;Rainn: No.

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:44.669
[laughter]

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.889
But, that's, I can't speak to that. But, yeah,
this is a lot of what we have in the book

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:59.080
is a lot of creative challenges. This would
be a great book for people to have to; this

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.330
would be great on a date.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.330
[chuckles]

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.649
I'm just gonna go back to the beginning a
little bit. Hi, welcome everybody; all you

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:08.599
latecomers. Oh, you're too busy Googling things
up there?

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:09.599
[laughter]

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.689
To come and get a chair? All right, track
suit.

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:14.379
[laughter]

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:24.529
So, when I started getting well-known for
doing "The Office", I really wanted to do

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:31.499
something positive and unique on the Internet,
cause there's so little, there's so much crap

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:40.409
out there. And when I was a teenager, I was
every kind of nerd. I was even on the computer

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:45.059
club for awhile and I programmed in Basic
a little bit.

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:47.139
[cheering and clapping]

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:53.190
Yeah. Yes. And, but I was also in Model United
Nations and band and debate and I was on the

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.819
chess team. We were undefeated that year,
no thanks to me.

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.830
I was fifth board, so I don't know if you
know what that means. There's, you play your

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.340
top five players, OK? I was the fifth best
in Shorecrest High School in Seattle, Washington.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:17.349
Woo! No one went there. And, but one of the
kinds of nerds that I was, was a philosophy

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:21.759
and spirituality nerd. I took a lot of great
books courses, where instead of writing papers;

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:30.240
we debated things and talked about big ideas.
And it was my favorite thing to do. I even,

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.129
a group of friends and I--, when I was a freshman
in college, we decided it would be a great

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:40.439
idea-- we discovered caffeine. There weren't
Starbucks back then and they didn't, coffee

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:46.029
was like, it was just like coffee farts; like
someone ate a coffee bean and farted in a

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:50.580
glass of water and that's what, that's what
coffee tasted like for decades.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.720
[laughter]

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.709
And we--, so, they called it Folgers, or something
like that.

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:58.709
[laughter]

00:07:58.709 --> 00:08:03.969
And so, we went this cafe in the University
of Washington, it was called Last Exit to

00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:10.639
Brooklyn, and we drank these things called
espresso floats and they had like, triple

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:15.111
shots of this espresso with coffee beans churned
in there. And we didn't even know what caffeine

00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:18.679
was or coffee beans and we would drink thing
and we would just be instantly filed with

00:08:18.679 --> 00:08:23.619
just the most amazingly, great ideas. And
one of the great ideas we had was, "Let's

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:29.699
take my whole philosophy book collection,
go up to Capitol Hill and rap philosophy for

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:34.419
money. And we'll make enough money to back
and buy more espresso floats."

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.539
[laughter]

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:42.490
So, we went up there--it's a true story--
and we would rap to Rousseau and Kant and

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:49.290
Nietzsche and we were just out free-styling
to these philosophers. We thought it was just

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:55.240
the most amazing; we were just flying so high
at that point, like, "This is gonna be completely,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.060
this is gonna be amazing. We blow people's
minds." And we had a hat out and we were making

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:05.040
all kinds of money and then someone stole
our hat with all our money. And we left and

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.850
then we had a caffeine crash and then it all
ended poorly. But, that's to say that, so

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:19.240
the stuff of what this book is, is philosophical
and creative and spiritual journeys. I was

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.490
very intrigued with, at a young age and so,
I had this great opportunity to start a website,

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:32.639
so pancake.com. It has like, triple the usage
of Google.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.990
[laughter]

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:39.310
And it's out of the park. So, pancake.com,
and then we decided that this would be a great

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:46.779
companion piece to the website. So, a roundabout
way of answering Will's question is that,

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:51.709
this is a companion piece to the website,
but it also stands alone in that it's about

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:58.019
promoting discussion. There's no answers in
this book, there's no answers on the website.

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:04.480
Too many people know all the answers all the
time. I mean, even newscasters have the answers

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:11.980
to how everything should work, but it's all
about-- we realized as we were building SoulPancake,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.210
like, it really is all about the questions.
And whether you're an atheist or you're a

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:20.730
born-again Christian or a Buddhist or a Sikh
or Agnostic or you've never thought twice

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:32.500
about it, we all have to deal with death and
love and regret and free will and family and

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:38.240
all of these things that present so many of
life's big questions. And so, I was just thrilled

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.769
to be able to launch something like this.
And my other, my co-writers, and my co-"SoulPancake"

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:50.620
team members are right here. Stand up, you
guys. Devon and Golriz and Shabnam, stand

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.660
up.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.699
[applause]

00:10:52.699 --> 00:11:00.680
Aren't they cute? Aren't they adorable? So,
yeah. What else?

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.480
&gt;&gt;Will: I'm sorry; I'm a million miles away.
Say that again.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480
[Rainn laughs]

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.480
[Will laughs]

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.540
&gt;&gt;Rainn: When I was a teenager, oh, ok.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:15.600
&gt;&gt;Will: You reminded me that there's a great
piece of, I think this guy's sort of a Jewish

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:21.889
mystic type, but his quote is, "The answer
is the order of the questions." And the way

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:28.550
the book unfolds, and the order of the questions
in it, are, it's very nice, meaningful and

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:35.130
sort of gently directed experience to go through
it. Cause that's how you read this, at the

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.130
start.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:37.420
&gt;&gt;Rainn: You start at the top.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.420
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah, I know. On the left.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.850
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Who said that? Do you remember Maimonides?
Was that--

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.380
&gt;&gt;Will: Jabes. Edmond Jabes.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.380
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Jabes.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.000
&gt;&gt;Will: Who has a book called "The Book of
Questions."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Oh, does he really?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.670
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Where can you get that. Could someone
Google that?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.279
&gt;&gt;Will: Could we get four of those Google
phones up here to the microphone?

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.720
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah, and that--

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.720
[laughter]

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:04.199
we categorized all the questions into nine
chapters: Brain and the Soul, Art and Creativity,

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:09.899
Experiences and Emotions, Love, Sex and Relationships,
Virtues and Vices, Introspection, Reflection

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:16.899
and Identity, God and Religion, Science and
Technology--woooo! wooooo!--

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:18.899
[laughter]

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:23.680
Life, Death and Living and Who is Gonna Replace
Steve Carell on "The Office".

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.940
[laughter]

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:37.230
&gt;&gt;Will: So, quick, some, just-, maybe people
are interested in your personal life. Is there

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.421
a Mr. Wilson in the picture, other than your
dad and like, I guess, you?

00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:41.620
&gt;&gt;Rainn: My grandpa.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.620
&gt;&gt;Will: Ok.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.620
[laughter]

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.620
&gt;&gt;Rainn: He's dead.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.279
&gt;&gt;Will: No, but you're very proud of Holly
and Walter and--

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:50.819
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah, I have a wife named Holly,
who I love. We've been together for 20 years;

00:12:50.819 --> 00:12:55.360
married for 15. And I have a son, Walter.
We've been together for six years.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.170
[laughter]

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:05.730
And you remind me of me when I was that age.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:06.810
[laughter]

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:12.120
And, yes, I have a family. My wife and I had
sex and we created a son.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.120
[laughter]

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.610
&gt;&gt;Will: True story. No, true story.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:15.610
&gt;&gt;Rainn: True story.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.610
[laughter]

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.610
Basically--

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.990
&gt;&gt;Will: Well, no, actually well, now that
I think of it, but--

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.990
[laughter]

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.459
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Just to go into more detail on that,
she disrobed.

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:31.149
[laughter]

00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:38.149
No. What else do you got? I would love to
get into questions. I don't really know what

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:39.410
else to say here.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.949
&gt;&gt;Will: Yeah, but I wanna, there's something
I do want you to say, or--

00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:44.949
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:49.410
&gt;&gt;Will: both of us to somehow get towards
saying, but in a great way, you've always

00:13:49.410 --> 00:14:02.410
been the way you are in a deep and real way.
But then also, or, seeds of you have-, you've

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:09.339
always been there in some form that has gotten
stronger and clearer and all sorts of great

00:14:09.339 --> 00:14:14.070
things. And I don't wanna get, I couldn't
get too deep into philosophy cause I don't

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:23.160
know that much, but whatever we call the soul,
do you think of it as something that can increase

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.829
or progress or grow?

00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:28.569
&gt;&gt;Rainn: That's interesting.

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:30.430
&gt;&gt;Will: Isn't it?

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.670
[Rainn laughs]

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:38.230
&gt;&gt;Rainn: I, the soul is a weird one and I'd
love to hear people's thoughts and if we have

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:48.430
a soul. I think the word "soul" is weirdly
used, cause many religious beliefs says, "We

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:56.210
have an eternal soul," and they have a very
specific view of what that is, I think, and

00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:01.970
then we know what like, "soulfulness" is in
music, but there seems to be a disconnect.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:12.459
I grew up a member of the Baha'i faith, and
that informed a lot of where my thirst and

00:15:12.459 --> 00:15:17.370
my curiosity for all different religious beliefs
and philosophies came from and my parents

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:24.980
encouraged that. They would invite born-again
Christians into the house with the Watchtowers,

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:31.800
to talk about the Bible and we would have
Buddhist monks stay with us and we had books

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:40.510
on Egyptian mysticism and Sikhism and it was
a really fun household in that respect; other

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.950
than the fact that we all hated ourselves.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:43.950
[laughter]

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.270
And then, the true story--

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.999
[laughter]

00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:54.800
and then I went through a long period of time
of really questioning all that and I really

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.610
decided that there could not be a God and
that God was a construct and that only the

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:04.899
weak needed God and so much evil had been
perpetrated in the name of religion and how

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:10.850
could religion possibly be relevant to this
day and age. And that's, and I talk about

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:17.879
this in my introduction; I'm not gonna just
tell you the whole thing right now. But basically,

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:26.050
as I came through my '20s and discovered that
I was unhappy, even though I had become an

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:31.720
artist, which was my dream, and I moved to
New York and I shaved my head and dyed my

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:37.120
hair black and smoked filterless cigarettes
and I became a bohemian and I was doing off

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:43.029
off Broadway plays and I was doing workshops
with Andre Gregory where we were doing plastiques,

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:49.699
where we were doing these body deconstructions
for hours, sweating in weird lofts in the

00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:53.829
meat packing district. And I was like, "This
is my dream come true." I was getting paid

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:56.899
to be an actor, I was like, "My God, I'm an
artist, I'm an actor, I'm living in New York;

00:16:56.899 --> 00:17:01.850
this is awesome." But I was really, really
unhappy. And that, I think that's when we

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:07.021
all go on journeys is when we get unhappy
enough. All of a sudden, we get unhappy enough

00:17:07.021 --> 00:17:11.089
and then the needle goes "eeeeh" and then
we go, "I need to do something about this.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:15.679
I need to figure out what that is." And it
could be through therapy or through travel

00:17:15.679 --> 00:17:21.220
or breaking up with someone or whatever we
do to kind of unravel that, but I went, then

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.290
I describe this long spiritual journey. But
basically, what, long story short is what

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:33.430
I came to realize is that I came back to my
faith, but more importantly, what I learned

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.221
from that journey is that it's all the same
thing. And this is supported by my faith;

00:17:37.221 --> 00:17:43.809
I think it's supported by all the faiths in
the world. And that's what that young man

00:17:43.809 --> 00:17:47.670
who introduced me--I'm gonna call him Chip;
I don't know what his name is--

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:48.670
[laughter]

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.649
&gt;&gt;Will: Leigh. Leigh.

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:53.270
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Don't care.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.660
[laughter]

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.660
He--

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.540
&gt;&gt;Will: Terrible person. Terrible, terrible
person.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.950
&gt;&gt;Rainn: He's a terrible, terrible man.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.929
&gt;&gt;Will: No, you're a terrible man.

00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:03.929
[laughter]

00:18:03.929 --> 00:18:04.929
&gt;&gt;Rainn: He, oh, I am?

00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:10.770
&gt;&gt;Will: What? I'm sorry. Again, I was wasting
time.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:20.200
&gt;&gt;Rainn: So what I came back to is that it's
all the same thing. Is that my basic, my personal

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.360
belief, which really doesn't have to do with
the book--this is what I think. But it maybe

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:31.190
is filtered through the book a little bit,
is that there's not any difference. We, as

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:38.970
human beings, long to transcend. We want more
than just the material. I think even people,

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:47.179
even-- even Bill Maher or Christopher Hitchens,
or any of the adamant God deniers, still are

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:51.570
yearning for something. They still are reaching
for something; they're still doing more than

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:59.669
just eating and shitting and fucking and sleeping
and accruing wealth. They're wanting more

00:18:59.669 --> 00:19:04.390
than that. They're wanting to connect. They're
wanting to create art. They're wanting to

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.909
make the world a better place. They're wanting
to increase discussion, whatever that is,

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:19.480
but soulfulness is, I think, human beings
wanting to transcend just the ordinary. And

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:25.010
that can be through making music and making
art. That can be through exploring the limits

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:31.670
of science and technology and mathematics
and striving to go beyond just the material

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:39.549
world. It can go through an expression of
prayer or devotion; to be devout. And that,

00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:48.190
this is an expression of the soul. So, I think
that we all have souls, we all have that an

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:57.390
energy in us and about us that wants to do
more than just be a monkey and this soul can,

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:04.740
I believe, when exercised and can grow and
flourish and become more and more radiant

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.370
and that's really what life is all about.
But I don't think that you need religion necessarily

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:19.530
to do it. I think that you just need to, one
just needs to engage in this moment right

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:23.710
now, all that exists is [snaps finger] boom,
here we are and there, it's gone. And boom,

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:31.070
and now, now, now, and this is where we live
and that's, it's about the striving and the

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.429
striving creates soul. Oh my gosh, what'd
you do?

00:20:35.429 --> 00:20:36.429
[laughter]

00:20:36.429 --> 00:20:37.899
You spilled that. Was it water?

00:20:37.899 --> 00:20:39.470
OK, good.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.730
[chuckles]

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.880
Is there anyone here on the Google janitorial
staff?

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.010
&gt;&gt;Will: Can we get some paper towels and some
of those free iPhones?

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.260
&gt;&gt;Rainn: The Google janitorial--

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.780
[laughter]

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:56.269
So, I dunno. This is wierd; this is your lunch
hour? Is that what's going on? What happens

00:20:56.269 --> 00:20:59.820
after this? You go back to work? What are
you guys working on?

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.950
[laughter]

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:06.179
Are any of you guys taking pictures out on
the streets of the things for the Google Maps?

00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:08.010
[laughter]

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:14.120
Who here works on Google Maps? Who here works
on Google App-, Apps?

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.120
[chuckles]

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.919
Who works on the search engine? Who works
on the servers?

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:20.559
[chuckles]

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:29.450
Who works in the cafeteria? Who works on the
phone? Nobody? You do? You're the one person.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.450
[laughter]

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.460
What else does Google do? YouTube?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.649
&gt;&gt;Will: Keep going, Rainn. This is gold. This
is gold. Keep going.

00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:36.649
[laughter]

00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:38.380
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Who works, who works on YouTube's?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.630
[Will laughs]

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.080
All right. Yeah.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:50.220
&gt;&gt;Will: I have a thought. I saw a guy speak
last night named Slavoj Zizek. Do you know

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.220
that guy?

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.220
&gt;&gt;Rainn: No.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.019
&gt;&gt;Will: A Slovenian philosophy guy. He wrote,
he has a great book called "In Defense of

00:21:55.019 --> 00:21:59.380
Lost Causes," and he did a great thing called
"The Pervert's Guide to Cinema," which is

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.960
unbelievable; it's great stuff, yeah.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.490
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Oh yeah, I've heard about that book,
yeah.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.491
&gt;&gt;Will: But he was saying, he was quoting
Kierkegaard last night and I thought of you

00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:13.130
and the Baha'i thing, because he was saying--
Kierkegaard said, in the 1800s or whenever

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:19.080
Kierkegaard was, that any divinity student,
any theology student could lay out Christianity

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.960
much better than Christ ever did; they could
describe the whole thing. It very clearly

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:31.080
made it all seem like just an ongoing conversation
that the world religions are this, this long,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:40.760
rich, deep debate moving toward ever--I don't
know how to, I don't know what to put after

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:47.640
"ever," but toward clarity and toward some,
not final vision, but a fullest vision.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:54.320
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah, and the fullest vision, I think,
they-- I think religion does an awful lot

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.460
of damage in the world, but I think that religion,
I think that we as a society right now, we're

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.320
throwing the baby out with the bath water
in terms of religion; just saying like, "Well,

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.789
it's all a bunch of crap." And that's easy
to say when you see what's done in the name

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:13.260
of religion, but it's also easy to just throw
the baby out with the bath water and not notice

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:20.519
that there are some things about religious
faith that are beautiful and true and lasting.

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:21.519
&gt;&gt;Will: Yep.

00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:24.690
&gt;Rainn: In the same way that there are things
about science and art that are beautiful,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.230
true and lasting. So--.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:32.320
&gt;&gt;Will: No, that's, he also, this guy, Zizek,
also had an interesting point, which was,

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.899
and I couldn't agree more in that it seems
like that wonder is the, that's the important

00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:37.899
thing--

00:23:37.899 --> 00:23:38.899
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Mm-hmm.

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:41.880
&gt;&gt;Will: and that's not knowing and wonder
and striving toward--there must be reasons

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.070
and great, grand, beautiful reasons. But he
was saying--

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:52.909
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Well, I think that's what--hold that
thought-- what this book--

00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:58.730
what life's big questions does, is hopefully
it engages that sense of wonder and the sense

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:06.019
of asking. And again, yearning and searching,
because I think that the easiest thing, I

00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:12.650
guess what I say, what I'm all about is that
the easiest thing in the world to do is to

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:20.070
be cynical. It's an easiest fallback position
to know it all, to be over it, to be cut off

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:31.389
from, to be withdrawn from, to know better
than others, to be pissy and sarcastic and

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:36.410
all of those things. Like, it's a really easy
position to be in. It's actually really hard

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:45.389
to be present, engaged and open-hearted. And,
but I think that's what we can all aspire

00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:51.090
to. And I think that engaging in the questions
helps us get there. Does that make sense?

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:55.070
You guys didn't think you were gonna get this
kind of talk, did you?

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.210
[laughter]

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.090
When I started on "The Office", we had so
many--, John Krasinski--

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:04.260
&gt;&gt;Will: Just a quick thing. So, you're on
this show, "The Office", in which you guys

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.600
all play people, you work in this office.
Was that in the script? Or was that something

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.350
you came up with on the fly?

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.350
[laughter]

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.710
So, I, we should take some questions if people
have questions.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:15.710
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah, good.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.730
&gt;&gt;male #1: Hi, Rainn and Will.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:18.730
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Hi.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.860
&gt;&gt;male #2: I have a question about heartbreak
and if this is part of the book and what your

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:28.170
take on it is and how it affects the SoulPancake
and if you've gone through it and that kind

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:34.970
of thing. I don't know if that's in scope,
but I hope you have some thoughts on this,

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.350
not that I've dealt with this myself.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.350
[laughter]

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.100
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Do you, do you have something you
need to get off your chest?

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.100
[laughter]

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.890
&gt;&gt;male #2: I was just waiting for you guys
to get here, you know? I just got a lot going

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:46.890
on.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:47.890
&gt;&gt;Rainn: What's her name? What's her name?

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:48.890
&gt;&gt;member #2: My name's Ryan.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:49.890
&gt;&gt;Rainn: No, what's her name?

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:50.890
&gt;&gt;member #2: Oh, oh.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:51.890
[laughter]

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:53.190
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Or his name, I don't know.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.610
&gt;&gt;male #2: Kim.

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.610
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Really?

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.610
&gt;&gt;male #2: No.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.640
[laughter]

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.600
This is on YouTube. I can't do that.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:10.269
&gt;&gt;Rainn: I had, I experienced heartbreak not
far from this building. My first real girlfriend

00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:14.559
was named Catherine and Will, actually, was
our roommate and this is in the late '80s.

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:27.570
And, Catherine, she was from New Zealand and
she, she broke up with me and that sucked

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:34.149
and I was heartbroken and she lived on 19th,
we used to live on 19th, between 8th and 9th,

00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:40.740
right up here. And then, I stalked her for
a long while because I was sure she was seeing

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.630
someone else and I would stand across the
street from her, on the stoop, and I cried

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.950
and I wept and I had tears pouring down my
face and I was like, "Why, God, why?" And

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.950
it's--

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.389
[Rainn laughs]

00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:55.620
Will: it was the 6th.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.920
[laughter]

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.030
And so, I've experienced heartbreak. Yeah,
sure.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:09.470
&gt;&gt;male #2: Any advice that you might give
the people? Ok, it's done.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:10.470
[laughter]

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:19.510
&gt;&gt;Rainn: What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Boom. How's that? You can quote me on that.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.510
[laughter]

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:21.510
&gt;&gt;male #3: Hi.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.510
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Hi.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.510
&gt;&gt;male #3: Why do you think there's such a
strong link between funny people and comedians

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.259
and wanting to talk about philosophy and large
issues like this?

00:27:25.259 --> 00:27:26.259
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Is there?

00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:27.259
&gt;&gt;male #3: I think so.

00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:29.480
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Is there really? Funny people wanting
to talk about--

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.440
&gt;&gt;male #3: It seems like a connection that
I make a lot.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.399
&gt;&gt;Will: Stephen Fry is a good example of that.

00:27:33.399 --> 00:27:36.310
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah. Stephen Fry? That's very true.
Stephen Hawking.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:44.570
[laughter]

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:52.850
Well, I think that there's something to the,
I don't know, it can get, it can sound very

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:59.659
pretentious very easily to talk about comedy
and pain, but you have to know something of

00:27:59.659 --> 00:28:08.380
pain to experience comedy or be funny, I think?
Except for Krasinski; I don't think he's ever

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.450
had any pain in his life.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.450
[laughter]

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:15.500
And he's a very funny human being. So, that's
all bets are off with him, and ravishly handsome.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:16.500
[laughter]

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.500
Ravishingly.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.500
&gt;&gt;male #3: Does he like philosophy?

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.500
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Sorry?

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.500
&gt;&gt;male #3: Does he like philosophy?

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Nah, I don't think he'd give a rat's
ass about philosophy.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.500
[laughter]

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.759
&gt;&gt;Will: I know you don't care what I think,
but I actually--

00:28:25.759 --> 00:28:26.759
[laughter]

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:31.720
I haven't thought about this. Not you, but--

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.720
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.620
&gt;&gt;Will: but I actually think, when I think
of really funny people that I know, I think

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:41.570
from a very early age, people who know, feel
just some kind of discomfort in life or find

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:48.650
life painful in some way, start to very deeply
need to transform any situation into another

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:55.280
situation, which I think is kind a root of
both philosophy and comedy in a way of--

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:01.340
&gt;&gt;Will: of seeing a thing and then tilting
it four degrees so that it's another thing.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:05.559
&gt;&gt;Rainn: I think that there's something to
comedy, too, about, I was always interested

00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:09.740
in like, "Why is something funny? Like, that's
really, why is that funny? Why is it funny?"

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.850
It wasn't enough for it to just be funny,
and I think that same question of like, "Why

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.669
is that funny?" or then it goes to like, "Why
is that true?" or "Why do I feel that way?"

00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:24.990
There's that same kind of searching thing.
I know, I don't know. Does that make sense?

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:29.380
Not really. Sorry, I couldn't answer your
question very well.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.380
[laughter]

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:31.380
This is weird.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.380
[laughter]

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.149
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi. I'm a big fan of Krasinski.

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:41.250
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Are you a male model? You a male
model?

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.919
&gt;&gt;male #4: No.

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:44.919
[laughter]

00:29:44.919 --> 00:29:45.919
&gt;&gt;Rainn: You're in; you're in my Land's End
catalog.

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:46.919
[laughter]

00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:47.919
&gt;&gt;male #4: No, I'm not, actually.

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:55.791
&gt;&gt;Rainn: I just saw you. You were selling
a tote bag. Turn around and just go like this.

00:29:55.791 --> 00:29:57.084
&gt;&gt;male #4: I left it over on my chair over
there, actually. Sorry. I'm a big fan of the

00:29:57.084 --> 00:29:58.084
show and looking for the book, I--

00:29:58.084 --> 00:29:59.084
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Of this show?

00:29:59.084 --> 00:30:00.084
&gt;&gt;male #4: This show's great. I haven't read
your book, but this makes me interested in

00:30:00.084 --> 00:30:04.470
it. But it also, you seem very different then
Dwight Schrute right now and I'm wondering

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:09.830
if you could tell us like, where your motivation
for that character came? It seems different

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:14.500
from Rainn Wilson, so I'd be interested to
know how you, how you developed Dwight Schrute

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.830
as a character.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:20.090
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Umm, yeah. Well, a lot of Dwight
Schrute I stole from the guy who played Gareth

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:30.429
on the English show, who is brilliant, Mackenzie
Crook. And there's, a lot of my family is

00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:39.090
kind of trailer trash, South Seattle, muscle
car types, and --

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.090
[chuckles]

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:47.820
I really wanted an aspect of that to be part
of Dwight. And I went to high school with

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:54.910
a guy named Chris Cole, who had the same Dwight
glasses and, only they were, they had the

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.990
word "Battlestar Galactica" on the sides of
them.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.990
[laughter]

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:07.789
I am not making that up. This is 1980, people.
1980, he had Battlestar Galactica Dwight glasses

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:14.789
back then; he loved fencing, Dungeons and
Dragons, he went into the Army as a coronet

00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:15.789
player.

00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:18.090
[laughter]

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.770
And so I grew up with a lot Dwight.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.250
&gt;&gt;Will: He was actually killed, which was
a sad story.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.600
&gt;&gt;Rainn: What's that?

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.779
&gt;&gt;Will: He was decapitated, yeah. Sad story.

00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:31.909
&gt;&gt;Rainn: And he was decapitated. No. And he's
killed hundreds of people in wars.

00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:32.909
[laughter]

00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:37.470
No, not really. But, so, I don't know. I feel
like its part of me; it's part of my roots

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:43.889
and stuff like that and I play Fascists good
and I play nerds good and so I blended the

00:31:43.889 --> 00:31:46.919
two and it kinda worked out.

00:31:46.919 --> 00:31:47.919
[laughter]

00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:50.299
So. Thanks. Good luck with that modeling career.
Yeah?

00:31:50.299 --> 00:31:57.270
&gt;&gt;female #1: So, you mentioned that you used
to go to Capitol Hill and rap some philosophy

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:07.834
and I was wondering if you could give us a
demo.

00:32:07.834 --> 00:32:08.834
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Umm.

00:32:08.834 --> 00:32:09.834
[laughter]

00:32:09.834 --> 00:32:10.834
[clapping]

00:32:10.834 --> 00:32:16.200
You have that thing? Do you have that thing?
That rap? That one rap? Yeah. It's on my Posterous

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.820
account; you can find it. Someone'll look
that up. So, we'll do it. Thanks. Thank a

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.820
lot, jerk.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.820
[laughter]

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.820
Yeah?

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.820
&gt;&gt;female #2: Hi.

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:25.820
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Hi.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.259
&gt;&gt;female #2: I was really gonna try to work
out some sort of soullessness of offices and

00:32:30.259 --> 00:32:34.680
trying to bring Google into a really soulful
place, but really, I just wanted to give you

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:42.870
this Droid that we made of Dwight for Halloween.
It's a zombie, so if you wanna talk about

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.879
the soullessness of zombies that's fine, too.

00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:45.879
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Of zombies? Yeah.

00:32:45.879 --> 00:32:47.299
&gt;&gt;female #2: This is for you.

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:52.000
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Why don't zombies eat other zombies?
I mean, they're wandering around-- thank you

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.890
very much. This is umm.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.559
[clapping]

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:02.929
They're wandering around; there's plenty of
zombies out there. Do you know what I mean?

00:33:02.929 --> 00:33:08.641
Like, just like, they're like "urrrrr." Another
zombie, urrrrr. Why does it, it doesn't make

00:33:08.641 --> 00:33:10.250
any sense. Yes.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.710
&gt;&gt;female #3: Hi. How come you didn't ask me
if I'm a model?

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:12.710
[laughter]

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.710
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Umm.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:21.789
&gt;&gt;female #3: No, I'm just kidding. I'm just
kidding. Sorry. So, I think that, as an individual,

00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:26.070
it's pretty easy to question religion and
explore lots of different things, but I'm

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:31.299
curious as a parent, how that translates into
raising your kid and how you've chosen to

00:33:31.299 --> 00:33:35.190
incorporate that into raising a child?

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:42.250
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Well, that's a very good question.
I think that I learned so much from my son

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:47.940
and I learned so much about what I was talking
about, about being fully engaged in the stuff

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:54.070
of life from my son because he's incapable
of being cynical. He's incapable of being

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.360
over something. I mean, I think very soon
they start to experience that as they learn

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:04.549
it from their peers and stuff like that, but
everything that he sees is a little miracle.

00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:08.590
I mean, it does, the way cereal floats in
a bowl, the way that this screen is on an

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:16.480
angle, this and how they get the antennas
in there and it, when you have children--most

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.220
of you won't because you'll be working your
whole lives--

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.040
[laughter]

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:35.970
for Larry and Sergey-- but, I. So, I learn
a ton from him, but I think that I believe

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:42.500
that our--, we owe it to our children to give
them a spiritual education. And that can be

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:48.280
whether you're religious or not, but that
spiritual education is to show them their

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:58.560
place in the universe, teach them about service,
teach them virtues. There are eternal virtues

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:08.610
that work whether you're of a faith, a community,
or not. Kindness, compassion, humility, truthfulness,

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:13.770
all of these things are, need to be fostered
in a child and those are taught best at the

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.830
home, not necessarily in schools, although
I think a lot of schools are moving in that

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:24.810
direction and it's a really good thing. And
so, it's very important for me to engage my

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:29.991
son in that, in that spiritual education.
And our, and all of our spiritual education

00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:35.080
never stops, really. It's not something like,
"Oh, I have my diploma in my spiritual education."

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.080
It continues going, so.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.080
&gt;&gt;female #3: Thank you.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.240
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Umm-hmm. Are you a model?

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.240
[laughter]

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:49.840
Don't you work for North Face? Take your hand
off your hip.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.840
[laughter]

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.090
&gt;&gt;male #5: Speaking of parenting, I was just
wondering if your wife--

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:56.910
&gt;&gt;Rainn: We're not about to, what?

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.910
&gt;&gt;male #5: wondering if your wife is going
to redeem her punch card for four more babies?

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.560
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Wait. What?

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.560
[laughter]

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.950
&gt;&gt;male #5: The joke is dead, nevermind.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:07.950
[laughter]

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.640
&gt;&gt;Rainn: For four more, I don't underst-,
I'm, I wish I knew what that meant.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.590
&gt;&gt;male #5: The Office with Angela.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.590
&gt;&gt;male #6: Angela.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.590
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Ooohh!

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.590
[laughter]

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:18.590
Yeah, sit down.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:19.590
[laughter and clapping]

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.850
What do you, what do you work on, man?

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:23.380
&gt;&gt;male #5: On Docs.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:24.530
&gt;&gt;Rainn: On what?

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.070
&gt;&gt;male #5: Google Docs.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:33.190
&gt;&gt;Rainn: I'm sorry.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:34.190
[laughter]

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.600
Why don't you work on a Google Lasers?

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600
[laughter]

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.660
Something really cool; Google Spacecraft.
Google Genetics, Cloning.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.400
[chuckles]

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400
Yes.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.930
&gt;&gt;male #7: Hi. So, you mentioned an interesting
question, which was why are things funny?

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:51.830
How analytically do you approach that? Do
you literally take a joke and rip it apart

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:54.210
and say like, "Oh, this is changed." Or, do
you take a more philosophical approach to

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.210
it?

00:36:55.210 --> 00:37:02.150
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Well, I think that's the magic of
making art, is that you can philosophize about

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:07.980
it all you want, but then there's the ineffitable,
enethible, intangible thing that happens that

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:13.781
is inexplicable. You can, as a musician; you
can study like, why is something, why is a

00:37:13.781 --> 00:37:19.200
melody moving? And you can diagram all these
different melodies and you can write a melody,

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:28.540
but then ultimately it, you gotta hit a point
where it kind of transforms and transcends,

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:34.550
and that's the, what's mysterious about the
arts. And, do you think that's mysterious

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.290
about science or computer programming, too?
Does it work that way? Can you figure it all

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:44.410
out with your head or does inspiration and
intuition--there's a life's big question for

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:51.820
you-- does inspiration and intuition guide
anything of what you do when you're programming

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:55.320
or creating something at a place like Google?
Anyone?

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.570
&gt;&gt;male #7: Yeah.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:01.420
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah? How? You would seem to know
the answer to that, I bet.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.420
[laughter]

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.360
&gt;&gt;male #7: Strangely enough, I do not.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.620
&gt;&gt;Rainn: You don't. Anyone? Who wants to speak
to that? Yeah?

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:12.560
&gt;&gt;male #6: The people who create programming
languages or programming tools try to that

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.430
by letting people express whatever ideas they
have most eloquently or most optimally. So.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:19.670
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Interesting. You look like, yeah,
you got something to say there. Yeah?

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:24.100
&gt;&gt;male #8: So, we have things like codes,
melds. Like, you take a look at like piece

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.060
of code and then like, you realize something
is not, is fishy, but sometimes don't know

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.360
exactly what that is.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.480
&gt;&gt;male #8: And then that's like it's some
sort of intuition you have, like when, at

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.810
least like when look at code. We actually
try to formalize those codes, melds so it

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.930
becomes more analytical, but there are like,
there is some--

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:47.430
&gt;&gt;Rainn: It's like Keanu Reeves when everything
can turns into numbers, and he's like.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:48.430
[laughter]

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.801
&gt;&gt;male #8: Something like that.

00:38:49.801 --> 00:38:50.801
[laughter]

00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:51.801
Yeah.

00:38:51.801 --> 00:38:56.020
&gt;&gt;male #5: I think it's more like the other
way; you anthropomorphize the code and--oh,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.660
not anthropomorphize--you make it say like,
this part smells bad. That's the way of saying,

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.660
"I don't like it," I guess.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.880
&gt;&gt;Rainn: I don't speak any of that language,
but yeah, do you have a question?

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:10.570
&gt;&gt;male #9: Yes, I do. So, you were speaking
about the sense of wonder and that a lot of

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:15.930
musing on philosophy or religion really serves
to answer questions that we cannot answer

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:22.560
adequately through other means. But as the
per view of science and information increases,

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:28.450
these fears of religion or philosophies decreases.
We no longer have to assume that every lightning

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:34.320
bolt falls for a reason and is targeted by
an angry God. So, do you see, perhaps, the

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:38.950
shrinking of the role of religion in our life
as a natural consequence of the expansion

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:44.400
of science? Are we here, as part of Google,
killing wonder by giving people better, real

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.400
answers?

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.970
&gt;&gt;Rainn: That's an awesome question. Let's
give him an applause for that question.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:49.970
[applause]

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:55.940
Yeah, I'll speak to that. I'll speak to that.
I think that, first of all, it's a kind of

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:01.550
arrogance to say that religious thought could
be equated to like, "Oh, this angry God threw

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:07.480
a lightning bolt down." I think that that's
really reductivist. I think that if someone

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.990
was talking about science and being like,
"Oh, I put a magic thing in a test tube and

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:16.080
nyeh, nyeh, nyeh." No, science can cure cancer
and we can heal people and we can make our

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.290
lives easier and better, like we have to be
careful not to reduce both sides of the equation

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:25.640
because I think ultimately religion and science
have to walk hand in hand. And by religion,

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:31.920
I don't mean organized, specific religions.
I mean that again, that thought, that interest

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:37.620
in attuning with the eternal, or with the
divine or transcending; what it is beyond

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:45.590
just being an eating, shitting monkey. And
so, I think that we're in a, our culture is

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:52.530
in a vast change right now. And definitely
science is superseding religion and again,

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:56.660
religion isn't superstition, and that's different
than religion, although certain religions

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:03.730
have superstitious elements still lodged within
them, but I think that as we go forward as

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:08.300
a culture, I think we'll find, first of all,
there's a couple of things that come to mind.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:14.270
I don't think, and I'm not, I'm not scientist,
but I don't think that science has the explanation

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:20.830
for everything. I think, I think we still
don't know what gravity is. We still don't

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:25.940
know that light, what light is; it's still,
it's a beam, it's a wave, it's a particle,

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:29.840
it's a; we don't know exactly what it is.
You say, "Well, yes it is. It's this form

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.230
of--." No, but you can't, you could get the
biggest light expert in the world and they

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.310
can't quite tell you. There's something still
not there. We still don't know what the real

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:43.440
building blocks of matter is. I don't think
that science, I don't think that's what science

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.950
is, it's providing the concrete answers in
the same way that I don't think religion provides

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:52.550
the concrete answers. So, I think we're in
this phase right now, societally, where science

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:57.140
is on the forefront and it's gonna keep going
and that's great and more and more people

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.290
are gonna be like, because you hear people
all the time saying, "I don't believe in religion,

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:05.730
I believe in science." It's like, "Well, ok.
Let's see how science handles those broken

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:11.780
hearts. Let's see how science handles when
someone dies, or when you're grieving. Or

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:16.680
when you feel immense love." Because science
can't answer all of the questions of what

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:24.350
it is to be human. That we, but science is
a beautiful expression of human. I think an

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:29.720
expression of the design. I think God's greatest
creation is science and I think that they

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:38.910
will eventually, if humankind is to survive,
that science and religion will be walking

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:44.140
hand in hand. And not even like, side by side,
but we'll see that they're the same thing.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:50.530
I think that ultimately that's what it's about;
that art and science and religion, faith,

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:56.770
are all, they're all one thing. Again, it's
that God essence that flows through all of

00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:05.140
our molecules that seeks to transcend just
this chair, so. Yeah.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:10.840
&gt;&gt;Will: Rainn, your parents were driving.
They had set out on a trip to, we should wrap

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.720
it up and show the trailer with the [inaudible].

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.631
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Oh, ok. Great. One more question
and we'll wrap it up, yeah.

00:43:17.631 --> 00:43:21.260
&gt;&gt;male #10: All right. I can't believe I have
to follow that last question, but so, the

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.090
premise of The Office is that it's this--

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.090
[laughter]

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:29.290
yeah, we're dumbing it down a little bit,
is that this office staff is being filmed

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.480
for this ongoing documentary or reality show?

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yes.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.630
&gt;&gt;male #10: I was just wondering, do the characters
on the show watch this show? And if it hasn't

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.340
been released yet, will they?

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.730
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Yeah, we talk about that a lot on
"The Office". I think that the documentary

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:45.650
crew just has eternal funding and they have--

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.550
[laughter]

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:52.320
two, two camera men and a couple sound guys
and some producers and stuff like that and

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.870
they're just like, "Oh my God, I can't believe
all the gold we're getting on this typical

00:43:55.870 --> 00:44:00.640
American workplace. Let's just keep filming
and filming and filming and filming." And,

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.990
but they did that on the English show, where
on the very tail end of the English show.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:11.020
The documentary on The Office had aired and
they'd all become minor celebrities. We talk

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.220
about heading in that direction in "The Office",
but as soon as you do that, you gotta end

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:18.710
the show. So, I'm not sure exactly when or
how that would happen, but it would be a hell

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:23.350
of a lot of fun. If Dwight Schrute were a
celebrity and you followed Dwight Schrute

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:28.080
around in his life and people were just showing
up at his beet farm asking for autographs

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.690
cause they had watched "The Office" and they
just can't believe that such a person exists,

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:36.111
so it's very metaphysical. It's much like
the "SoulPancake" book.

00:44:36.111 --> 00:44:37.111
[laughter]

00:44:37.111 --> 00:44:44.710
And speaking of that, I hope you'll each pick
up a few dozen copies for stocking stuffers

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:49.000
and let's show that little trailer we made.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.900
&gt;&gt;Will: Do you wanna set it up for them?

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:56.400
&gt;&gt;Rainn: This is a documentary about people
enjoying the "SoulPancake" book.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.730
&gt;&gt;Will: No, I mean could you go back and set
it up for us? Oh, ok.

00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:58.730
[electric guitar plays]

00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:59.730
[humming]

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.730
[applause]

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:01.730
&gt;&gt;Will: All right.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:46:17.160
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Is that it? Who's in charge here?
Is that it?

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160
&gt;&gt;Will: We're good?

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.410
&gt;&gt;Rainn: Larry, Sergey, are we done?

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:20.410
[laughter]

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:24.520
Thank you guys so much for giving up your
lunch period and having me and Will here.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:29.380
His new play of Middletown, is at the Vineyard
Theatre. I'm going tonight. You should all

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:36.030
go see it cause he's an absolutely genius
playwright of the first rank and order and

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:42.010
your children will be performing scenes in
drama class from Will Eno plays, so get to

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:48.801
know him now. Tear off a chunk of his sweater
and thank you very much for having me.

00:46:48.801 --> 00:46:49.810
[applause]
