00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.830
NARRATOR: Before another day
comes to an end on Oak Island,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.380
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
and their partner Craig Tester

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.460
gather in the war room with
other members of their team

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.710
for a much anticipated meeting.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.210
Guys, this is the part
of the war room meetings

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.540
I really like.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.880
We've got some
information, some results

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.920
coming in on dendrochronology.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.080
It's specific, it's to the wood
we took out of Smith's Cove.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.750
I believe we sent samples
of the U-shaped structure,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.830
the L-shaped structure,
some of the walls that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.580
were more dimensional lumber.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.750
So Professor Colin Laroque with
the University of Saskatchewan

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.000
has analyzed everything.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.420
And Jack, he's standing by.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.540
Can you get him
up on the screen?

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.920
Sure.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.040
RICK LAGINA: Colin!

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.210
How are you, sir?
- Good.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.080
How are you guys?
- Good.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.380
Good, thank you.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.250
We're looking forward
to the results.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.170
MAN: That's quite
a significant wall.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.830
This is totally undiscovered.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.920
NARRATOR: Over the
past three months

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.750
the Oak Island
team has unearthed

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.750
numerous mysterious
wooden structures

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.380
buried as much as 10
feet beneath the seabed

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.790
at Smith's Cove.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.540
In addition to finding the U
and L-shaped structures first

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.790
discovered by Dan
Blankenship in the 1970s,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.380
the team uncovered the
remains of a massive slipway

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.380
or shipping ramp.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.580
With each new discovery,
the Oak Island team

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.620
extracted wood samples
for scientific testing

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.920
in the hopes of obtaining
reliable dates as to when

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.290
they were constructed.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.620
These samples were then sent to
Dr. Colin Laroque, a professor

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.290
of dendrochronology
and climate science

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.380
at the University
of Saskatchewan.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.210
CRAIG TESTER: Why don't you
go through sample by sample

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.960
and give me the date?

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.580
COLIN LAROQUE: OK.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.330
Sample 7, That was one of
our more confident samples.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.670
CRAIG TESTER: Sample
number 7 is the slipway.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.000
It's the north arm
on the east end.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.330
So the slipway.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
It was, we believe, red spruce.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
It's reminiscent to
some of the samples

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.830
we did in other
areas of Halifax.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.170
We had a fairly strong
date on and that's 1771.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.080
Wow.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.120
Predates the money pit.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.790
Yep.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.670
Wow.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.000
That's really cool.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.250
Yeah.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.790
The two that
are coming up next

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.960
are actually some of
the biggest samples.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.460
Sample 8 and sample
9, we call them.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.000
CRAIG TESTER: Sample number 8
is the U-shaped shaped structure

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.580
and sample number
9 is another piece

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.500
of the U-shaped structure.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.170
So for both
samples we had 1769.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.120
Wow.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.380
This is quite impressive.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.290
I mean, that's huge.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.040
Yeah.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.210
We could pretty much be sure
that all that work in Smith's

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:49.380
Cove occurred in about 1770.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.540
That's pretty amazing.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.830
Yeah.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.380
Well, if we can
find more of that wood

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.380
from the money pit that
dates to that same era then

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.710
we'll have a bullseye.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.380
Yes.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.500
And it ties in.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.210
Yeah.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.330
Hey, Colin.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.290
How accurate of a
list do you have

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.710
that you can compare it to?

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.380
Right.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.920
The one red spruce chronology
that we were using, which

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.580
is about a 550-year-old
tree that is still growing,

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.540
and it matches with that.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.250
So something like sample
8 we're at probably 99.999

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.830
sure that it sort of
ends in that 1770 time.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.920
Wow.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.750
This is big.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.500
Oh yeah.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500
In these kind of things they
tend to answer one question

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.080
and raise two or three others.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.580
What a shock that is.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.540
[laughter]

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.420
COLIN LAROQUE: I think so.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.210
Great work.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.420
I love the 99.99.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.250
We don't we don't get
that ever, so thanks

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.920
for being in on the quest.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.670
You're welcome.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.500
All right, Colin.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.920
Thank you very much.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920
We will be in touch,
really appreciate it.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.290
Excellent report, thank you.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.040
Thank you.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.750
You're welcome.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.920
Take care guys.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.920
I believe that
we have just found

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.960
conclusive proof that not
everything we're finding

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.710
is searcher, OK?

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.420
Yeah.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.960
Yeah.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.960
For me this is the biggest
thing that's happened

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.960
since we started this quest.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.290
It's amazing.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.960
I was about to say
direct, turned to him

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.040
and say, look, it's time
to turn this island over

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.290
from the archaeologists to
the psychiatrists because--

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.250
[chuckles]

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.750
The first time I heard--

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.920
--because this isn't
making any sense.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.080
And then at the 11th
hour we find out

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.620
something very significant
happened here 25 to 30 years

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.580
prior to the discovery
of the money pit,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.000
and it's in Smith's Cove.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.170
To me that's gigantic.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.580
Well, I have to say I'm
impressed with this.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.000
I'm happy that
you're impressed.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.170
I am impressed!

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.920
Let's go.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.330
OK.
