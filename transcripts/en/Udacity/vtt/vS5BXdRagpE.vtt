00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.627
So far our programs always do the same thing. I mean when when we run it a

00:00:03.627 --> 00:00:05.755
second time, it does exactly what it did before.

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:09.240
&gt;&gt; I don't get it. We just learned about reading input. When you run the program

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.770
again with different inputs, it'll do something different.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.190
&gt;&gt; That's not exactly what I mean. Whenever I run the program again, it runs exact

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.760
same lines of code. What if I only want to add a friend if the friend's not

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.900
already there?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.538
&gt;&gt; I think the time has come to, to learn about programming decisions. Then your

00:00:24.538 --> 00:00:28.216
program can take different actions depending on circumstances. For example, you

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:30.988
could skip the lines of code that do the adding if the friend's already in the

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:34.699
list. That's exactly what I want, let's do that.
