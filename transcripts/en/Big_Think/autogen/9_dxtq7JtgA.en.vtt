on using techniques from what are called
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.030
on using techniques from what are called
the formal methods communities so

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
the formal methods communities so
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.070
the formal methods communities so
techniques based on math more or less to

with proofs that the software had
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.460
with proofs that the software had
certain desirable properties that it

that there were no bugs and certain
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.960
that there were no bugs and certain
kinds of certain kinds of bugs in the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829
operator so they're trying to hack in
 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.559
operator so they're trying to hack in
take over control disrupt the operation

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569
take over control disrupt the operation
 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.440
take over control disrupt the operation
of the helicopter so in this setting the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450
of the helicopter so in this setting the
 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.270
of the helicopter so in this setting the
red team was allowed to have root access

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280
red team was allowed to have root access
 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.759
red team was allowed to have root access
so unfettered access within the camera

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769
so unfettered access within the camera
 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.089
so unfettered access within the camera
partition and charged with break out of

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099
partition and charged with break out of
 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.830
partition and charged with break out of
this take over control the rest of the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840
this take over control the rest of the
 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.390
this take over control the rest of the
helicopter disrupt the operation of the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400
helicopter disrupt the operation of the
 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.189
helicopter disrupt the operation of the
helicopter in any way corrupt the

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199
helicopter in any way corrupt the
 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.930
helicopter in any way corrupt the
messages to the ground station basically

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
messages to the ground station basically
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.059
messages to the ground station basically
interfere in any way you can with the

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069
interfere in any way you can with the
 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.059
interfere in any way you can with the
legitimate operation of this helicopter

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069
legitimate operation of this helicopter
 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.890
legitimate operation of this helicopter
the red team had no full access to the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900
the red team had no full access to the
 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.030
the red team had no full access to the
source code they understood all the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
source code they understood all the
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.589
source code they understood all the
design documents they knew as much about

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599
design documents they knew as much about
 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.710
design documents they knew as much about
the system as you could reasonably

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720
the system as you could reasonably
 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.599
the system as you could reasonably
expect to know and after six weeks they

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609
expect to know and after six weeks they
 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.580
expect to know and after six weeks they
were not able to break out they were not

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590
were not able to break out they were not
 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.080
were not able to break out they were not
able to disrupt the operation of the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090
able to disrupt the operation of the
 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.659
able to disrupt the operation of the
copter at all all they could do was they

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669
copter at all all they could do was they
 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.159
copter at all all they could do was they
can fork bomb themselves they could

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169
can fork bomb themselves they could
 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.289
can fork bomb themselves they could
basically crash their own process but

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299
basically crash their own process but
 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.670
basically crash their own process but
the rest of the helicopter would then

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680
the rest of the helicopter would then
 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.469
the rest of the helicopter would then
notice that that process was crashed and

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479
notice that that process was crashed and
 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.330
notice that that process was crashed and
restarted again restoring the operation

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340
restarted again restoring the operation
 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.000
restarted again restoring the operation
of that the camera so that's an example

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010
of that the camera so that's an example
 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.409
of that the camera so that's an example
of where you could use the formal

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419
of where you could use the formal
 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.119
of where you could use the formal
methods based techniques to create this

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129
methods based techniques to create this
 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.710
methods based techniques to create this
kind of thin level at the bottom which

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720
kind of thin level at the bottom which
 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.629
kind of thin level at the bottom which
was the SEO for microkernel and then

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639
was the SEO for microkernel and then
 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.099
was the SEO for microkernel and then
leverage that to produce sort of the

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109
leverage that to produce sort of the
 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.020
leverage that to produce sort of the
full functionality of the helicopter and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
full functionality of the helicopter and
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.550
full functionality of the helicopter and
they you know the camera functionality

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560
they you know the camera functionality
 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.710
they you know the camera functionality
might come and go as hackers break in or

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
might come and go as hackers break in or
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.539
might come and go as hackers break in or
don't break in but you're guaranteed

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549
don't break in but you're guaranteed
 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.219
don't break in but you're guaranteed
that the helicopter will be still able

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229
that the helicopter will be still able
 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.870
that the helicopter will be still able
to communicate to the ground station and

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880
to communicate to the ground station and
 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.200
to communicate to the ground station and
fly appropriately

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210
fly appropriately
 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.450
fly appropriately
