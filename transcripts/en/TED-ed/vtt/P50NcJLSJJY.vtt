00:00:06.552 --> 00:00:08.950
Do you ever struggle to find the perfect description

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.881
when trying to convey an idea?

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:12.199
Like a foggy picture,

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.336
adjectives and modifiers fail to depict

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:15.828
what's in your mind.

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:18.700
Illustrators often face a similar challenge,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.369
especially when attempting to explain

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.749
complex and difficult concepts.

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:24.752
Sometimes the imagery is intangible

00:00:24.752 --> 00:00:28.355
or way too complicated to explain with a picture.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:31.381
Although complex information could be relayed

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.118
using charts and stats,

00:00:33.118 --> 00:00:34.895
this could get pretty boring.

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.999
Instead, just like when writing an essay

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:39.309
to describe, for example, emotions,

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.853
illustrators can use visual metaphors

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:44.321
to bring to life difficult concepts.

00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:46.449
Just as a written metaphor is a description

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.399
that relates one object to another,

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.123
a visual metaphor uses imagery to suggest

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:54.890
a particular association or point of similarity.

00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:01.243
Our lesson "Big Data" is a great example

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:03.466
of a situation where visual metaphors

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.328
played a huge role in explaining the concept.

00:01:06.328 --> 00:01:09.039
What is Big Data in the first place?

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.544
Good question!

00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:13.301
Big Data is a huge amount of digital information

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:15.968
produced worldwide on a daily basis,

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:17.918
challenging us to find solutions

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:18.673
for storing,

00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:19.415
analyzing,

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:22.001
and also imagining it visually.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.082
Quite an elusive concept!

00:01:24.082 --> 00:01:26.070
How should we depict this?

00:01:30.224 --> 00:01:32.229
Let's take a look at our "Big Data" script.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.615
We start with smaller computer servers

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:36.282
that branch out into bigger networks

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:37.487
to produce data,

00:01:37.487 --> 00:01:38.850
then even bigger networks

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.153
and production of even more data.

00:01:41.153 --> 00:01:42.673
You see where we're going with this --

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:45.839
an object growing and branching out in many directions

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.120
and producing something as a result?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.651
Does that remind you of something?

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.547
Just like those computer networks,

00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:53.731
a tree grows and branches out

00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:56.758
to produce more leaves each year.

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:58.702
And every year, just as the data accumulates

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.011
and faces us with a challenge

00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:01.689
to find storage solutions,

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.767
it gets harder to collect those piles of leaves

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:05.819
when they fall off the tree.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.915
Aha! There's our visual metaphor!

00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:13.649
Okay, so we have the script,

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:14.231
audio,

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:15.738
and a visual metaphor.

00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:17.543
The next step in visual development

00:02:17.543 --> 00:02:18.819
is to design the characters

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.796
and environments of the animation.

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:22.044
To do so, we think

00:02:22.044 --> 00:02:23.800
of an appropriate and appealing style

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.960
to illustrate the ideas

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.925
and help the viewer better understand

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:28.475
what they're hearing.

00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:29.779
Let's go back to the script

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.201
and see if we can find any clues there.

00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:34.507
Our story starts in the 1960s

00:02:34.507 --> 00:02:36.809
when the first computer networks were built.

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.616
This decade will serve as a good point

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:41.147
to make the stylistic choice for our animation

00:02:41.147 --> 00:02:43.195
as it will allow us to refer to artwork

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.569
from that era.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.271
You may want to start

00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:46.604
by looking at some art books

00:02:46.604 --> 00:02:49.675
(design, illustrations, cartoons, etc.)

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:50.854
from that era

00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:53.435
and find a style that may our own purpose.

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:54.272
Look closely,

00:02:54.272 --> 00:02:55.156
study the material,

00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:56.630
and try to understand the choices

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.740
artists of that time made and why.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.207
For example, the 1960s minimalist animation style

00:03:03.207 --> 00:03:04.585
was a significant departure

00:03:04.585 --> 00:03:06.201
from the cinematic realism

00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:08.791
that was popular in animated films at the time.

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:11.093
The choice to use limited animation techniques

00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:13.760
was originally made for budgetary reasons,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.344
but it became a signature style

00:03:15.344 --> 00:03:18.962
that influenced many future generations of animators.

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:20.459
In this stylistic approach,

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.143
the simplified characters,

00:03:22.143 --> 00:03:23.127
flat backgrounds,

00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:25.142
and angular shapes come together

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:28.053
to create new interpretations of reality,

00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:29.628
which also sounds like a good place

00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:32.862
to begin visualizing our own Big Data.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:40.041
Well, let's try an experiment.

00:03:40.994 --> 00:03:43.496
"In the 1980s islands of similar networks

00:03:43.496 --> 00:03:44.909
speaking different dialects

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.161
sprung up all over Europe and the States,

00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:50.619
making remote access possible but tortuous."

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:51.744
Is this better?

00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:54.079
"In the 1980s islands of similar networks

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.400
speaking different dialects

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.830
sprung up all over Europe and the States,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.944
making remote access possible but tortuous.

00:04:00.944 --> 00:04:03.046
To make it easy for our physicists across the world

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:05.571
to access the ever-expanding Big Data

00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:07.413
stored at CERN without traveling,

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:08.823
the networks needed to be talking

00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:10.461
with the same language."

00:04:10.461 --> 00:04:11.576
As you probably observed,

00:04:11.576 --> 00:04:13.637
graphic representations are a great way

00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:15.681
to capture the interest of your audience.

00:04:15.681 --> 00:04:18.233
By depicting what you want to present and explain

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:20.188
with strong, memorable visuals,

00:04:20.188 --> 00:04:22.808
you can communicate your idea more effectively.

00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:24.358
So, now, challenge yourself.

00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:26.076
Think of an abstract concept

00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:28.444
that cannot be explained with simple words.

00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:29.609
Go ahead and try your hand

00:04:29.609 --> 00:04:31.780
at visually developing that idea.
