00:00:00.296 --> 00:00:01.576
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.576 --> 00:00:05.419
is some examples converting
between liters and milliliters

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.080
and just as a reminder,
milli means one-thousandth

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.817
so a milliliter is
one-thousandth of a liter,

00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:14.957
or another way to think about it,

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:17.457
one liter is 1000 milliliters.

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:23.989
So given that, how many
milliliters would seven liters be?

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.233
Pause the video and think about that.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:29.129
Well if one liter is 1000 milliliters,

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:33.298
then seven liters would
be 7000 milliliters.

00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:34.972
And what about 18 liters?

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:36.699
Pause the video and think about it.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.866
Well that would be 18,000 milliliters.

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:44.676
So however many liters you've got

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:47.563
it would be a thousand
times as many milliliters

00:00:47.563 --> 00:00:51.760
because each milliliter is
one-thousandth of a liter.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.861
Let's do some more examples.

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:58.026
So here it says blank
milliliters equals 15 liters.

00:00:58.026 --> 00:01:01.268
Pause the video again, see
if you can figure this out.

00:01:01.268 --> 00:01:05.271
Well remember, every liter
is a thousand milliliters.

00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:08.688
So 15 liters would be 15,000 milliliters.

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:13.653
Remember, if you have a smaller unit,

00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:15.979
and here you're smaller
by a factor of a thousand,

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.054
the number that you would need of it

00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:20.917
to have the same as a
large unit would be larger.

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:22.799
So you have a smaller unit,

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.941
so you have a larger number here.

00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:27.582
Let's do one more example.

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:30.845
Compare using greater than,
less than, or equal to.

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:35.466
So nine liters, how does that
compare to 90 milliliters?

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:39.500
Pause this video and try
to answer it for yourself.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.548
Well how many milliliters is nine liters?

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:47.372
Nine liters is the same
thing as 9,000 milliliters

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:50.196
and 9,000 milliliters is clearly

00:01:50.196 --> 00:01:52.529
greater than 90 milliliters.

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:55.661
So what you want to do
in a problem like this

00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:57.508
is convert both to milliliters.

00:01:57.508 --> 00:02:00.427
9,000 milliliters, that's
what nine liters is,

00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:03.086
that's 9,000 milliliters,
that's going to be

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.419
greater than 90 milliliters.
