00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.570
Okay, so now we've done some research so
we can finalize our marketing plans.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.039
&gt;From lesson one we already know our
audience is dog owners who travel.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.990
We've chosen a persona to focus on, we
completed our competitive analysis and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.290
our value proposition so we know how
to position ourselves in the market.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.280
And now we know our
distribution plan and

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.090
the keywords we're planning on using.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.190
We've done a great job so far,
and now we're ready to move on to

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.510
actually creating the materials
we're going to need for launch.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.180
First, we'll need to create our landing
page, create our app store listing, and

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.260
then do some beta testing.
