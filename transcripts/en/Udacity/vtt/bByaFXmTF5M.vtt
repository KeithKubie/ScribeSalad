[Evans] A word is just something that has meaning

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that speakers of the language will understand.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We could define words as just what's in the dictionary,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and then there would be a clear answer for that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But certainly there are lots of things that are words that aren't in the dictionary.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the important thing about words is we have rules for making new words.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For example, we have a rule that says if we have a word,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we can make a new word by adding counter in front of the old word.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm using the same notation that we used back in Unit 1.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is the BNF replacement grammar.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you need a refresher on this, please go back to the video that introduced that in Unit 1.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But the basic property is that we can replace what's on the left side

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
with what's on the right side.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So any time we have a word, we can replace it with counter-word,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and the meaning of the new word is something that goes against the original word.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So if we started with the word intelligence--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and I mean this in the sense of spycraft, not in terms of smarts--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
then we can use the rule.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We could make the word counter-intelligence.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Intelligence was a word. We added counter in front of it to make counter-intelligence.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That means trying to thwart intelligence from the enemy.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We can use the rule again.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So now this is a word, and we could replace this word with counter in front of that word.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We get counter-counter-intelligence,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and that would be trying to thwart the enemy's counter-intelligence

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that's preventing you from getting intelligence.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And we could keep doing that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We could have counter-counter-counter-intelligence and so forth.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
These are words that once we get up to at least 3 counters

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
it's not something that's used before, but it's still something that has a sensible meaning.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We could do this for other words.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:58.000
We saw that one of the very long words was this hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
If you knew that this word meant fear of long words,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and even if you've never seen the word counter in front of that before,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:23.000
now we can make the new word counter-hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Quite a mouthful.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But even though you've never seen that word before--

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and I expect most of you have never seen that word before--

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
you could guess that this is something that goes against the fear of long words.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Maybe there's some new medication that cures people of this phobia.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You could also figure out if there was a counter-counter-hippo and so forth phobia,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that would be something that counteracts the counter-hippo,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and that might be something where this new drug doesn't work if you have too much coffee.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Then coffee would be a counter-counter-hippo so forth phobia.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So the point is, because English has this rule that allows us to make new words

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
from old words, there's no such thing as the longest word.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
We could always make a longer word starting from any word that we have.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If you remember how BNF grammars work,

00:03:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
then you should be able to answer the next quiz.
