1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,200
That there's no warrant for that
from the psychological community.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,440
So anyways, I got up at two in the
morning and made these videos. I thought,

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,260
well, let's see what happens if I
make these videos. It's like, well,

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,970
this is back to the technology issue.

5
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:15,690
It's like I didn't know what YouTube
was when I put my videos on it.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,990
You didn't know what YouTube
was. Well, you know what I,

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,140
no one knows what YouTube is.
That would be the thing. Well,

8
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:24,020
look at what happened to
you. You have a million,

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,550
billion and a half downloads a year.

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,250
It's like you're definitely
riding a giant wave.

11
00:00:28,251 --> 00:00:32,480
Like would have you predicted
this 15 years ago? No. So,

12
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:35,240
so you know you're in the right place
in the right time and you're a very

13
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:38,150
interesting interviewer because
while, especially for long form,

14
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:42,170
because you're very, very curious,

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,120
but also very, very tough.

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,540
Like it's interesting watching you
because if you don't understand something,

17
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:51,050
you will go after the person and you're
not doing it in a vindictive way,

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,700
but you're quite formidable interviewer.

19
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,400
And I've been trying to figure
out why you're so successful.

20
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,310
And like you're a lot smarter
than anyone might think,

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,480
which is quite interesting.

22
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:03,260
So you're a weird combination because
you know your persona doesn't shout

23
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:04,190
intellectual,

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,880
but you're damn smart and you're tough
as a bloody boat and you ask really pop

25
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,530
provocative questions and not because
you're provocative and so your personality

26
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,630
in this long form seem to
suit each other really well.

27
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:17,990
You're also really good at pursuing
things you don't understand instead of

28
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:19,610
assuming that you know
what you're talking about.

29
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,540
So you take the listeners on a journey,
right? It's an exploratory journey,

30
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,990
but fundamentally what's propelled you
to superstardom in some sense is not just

31
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:30,710
your ability, which is nontrivial,

32
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:34,100
but the fact that you're on this giant
technological wave and you're one of the

33
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:36,770
first adopters. And I'm
in the same situation.

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,800
We're first adopters of technology.

35
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,830
That's as revolutionary as
the Gutenberg printing press.

36
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,910
And so that's all unfolding in real time.
It's like, look at what's happening.

37
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,780
Yeah, well the spoken word is now
as powerful as the written word.

38
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,210
That's never happened
before in human history.

39
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,000
And we're on the cutting edge
of that for better or worse.

40
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,060
That's a very good way to put it.
The spoken word is just power. Yeah.

41
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:00,380
And maybe even more so. Well,

42
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:03,830
he's so accessible to people that don't
have the time to read well or stuck in

43
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:07,160
traffic or, or, and here's
another possibility,

44
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,780
maybe 10 times as many people can listen
to complex information as can read

45
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:16,370
complex information in terms
of their ability to process it.

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,340
Sure could easily, we don't know.
Maybe it's, maybe it's the same.

47
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:23,180
Certainly easier to listen to a book on
tape for me than it is to read a book.

48
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,300
Yeah. Well, so for us, so the question
is for how many people is that true?

49
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:29,540
And I would say it might be true for
them, for the majority of people.

50
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,550
And then people are
doing hybrids, you know,

51
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,180
so because you can sync your
book with audible, right.

52
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:38,480
So they'll read when they have the time,
but then when they have found time,

53
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,520
which is also a major component of this,

54
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,090
that that's the time when you're driving
or the time when you're doing dishes is

55
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:46,910
now all of a sudden you can educate
yourself during that found time.

56
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,590
This is a big revolution and the
blowing out the bandwidth makes a huge

57
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,780
difference because while we talked
about that at the beginning,

58
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,630
looks like people are more
intelligent than we thought.

59
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,710
And you and I are both in the
rest of this intellectual web.

60
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:03,790
That's kind of what unites us say is
everybody has an independent platform.

61
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,240
Virtually everybody, they have
an idiosyncratic viewpoint.

62
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,110
They're interested in having discussions
and pursuing the furtherance of their

63
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,140
knowledge, even though they might
have a priori ideological commitments.

64
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:17,770
Sam does. And I suppose I do, and
and Ben Shapiro certainly does,

65
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,060
but they're still interested in having
the discussion. But more importantly,

66
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,680
they're capitalizing on the long form.

67
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,460
And the fact that that's possible is
a reflection of this technological

68
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:32,170
transformation and the technological
transformation might be utterly profound.

69
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,410
It looks like it. And so that's, you know,

70
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,600
I've been trying to sort this
out because I keep thinking,

71
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,300
why the hell are these people coming to
listen to what I'm saying? It's like,

72
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,450
well I'm a guru. You know, I'm a
Sage. It's something like that.

73
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,030
It's like don't be thinking that first.

74
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,140
Think if there's situational
determinants first.

75
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,190
Take your damn personality out of
it. Okay. What's going on? Oh yes.

76
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,280
This is all fostered by YouTube
and fostered by podcasts.

77
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,270
What's so new about that?
No bandwidth restrictions,

78
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,340
no barrier to entrance,

79
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,750
possibility of dialogue because people
cut up the YouTube videos into chunks and

80
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:11,380
make their own comments on. It's a
whole new communication technology.

81
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,370
Also a lack of interference by executives
and producers and all these different

82
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:19,300
people that have their own bias.
Yeah. So unmediated as giant. Yeah.

83
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,470
Yeah. Well and that's all part.

84
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,230
Part of the reason you're so popular
too is like you just put this on like,

85
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:29,210
so you've got exactly the right
balance of ah, competent production.

86
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,500
Cause there's nothing access
about it. Like it's competent,

87
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,920
but no more than that. I know that's
by design, but you also don't edit it.

88
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:40,130
It's like what you see is what you get.
It's like everyone's relieved by that.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,720
We could make our own damn decisions

90
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,240
do. I think that's very important.

91
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,760
If you're going to have a conversation
with someone that's honest,

92
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,450
you can't decide what to leave in
and what to take out and it's just,

93
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,420
well, that's partly also why I
deal with the press the way I do.

94
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,550
If I'm going to have a full conversation,

95
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,890
it's like I'm willing to take the hits and

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,250
I understand what you're saying,

97
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:02,190
but that's one of the reasons why it
frustrates me so much is that I see what

98
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,310
they're doing and I'm like,
what you're doing is ancient.

99
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,880
What you're doing is it's, it's,
this is what people did 20 years ago,

100
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:12,990
30 years ago. You can't really do that
anymore. You can't misrepresent people.

101
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,730
You used to be able to,
if you were in the press,

102
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,150
you could take people quote amount of
context, do whatever the fuck you wanted,

103
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,610
put an article about them and they
couldn't do a God damn thing about it.

104
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,540
It happened to me in 19. Boy,

105
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,870
it was like 99. I did a,

106
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:31,620
a con I had a comedy CD that came out
and this woman wrote an article about it

107
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:36,030
and it just, she just lied.
She lied about my perspective.

108
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:39,720
She lied about the bits.
She misquoted the bits.

109
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,000
She didn't just paraphrase them.

110
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,930
She changed what the bits
were to make them, you know,

111
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,320
massage NIST or hateful
or whatever it was.

112
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,130
And in doing so, I, there was no recourse.

113
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,410
There was nothing that I could
do about that. I'm like, wow,

114
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,830
I'd never experienced that
before. I like, this is stunning.

115
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,370
And then I found out this person did
that a lot and this is what she did.

116
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,170
And there's ultimate power that comes
with being the person who has the pen and

117
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:07,010
being the person who has
the typewriter and you, you,

118
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,540
you're the person who works for, you know,

119
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:12,950
the Boston globe or whatever the
publication is that that is, uh,

120
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,290
something that existed forever, you know,

121
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:20,120
and that you had to be either a friend
of the press, you had to play ball,

122
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,190
you had to, you had a bend to their will.

123
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,350
You had to do what they wanted you to do,

124
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,800
and they could misrepresent you and
choose to paint you in any way they like.

125
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,380
And it's one of the reasons why
I don't do anything anymore.

126
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,330
I don't do any interviews
anymore. I don't do anything.

127
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,720
I don't want to do anything because I do
enough. Man, you want to know about me?

128
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,800
It fucking, there's a thousand podcasts.
There's more than a thousand. There's,

129
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,150
I think there's, there's 1100 and
there's a bunch of other ones too. Right.

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,800
Let's just, it's, it
doesn't make any sense.

131
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,260
Yeah. Well that, that, that,

132
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,420
that it may also be the position
that I increasingly find myself in.

133
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,630
I think it's the right position because
then the misrepresentations don't exist

134
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:59,650
anymore. So then the only problem is
the dispute over the actual ideological

135
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,680
conversations or the, the,
the, the actual concept.

136
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,270
But you know, the thing is, you know,

137
00:07:04,271 --> 00:07:07,450
you made a point there that's quite
interesting is like we are in a new media

138
00:07:07,451 --> 00:07:10,060
landscape. So now if
someone comes out as a,

139
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,450
as a media figure with some institutional
credibility and misrepresents,

140
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,430
it's exposed.

141
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,990
And so then the question is how much
risk should you shoulder to expose the

142
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,300
proclivity for media misrepresentation?

143
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,710
And the answer to that might be some
now it might be moving, you know,

144
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:31,150
maybe I've done enough of that.

145
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,590
I mean it would be easier for me in many
ways if I just stopped doing it. But,

146
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,080
but there's some utility in
having it play out. And so while,

147
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:41,950
so I'm trying to, I'm,

148
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,130
I'm trying to only take
those opportunities that
appear to have more benefit

149
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,200
than risk. And when I defining benefit,

150
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,440
well the question is then
what constitutes benefit?

151
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,920
And I guess what constitutes benefit is
while that would further the attempts

152
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:05,360
that I making to bring information
to a vast number of people that could

153
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:09,590
conceivably help them stabilize
and improve their individual lives,

154
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:11,150
that's worth a certain amount of risk.

155
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,260
Well it certainly increases your
profile, increases your profile.

156
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:17,890
And even if you know you have 60% of
these people are going to get a bad

157
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:20,650
perception of you, 40% of these
people that never heard of you,

158
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,800
now we're going to understand who you are
because they do further investigation.

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,100
Yeah. So there's some benefit in
that. But the negative, I mean I've,

160
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
I get text messages from random people
that I was friends with years ago.

161
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,180
They'd say this Jordan Peterson is just
such a lying sack of shit and he's this

162
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:37,900
now. Like I don't even know who the fuck
you are. And then second of all like,

163
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,570
why are you contacting me?
You're not even saying hi.

164
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,200
You're saying Jordan
Peterson is a, is a this,

165
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,720
he's a scam artist. He's a fraud.
He's at the end. I'm like wow.

166
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,950
And so they'll see an interview, you
know like the, the Jim Jefferies clip,

167
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,710
which is a minute long, or it is,

168
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,860
or the vice piece or the initial Cathy
Newman piece and they just form this

169
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,630
determined position on you and
then read hit pieces on you.

170
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,330
And then this is where they take their
opinion of this is where it's from and

171
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,170
it's, I,

172
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,390
I feel like these are the last gasps
of a dying medium. I really do. I just,

173
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:22,380
I think too, I don't, I don't
think that people appreciate it.

174
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:25,230
I think the people that are listening
to this that do appreciate long form

175
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,020
conversations and with all warts and all,

176
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:33,021
all the ugliness and the mistakes and
the critical errors and the people that

177
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:35,130
appreciate that they, they,

178
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,990
they have a real hate for being
lied to. You know, because it's, it,

179
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,550
it changed when,

180
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,120
when you for being treated as if
they're stupid, which they aren't.

181
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,860
Yeah, that's both. It's just, it's,

182
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,860
it's deceptive when you,

183
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,580
when you edit someone and take their
words out of context and change them

184
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:56,750
around, you're being deceptive.

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,830
Didn't. The New York times
did that again this week.

186
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,190
They had some philosophy professor from
Hong Kong university write a piece on me

187
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:05,250
and he took, they quoted
me a was a sentence.

188
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,520
There's like the first phrase was in
quotes and then there were some joining

189
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,400
words and then the second phrase was in
quotes and there were some joining words

190
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:14,880
and then the third phrase was in quotes
and the three quotes added up to a

191
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:18,450
statement that bore no
resemblance whatsoever to what
I was saying. How can they

192
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,680
do that in the New York times?

193
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,160
That seems to me to be something
that should be the the,

194
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,050
I don't think they can, I
don't think they can do,

195
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:29,830
I think they're killing their brand
so fast that they, that they can't,

196
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,400
but it's so disturbing to me as a person
who's been a fan of the New York times

197
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:36,490
forever. I just don't understand
how they could allow that to happen.

198
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,670
How could you allow your, what? What is

199
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,250
gold standard for journalism?

200
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,590
How could you allow it to become something
that willfully misrepresent someone?

201
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, they never did to push an idea.

202
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,910
It never did put my book on the
New York times bestseller list,

203
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,080
which quite comical. How's that
possible? Oh, they have rules,

204
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:58,080
which they don't disclose, but
one of them apparently is, well,

205
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:00,900
if the book is published in Canada
and distributed in the United States,

206
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:01,800
then it doesn't count.

207
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,860
Even though they've had books like that
on the New York times bestseller list

208
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:08,520
before. And I think, okay, well is
this bad or good? It's like, well,

209
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:12,210
it's bad because to the degree that I
might want to be on the New York times

210
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:14,630
bestseller list, although I
haven't been losing any sleep over,

211
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,520
but you're selling, I know how
many books are selling. Yeah.

212
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:21,030
It's basically been the best selling book
in the world since January. You know,

213
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:22,410
it's gone up and down to some degree,

214
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:26,160
but fundamentally it should be the number
one New York times bestselling book.

215
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,260
So they, they, they, they
have their reasons and,

216
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,210
but I look at that and I think, Oh,

217
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:33,540
well you can only do that 10
times until you're done. Like,

218
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,110
because it's a fatal error. You have
the gold standard for measurement.

219
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,600
You're not measuring properly, you're
burning up your brand. You think,

220
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,390
well we're the New York times so we
can burn up our brand. It's like,

221
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,580
no you can't. Newsweek is gone.

222
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,360
Time magazine is a shallow sh
is a shell of its former self.

223
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,300
Like the big things disappear and they
disappear when they get crooked and

224
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:56,560
ideologically rigid.

225
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,060
And so that's what's happening at the New
York times and not with everyone there

226
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:05,080
but with plenty of them. And it'll
die faster than people think.

227
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,970
But it's so confusing to me
that he didn't use to be that.

228
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,440
Yup. And now it is.

229
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:15,940
And they just responding to this new
world where you have to have clickbait

230
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:17,650
journalism and you know,

231
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,610
some of people are struggling to find
people to actual biophysical newspapers,

232
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:25,330
which is two different things.
Hard to say because maybe, see,

233
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:30,331
it's weird because you don't
have to resort to clickbait
because these long form

234
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:33,110
discussions are the antithesis
of clickbait, right.

235
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,480
That are they struggling in terms of
like how many people buy their newspaper?

236
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,190
Oh absolutely. Every newspaper,

237
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,520
the newspapers in Canada went cap in
hand to the federal government for

238
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:43,091
subsidies.

239
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:47,410
About six months ago because they're
dying so fast and so some of it is they're

240
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,080
being supplanted by technology.
That's a huge part of it.

241
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,960
But as they are supplanted,
they get more desperate.

242
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,280
They publish more polarizing stories that
works in the short term to garner more

243
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:00,880
views. But it alienates people from
the brand and speeds their demise.

244
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,360
Classic death spiral of a
big of a big organization.

245
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,060
And that's going to clean
things out like mad.

246
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:10,720
I mean I don't know where CNN is in the
cable news rankings now our cable show

247
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:15,580
rankings but it keeps falling but it's
falling in the rankings as cable itself

248
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,450
disintegrates and dies. Why
do you need cable TV, right?

249
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,320
No one needs cable T the only people
who have cable TV are the people who fig

250
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,460
haven't figured out yet that you can
replace it entirely online for like one

251
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:29,560
10th the price with with much less hassle.

252
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:33,730
But the IRA is people want a location
they can go to to find out what's going on

253
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:37,300
in the world. And this is the one
thing that they used to represent.

254
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,360
And you know, I mean, I don't
think Fox news is any better.

255
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,810
I think you just have these
ideological extremes left and right.

256
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,020
And I remember very clearly watching the
election coverage before the election,

257
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,590
like leading up to the election, I would
go Fox news and then I'd go see an end.

258
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:57,320
I just would go back and forth of them
on my cable and I would just be laughing.

259
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,530
I'm be like, what is really
happening in the world?

260
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,210
Because I'm getting two different stories.

261
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm getting Russia and I'm getting
Hillary's emails. This is, I mean,

262
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,580
I don't know what the fuck
is, what, what is happening?

263
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,060
I'm getting pussy grabbing
and I'm getting, you know, uh,

264
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,830
Bengazi I'm,

265
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:15,640
this is what I'm getting and I don't
understand like why this is obviously

266
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,740
ideological, this is not just,

267
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,920
it might be that as the
technology is supplanted,

268
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,840
the ideological polarization
increases as the thing dies, right?

269
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,300
They're struggling for
anyone to pay attention.

270
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,250
And this is the way they
have to do it to ensure,

271
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,180
and I think what's happening on the
other side, which is the side you occupy,

272
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:34,451
say,

273
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:39,370
is that a new technology that's long form
that deals with many of those problems

274
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:42,460
is emerging and it's going to
emerge. It's going to be victorious.

275
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,880
But in the mean might already
be victorious in the meantime,

276
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,080
baby stuff still exist in
the digital world. You know,

277
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:52,400
and then you're getting a lot of the
articles that are written about you.

278
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:55,160
People are absorbing these
articles, not from a physical form.

279
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,030
You're getting it from, from digital
yet. Well, okay, so then the sense is,

280
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,470
well, do you have fundamental trust
in the judgment of your fellow man,

281
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,900
let's say? And my answer to that is yes,

282
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:10,730
because although I've been pilloried to
a great degree by the radical types in

283
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:14,780
the commentary at, in, in, in
the classic journalists, um,

284
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,320
though comments with regards to me
on YouTube are 50 to one in my favor.

285
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:24,940
And, and that's even the case when
the ideologues put up videos about me.

286
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,080
They're designed to discredit me, and
I've sold a million and a half books.

287
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,570
It's going to be
published in 40 countries,

288
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,820
and thousands of people
are coming to my lectures.

289
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,230
And so I would say the attempts
to discredit me aren't working.
