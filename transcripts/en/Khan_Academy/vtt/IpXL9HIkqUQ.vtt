00:00:00.853 --> 00:00:02.730
- The bacteria in a Petri dish culture

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.202
are self-duplicating at a rapid pace.

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:07.524
The relationship between
the elapsed time T,

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:09.927
in minutes, and the number
of bacteria, B of T,

00:00:09.927 --> 00:00:13.201
in the Petri dish is modeled
by the following function.

00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.140
And we see it's an exponential model here.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.044
How many bacteria will make up the culture

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:20.085
after 120 minutes?

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.710
So, really they just want to say,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.286
well what is B of 120 going to be?

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:28.649
And so it's going to be 10 times two

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.439
to the 120

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.959
divided by 12th power.

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:37.428
So, this is going to be
equal to 10 times two to the,

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:42.025
120 divided by 12 is, 10th power.

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:45.001
So this is going to be equal to 10 times,

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.891
two to the 10th power is

00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:51.128
1,024.

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:52.551
If you want to verify that,

00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:57.495
you can say, well two to
the 5th is equal to 32,

00:00:57.495 --> 00:00:59.493
and so two to the 10th is going to be

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.851
two to the 5th times two to the 5th.

00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:04.322
And 32 times 32 is...

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:06.489
Let's see, 64. Zero.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:09.659
So, Let's see we're gonna have...

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.936
Sorry, three times 32 is 96.

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:16.119
Let's see you have a four and 12,

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.872
1024.

00:01:17.872 --> 00:01:19.091
So this is gonna be 1024.

00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:20.995
10 times that is going to be equal to

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:23.932
one zero two four zero.

00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:26.264
So, 10,200...

00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:29.648
10,240 bacteria,

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:32.376
and we're done.
