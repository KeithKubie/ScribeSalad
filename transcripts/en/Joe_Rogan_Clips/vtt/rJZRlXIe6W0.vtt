00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.320
Oh,
the Al Gore film is uh,
something that scared a lot of people,

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.370
but it was also very widely dismissed by a lot of other people as well.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.660
How accurate was that movie?

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.790
I think it proved to be too sanguine it like it didn't deal with a lot of

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.220
extreme weather.
I thought that stuff was far away.

6
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.330
And I think this is one of the,

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.450
one of the big shortcomings of most writing about climate,
most

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.040
kind of communication about climate for 25 years is that we were told it was

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:29.364
slow.

10
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.730
We were told it was going to be coming maybe at the scale of centuries,

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.610
something we'd have to worry about for our grandchildren.

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.180
But when you realize that half of all the damage we've done has been done in the

13
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.900
last 30 years and you see already the extreme weather.

14
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.830
We had a global,
he waved last summer,
totally unprecedented.

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.630
People died in Canada.
They died in Russia.
They died in the Middle East.

16
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.700
The same season.
3 million people were evacuated in China from a typhoon,

17
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.520
unprecedented rains in Japan.

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.190
We had multiple hurricanes in the Caribbean all at once.

19
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.830
There was an island in Hawaii,
east island,
a small island,

20
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:09.150
not one that most people have gone to,

21
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.640
but God literally wiped off the map by a hurricane.

22
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.780
They're thinking about inventing a new category of hurricane category six.

23
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.690
All of these impacts,
um,
were,

24
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.160
are coming much faster than scientists predicted even a decade or two ago.

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.850
And so I think the first inconvenient truth is a little too complacent,

26
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.480
but Al Gore is also,
you know,
I know him a little bit.

27
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:34.410
I've talked to him a few times.
He's,
I'm temperamentally,
he's a technocrat,

28
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.580
he's an optimist.

29
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.810
He thinks market forces can solve all this stuff and I don't even totally

30
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:42.750
disagree with him.
Um,
I think that market forces are really powerful.

31
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.170
We've had a huge green energy revolution in the u s that's,
you know,

32
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.570
and had spillover effects elsewhere in the world.

33
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.890
So solar powers now cheaper than anybody expected it would be decade or two ago.

34
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.120
Although it's also the case that we haven't replaced any of our dirty energy

35
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:58.590
with it.
We've just added to our capacity.

36
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:03.540
So the ratio of renewable energy to dirty energy is now the same as it was 40

37
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:07.800
years ago.
We made no progress.
Um,
why is that?
Because we just,

38
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.510
if we're like,
rather than saying,
oh,

39
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:13.350
let's retire this coal plant and replace it with it,
um,
you know,
a wind farm,

40
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.620
we think,
oh,
we'll have the coal plant and the wind farm will have more energy.

41
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.350
You know,
we just grow the pie of energy.
