00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
On TV you hear the term vegetive state and coma and brain death

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
all the time in medical shows. But what do these terms actually mean?

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.600
 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.599
Hey brainiacs, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.580
For non-medical people, the terms “vegetative
state,” “coma,” and “brain dead”

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.119
are used interchangeably, but they’re not
synonymous and there are very important distinctions.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.230
People in a vegetative state still have a
functioning brain stem, meaning their body

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.700
is on autopilot.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.340
They can breathe on their own, have a sleep-wake
cycle, and react to some stimuli.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.210
But they can’t hold a conversation or take
in their environment.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.489
Neurologists define consciousness by wakefulness
and awareness, and people in a vegetative

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.190
state are awake but unaware.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.850
People in a coma, on the other hand, are not
awake or aware.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.359
Comas can happen either if the their cerebral
hemispheres aren’t working or if the Reticular

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.999
Activating System, the part of their brain
stem responsible for wakefulness, is damaged.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.249
They enter a state of deep unconsciousness,
like the most hardcore nap ever taken.

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:06.260
Still under the surface their brain is, at
a minimum, sending out some signals.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.590
It’s possible to recover from a coma into
a vegetative state and then regain awareness.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.860
Unfortunately it’s also possible to progress
from a coma to a state where all neural activity

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.220
ceases and the brain no longer has any input
on the body’s functions.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.219
This is brain death.

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.770
Brain death has another name in the medical
community: death.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.969
Someone in a vegetative state or coma is still
considered alive.

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.719
But brain death is irreversible, so doctors
go through a series of tests known as the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.560
brain death examination before officially
determining that a person is in fact brain

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.560
dead.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.910
These tests look for any brain function, even
the most basic brainstem reflexes.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.289
If the patient fails them, they are legally
dead.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.070
Sure they can have the semblance of life thanks
to life support, which in this context takes

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.590
on an ironic name.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.960
But a brain dead person cannot live long without
assistance.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.140
Pacemaker cells in a person’s heart can
continue to function independent of the brain

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.290
for up to a week, meaning blood keeps pumping.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.670
But the brainstem is responsible for keeping
breathing going.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.470
Even when you’re not thinking about it,
your brain is regulating your breathing, though

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.280
I bet you’re all thinking about it now.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.640
Complete cessation of neural activity means
even that basic function of operating the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.670
lungs stops.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.480
Within minutes CO2 levels in the blood will
be fatal.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.320
A person in a coma would reflexively gasp
for air, but a brain dead person would not.The

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.730
brain regulates a host of other functions
unconsciously too, like body temperature and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.990
blood pressure.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.900
And it is in charge of hormones that control
your metabolism, immune system, and specific

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.760
organs like your kidneys.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.950
Keeping a person’s body going after brain
death requires a ventilator, blankets, and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:44.950
hormones.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.980
That’s a lot of outside effort to handle
the most basic work of meatball between your

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.980
ears.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.540
It makes you appreciate everything that little
guy is up to.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.540
Thanks brain!

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.230
Your brain is pretty vital for that whole
staying alive thing.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.840
So how much of it can you lose and still not
die?

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:18.150
Julian covers just how much of your brain
is expendable here.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.800
What else would you like to know about the
brain?
