00:00:01.181 --> 00:00:03.348
(beeping)

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.210
- Maldonado is a pediatrician

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.740
and the Senior Associate Dean

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.440
for Faculty Development and Diversity,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.820
Professor of Pediatrics and
Health Research and Policy,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.770
and the Chief of the Division

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.150
of Pediatric Infectious
Diseases at Stanford.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.700
We were really fortunate to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000
get Dr. Maldonado to come today

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.330
because she's usually off in some

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.250
distant part of the world

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.380
stamping out infectious diseases

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.380
or creating policy or whatever.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.373
So Dr. Maldonado,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.440
she will be talking about something

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.830
that I really don't
quite understand, SPHERE.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.520
So can you educate us please?

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.353
Thank you.

00:00:59.353 --> 00:01:01.929
- Yes, thank you Lucy,
it's great to see you.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.480
(audience clapping)

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.430
Thank you.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.520
I really wanna thank Lucy

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.270
for being very forward-thinking
about this topic.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.070
It's something that
we're doing at Stanford

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.020
but it's also happening
all over the country now

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.520
and we thought, she thought
it would be a great idea

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.480
for you to hear about some of this,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.420
the area of what we
call precision medicine.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.510
How many people have heard
of precision medicine?

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.773
Okay, how many people know what it means?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.493
Okay.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:38.240
It's a tough situation
and it's a new concept.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.150
I think it's actually
simpler than it sounds

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.060
but I'm going to spend the next 30 minutes

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.260
just giving you a high level overview

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.240
of what it is in a couple slides,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.370
and then specifically showing you

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.320
what we are doing at
Stanford with this area.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.860
Because it's gonna be something that

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.413
I think all of you need to
advocate around and understand.

00:02:04.383 --> 00:02:06.223
So, let me just go back, sorry.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.730
Is this a pointer? Yeah.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.160
This is what our Stanford Medicine,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.130
so we applied to the NIH.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.470
They had a request for applications for

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.140
what was called precision
medicine and health disparities

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.590
and we didn't really
understand that either,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.440
but we put together our own
idea of what we thought it was,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.850
which I'll explain to you.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.880
And we called our center,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.460
because we all like acronyms,
especially Stanford.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.270
We called it SPHERE

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.060
and it stands for
Stanford Precision Health

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.700
for Ethnic and Racial Equity.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.330
Now, I know in this
group we're talking about

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.300
different disparities

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.520
but we thought, well, we'll start

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.860
with racial and ethnic disparities

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.810
but this can apply to disparities
in many different areas.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.980
And so, I will explain this to you.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.290
But first I just wanted to say

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.210
I am an advisor to Pfizer,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.850
I am on the data safety monitoring board

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.350
for a vaccine study,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.160
but otherwise I have no conflicts

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.370
relevant to the topic that
we're discussing today.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.223
And so, when we talk about SPHERE,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.580
the overall concept that we had is

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.550
that we, the idea of and I'll
explain a little bit more

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.950
about personalized medicine,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.807
is really to take large data

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.900
that's available anonymously
and/or with permission

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.030
to really understand giant
high level patterns of disease

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.720
so that we can treat,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.020
we can see those patterns

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.700
and then come focus in
on the individual person.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.180
And rather than just say okay,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.690
if everyone in here
developed a strep throat,

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.220
this is what I'm gonna give you all,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.650
this is the one drug.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.130
Obviously for that we can do it

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.100
but let's just say somebody
had and we've seen this happen.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.720
Someone has cancer

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.550
and they have a particular kind of cancer.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.330
And what we can do now
is we can take some,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.900
in some cases we can
take those tumor cells

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.320
and sequence them, and
look at areas in that tumor

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.900
that are unique to that particular tumor

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.900
that might affect the
treatment that is involved

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.160
for that particular cancer in that person.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.340
That's what precision medicine is about.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.070
Taking the general knowledge

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.010
we have about diseases and health

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.390
and really focus them in on the individual

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.030
so that that person can get treated.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.030
One of my personal
friends had oral cancer,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.000
this was a couple, a few years ago,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.980
able to get that cancer sent
off to some specialized lab,

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.510
they did the sequences, and they realized,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.410
okay, this is the
chemotherapy that won't work

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.950
and here's the one that
will, and he was cured.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.620
Now, he had a lot of money

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.190
and he had the ability to go to find

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.380
all these specialists that
were doing these studies

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.720
that weren't available
to lots of other people.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.680
That's a big disparity already there.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.430
And so, if you can apply
that to other areas,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.210
for example, what about development,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.870
risk for developmental disabilities?

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.940
What if we know that there are certain

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.720
genetic predispositions,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.500
and we can say, this is
what you should be doing

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.460
if you're planning to have a child

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.500
or if your child, you had a child

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.590
and that child had issues or et cetera,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.150
how do you know that you may be at risk

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.040
for particular manifestations

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.520
that we can try to prevent in XYZ manner.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.670
This is really taking this
vast broad array of knowledge

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.850
and applying it to the individual,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.830
and the ideas that eventually

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.110
your own physician, your
own health care provider

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.260
or your own practice
may be able to give you

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.640
information that you can
follow to help you understand

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.350
how your own genetic information

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.180
or your own environmental information

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.129
affects the way that
your health will play out

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.990
over the short term and the long term.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.800
The other area there that's
important is to understand that

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.140
we all, I don't know if
you've talked about this today

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.500
or in other discussions

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.160
but we know now that only
about 20% to 40% of our health

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.170
in our long lifespan
is really dependent on

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.180
genetic and medical factors.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.880
It turns out that 60% or
more of our health outcomes

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.100
are dependent on environmental factors.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.590
And so if we understand

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.060
the impact of the environmental factors

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.240
on the genetic predispositions

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.130
that actually is going to go a long way

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.120
to helping us live longer healthier lives

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.260
or to treat diseases.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.280
So that's really the
broad base understanding.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.330
And so, we were focusing on
racial and ethnic disparities

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.530
primarily because the NIH wanted us

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.440
to focus in that area

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.030
and we thought okay Stanford has

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.520
all of this great experience
in genetics, genomics,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.160
we can do all of these very
detailed lab based programs

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.930
but how do we translate that
into health in human beings

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.420
and people in the real world,

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.530
and people who actually
have less access to care?

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.710
And so that's where we pulled
the two communities together.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.970
So this program now,
we're in our second year

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.540
and it's a $12 million grant

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.640
and we are focusing on identifying

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.330
genetic and biological markers

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.210
that we can use to help reduce disease

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.130
in minority populations in the US,

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.000
and I'll tell you
specifically how we're doing.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.250
Now we're just one of about 12 centers,

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.490
other centers around the country

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.110
are focusing on different aspects

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.780
but they're all working
with minority populations

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.360
in order to try to understand

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.780
how we can reduce diseases
in these populations.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.970
So we're trying to develop
first of all the analytic tools

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.230
to understand how to look at this data.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.990
We're talking about very large data sets.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.270
For example, genetic
sequences are run into the

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.950
hundreds and thousands and millions,

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.160
and how do you take
all those sequence data

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.740
from many people and try
to understand patterns.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.840
And we're still trying to understand

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.240
at a national and international level

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.260
what kinds of analytic
tools we need to develop

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.370
to be able to do that.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.380
It's kind of like looking
at the earth from space

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:16.870
and seeing the big picture

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.260
but when you're sitting here in this room

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.200
you really don't know where you are.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.580
We need to have that very
high level analytic capacity

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.050
to be able to look at a gene.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.720
The earth is a gene say

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.630
and say, oh look this part of the gene

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.487
regulates this and this
part regulates that,

00:08:31.487 --> 00:08:33.660
and we need to understand
all of those things.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.560
And these are the tools
we're trying to develop.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.960
And then finally we want
this to be broadly applied.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.840
In fact, at Stanford and UCSF as well

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.030
and other institutions,

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:48.210
precision medicine has
become a real calling card.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.540
Now we all want to do this,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.170
we all want to be able to
have our patients come in

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.920
and first of all do
prevention in the communities.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.030
That's the most important part to say.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.760
So, we want to keep people at home

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.810
rather than coming in sick.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.050
And at Stanford we call
it precision health

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.870
rather than precision medicine

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.330
because the idea is we
don't want people to come in

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.410
and have a disease that we
have to diagnose, et cetera.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.640
Obviously we will do it

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.410
and we will do the best we can.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.990
We would love it to be health.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.130
That is before you even get sick,

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.000
before you're even born
how can we give your family

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.250
markers kind of like
this 23andMe approach?

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.623
How do you know where you,

00:09:30.623 --> 00:09:33.570
what your risks might be
and what might trigger them

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.320
so that we know ahead of
time how to keep it healthy?

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.600
So we talk about predicting and preventing

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.570
and then if we have to
treat, treating precisely.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.870
That is the precise
disease that your body has.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.960
And so those are the big concepts.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.290
Now, (coughs) excuse me.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.620
The project that we
have is centered in our

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.480
center for population health sciences

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.790
and population health is again

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.710
very similar to what I just described.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.260
It is a study of relationship between

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.930
health determinants that
affect your health outcomes

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.020
in large populations.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.680
And when you look at large populations

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.070
you can start seeing patterns popping up.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.580
Certain people may be at higher
risk for certain problems.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.640
For example we know
that stress in children

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.610
who are brought up in
stressful environments

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.000
actually have cellular markers of stress

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.400
in their cells that can
predict shorter lifespans

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.880
and other healthy outcomes

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.080
and we're just starting
to understand that.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.370
So we need to understand how

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.150
our environment really affects our health.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.250
And so, this is really at the intersection

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.120
of medicine and public health

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.100
because we need to work with communities

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.040
to make sure we're all engaged.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.720
And in Stanford you can see the list of

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.550
different researchers that are involved

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.810
and this is people who are working

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.360
in many different areas.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.480
Another one for example
in behavioral health

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.390
is the idea that we diagnose children

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.730
who come from very distressed backgrounds

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.900
with mental health disorders

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.305
at a higher rate than children who are

00:11:10.305 --> 00:11:12.640
brought up in less
distressed environments,

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.380
and yet the new model now is the idea

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.320
and actually there are researchers
here at UCSF and Stanford

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.350
that are saying we're miss
diagnosing these children.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.760
They don't have bipolar disease,

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.690
they don't have these other
diseases that we talk about,

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.350
they actually have some
form almost of PTSD.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.440
And you don't treat that the same way

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.020
as you treat that bipolar
disease, et cetera

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.280
but we've been lumping
all of these together

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.580
and we're starting to try to understand

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.690
what the environment,

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.800
how that impacts your behavioral self

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.720
and how we can be better
at being much more specific

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.030
about individuals rather
than lumping them together

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.700
and possibly treating them with drugs

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.540
that may not work as well

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.250
or may not actually address the problem

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.380
that these people have.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.280
So we're moving into that realm,

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.240
it's hard going because it's hard to find

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.440
the funds to do these things,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.850
so we're very excited about
our opportunities here

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.600
to be able to start this process,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.240
and people are doing this around the world

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.900
in other ways as well,

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.480
but we need better data

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.150
and better ways to understand.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.680
So again, the idea of precision health

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.500
is to predict and prevent disease

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.630
and not just treat it,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.110
that's really the idea.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.270
And we tried and here again it says

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.030
imagine a time where your
doctor can really quickly

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.137
take a snapshot of your problem and say,

00:12:31.137 --> 00:12:33.797
"Well, here are, this
is what we used to do

00:12:33.797 --> 00:12:36.617
"but because your specific profile fits

00:12:36.617 --> 00:12:39.697
"this particular treatment regimen

00:12:39.697 --> 00:12:42.147
"this is what we would think
would work best for you

00:12:42.147 --> 00:12:44.190
"and not for other people."

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.100
And we hope to get and we can do that

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.590
to a certain extent now

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.623
but we can be much better at it.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.670
So, the aims of our center,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.270
now this is where we talk
about our specific center.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.890
These grants they have lots
and lots of requirements

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.660
so we have three research projects

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.730
and these are projects that are trying

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.760
to look at these ideas, how
can we translate this data

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.040
into understanding health disparities,

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.680
and we have five cores

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.560
and I'll show you a
little bit of what we do.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.560
So, we want to implement
these three programs

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.500
with an integrated and
what we call a science team

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.580
and the team very much
includes our local community.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.900
So everybody in the community
that is involved with this

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.300
really has a part in helping us

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.270
carry these projects forward,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.980
and then we disseminate that information

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.720
to the communities as well.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.560
And we actually develop as you see,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.830
we expand relationships with our partners

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:48.500
in our communities so
that they can actually

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.350
inform us about how we should be working

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.410
and getting the information
out to communities

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.820
to help educate them based on
the information that we learn.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:14:00.190
And finally again in the idea of

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.040
trying to understand tools,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.790
we're just getting better
experience with these genetic

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.400
and biologic information sets

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.110
and really how do we understand
how certain subpopulations,

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.380
for example, right now we're
using race and ethnicity

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.200
but we could use other things.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.080
So one of my colleagues is working on

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.600
gender and sex differences.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.690
So, how do women respond
differently to drugs

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.410
and other treatments than men do

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.120
and we have virtually
no experience with that.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.260
Because most drugs and most treatments

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.420
and most clinical studies in the world

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.343
for helping people out are done in men.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.100
The people feel like it's
easier to work with men,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.304
they're much more compliant, et cetera.

00:14:43.304 --> 00:14:44.350
(audience laughing)

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.183
Right?

00:14:45.183 --> 00:14:47.260
I mean yeah, that's what we hear,

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.093
that's what we hear

00:14:48.093 --> 00:14:50.030
and we think well, so
women aren't compliant

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.560
and women won't come in?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.590
I mean it's not been my experience.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.910
I've worked with
preventing mother to child

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.480
transmission of HIV in African communities

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.860
and those mothers know that their children

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.930
lives are at risk.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.970
They are almost 100% compliant
with everything we say.

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.080
So, I think this is this old notion that

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.960
it's just easier to use men

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.880
but it was really astounding.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.880
It's only been in the
last five years or so

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.390
that we even understood
that most of the drugs

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.770
that are prescribed in the US,

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.650
most of the studies that have been done

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.010
around treatment of diseases

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.500
have been done primarily in males.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.460
And it's not that they said no,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.930
you can't be in the
study if you're a woman,

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.300
it's that well, the way
they cater to the people

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.590
who come into the trials
they attract more men,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.650
they haven't really looked to get women in

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.350
and another big problem

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.260
which we have to deal with separately is

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.580
if you're at risk for becoming pregnant,

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.990
they don't want to have to deal with that

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.440
because then you might have
to drop out of the study

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.510
and you know?

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.830
So anyway, there's a lot of problems here.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.770
By the way, it turns out
that most of the studies

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.820
and however you feel about animal studies,

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.600
there have been a lot of mouse studies

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.440
and up until five years ago all,

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.840
virtually every study done in mice

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.030
to look for drug development, et cetera

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.350
we're done in male mice.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.344
Male mice.

00:16:11.344 --> 00:16:12.780
(audience laughing)

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:14.070
Yeah, it seems easy

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.940
and the idea was well, but the hormones

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.300
are gonna muck up the studies

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.070
and then we won't understand if this,

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.500
well, but that's the point, right?

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.823
If a woman takes it, she has hormones too.

00:16:25.897 --> 00:16:29.220
So basically when you put a drug in women

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.690
it turns out that it may
not work the same way

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.180
because of those pesky hormones.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.210
Anyway, so now there's a
rule at the federal level,

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.810
you have to use, you have to explain

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.990
why you're not gonna use equitable

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.380
gender distribution in
your studies even in mice.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.730
So anyway, yeah.
(audience laughs)

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.200
I just can't believe that we,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.650
you just take certain things for granted

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.013
and then we found this out.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.973
We're making slow baby steps forward.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.393
This is the structure of our project.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.210
The center is housed in the center for

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.450
population health sciences.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:07.850
There's a steering committee

00:17:08.773 --> 00:17:10.100
and an administrative core.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.620
I run this with it with
the director of the center.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.360
He has, this doctor is Mark Cullen

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.930
and Mark has worked in occupational
health work for decades.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:22.560
That's where he's been working.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.664
So primarily looking at bad
outcomes of health workers

00:17:26.664 --> 00:17:30.730
in industrial settings and
how you can achieve this,

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.200
improve that and I'm an
epidemiologist as well

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.670
so I work on populations,

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.210
although I work in global
infectious diseases.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:38.950
So the two of us really have this

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.580
broader population experience

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.100
and we have a lab core,
the statistical core,

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.730
an implementation core
and a consortium core.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.089
Frankly, I think these two
are the most exciting cores.

00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:52.030
these are great cores as well

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.880
but they are doing the
standard lab-based sequencing

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.090
and analytics, we're
developing again new tools

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.220
to try to understand how to
analyze these giant data sets.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.270
They're just so big you
would take your lifetime

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.610
in using traditional methods

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.120
so we have to learn
new methods to do that.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.410
But these cores are the ones

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.190
that really engage with the community

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.023
and we've done such a,

00:18:14.023 --> 00:18:16.550
I feel like we've done a really
great job of reaching out.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.330
And here are the three projects.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.590
There's three big
projects and I'll go into

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.000
a brief description of them.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.680
So, the first project is really exciting.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.120
It's called BRAICELET and that stands for

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.190
Bio-Repository for
American Indian Capacity,

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.340
Education, Law, Economics and Technology.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.550
So again, you really have to
work hard for that acronym

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.380
but it really does embrace
what they're trying to do.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.820
So we have partners in South Dakota,

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.850
this is a Lakota Indian tribe

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.360
and they for good reasons are mistrustful

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.500
of sending their clinical samples off

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.380
to this person, that person.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.180
They said we wanna do it ourselves,

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.790
can you teach us how to do that?

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.360
So we wanna run our own biobanks,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.080
we wanna be able to understand ourselves,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.480
what we wanna study,

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.990
how we wanna disperse that information

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.350
if at all if we keep it in the community

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.650
and what are the ethnic and ethical

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.840
and legal ramifications
of that kind of thing?

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.600
So for example, to what extent can we

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.910
have some of those
samples and help them out

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.840
because if you wanna keep
it within their organization

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.320
how does that happen?

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.190
And so, this is really exciting

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.150
because there are some health issues

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.230
within these communities

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.590
that are very unique to these communities

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.203
just like in other communities.

00:19:35.126 --> 00:19:37.860
And they can actually collect the data

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.630
and then using other
partners including Stanford

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.520
but not necessarily only Stanford,

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.120
to try to understand how to analyze them

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.800
and see what risk factors they might have

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.620
for certain diseases and how they can

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.010
and more importantly, how you can predict

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.410
whether those there are ways to prevent

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.090
those diseases from occurring.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.910
So this has been a really
exciting population,

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.930
these are some of our partners.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.600
Here they are at Stanford
and here they are

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.650
again also at Stanford although

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.630
we've had many site visits there

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.630
and we're teaching them a lot,

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.890
and we're learning with them together also

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.790
about how to set up their own biobanks

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.950
and get them interested in their own,

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.993
taking charge of their own health.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.040
I won't go through the aims but basically

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.640
the top high level area is really

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.330
to just establish this biobank

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.530
and try to help them do some pilot studies

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.130
just so that they understand on their own

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.510
what do they want to look at.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:38.450
Now, it turns out that
this particular tribe

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.100
has a number of autoimmune illnesses

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.860
that even other Lakota tribes

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.420
within that same region do not have.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.530
So, they wanna understand
how they're different

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:49.640
from these other groups.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.430
Now, not only would it
help them to understand

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.460
why do they have this predisposition

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.220
and what are the risk factors

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.630
but might teach us about
autoimmune diseases

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.790
for all populations.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.280
So, this is a study that they wanted

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.490
to undertake on their own

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.730
and we're gonna help them,

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.920
teach them how to do some of the studies

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.690
in their labs locally

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.690
and some of the work
that they can't do there,

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:14.150
we can pull over to
Stanford and help as well.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.630
So, it's really an exciting opportunity

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.900
and then also at the same time

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.580
develop, implement and evaluate

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.896
health education and literacy.

00:21:24.896 --> 00:21:27.170
One of the first things we
did with all of our projects

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.620
was bring our community partners in

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.910
and ask everybody what do you think

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.860
is precision medicine means

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.720
and what do you think
precision health means?

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.880
And everybody put their
own definition together

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.120
and then we all discussed it,

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.460
and we all tried to understand how

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.240
because everybody had great ideas

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.790
and it isn't one thing to all people.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.010
And so, just getting that health literacy

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.950
out there is very important.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.370
It gives people the ability to feel it,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.730
that they can control in some ways

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.193
their own health outcomes.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.150
The second project is
really closer to home,

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.000
it's called iPOP.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.700
Again, little acronym.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.490
So, Integrative
Personalized Omics Profiling

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:10.530
and Omics is a term that's
just generally means

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.290
the study of large

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.620
genetic or molecular data sets.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.210
So we have genomics, we have metabolomics,

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.210
we have all of these, these omics

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.620
and we can take for
example one sample of blood

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.420
and you can study lots and
lots of different markers.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.690
Well, one of my colleagues
at Stanford is a pediatrician

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.820
and he's been working in the
communities around San Jose

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.810
and Stanford for many years

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.770
among obese, young Latino kids

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.010
to try to do interventions,
health interventions,

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.710
help them to exercise more by dancing,

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:48.800
there are other things.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.000
Just trying to see what
works in keeping kids active

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.710
and keeping their weight down.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.670
And so, as part of this group

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.600
he's really established over the decades

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.430
a great relationship with these families.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.820
And he asked them permission,

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.810
would you be willing to
give us a sample of blood

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.170
as we track you through.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.550
So some of the kids are
having one intervention

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:11.310
and some are having a different one

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.230
to see if it helps with
their control of their weight

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.180
and other health markers.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.130
These kids are at very
high risk for diabetes

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.270
and so he's tracking,

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.960
he asked for permission
to take blood samples

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.670
once a year from the kids

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.770
to see if we could track who predict

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.980
if there are genetic and other markers

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:37.350
that predict who might
go on to develop diabetes

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.470
or other other health issues.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.250
And he got about 98% acceptance

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.210
because these are families

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.800
he's worked with for a long time.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.090
And so, the the idea is really to pull out

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.650
all of the different molecular markers

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:55.280
in the blood that he's collected

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.130
and then understand patterns.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.820
And again these are all anonymized

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.710
so the kids and the families

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.260
can get their data back if they'd like.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:06.330
If they don't want to they
don't have to have it.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:07.900
And the idea is it's really

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.120
try to understand if there
are again risk factors

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.090
for something that is very, very common

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.680
not only in the US but globally,

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.020
that is obesity and the
impact of that on diabetes

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.140
and other cardiac diseases for example.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.420
So that's a very exciting project.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.930
And so I just mentioned to
you what the goal is here.

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.370
Looking at these iPOP markers to measure

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.200
obesity and diabetes risk at baseline

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.030
and then to follow overtime to see how

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.030
this might affect this risk over time.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.740
It would be wonderful if
we could take a blood test

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.810
from somebody and say this is your,

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.010
just like we have now for say

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.960
maternal screening for fetuses,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.400
here's your risk of your
child developing XYZ disease.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.620
This would be a great way to say

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.270
here's your profile that
you are at this much risk

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.240
for developing these diseases.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.010
Of course he's also working
on the intervention side too

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.360
so that would be helpful to know

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.370
this would awaken the
family to this child,

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.880
you need to turn the television off

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.410
or you need to get them
outside, et cetera.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.710
Those are but that can
help inform policies,

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.563
it will do that.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.900
And then finally our third project

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.530
is really interesting also.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:27.530
It's a different project,
it's how do we communicate

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.010
all of these information to patients

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.250
and how does that cultural,

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.230
how do different cultures
take up that information

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.390
and do they act on it and
if they don't, why not?

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.600
And part of this came up from

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.040
some reports that one of our physicians

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.610
had had over time where the people,

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.350
where they felt that a
lot of, based on your

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:52.090
ethnic and racial background
and your cultural background,

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:55.330
some people didn't wanna
know their genetic results.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.090
Say for example from
breast cancer screening

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:57.923
they didn't wanna know,

00:25:57.923 --> 00:25:59.780
they didn't wanna do anything about it

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.750
and other people were
very really hyper aware.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.290
I wanna know what my markers are,

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:06.750
I wanna know what treatments will work

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:07.640
and other people just said

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.030
I don't really wanna hear it.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.373
And it was really interesting
to hear about why that,

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.200
we don't really understand why that occurs

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.210
and so this project
will be a multi-ethnic,

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:22.730
multilingual two-site project
at Stanford and at USC

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.320
where we're going to focus on Hispanic

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.280
and Chinese and white women
who are being diagnosed

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.710
with breast cancer,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.750
and really trying to help them

00:26:35.443 --> 00:26:38.010
and how the doctors communicate with them

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.733
about that information.

00:26:41.582 --> 00:26:44.560
And not only that, how
the communication style

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.900
works with that patient

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.270
and to see what they do with
that information over time

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:54.270
to understand how and why the information

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.700
had some uptake or did not have uptake.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.560
It's really important,

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.060
all of us know we're not
supposed to smoke, drink,

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:03.580
we have to get a lot of x-rays, et cetera.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.500
And yet, many of us, every one of us

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.270
has a different response to that.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.970
So it would be helpful
to understand what is it,

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.970
how do you communicate
information in a better way,

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.170
in a way that can maybe get the best

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.560
health outcome for that person

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.320
or to understand what the obstacles

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.940
to communication might be.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.670
So here the project is to assess

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:27.660
genomic confidence of
clinicians communicating this.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.790
And that means you know
how well does the doctor

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:33.100
understand what they're
talking about basically.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.470
And then there will be with,

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.550
again with permission, they're
audio taping the information

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.960
to be able to study how those
interactions are working

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.190
and whether there's keywords

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:44.750
that seem to be carried across

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.470
the successful interactions
compared to those

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.230
that are not so successful.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:53.370
And then to identify when patients

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:55.610
share with their family members

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.510
and how that's influenced
by their health literacy

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.410
and other factors.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:05.310
To see if we can overcome
some of the health disparities

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.430
that we see among racial and ethnic groups

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.240
that may not really have
sufficient health literacy

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.123
and how do we get them to that point.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.700
So those are our three projects

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.720
and we have five years to work on them

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.710
and so far we're just enrolling
patients at this point,

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:24.310
and actually with the BRAICELET project

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.900
we're working with the Lakota group

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.500
to try to to help them
set up their biobank.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.490
And so it's going reasonably well

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.640
and we don't have results at this point

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.460
but we work very carefully
with the community

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.490
and I talked to you about our five cores.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.370
Our consortium core and
our implementation core,

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:45.720
great, we wanted to make them one core

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.150
but and I said no, you have
to have two separate one.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.750
So we basically, functionally
they're one group,

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.150
we pull them all together.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.360
So, this is just a picture of a meeting

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.320
that we had last year at Stanford

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.530
of some of our community
consortium members

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.090
from the actual projects.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.280
But in addition to this group of people

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.740
we bring in partners
around the Stanford area

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.250
from different minority groups.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:14.930
We have Vietnamese, Chinese,
African American, Latino,

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:19.110
other Asian subpopulations,
other groups as well

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.080
and really have them
come in and meet with us,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.860
and review the data, the
work what we've done to date.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.100
And we actually had a
really fun all-day session

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.690
with this group where we had people

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.270
present their own stories to each other

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:37.970
so that it was a really,
really unifying experience.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:41.300
So, we're really trying to
create the strategic alliance

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.750
and build capacity for people to really

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.770
take control over their own health

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.770
and their own health literacy.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.840
And then evaluate our projects

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.720
and the community members
know what's best for them,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.580
so they tell us.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.340
You know, we didn't really understand

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.420
why you did it this way,

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.310
we think you should do it this way.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:02.060
And we really have been able
to build a better interaction

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.837
and I think better studies
and programs in the long run

00:30:05.837 --> 00:30:09.900
to be able to speak in the language

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.560
that people understand best.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.140
We also have some really
nice opportunities.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.700
The NIH allowed us to
grant a few pilot grants

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.190
to our community members

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.560
so they can go out and do

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.920
their own pilot work in their communities.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.990
A lot of these are around

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.550
health education and
health literacy education,

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.710
and so we're in our second round,

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.240
we're just gonna be awarding
our second set of grants

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.040
in the next couple of months.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.580
And so these are our partners,

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.600
this again is that group here you saw.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.930
We had our annual meeting
and then we have...

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.010
We bring people back
and forth quite a bit.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.610
We travel there to the different sites

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:49.870
but we also bring people in

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.200
so that they can get to know one another

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.320
and really understand the overall

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.463
objectives of this project.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.670
And so, the implementation core is really

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.810
meant to try to create some guidelines

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.470
so that communities can have something

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.320
to communicate back into their populations

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.560
based on what we have learned so far

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.090
about how to work together.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:17.180
And we are trying to
understand what the best way is

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.030
to communicate with
populations around the area

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.230
given that they may have obstacles,

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:23.960
maybe there's language obstacles,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.740
cultural obstacles, just
transportation obstacles.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.100
So one of the things we found out

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.960
is that most of the
people didn't wanna have a

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.030
conference at Stanford.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.410
They were afraid to come to Stanford,

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.870
it's too big, it's a little intimidating.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.420
They prefer to have it in
their local community center.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.420
We couldn't afford to
have that many meetings

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.670
so we did have individuals

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.380
going out to the community centers

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:44.710
but when we had our big meeting

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:48.390
we had it in a little,
a more low-key building

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:50.620
and really engaged the community that way.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.110
But we were really surprised
that people just felt

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.900
and they also didn't want
to have it in the hospital

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.240
and that part we can understand.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.930
The hospital's certainly intimidating.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.250
And so we had it on
campus but off in another

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.358
like a undergraduate building.

00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:05.500
So you learn a lot about

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.090
how people wanna be messaged

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:11.103
and I think we've
learned a lot about that.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.740
And again I mentioned the
analytics and modeling core

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.340
really trying to come up with cutting edge

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.730
statistical methods to understand

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.080
how to process large amounts of data

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.620
in a way that really is meaningful.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:27.080
And then our lab core does
all the laboratory studies

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.370
and so far we've had many

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:33.410
or finally we've had many
visits to the different site

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:34.450
particularly in South Dakota

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.040
but other sites as well.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.450
We have had these focus groups over time,

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.490
we continue to do that

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:43.670
and we have a lab core
partnership in Mexico.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.920
They're trying to do
the same thing in Mexico

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.350
looking at genetic
predisposition to immune markers

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.880
that predict immunity
to develop to vaccines,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.630
and so they wanted to partner with us.

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.460
And we had our annual
Community Consortium meeting

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.160
which was really exciting

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.040
all really run by the community members

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.010
telling their stories about
how their diseases were,

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.440
were not handled well

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.390
and what they thought might work better.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.180
It was really edifying for a lot of us

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.450
and across the board

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:17.420
and we also have been publishing work.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.430
So, I'd like to stop there

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.316
and thank you so much for your attention.

00:33:21.316 --> 00:33:24.316
(audience clapping)
