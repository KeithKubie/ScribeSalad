00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.900
We're going to look at five key concepts in evolutionary thinking.

2
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:08.430
The first of which is natural selection.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.700
Natural selection presents us with a puzzle because it creates the appearance of

4
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:19.701
a design without having a design in mind or even having a mind at all.

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.960
There is no agent that's actively selecting anything.
How does it do that?

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.730
Natural selection occurs whenever these four necessary conditions are fulfilled.

7
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.760
First,
there's variation in reproductive success.

8
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.520
Second,
there's variation in the treat of interest.
Third,

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.880
there's a non zero correlation between reproductive success and the trait and

10
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.820
forth.
The state of the treat is heritable.

11
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.820
There's genetic variation for the tree.

12
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.640
When in doubt returned to these basic conditions.

13
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.290
They help you to understand whether or not natural selection could be operating

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.400
on anything.
Let's unpack them.
First,

15
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.410
variation in reproductive success.

16
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.250
Now to a first approximation in humans.

17
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:16.251
This is variation and completed family size and that means lifetime reproductive

18
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:21.180
success,
abbreviated LRS or children ever born,

19
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.980
abbreviated CEB in bacteria and cancer cells.

20
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.750
It's variation in time and survival between cell divisions.

21
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.670
Now to reproduce one must survive of course.

22
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.770
Thus reproductive success is a composite of survival and reproduction.

23
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.520
The probability of surviving to reproduce times the number of offspring produced

24
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.140
some over the reproductive period.

25
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.270
Now you'll note that selection acts directly via reproductive success and only

26
00:01:56.371 --> 00:02:00.780
indirectly via survival to the extent that survival is contributing to

27
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.830
reproductive success.

28
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:06.831
This is an important point and it's because of this distinction that we can see

29
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:09.270
how aging evolves.

30
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.180
Now variation in reproductive success is universal.

31
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:16.860
We have two examples here.

32
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.420
On the top panel we have the monogamous Pitcairn islanders and in the bottom

33
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:26.100
panel the polygynous doggone.
In Mali,
males are in blue,

34
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.690
females are in red.

35
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.240
On the x axis we have the number of offspring that are particular individual

36
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:34.074
had.

37
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.230
On the y axis we have the number of people who had that number of offspring and

38
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:43.410
you can see that in both populations there's great variation in reproductive

39
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.244
success.

40
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Any trait that correlates with reproductive success in these populations will

41
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:55.281
experience selection and whether then response to selection is is going to

42
00:02:56.521 --> 00:03:00.520
depend on whether it is heritable on whether it's underpinned by genetic

43
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:01.354
variation.

44
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.080
<v 0>Variation in the trait is then the another key factor.</v>

46
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.290
The trait could be anything.
It could be eye color,
height,

47
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.220
the temperature dependence,
and then have an enzymatic reaction.

48
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.500
The structure of the ribosomes assess susceptibility to a disease.

49
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.130
Those are all possible traits that could be under selection.

50
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.280
If the trait does not vary,

51
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.570
there can be no competition for improved reproductive performance among treat

52
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:32.404
variants.

53
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.680
<v 0>Natural selection does not operate on things that do not vary.</v>

55
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.271
Now,

56
00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:44.250
most traits do vary among individuals and most traits therefore can potentially

57
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:47.430
come under selection.
Here's an example,

58
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.380
variation and resistance to malaria.

59
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.770
Here you have a table of sickle cell genotypes across sub Sahara.

60
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:58.500
In Africa there are 10 rows each for a different region of Africa.

61
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.250
These two columns show the infected and uninfected people that have the s Oleo,

62
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.220
the sickle Leo,

63
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and these two columns show the infected and uninfected people who are Aa

64
00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:12.060
homozygotes.

65
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.090
So s codes for sickle cell and a is for the normal hemoglobin.

66
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.160
You can see down here at the bottom the percentage of people infected and if you

67
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:26.250
examine those,

68
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:30.030
you'll see that the sickle cell carriers were about 6% less likely to be

69
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:33.180
infected by malaria than the normal homozygotes.

70
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.730
Now the s s homozygotes suffer from anemia,

71
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.570
the Aa homozygotes suffer from malaria and the essay heterozygotes are protected

72
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:48.743
from malaria.

73
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.940
So this is an example where genetic variation is being maintained in these

74
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:58.680
populations by the selection pressure exerted by disease.

75
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.470
In this case we have a lot of information on the biochemical basis.

76
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.140
The s variant is caused by a mutation in the sixth position of the Beta globin

77
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:14.670
chain of hemoglobin and that results in the replacement of hydrophilic glutamic

78
00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:16.410
acid by hydrophobic veiling.

79
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.640
So here is a case in which we can go right from the molecular level up to the

80
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:25.470
population level to understand why genetic variation is being maintained in the

81
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:26.340
population.

82
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.060
And we can also see that disease is playing an important role in selection on

83
00:05:33.181 --> 00:05:34.014
humans.

84
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.740
<v 0>The next criterion,</v>

86
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.630
the next condition is that the correlation between reproductive success and the

87
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:46.570
trait of interest must be non zero.

88
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.000
Even if there's variation in reproductive success and variation in the trait,

89
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.490
that doesn't mean that natural selection is operating.

90
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.890
Those are necessary conditions,
but they are not yet sufficient.

91
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.960
There must also be a correlation between the value of the trait and reproductive

92
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:05.360
success.
For example,

93
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.990
patients who resist disease may reproduce more often than patients who don't.

94
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.570
<v 0>What in general generates such correlations?
Well,</v>

96
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:19.571
they are produced by myriad circumstances in the biology of humans and also in

97
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:26.030
their culture.
An important element of human culture is now medicine.

98
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.300
Medicine is actually generating correlations between reproductive success and

99
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:32.600
traits of interest.

100
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.730
There was thus no single general cause of selection.

101
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.330
Selection occurs for a huge variety of reasons that include anything that causes

102
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:46.460
variation in reproductive success.

103
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.700
<v 0>Let's take a look at one example.
Here is a table of uh,</v>

105
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.270
traits with are correlated that are correlated with reproductive success and

106
00:07:00.391 --> 00:07:04.800
they come from women in Framingham,
Massachusetts,
born between 1890 and 1960.

107
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.350
The traits are cholesterol,
height,
weight,
age at first birth and agent menopause.

108
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.630
This Beta is not strictly speaking a correlation coefficient.

109
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.670
It is a selection gradient and it has the same sign is a correlation
coefficient.

110
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.870
You can see that the sample sizes are large,
the p values are small.

111
00:07:24.871 --> 00:07:26.970
These are all significant effects.

112
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.670
What we can see from this table is that in this period for women in Framingham,

113
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.360
selection was acting to decrease their total cholesterol to decrease their

114
00:07:38.401 --> 00:07:39.234
height,

115
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.620
the increase their weight to decrease their age at first birth and to increase

116
00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.590
their agent menopause.

117
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:52.310
So selection is acting in a contemporary human population and this result is

118
00:07:53.131 --> 00:07:56.460
fairly general.
It's been confirmed in other populations as well.

119
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.320
The next necessary condition is that the state of the trait must be heritable.

120
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.960
That is the critical genetic condition that allows what worked in the past to be

121
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.590
remembered and improvements to accumulate.

122
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.720
It does interacts with natural selection to generate order out of disorder.

123
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.930
However,
inheritance must not be 100% perfect.

124
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.850
If it were genetic variation could not originate in the first place,

125
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.330
and if for some reason it already existed,

126
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.040
then natural selection would rapidly eliminated.
By selecting the best variants,

127
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.620
there has to be some mutation to create the mute.
The variation.

128
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:43.380
That's the fuel on which the motor selection runs,

129
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.290
but not so much mutation that destroys too much of the useful information on

130
00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:53.250
what worked in the past.
So there must be some intermediate,

131
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.890
fairly low optimal rate.

132
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:57.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

133
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.810
<v 0>Here are the heritabilities of some human traits.</v>

134
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:02.540
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

135
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:07.490
<v 0>age at first birth.
Oh 0.11 blood traits like cholesterol,</v>

136
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:12.700
somewhere around old 0.4 or 0.3 or 0.4 agent menopause about old 0.6 height

137
00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:20.291
about oh 0.75 and all of these traits are capable of responding to selection,

138
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.460
but height will respond more rapidly than age at first birth,

139
00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:29.930
because it's heritability is higher for an equivalent selection pressure.

140
00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:33.920
That means that height will respond more rapidly than Asia first birth.

141
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:35.690
<v 1>Okay?</v>

142
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.350
<v 0>Now,
heritabilities are things that can vary from zero to one.</v>

143
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.640
Zero means no more resemblance between relatives.

144
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.550
Then between people chosen at random,

145
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.890
and one means that offspring have exactly the same value is the average of their

146
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:52.724
parents.

147
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.630
So human traits have significant genetic variation and can respond to selection.

148
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.463
<v 1>Okay,</v>

149
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.870
<v 0>let's take a look at natural selection in action.</v>

150
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.320
The rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus is illustrated by

151
00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:14.381
what is pretty much a standard history of introducing new drugs to combat

152
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:15.920
bacterial infection.

153
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.760
In 1943 penicillin became commercially available and staphylococcus was

154
00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:26.900
resistant.
By 1947 there was a switch to methicillin.

155
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:30.410
In the 60s methicillin resistance was rising.

156
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:35.411
By the eighties by the 1990s 35% of isolates were resistant to methicillin.

157
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.840
There was then a switch to Vancomyocin.

158
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.520
By 1996 Vancomyocin resistance was reported and Linezolid was approved in 2000

159
00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:52.181
by the FDA and by 2000 to linezolid resistance was reported in staphylococcus.

160
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.510
This is a fairly representative standard history of the way that bacteria

161
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.890
respond to the introduction of antibiotics.

162
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.770
They repeatedly Reeve evolve resistance.

163
00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:05.760
<v 1>Okay?</v>

164
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.440
<v 0>It's caused by strong selection that elicits a rapid response.</v>

165
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.140
Bacterial populations are huge.

166
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.400
There are large numbers of genetic variants that are continually generated by

167
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:18.031
mutation,

168
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:23.031
but also importantly introduced by horizontal gene transfer and generation times

169
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.840
are very short.

170
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.310
Antibiotic therapy creates huge differences in the reproductive success of

171
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.650
different variants in the bacterial population.

172
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.340
The trait that varies is resistance.
That variation has a genetic basis.

173
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.280
Antibiotics select resistant clones,

174
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.710
which then have greater reproductive success.

175
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

176
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.430
<v 0>There are other examples of natural selection,
clinical medicine,</v>

177
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.540
and in public health,

178
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.030
the evolution of metastatic cancer involves natural selection.

179
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.020
The evolution of resistance to cancer chemotherapy involves natural selection.

180
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.560
The coevolution of pathogens with host defenses.

181
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.370
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

182
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.590
<v 0>leading to the evasion and to manipulation</v>

183
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.890
involves natural selection.

184
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.800
The evolution of pathogen variants in response to changes in transmission and to

185
00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:29.801
vaccination campaigns involves natural selection and the impacts of medical

186
00:12:30.711 --> 00:12:32.870
practice on human pathogen and cancer.

187
00:12:32.871 --> 00:12:36.590
Evolution all involve natural selection.

188
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.260
So to summarize,

189
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.940
selection occurs whenever variation in a trade is correlated with reproductive

190
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:45.860
success traits.

191
00:12:45.861 --> 00:12:50.450
Experience selection only respond if their variation is heritable.

192
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.420
Selection produces a significant response when the events that generated occur

193
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.210
frequently and consistently.

194
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.770
Selection efficiently creates order out of disorder,

195
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.060
producing the appearance of design that we call adaptation.

196
00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

197
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.570
<v 0>No agent is actively selecting the process emerges unsupervised from any</v>

198
00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:21.811
circumstances that correlate heritable variation in traits with reproductive

199
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:23.164
success.

200
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.660
Natural selection is largely a numbers game.

201
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.320
It occurs in response to things that happen frequently and consistently.
