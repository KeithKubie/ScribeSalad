1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:08,760
Hello Freak bitches. That's
right. We're back. Oh, oh.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,090
I'm mixing it up.
Prompts a dom Irrera whenever you say Ooh.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,720
Ah, Ooh. You got to give
props to the Godfather. I'm,

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,070
this episode is brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot Com uh, on it is,

5
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:25,490
if you've never heard it before about
it before a human performance website.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,840
It's all supplements and strength and
conditioning equipment dedicated to human

7
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:32,870
performance,
including the new primal bells,

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,830
the new kettlebells that come in the
form of gorillas and chimpanzees.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,410
These are just the beginning. We have a
bunch of different designs coming out.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,420
The new gorilla one just came out and
it's fucking Badass. It's 72 pounds.

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,170
It's a a bad ass workout.
It's got a big fat handle on it.

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,710
And if you've never worked
out with kettlebells and
you buy something like this,

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,010
let it be a goal. Don't have it be
your main piece of exercise equipment.

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,760
Because if you have never
lifted kettlebells before
and you don't understand it,

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,810
70 pounds is a lot of weight
to swing around. So, uh,

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,970
start with, I would start with light
and do it correctly. And if you can,

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,390
if you can afford to get a trainer or
get someone who knows how to do it,

18
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:15,230
to show you the movements, just film
it on your phone and then watch it.

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,160
You don't want to hurt yourself.

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,810
And so if you're doing anything that is
involving a strength and conditioning,

21
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,550
my main,

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,630
the main piece of advice that I always
give people is learn what you're doing.

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,040
Do it correctly, learn from someone
and then pay attention to your form.

24
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,020
It's the most important thing.
If you get sloppy,

25
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,780
that's when people get hurt and you
don't want to get hurt when you swing it

26
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:38,720
around a 72 pound kettle bell bitch.
All right.

27
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,680
Especially one that looks like a gorilla,
you'll feel so weakened, fleshy already.

28
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,900
Um, we have all kinds of shit,
battle ropes, maces and club bells,

29
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:52,901
and there's a fantastic series of
strength and conditioning DVDs,

30
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:56,570
especially the ones that I can recommend.
The extreme kettle kettle, excuse me,

31
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,220
extreme extreme. Do I know how to talk?
Extreme kettlebell cardio workout,

32
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,350
DVD one and two,

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,590
they're these fucking incredible workouts
by this maniac named Keith Weber's

34
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,853
guy's a nut.

35
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,240
He's on the beach doing this workout that
literally makes you want to just stop

36
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,070
breathing. It's incredible. And you can,

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,940
it'll kick your ass with a 45
pounder or 35 pound or even a,

38
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,860
he uses a 45 pounder though in the video.
Fantastic shit.

39
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:25,040
Go to [inaudible] dot com

You just dangerous. You're radical. What
is your shirt? What are you selling?

63
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,550
It's the new uh, equation. Tee shirts.

64
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:53,260
My first tee shirt and I got together
with a designer and gave him some wild

65
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:57,040
notes about different things about me
and he had this idea to make it look like

66
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:01,000
a chalkboard and it's really cool and
they're selling and it's exciting. Oh,

67
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:03,610
that's cool dude. Get me one
of those. Definitely will do.

down the camera and his website.

72
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,600
He is so gangster.

73
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,120
Give zero fucks. Yeah, look at him.

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,180
So anybody that's behind you
sees me looking right at them.

76
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,490
So that's a for those paying attention.

Just squad.tv higher primate.com Tony

Boom. All right, Brian. Keith
music. Let's get this party rolling

79
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,530
experience. Joe Rogan podcast. My name,

80
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,190
sweet baby Jesus.

81
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,350
Tony Hinchcliffe is in the house
today. Oh yeah. Tony Hinchcliffe.

82
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:05,550
How's your life? Great man.
Having Fun and kicking butt. It's,

83
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,870
but I hardly believe people when they
say kicking Butt Sam kicking ass.

84
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:12,310
I'll take you seriously. Say
kicking butt and like, who are you?

85
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,260
What are you doing? Partying was all
ladies and beating them at things.

86
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,250
How are you kicking?
But just having them just staying busy.

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,320
It's my favorite thing to do is to
stay busy. What about kicking butt?

88
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,870
Uh, well, you know what, I, I'm going
to rephrase it. I've been kicking ass.

89
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,420
There you go. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. I appreciate that.

90
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,310
I appreciate, appreciate it. Also,

91
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,100
all the people that, uh, have, uh,
sent comments pro and negative about a,

92
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,730
the new Scifi TV show
appreciate all your input.

93
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,220
I think this is a rare time
where people get to, uh,

94
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,160
give input about things they see online,
whether it's a standup comedy show or a,

95
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,830
um,
a TV show like this show or anything.

96
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,110
It's important that people get
to talk about stuff and telling,

97
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,240
tell me what sucks. I want
to know, you know, and it's,
it's not perfect. There's no,

98
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,950
no, none. No shows are
perfect, man. It's hard.

99
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,630
It's hard to do a television
show that's perfect.

100
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,200
It's also hard to do a terrible television
show like this where you squeezing

101
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,460
hours of information and hours of
conversations until like 40 plus minutes.

102
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,850
But one of the things that I've found is
that people are so fucking attached to

103
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,400
this shit.
They believe they're so attached.

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,500
And one the big one that people are
mad at me now is chem trails because a,

105
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:31,490
we had an episode of that kind of debunk
chem trails and it didn't debunk all

106
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,130
chem trails.
This is what people need to understand it,

107
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,760
and this is a really important, first
of all, I don't work for the government,

108
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,820
but if I did work for the government, I
probably wouldn't tell you, but I don't.

109
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,590
I don't. I'm the fucking, I give up,

110
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,560
come on pot smoking fucking
cage fighting commentator.

111
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:48,170
I'm not working for the government.
All right, stop it. Don't be silly.

112
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,090
You would be the perfect person.
She'll what?

113
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,110
What people are seeing for the most
part when you see these con trails,

114
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:00,140
these trails behind jet that
become artificial clouds.

115
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,530
The way it's been explained to me by
not just one but numerous scientists is

116
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,850
that when jet engines pass through
various levels of condensation,

117
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,710
it creates different effects.

118
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,780
And if a jet engine passes through
sky that has enough condensation,

119
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,140
it will literally change
the temperature of the sky,

120
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,260
stir it up and create a cloud and it's
a lingering cloud behind the jet and if

121
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,530
you're looking at it,

122
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:32,120
it looks like someone's
spraying artificial clouds
and you get this feeling like,

123
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:34,640
oh my God,
they're spraying clap like I when I,

124
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,080
I've saw them and I saw
some of the documentaries on
and there was a quite a bit

125
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:43,070
of time before I was, I was looking at
it, I was like, that doesn't make sense,

126
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:46,640
but is it possible that they're really
spraying artificial clouds out of all

127
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:47,780
these planes?

128
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,720
And then you talk to people to tell you
that these are military planes and this

129
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:55,100
is a constant geothermal
engineering exercise.

130
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,700
But then when you find out that it is
possible to put a jet engine through

131
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:04,970
various levels of condensation and create
these clubs like scientifically proven

132
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,541
hundred percent you got to go,
okay,

133
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,110
well that's 100% if that's 100% is there
a way to tell when they're going to

134
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,360
leave contrary and when they're not,
it turns out the risk.

135
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,610
There's a NASA website and
you go to the NASA website,

136
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:15,770
it shows you where there's condensation,

137
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:18,410
where there'll be contracts and it's
for pilots so they could see better.

138
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,440
It's for people that are like
trying to observe the sky.

139
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,490
It's like a bunch of reasons
why they monitor this shit.

140
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,730
They know when contracts are going to
exist and when they're not. In fact,

141
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,140
in 1942,

142
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,450
the government was trying to figure out
what the fuck was going on cause they

143
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:34,310
just like first started having planes
involved in world war two and they were

144
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:34,700
um,

145
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,700
they put out a paper on what they called
persistent condensation trails and that

146
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,740
is these lines that were behind these,
these planes.

147
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:45,920
And their conclusion was that it's a
natural part of what happens to the

148
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:49,670
atmosphere when a plane flies by and it's
sometimes they last and sometimes they

149
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,770
don't based on how much
moisture is in the atmosphere.

150
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,410
19 fucking 42 they did this,

151
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,200
so this is something that has been
scientifically able to be explained for a

152
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,140
long time. That set, now this
is where everybody gets crazy.

153
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,460
The I'm sure the government or
let's just say people that are evil,

154
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:09,360
let's not just say the government
because they're probably not even the

155
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:11,250
government now is probably
the government of the past,

156
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,260
which you can't blame the people now.
You can blame them on a lot of shit.

157
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,920
You can't blame him for shit that
happened in the 50s for sure.

158
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,860
People have sprayed things out of planes.
Hundred percent yeah,

159
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,930
it's definitely happened for sure.

160
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:27,050
You're dealing with a power structure
that values money over a certain aspects

161
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:28,320
of humanity for sure.

162
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:32,670
100% but we've gotta be honest about
what's happening and what's not happening.

163
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,730
Southwest is not spraying
artificial clouds.

164
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,880
They're accidentally making them in a
natural byproduct of a jet engine passing

165
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:41,940
through condensation.

166
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,350
But it doesn't mean that people
haven't done evil shit in the past.

167
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,360
It just means that's what that is.

168
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,010
And people are getting so fucking mad
at me on Twitter and calling me a shill

169
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:56,080
and a government agent and thinking
that somehow or another, um, um,

170
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,480
I'm changing the truth because I want to
protect myself or something. It's just,

171
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,400
I think people are looking for like a
reason, something to blame, you know,

172
00:10:04,401 --> 00:10:09,200
the lack of health and feeling good and
you know, on, and I think that they,

173
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,120
they do that and then they roll in,

174
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,570
they blame it on the chem trails and they
roll into Mcdonald's and eat five big

175
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,220
macs and wonder why
they're feeling shitty.

176
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:18,930
They think they're just
spraying stuff down on that.

177
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,150
Have you ever seen the one,

178
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:24,890
the video with prince on the prince
sitting with Dick Gregory, pull it up.

179
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,690
Prince talks about chem trails.

180
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,440
Prints is talking about chem trails
in the hood and friends, for instance,

181
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,510
one of the banners,
rock and rollers of all the tile.

182
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:36,500
And he's talking about chem trails,
um, in the hood when he was growing up.

183
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,610
And it's, it sounds like he's singing
a song. Like it's like almost lyrical.

184
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,600
Like the way he looks at it.

185
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:46,601
It's like sometimes no
clothes in a thought.

186
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,290
It was purple rain.
Yeah. The, the video is,

187
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,690
the video is really quite fascinating.
It's, did you find it? Yeah. Okay.

188
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,524
I play this bitch

189
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,370
like Jackson, like Jack. Yeah. Oh,
it's not that great. I'm sorry. Well,

190
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,880
because I knew I was right.
You know,

191
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,390
we talked about this in our very first
interview and conversation together.

192
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,643
Um,

193
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,050
it's obvious now that artists are supposed
to own their master recordings. Okay.

194
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,180
This isn't the part will be,

195
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,390
there's a part where he talks about
chemistry takes them bodies. Oh, it's,

196
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,600
it's Prince Dick Gregory. You started to
see a whole bunch of, Huh, here we go.

197
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,080
Phenomena of chem trails.
Okay.

198
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,140
And you know,
when I was a kid,

199
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:34,950
I used to see these trails
in the sky all the time.

200
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,930
And so that's cool.

201
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,160
A jet just went over and then you
started to see a whole bunch of,

202
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,290
and next thing you know,

203
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,050
everybody in your neighborhood was
fighting and arguing and you did know why.

204
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,080
Okay. And, and you really didn't
know why. I mean, everybody was fine.

205
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,100
So he,

206
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,880
he started riffing about
the chem trails and

207
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,490
he started to say things
that, uh, hit home so hard.

208
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,820
And I would recommend that everybody try
to get what he said online or wherever

209
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,900
and try to get a copy of
it and just listen to it.

210
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,950
I'm so moved that I had to write the song.

211
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,110
He wrote a song about chem
trails. Really, when you lean,

212
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,630
what?
All the half,

213
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,203
what is this?

214
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,180
That's just ancillary video.
That's actually Dick Gregory.

215
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,450
That's the guy who brought these approved
or filmed of the Geraldo Rivera show.

216
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:40,470
Dick Gregory, the older guy. He, uh, was a
standup comedian, like an activist and he,

217
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,160
he bought this approved or film to a
Geraldo Rivera show and showed it on

218
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:46,740
television. President Kennedy
getting shot for the first time.

219
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,620
It's actually in the 1970s long after his
death, he died in [inaudible] 63 they,

220
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,400
they showed it on TV, I think I'm
like 72 or something like that.

221
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,570
72 73 it might have been, you would have
done that. Yeah. They showed the actual,

222
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:00,360
it might've been 75. The uh, um, yeah,

223
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:04,290
they showed the actual gunshot to
the head on national television.

224
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:08,640
Even showed a close up on it and Geraldo
Rivera was the conspiracy theorist back

225
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:12,150
then. Geraldo Rivera who now
works for Fox News back then.

226
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:16,860
He was saying the clot shot clearly
comes from the front as you see his head

227
00:13:16,861 --> 00:13:20,030
snapped back into the left. Like
wow. It's interesting. Really.

228
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,170
It is tough to argue that. I mean, I'd
love to, I'd love to see that broken down.

229
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:28,230
Like how do you explain his
head going in front to back,

230
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,520
but how crazy his prints on KemTrace.
Oh my goodness.

231
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,010
It's like you listen to
that and you're like, wow.

232
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,280
And all of a sudden everyone's fighting.
And I couldn't figure

233
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,910
when I was a kid,
there was only a few airplanes.

234
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,820
And then as the airplane business
got bigger, there was more airplanes.

235
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,150
Well, when he's saying actually kind of
flies in the face of the traditional camp

236
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:52,770
trail fears,
they believe that these,

237
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,270
these long lines in the sky didn't exist
in the past and that they are fairly

238
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,080
recent.

239
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,410
But there's like photos from like the 80s
and shit and people took where there's

240
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:05,280
these lines in the sky and it looks
like artificial clouds and it's just,

241
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,660
it's just part of the process of
flying a jet and mean it's, it,

242
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,700
it does create a cloud though.
And people will likely,

243
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,580
these clouds are blanking up. The Sky was,
it was really clear until they flew by.

244
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,370
That is true. It does happen.
Is that, that is real.

245
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,520
Yeah. And it goes along with
what you're saying about it,

246
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,980
the planes making it because,
uh,

247
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,800
planes have gotten bigger and
bigger as the years have gone on.

248
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,250
They didn't always have a seven
40 centers, seven 57 you know,

249
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,030
so as these are getting bigger, of course
the uh, the chem trails will be too,

250
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,080
it seems at least,

251
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,670
well there's,
you know,

252
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,670
the other thing that's real is that it
changes the temperature of the earth.

253
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,960
That is a fact, in fact,
that the temperature change
quite a bit after nine 11.

254
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,350
Do you remember what it was like when
nine 11 happened and then also no one was

255
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,860
flying for like two weeks? Yeah. What
changed the temperature of the earth?

256
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,370
But I forget if it heated up
or it down. Let's see, uh,

257
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,570
temperature changed nine one, one, let's
say. Cool. Dan, what would you say? Yeah,

258
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:59,870
I would say that. Yeah, I think so
too. Opposite reaction. Right, right.

259
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:01,701
Okay.

260
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,230
Let's say temperature change after nine
one one air traffic affects the climate.

261
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,760
Yeah, yeah. Let's do this.
Oh yeah. And then that seems
like the piece that I know,

262
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:15,380
the purity of the air definitely changes
temperature and then everybody's tears

263
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,440
even says it in here.
Listen to this.

264
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,030
During the three day commercial flight
hiatus when artificial clouds known as

265
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,670
con trails all but disappeared.

266
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,740
So they're like admitting on CNN that
these planes create artificial clouds.

267
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:31,790
Like no one's tried to hide it.

268
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,270
This isn't like some crazy conspiracy
that people wondering about.

269
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,170
But artificial clouds known
as has all but disappeared.

270
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:44,171
The variations in high and low
temperatures increased by 1.1 degrees.

271
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,360
Interesting each day.
Said meteorology,

272
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,630
meteorological researchers. That's
interesting. I don't know if that's,

273
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,130
I don't know if that
means anything though.

274
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:58,280
It's so hard to tell cause
like the temperature fluctuates
by more than a degree

275
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:02,300
every day anyway. And if it goes up, I
mean it could be, I mean I'm an idiot,

276
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:05,990
but I'm reading this and I'm
gonna go on. Are you sure? Anyway,

277
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,370
the point is in this,

278
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:12,371
even in this CNN paper from 2002 it says
artificial clouds known as con trails,

279
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,340
I think.
But people are looking at them,

280
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:20,150
they think it's something that didn't
happen before. They're like they, oh,

281
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:21,620
I didn't,
these weren't there before.

282
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,130
It doesn't mean that people
haven't sprayed shit out of planes.

283
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,210
But what it does mean is that what
you're seeing is not what you think is

284
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:34,070
happening.
Most of the time when you see this spray,

285
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,410
what you're seeing is a fucking cloud.

286
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,380
That's what happens when it goes
through the jet. But if it was a spray,

287
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,650
it wouldn't look like that.
If it was aluminum and Barium,

288
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,080
which is like what they're claiming the
government for some reason to spraying

289
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:49,310
in the sky, it would be more
like smoke signals or like a, um,

290
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,490
those things behind a plane to smoke
writer. It would linger in the sky.

291
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,830
But those are, those are heavy
metals. Those are particles.

292
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:57,770
Even if they're nanoparticles, they're
going to fall, they waste something.

293
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,840
It's not going to be
like moisture in the air,

294
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:02,750
which just lingers like a cloud was.
We know about clouds,

295
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,720
we don't know about shit that
like sits up in the clouds,

296
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:08,630
but it's actually aluminum. It just
floats up there. Well, that's not even,

297
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,390
that's not even possible. It would
fall, would fall out of the sky.

298
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,530
It's not the same thing.

299
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,060
So I understand people's
mistrust of the government.

300
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,720
I understand that people
are, but you can't, when,

301
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:24,770
when something's explainable, you got
to explain it. You know, and it doesn't,

302
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,790
doesn't remove all the other
possibilities than the fairies doings.

303
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,230
But it does explain one thing that
people are trying to point in the wrong

304
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:35,300
direction.
And the problem is if you,

305
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:39,020
if you pointing that direction and then
people can prove that that's not what's

306
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:40,820
going on,
but you won't let it go,

307
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,250
then they're not going to listen to you
when it comes to other shitty either.

308
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,470
You know, they're gonna,
they're gonna Think,

309
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,860
oh you're that guy that believes this
shit that's kind of wacky and this is one

310
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:52,560
of those things. It's a tricky
one man. It's really tricky. Yeah.

311
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,800
Cause it looks like they're fucking
spraying artificial clouds. Right.

312
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,490
And in effect, they are making
artificial clouds. That is a fact.

313
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,280
The guy in the show that one of the
craziest moments was that he, um,

314
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:07,380
had this a test that he did this water
test and he showed that there's aluminum

315
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,570
in the water,
but you look at the test results,

316
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,070
the t like the from the lab and it
says sludge. So like, and I go, well,

317
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,010
so, so it's got dirt
in it, not just water,

318
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,340
but it says sludge like to test results,
say sludge.

319
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,310
And all sludge has aluminum in it
because all dirt has aluminum in it.

320
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,700
So it's not testing water from
aluminum that fell from the sky.

321
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,710
You're testing water
for having dirt in it,

322
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,990
which also is always has aluminum in it.
Yeah.

323
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,100
So that was a good owning
by the way. I didn't want to
own them. I look, I'll, I'll,

324
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,963
you know,
I just,

325
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,070
I wish these guys had approached some of
these things with a little bit more of

326
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:45,240
an open mind and you know,
and not just go one way or the other,

327
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,050
but that's one, one of the things we're
seeing over and over again on this show,

328
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:49,981
so people just,

329
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:52,920
they get an idea in their head and they
just fucking and run with it. Right.

330
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:56,240
I thought that that little
town or whatever city that,

331
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,410
that the sound was coming from,

332
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:01,770
I thought that was the one in the most
interesting things about the episode from

333
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:04,860
yesterday.
But did they even,

334
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,940
did you even figure out if it was
coming from that? No one can tell.

335
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,880
No one can tell. Did you hear
it? No, I didn't hear it. The,

336
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,770
the people that experienced it,

337
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,920
they said it was really bad a
couple of years ago. It got better,

338
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:18,420
but occasionally it still happens.

339
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,270
It's like this weird hum
that's in this town and they,

340
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,210
no one knows what the hell is
causing it. Whoa. Yeah. It's like,

341
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,610
it's like we lost,

342
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,470
like rattles your windows and stuff and,

343
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,710
and it's in this area of Canada
called Windsor, Ontario. It's like,

344
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,600
well documented. There's, there's
terabytes of this hum online.

345
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:39,790
Nobody could figure out what the hell
it is. And some people believe it's, uh,

346
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,820
there's a lot of like crazy conspiracies.

347
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:46,560
One of them being that it's a harp
repeater station harp is this gigantic

348
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,920
antenna array that's in Alaska that
they send radio signals up into the

349
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:53,490
ionosphere. But you know, who
knows what the hell it is.

350
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,830
There's another thing to take into
consideration that nobody was willing to

351
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,960
consider, but it is
possible that they, uh,

352
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:02,040
they dig under the ground around there
for salt, you know, and they're, uh,

353
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,320
their salt mining and they say it wasn't,
you know,

354
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,580
that wasn't happening while the sound
was going on, but, you know, I don't,

355
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,820
I don't know how the fuck do, you
know, it's a weird thing though.

356
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:13,110
There's all these people experiences.

357
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,750
It's not just like a couple
of cuckoo heads see dragons.

358
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,710
There's like a lot of people and
they record it, you know? Wow. Yeah.

359
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,544
That's pretty freaky.

360
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,240
That one guy said he had seven terabytes
that I wish you had challenged him on

361
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:28,830
that. No, no. He does. He does. He record
that shit for like the entire night.

362
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:32,520
He likes, he'll set it up. He has like
a recorder and you're like seven MP,

363
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,920
three recorder up and tape
through the night. Yeah.

364
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,630
I really believe him because he has,

365
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:40,100
he's been following this and being
an activist on this shit for you.

366
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,220
Imagine if you lived there man,

367
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:44,910
and all sudden you fucking windows are
rattling in the middle of the night. Well,

368
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,350
yeah, I would move. Fuck, well
they don't have any money.

369
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,530
I wouldn't move to if you had some money,
but if you don't have any money, man,

370
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,281
oh shit.

371
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:54,190
And you're stuck there and you can't go
to sleep and then you have to get to go

372
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,890
to work in the morning and you're fucking
exhausted because your house has been

373
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,420
humming.

374
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,010
Windsor is a pretty interesting tags.

375
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,580
That's where everybody from Ohio and
Michigan goes to get drunk when they're 18

376
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,890
because you cannot drink there before
you're 21 oh really good example clubs.

377
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,310
Yeah,
Jamie [inaudible].

378
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:15,250
It's like you go there and
you fast forward three years
of your life and you can

379
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,510
do anything you want at
18 if you just go over it.

380
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,000
Bridge. Yeah. Well Detroit
is fucking crazy, man.

381
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,740
If you never been to Detroit before,

382
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,550
I recommend going just
to see the $39 houses,

383
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,340
house houses for sale for $39 dude,

384
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,960
you could buy a house for $39 they told
us we could buy a house for $500 and I

385
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,130
thought they were fucking crazy.

386
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,300
And then someone from the Rogan
board found a house for $39 wow.

387
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,810
Jesus do. They just went bankrupt.
The entire city went bankrupt.

388
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,930
It almost seems like it's almost like
an apple stock at the very beginning.

389
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:51,340
Like we should buy all these $39 houses.
You know, like, like while they're this,

390
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,960
you know what, man, it might not come
back in your lifetime. It might be.

391
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,040
What we're seeing might be when people
find the ruins of ancient cities in the

392
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,820
past. Sometimes cities just go so
far down. They never come back.

393
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,550
Sometimes cities stick around forever.
Like Rome.

394
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,900
You could drive by the fucking
coliseum today. Somehow or another,

395
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,650
they managed to keep some form of a
society around in that area for all these

396
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,880
years. It changed. It morphed, but there's
still people there. They still a society,

397
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,600
but fucking Detroit is
close. It's close, man.

398
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:27,440
It's 47% illiteracy rate.
47 47% illiteracy rate.

399
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,800
Yeah. It's crazy. I mean, it is,

400
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,750
it is one of the craziest places
in the world and it's in America.

401
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,700
It's a place that used to thrive.

402
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,510
Think about like the fifties
and sixties like the,

403
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,610
the roaring times for the auto industry.

404
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,180
They're making fucking 69 Chevy's and
everybody's making money and his union

405
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,800
workers and everyone's getting paid well,

406
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,790
and then all of a sudden somewhere along
the line jams like, we're out of here,

407
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,000
dog. We're going to take our shit to
Mexico. We're going to make cars in China.

408
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:57,760
We're going to, you guys cost too
much money. We're tired of this shit.

409
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,680
And they pull out and it's catastrophic.
Oh yeah. I mean, you seem Roger and me,

410
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,090
uh, the Michael Moore. Yeah. Yeah, I
think so. Yeah. It's all about that.

411
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:08,500
It's all about Flint,
Michigan.

412
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,480
It's all about the watching these towns
implode when the jobs aren't there

413
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:18,040
anymore. The Luda jobs literally pull
out of the community and Poof, that's it.

414
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:20,890
They're gone. And then everybody's
like, oh my God, how do I eat?

415
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,650
And then it's fucking crazy
that's going on, right.

416
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,770
The city where I'm from, uh, just
got ranked. I, there was an article,

417
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:31,580
I tweeted the number one most
dilapidated city or something like that,

418
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:35,750
and it used to be the number one steel
producing city for the entire world.

419
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:39,710
And they built it there because it was
so cloudy that back in the day satellites

420
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:43,850
couldn't see through clouds. Oh my God.
So they built it all in Youngstown, Ohio,

421
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,800
which has the weird lake effect.

422
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:49,640
So there's always clouds over
where I'm from pretty much. And uh,

423
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,410
and um, so the whole steel
industry was there and then it, uh,

424
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,810
it's nothing. I mean, it, there is
nothing there now. That's incredible.

425
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,730
It's really wild. It was a big, big,
big steel producing city and uh,

426
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,090
and Mafia town. And they got rid of
the mafia and the nineties and steel,

427
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,340
like the seventies super mafia
town. Yeah, that's actually a

428
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,230
what my parents, uh, my parents
were in that business before.

429
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,190
Um, they did some shady
stuff. Family things. Yeah,

430
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,790
they were, they were almost, almost
everybody that my parents knew as well.

431
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,240
They knew them from being, you
know, in some kind of business.

432
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:34,260
Like my mom for example, ran
numbers, you know, number running.

433
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:36,850
It's like a form of racketeering
and the illegal lottery.

434
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,650
So she would be the center
person of this entire thing.

435
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:46,300
All the people that would call in
their numbers would call her and uh,

436
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,100
and that's what just what she did.

437
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,580
Wow. That's incredible. Yeah. My uh,

438
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,460
grandmother went to jail for
numbers running. Really? Yeah.

439
00:24:54,461 --> 00:24:56,740
She apparently got caught.
You know,

440
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,680
what she would do was she'd be
like the go between or something.

441
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:02,500
She would like move things, you
know, I was like a job I guess.

442
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,920
And they arrested her and she
didn't want to rat anybody out.

443
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,190
So she spent like six
months in jail. Wow. Yeah.

444
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:11,680
I didn't even know about it until
I was like in my twenties you know,

445
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:13,900
my mom never told us about it.
Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah.

446
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,910
She had no choice but to tell
me because when I was a kid,

447
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:19,460
you know how when you're a kid and the
phone rings, you try to pick it up. Hello.

448
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:23,960
Well people would ask for a,
for Gina and my mom's name, joy.

449
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,220
So when they're like, hello
is Gina, is Gina, is Gina
available? No, Gina lives here.

450
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,590
Sorry. And I remember one
day I told my mom, I go, mom,

451
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,570
people keep calling asking for Gina.
She goes,

452
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,870
what are you doing with these phone calls?
What do you mean? And like, you know,

453
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,850
cause she obviously she
was missing business.

454
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:42,170
I was just being a little
kid being helpful. No, Gina
here. Sorry. Oh Wow. But uh,

455
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,910
and so very young,

456
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:47,150
I had to realize what she
was doing because also she
was on the phone a lot and

457
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:49,430
she would be repeating back
these numbers to people.

458
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,410
And there's like all this terminology
and stuff like Po and box and all these

459
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:56,360
different things like that.
Straight or boxed,

460
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:59,720
which means like straight means you're
picking three numbers in a row, like four,

461
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:03,950
six, seven and box means you
could have four, six, seven
but if it comes out seven,

462
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:07,370
four, six or six, four, seven
or whatever you win either way.

463
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:10,100
So there's all this terminology. So
you'd hear on the phone three, three,

464
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,450
four force it cause she would repeat back
the numbers that they just gave her to

465
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:18,290
confirm. So it's like
unbelievable. Wow. Yeah.

466
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,610
So that's who you grew up in
that environment. Did you,

467
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,230
did you ever see anything like dangerous
or was it just like gambling type stuff?

468
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,170
Nothing dangerous ever.
The closest thing that, uh,

469
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,590
the closest thing that I had
a weird feeling about when
I was a kid was one time

470
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,900
my dad came to visit
cause I lived with my mom.

471
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:35,940
So my dad would just come
in and visit sometimes.

472
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:39,480
And the weirdest thing was he came
in, came over when the day with a, uh,

473
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:43,380
with a cast on, with a cast on his hand.
And I'm like, how'd you break hand?

474
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:44,214
And I remember

475
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,040
my mom looking at him weird and
him looking at her, we, I don't,

476
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:51,320
I still don't know exactly what happened
with the, with a broken hand. But I mean,

477
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:55,620
I don't know. It could be
like a punishment. He could've
beat somebody up. He was,

478
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,430
he owned a restaurant, uh, at
the time. So it's not like he,

479
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,200
he didn't do, he didn't and he wasn't
the hands on guy at the restaurant.

480
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,690
I don't know how he broke his hand.
Yeah.

481
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:10,560
We're going to have to leave that one
to yeah, yeah, yeah. Suspicions. Yeah.

482
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:11,394
It'd be nice to,

483
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,960
Alicia didn't like make something up like
to fill in the blank to make the story

484
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:20,250
better. Right. No, exactly.
I keep it real. Yeah.

485
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:24,090
Isn't it weird when you really stop and
think about how little our parents knew

486
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:25,080
about the world?

487
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,000
Like now that we live in this really
strange place where we're finding out like

488
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,110
pretty, you mean you just ask your
phone and it's in a lancer, you almost,

489
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:38,250
any question you can come up with and you
just think about growing up and having

490
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:41,760
kids and living your whole life
without that and you're like, my God.

491
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,350
Like is that even society?
Was that even civilization?

492
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,420
Wow. Our poor fucking parents.
It's unbelievable. They
were lucky they had phones.

493
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,690
Oh yeah. They really, where there's apes.

494
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,210
I know the evolution of everything's
crazy. I just found out there's a,

495
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,820
a high school district in La in which
all the kids are getting iPads now.

496
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:06,780
So they upload all their information on
the IPAD and that's their only book send

497
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:07,920
out.
They're done with books.

498
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:12,660
And think about how many tons of pounds
of books we carried on our shoulders.

499
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:14,760
His kids for no reason.
There's a jet,

500
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,070
there's generations to come that
will never know that feeling.

501
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,690
They're going to look at us like,

502
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:20,940
what do you mean you were
carrying books around?

503
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,930
It doesn't make any p tons of
paper stacked on top. What is that?

504
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:29,430
Why would you do that? I don't get
it as they scan through nothingness.

505
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:30,264
You know what I mean?

506
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,820
It's thinking about that the other
day about how paper and books,

507
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:37,530
it's just going to be this and take well
how are you starting to see like some

508
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:41,700
of these different phones that are
coming out that allow you to answer and

509
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:46,290
scroll and do things without actually
touching the phone and that when you look

510
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:50,460
away from the phone like it
changes the way the phone behave.

511
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,450
Look at it. Yeah. Yes for does that. Yeah.

512
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,480
I think three also where you could just
wave your hand over to like answer our

513
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:59,030
phone call as well. I don't
know. The four does though.

514
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,900
There's a lot of like weird
shit's happening was like
the ability to like just

515
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:06,790
conjure things up out of the air with
your hands and your, your you'll looks,

516
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,930
it just doesn't seem like a
good idea because he's like,

517
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:09,950
give me like laying in bed,

518
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,580
like phone ringing and you like with wave
over it now you just have a video call

519
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:15,200
and your Dick's just like
in the, you know, like,

520
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:17,990
it just seems like a problem
for Brian, right? Yeah.

521
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,910
If you sleep with your
Dick next to your phone,

522
00:29:19,911 --> 00:29:24,350
you'd have pull your dick out every time
the phone rings just on instinct. Oh,

523
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:28,760
we doing this? Okay, we're doing
this. You want to do this? Yeah. No,

524
00:29:28,761 --> 00:29:31,850
I think that what I was getting
at is that, uh, it's, it's,

525
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,880
it's going to get weird
and to live the human

526
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,090
computer, human information interface
is going to get weirder and weirder.

527
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,000
It's the, who knows what the
limit is way. This is going to be

528
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
a bit something implant or
something. Oh yeah, totally.

529
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:49,130
Something you see,
you scrolling through things,

530
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,300
there's going to be a point to even wear
wearing a lens or something is going to

531
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:54,950
be like, oh look, that's peppers
and still wearing the lens.

532
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,820
No balls to get a fucking operation buddy.
Right?

533
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,370
You're afraid of neural implant starts,

534
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,210
they'll do something to your
eye and then they realize no,

535
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:03,880
you really got to get to their
cerebral cortex itself. Right.

536
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,880
So it'd be like it'd be looking at
people like they pierce their ears.

537
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,450
Did you get your brain peers?
Yeah,

538
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,510
just going right down the
factory line in the baby ward,

539
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,353
whatever those are called.

540
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,990
Duncan and I were talking about this and
we both agree that there's gonna come a

541
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:20,290
time where you're probably not gonna
use your regular memory anymore,

542
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,850
that you regularly memory will be
replaced by some sort of internal digital

543
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:25,684
storage,

544
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,670
which can record everything you
see in total real time HD. Right?

545
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:34,690
I mean that's pretty pretty likely to
be what we're dealing with in the future

546
00:30:34,691 --> 00:30:37,090
and then we're going to swap hard drives
and shit and I'm going to be able to

547
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:39,700
watch 20 inch clamp. It
really is. It's going to be,

548
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,140
it's going to be like the Matrix, how
they just upload information. Yeah.

549
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,310
It seems like it's inevitable. They've
already figured out a way to um, uh,

550
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,370
put artificial memories in a mouse.
Have you heard of that? Yeah.

551
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,480
Yeah.
They figured out a way to do that to mice.

552
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,140
They figured out a way to somehow or
another install and artificial memory in a

553
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:03,360
mouse and they also figured out how
to make a cat's tail move without a,

554
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,370
actually like a man with a brain thing
on can make a cat's tail move wirelessly

555
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,730
somehow or another. I need
to do that. Man. That sounds
awesome. It's fucking nuts.

556
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,710
I put it up on Twitter. If you could find
it. It was within the last day or two.

557
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:21,850
Maybe Jamie can help you. The, uh, the
story is a, it's pretty fucking freaky.

558
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,950
The ability to control another thing.
Me Even it's just a cat with your brain.

559
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,020
What the fuck is going
to happen in the future?

560
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:32,410
People are going to force people to
walk into their houses and blow them and

561
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,140
having your pet will be a
totally different experience.

562
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:37,190
Like that would be like your warrior.
Like all right Kat,

563
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,360
go in the kitchen and see if
there's anybody there like your,

564
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,790
cause if you could make the cat tail move
totally in 20 years you'll be able to

565
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,500
control your cat.
So your animal,

566
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:48,160
your dog or pit bull or whatever would
now be like your weapon or like your Hawk

567
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,900
as a needle, like a pirate. Especially
when you could kind of do that enough.

568
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,370
You train your dog really well,

569
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,210
but you might be able to control it
with your mind and see through its eyes,

570
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,590
eyes and feel. It's, it's some game of
Thrones anyway. Yeah. That would be crazy.

571
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,770
When you imagine if you killed somebody
with your dog and then there'd be like

572
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:09,550
some crazy legal thing. Like it wasn't my
idea. The dog went fucking crazy. Okay.

573
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,850
I'm trying to control the dog with the
brain. I'm just not that good at it yet.

574
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,130
The dog went crazy and killed the burglar.
Okay,

575
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:20,131
I'm not a murderer or we're having like
an eagle or having some kind of huge

576
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:24,510
bird or a gorilla. Like you
can control animals that, yeah,

577
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,220
well they, you can control a few animals
to do a few things, you know, like they,

578
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:33,580
have you ever seen those videos of
Mongols? This is the, uh, the brain.

579
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:35,290
Harvard creates brain to brain interface,

580
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:39,000
allowing humans to control other
animals with thoughts alone. Wow.

581
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,730
Hitting these Zale entails hooked up to
this thing and he figured out a way to

582
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:50,830
make the tail move so we can already
have the cat's tail answer, uh,

583
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,090
galaxy three phone.
So it's,

584
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,680
it seems like it's just a matter of
time before you're able to control

585
00:32:57,681 --> 00:33:00,980
everything the cat does.
And then that'll be like version one.

586
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:05,210
And then eventually virgin too will be,
you'll be able to see what the cat sees.

587
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,520
Wow. It's crazy. It's fucked up wild.

588
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,260
That's what it's turning
into human beings. Uh,

589
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,970
just wanting to be cats and stuff just
because they may like the cats. Like, Hey,

590
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:21,080
where's this guy? Can I be a
human? It's so crazy, so crazy.

591
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,760
It's all so crazy. It's weird. It's so
crazy. It's weird because you wonder like,

592
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:29,130
where is this going and there's no
way to know or else we would. Well,

593
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,880
it seems like it is not going to stop.

594
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,090
It's just going to get more and
more invasive. More and more.

595
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:40,150
You're going to be able to do all kinds
of really strange things within the next

596
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,590
few years or they're going to someone,

597
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:47,400
whoever has that kind of technology
controlling a fucking cat's tail. Jay's.

598
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,380
Dot.
This is awesome.

599
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,850
Have you ever seen those videos of the
Mongols that hunt wolves with the eagles?

600
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,660
Holy Shit, dude. Golden Wool.

601
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,980
Golden Eagles might be the most gangster
animal on the planet because they do

602
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:05,981
not give two fucks about a wolf and
they swooped down and kill a wolf.

603
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,310
What their out their talents. I showed
it to Steve Vanilla. He's a hunter.

604
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:12,860
He's just got that show of meat eater.
He's unimpressed.

605
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,930
He said they were more
coyote looking wolves.

606
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,460
There weren't the biggest
wolves in the world,

607
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:20,870
which I'll give you that there's
still fucking wolves, right bird.

608
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,940
Think about that. You weigh about
140 pounds. Tony Hinchcliffe.

609
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,040
Could you imagine if you had to kill a
60 pound wolf with your fucking teeth?

610
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,000
Now you have to tackle wolf and
then kill it with your face.

611
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,040
You know how the w, you know an
eagle weighs 25 pounds and it does.

612
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:41,660
That swoops in and Jack's a
fucking wolf with its face,

613
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:46,100
clings onto the back of this
thing, attacks it and, and
takes it out cold quick.

614
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,100
Watch this shit. Watch this shit.
You got it. No, no. Pull it up.

615
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,820
Mongols hunt with eagles. It's
going to trip you out, man.

616
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:57,150
I watched this once a month. The Eagle
comes back to the Mongol. Yup. Kills the,

617
00:34:57,151 --> 00:35:00,140
he kills the wolf and then they
use the wolf. Are they buy them?

618
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,140
They take their first. Wow. They
make like hats out of them and shit.

619
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,100
I don't understand why the Eagle
does that. Cause they're gangster.

620
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,580
They don't give a fuck. Watch this
shit. This is really trippy, man.

621
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,090
Look at this fucking bird.

622
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:17,950
This is agent of death
soaring dinosaur of death.

623
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,170
Watch this.
Bam Bitch.

624
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,690
Just that wolf knows it's coming to.
It fucks him up so quick.

625
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,370
It just gets those claws around its
neck and it's a wrap within seconds.

626
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:31,204
[inaudible]

627
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,830
look at that heartless motherfucker.
Watch this shit.

628
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,170
The wolves running is poor wolf was like,
oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

629
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:48,060
This guy just let's this
monster loose off of his arm.

630
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,403
Okay.

631
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,940
And it knows exactly what to do.

632
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,620
The Wolf is running and the Eagle
just count. The Wolf was like, oh,

633
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:58,830
fuck my life.
Fuck my life.

634
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,650
Look at that thing, man. Ego Sung this
song. I wish that Eagle Sung the song.

635
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,820
I love the eagles.

636
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,000
Welcome to the the phone.
Watch this.

637
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,070
Bam Bitch,
man.

638
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,940
It just takes them out within seconds.

639
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,220
It's incredible how lethal these things
are. That's why I look at those dudes.

640
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,350
What a dumb way to dress
Lilly.

641
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,740
I can train an eagle to kill a wolf,
still wearing a toilet.

642
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:37,050
Paper rolls on their
heads and it's straight.

643
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:38,760
I guess it's cold as fuck there though.

644
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,990
You know they probably need all that
stupid shit on just to stay alive. Yeah.

645
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,530
Just think of how much time it must take
to train a fucking eagle to kill a wolf.

646
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:51,060
Like how many eagles did you let go
and they never came back. How many,

647
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,440
how many eagles did you let go and
be like, bitch, I'm not killing.

648
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:58,260
I won't even know that. Well Fuck you man.
Right? Flying South. It's cold up here.

649
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,200
I wonder if the eagles just can't help
themselves and when something is running

650
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:05,610
they just go get it. You know, I wonder
if it's that this is terrifying animals.

651
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,860
I saw one the other day in Seattle,
so fucking Eagle,

652
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,220
they have eagles up there and
it had something in his hands.

653
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,910
That one got something,
some sort of fish or something.

654
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,950
I've been noticing a lot of
parrots lately in Burbank,

655
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,270
just like real mobs of parrots
like flying over my like,

656
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,410
like for 20 the other day and
they're all green with like the red.

657
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,070
It's like how Florida has pythons lose
cause people let them go right in Burbank.

658
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:32,660
It's parents. I fucking hate my bird
opened the window, get out pitch right.

659
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,260
There was a friend who lives up
here in Calabasas and he, he has,

660
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:40,440
he lives on like the place where they
film true blood. Like, it's, it's huge,

661
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,910
huge mansion type thing.

662
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,270
But he was talking about the other day
how a tarantula somehow God was in him.

663
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,280
Like he has the crazy,

664
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:50,800
he lives on this crazy like
humongous thing in the mountain.

665
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:54,390
So you know the caliber or Santa Monica
Mountains and there's all these weird

666
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:57,660
things like, like, like lizards
and snakes. But when he got,

667
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,880
had a tranche let in his, in his bedroom
the other day and he's like, well,

668
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:01,810
I don't know how the fuck it got.

669
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,430
Yeah, there's Tarantulas in
California. It's creating,

670
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,710
get him anywhere in the La area. I like
people that live in the Hollywood hills,

671
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,610
you know when they have a problem with
the Hollywood hills rats. Yeah, I see.

672
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:14,310
I see tons of Burbank. I know a
story. I don't know if it's true,

673
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:17,070
but I'll tell it anyway
about Sylvester Stallone,

674
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:19,620
apparently that someone went to
a Sylvester Stallone's house.

675
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,490
He had a house in the Hollywood
hills and when they were,

676
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,670
he had a movie theater and he told them,
he goes,

677
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,780
put your feet up when you watch the
movie because we have rats. Like what?

678
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,790
Like they couldn't get rid of the rats.

679
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,930
The rats were just like so infested in
the hills up there that you would have,

680
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:36,070
I'm like running through your house.
Sometimes

681
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,620
they ran on the power lines outside.

682
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,330
Like I'll sit out back and you just see
rats running on it and then one time a

683
00:38:42,331 --> 00:38:44,910
rat came up and stepped on my
foot or something like that.

684
00:38:44,911 --> 00:38:49,470
And I will you barefoot? Yeah.
Oh my. I uh, through my laptop.

685
00:38:49,471 --> 00:38:52,470
It was like the first time I had bought
a new Mac book and I opened it up for

686
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:55,740
the first time and I'm looking at like,
oh, look how nice and sexy this is.

687
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:00,210
Rat right on foot throws laptop
up in the air, falls down. No,

688
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:05,060
it fell down to break. No, luckily
just landed fine. Build quality.

689
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,530
Yeah. Powerful IPOD,
iPhone, apple product pitch.

690
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,890
Yeah. Um, rats were fucking gross.

691
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,960
They've carried disgusting disease
is to have those fucks. Oh, they,

692
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:19,640
the black plague came from a rats
carrying a tick, I think, I think,

693
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,060
or a flea or something like that.
I think that's what it was. Right.

694
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,903
Something like that.

695
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,180
I think it was some sort of a parasitic
thing that rats were carrying bugs gave

696
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:28,630
them,

697
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,250
well it's so gross and I'm one
of those people where like if I,

698
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:35,540
if I were to see a rat or a cockroach
where I live, I would just move. Well

699
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,540
that's one of the realities of
living in New York City. You know,

700
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:39,740
if you want to live in New York City,

701
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:41,960
you're going to see roaches and you're
going to see rats if you're paying

702
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:45,950
attention. When I lived in New York, there
was one time I never lived in the city.

703
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:48,350
I lived in new Rochelle,
which is like just outside the city,

704
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:51,950
like outside of the Bronx,
little suburb, Westchester. Um,

705
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,190
I parked my car at this gas station and
it was back when there was payphones.

706
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,430
I didn't have a car phone. I had to make
a call. I had to like get out of the car.

707
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,000
So I'm making a call on this payphone.
As my car is parked,

708
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:07,190
I'm watching rats jump on top of
the tires and climb up into the car.

709
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,230
I'm watching them and I'm like,
what the fuck? I mean, not one,

710
00:40:12,231 --> 00:40:16,070
like three, four, five. They just
kept doing it, looking for food,

711
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,300
like the car parked.

712
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,570
So they jumped on the back tire that run
over the top of the tire to run under

713
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:20,961
the car.

714
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:23,690
They ran up into the engine compartment
and sometimes they just stay in the

715
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:24,291
engine department.

716
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:28,140
You're fucking fan tears them apart cause
they're stupid heads are in there and

717
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:29,590
you start the car up

718
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,140
and fucking you open up the hood and just
splatter everywhere because I'm stupid

719
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:39,860
rat got inside of your fan. Yeah
man. They look for food everywhere.

720
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:43,340
They'll burrow the themselves and the
little tiny holes to try to search for

721
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:47,270
something that might be food. That's
Yonkers. Yeah, well it was actually,

722
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:50,450
that was in Manhattan. It was in New
York City. Uh, I'll never forget it.

723
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:52,730
I was just like, what? What the fuck?

724
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:56,390
And then when you find out that there's
this many rats in New York City as there

725
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:58,740
are people,
there's this,

726
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,490
there's 7 million people in New York City.

727
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:06,110
So there's 7 million rats in New York
City. Imagine controlling those rats.

728
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,180
They really have a hard time.
I think a lot of them drowned in Sandy.

729
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:15,170
I think a lot of, uh, those underground
layers and shit drown because, uh,

730
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:20,350
Shane Smith did a video once read af
after sandy a video about the possibility

731
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,320
superstorms increasing and
like a river of dead rats,

732
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:28,850
like flowed by him as he was a, as you're
standing there talking, I was like,

733
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,820
Holy Shit, you thing,

734
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,070
the thing that scared

735
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,930
me when I moved here was a,

736
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:40,110
I lived in Burbank when I first got
here and the Black Widows, oh yeah.

737
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,150
First it's like almost a normal spider
until you really look at that belly and

738
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:46,350
you see that red diamond thing.
Yeah.

739
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,160
That's the part where you're just
like this fucking thing. And it's,

740
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,010
it's interesting how nature
sort of a warns you about like,

741
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,290
I like I've read things about snakes.
If you see like red, yellow, black,

742
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:02,600
and that spider, that red diamond,
I mean if you look at it, it really,

743
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,660
it's like a warning sign, right?
Yeah. You're totally right.

744
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,110
It's incredible how nature,
uh, does that stuff.

745
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:12,320
You know what else I saw recently
is a thing about how butterflies,

746
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,360
if you look at a,

747
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,340
if you look at butterflies that
are around area where snakes are,

748
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,020
when their wings are up and they're just
chilling, most of them look like snakes.

749
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:24,030
Like if you look up a
butterfly snake, uh, Eh,

750
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,300
I mean it's unbelievable.

751
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:30,670
Wow. That makes sense. So
then any intruder that comes
by, it's like, oh shit.

752
00:42:30,671 --> 00:42:35,470
A snake instead of a look at this pussy
butterfly I'm about to eat. You know?

753
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,200
That's interesting. It's
really incredible. Yeah. It's,

754
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,170
it's weird when you see animals that
have figured out how to mimic their

755
00:42:41,171 --> 00:42:42,760
environment, you know, like,

756
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:47,761
have you ever seen octopus or Octopi
that change their shape and their look to

757
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:50,480
look exactly like the environment?
Well,

758
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,490
look at these crazy looking butterflies
that totally looks like a snake. Right?

759
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,660
That's incredible. Yup. Oh
my God. That's what they do.

760
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:02,740
That's amazing. Yeah. Wow.
Folks who view of, you're not,

761
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,820
obviously you don't watch most people
listening. There's a, what is the,

762
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:08,350
the Google that you go let her
fly snake butterflies. Snake.

763
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,170
There's one that looks like
these two fucking syrup.

764
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,720
It actually several that looked like it,

765
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,190
but they look like these two serpent
heads right next to each other. I mean,

766
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:21,100
exactly under the underside.

767
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:25,960
It's all looks that corner
one. Oh my God. That's amazing.

768
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:27,490
That's incredible.

769
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,210
Seen this by the way. You'll notice
that in actually a lot of butterflies.

770
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,700
It's not,
it's not necessarily a rare thing at all.

771
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:36,250
I'm pretty sure if they ever see a snake,
they're pretty much like,

772
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:37,084
well that's what I want.

773
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,760
That's amazing. That is really
amazing. It looks just like it.

774
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:47,670
Now look up. Um, octopus
camouflage, octopus camouflage.

775
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:49,230
He's really weird man,

776
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,450
because they also think that they
don't just look at that fucking,

777
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,150
it looks like a butterfly. We're looking
at the tip of the butterflies wound.

778
00:43:57,151 --> 00:44:00,570
That looks like a snake. I mean it has
an eyeball and even has a nose. Yup.

779
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,900
It's like Steve Harvey
has a mouth immediately.

780
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:07,080
It's a beautiful tattoo of a
snake. Yeah. And it's the softest,

781
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:10,080
most precious,
easy to kill animal in the world.

782
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:14,700
Butterfly of all the things. Yeah.
They're like, they're like man, a mush.

783
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,640
I mean they're softer than a fly there.
A butterfly.

784
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:22,200
Like they were like a tissue flies,
right?

785
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:29,690
Octopus or Octopi can blend in with their
surroundings and they also think that

786
00:44:30,781 --> 00:44:31,980
they,
their

787
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,760
ability to change shape on the
outside of the camouflage. Look,

788
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:41,090
they think they use that also to
communicate that it's not just,

789
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,510
um, that, that is
incredible. It's incredible.

790
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,490
We're looking at this octopus
that's completely blended
in with this white floor

791
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,290
and there's also been ones
that have eaten sharks.

792
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,270
They had a problem at this aquarium
where they're sharks started missing and

793
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:04,320
they would find like shark carcasses. So
they're like, what the fuck is going on?

794
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:08,850
What's eating at shark? And so they
watched this video, they set up a camera,

795
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,750
see there's a video of it. Brian's
even go watch it if you could find it.

796
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,550
But it's,
they do it on a regular basis.

797
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:19,170
Like apparently octopus are
smart as fuck or Octopi.

798
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,130
And they set up this camera and um,

799
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,160
they watched this octopus just sit there
completely camouflaged and as his shock

800
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:32,700
flies by him over the years.
But when the keepers here

801
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,750
decided to move one into a larger
tank with sharks and other big fish,

802
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,240
they assumed that the octopuses strength
and camouflage would keep it safe.

803
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,980
Is it turned out they
went tragically mistaken.

804
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,150
Watch the sharks got a gun.
It's Chardonnay though.

805
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,140
So you see this thing swimming.

806
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:11,563
Watch this shit

807
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,760
like the shark has no idea that
octopus is there dies in evil looking

808
00:46:16,761 --> 00:46:19,850
motherfucker, white eyes, wide eyes,

809
00:46:19,851 --> 00:46:22,610
completely camouflages
with his environment.

810
00:46:22,611 --> 00:46:26,090
You're waiting for that motherfucker
to get clothes. Watch this.

811
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,890
It's like bitch, I got you. My God.

812
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,590
So bad ass.
And you know they have like teeth,

813
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:42,720
like little beaks on the end of their,
of their check suction cups. Yeah.

814
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:46,350
It's like sharp, like little cat. Yeah.

815
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:51,000
They found giant ones in a
fossil and that they believe it.

816
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:55,800
It could possibly be evidence for a
cracking the idea of a crack and it's like

817
00:46:55,801 --> 00:46:59,010
an ancient mythology idea of
a chai and octopus that would

818
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,980
take out ships and kill people.

819
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,520
And they always thought
it was just mythology and
horseshit until they recently

820
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:09,420
found these giant fucking
suction cups and fossils.

821
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,170
And then they realize, oh
yeah, if the, if octopus die,

822
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,970
they don't live behind anything.

823
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,720
It's not like they're not like
a person leaves behind a skull.

824
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:23,190
The octopus are mollusks this movable,
you know,

825
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,340
sort of weird flexible material
and all they have is like a beak.

826
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:32,410
And that gets eaten by things like
really quickly. So if they die,

827
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,700
like you don't find shit,

828
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,880
but somehow or another someone died and
the imprint of it's suction cups left a

829
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:43,030
mark on the floor and they're enormous.
And so in looking at these,

830
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:47,590
they were like, oh my God. Like
this was a massive octopus.

831
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,400
Like something that was just
impossibly large. Oh Wow. Look at this.

832
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,370
The octopus got this cat's face.
The cat got gangster and the,

833
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,610
the octopus locked on its face and
it's fucking this cat up. Look at this.

834
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:05,530
Oh my God. It's like alien, like an alien
face hugger. Octopussy is that a, um,

835
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,800
a vine? So what that is? Give a gift.

836
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,260
That's hilarious. Yeah. The cat
cat. You think you're clever?

837
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:16,120
Octopuses are so smart.
They've,

838
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:19,330
they've had videos that they've taken
of them on security cameras where they

839
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:22,960
climb out of a fish tank and go across
the floor and climb into another fish

840
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:27,130
tank and then eat the
fish and then climb back.

841
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,580
Like guy was missing like these expensive,
efficient as fish tank. He's like,

842
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:31,630
what the fuck is going on?

843
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:36,640
So he set up his camera to look his fish
tank and he watched his octopus climb

844
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:40,840
out of his fucking fish tank, walk across
the floor, climb up the other fish,

845
00:48:40,841 --> 00:48:44,530
stand the tank, stand climbing into
the tank, lift the lid off of it.

846
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,570
Jackfish kill it,

847
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:51,370
walk across the street how back into
his tank and go to sleep. I mean,

848
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,780
Jesus Christ, it's what the fuck
are those things believable?

849
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,570
What are those things? Have you
seen this? What is this? A bear

850
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:02,650
bear, uh, getting into a
dumpster behind a restaurant,

851
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,350
walking up to the back of the restaurant
and there's this big humongous green

852
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,890
dumpster, you know, full of
old meats and stuff like that.

853
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:15,520
Probably smart ass bear
goes around the side of it.

854
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,450
Let me see if I can fast forward
it. Where did this take place? Um,

855
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,290
I forget it.

856
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:26,740
He starts going through it and then he
does something amazing coming up right

857
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:31,130
here. He's taking the whole entire
dumpster and walking with it.

858
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,080
The Fuck Gotti.
Wow.

859
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:39,940
And uh, yeah, if you keep on going,
he actually starts pulling it, uh,

860
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,970
around the corner.

861
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,870
Oh my God.
Tom Credible.

862
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,680
And that's like a humongous dumsor.
That's like a double wide dumpster.

863
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:55,580
Bears are so swollen. Then he comes back
for the strong, I should say what? Um,

864
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,050
then he comes back.
Where does it say this is a,

865
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,440
let's see. Uh, do you do, do,

866
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,140
it doesn't say it's just, Oh, Denver.

867
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:09,790
Denver totally makes sense.

868
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:13,690
You know what's interesting is that they
have a real problem when bears find out

869
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:17,470
they can do that. They always come back.
Like once a bear eats your garbage,

870
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:19,690
you got to call somebody,
you got a real problem.

871
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:22,720
They either have to shoot it or they have
to figure out a way to put it in a zoo

872
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:25,630
or do something because once it knows it,
can he get garbage.

873
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:26,950
It just keeps eating your garbage.

874
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:31,130
So if you live in a community that has
bears and you have that asshole neighbor

875
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:35,210
that leaves pizza boxes and is fucking
garbage is sitting out there and a bear

876
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:37,100
finds out about it,
you're Foxville.

877
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:40,540
I'm so glad I don't live near big animals.
When I was in Texas,

878
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,860
they introduced me to the goats
and these fucking things are crazy.

879
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:49,300
He's a little goats that I thought were
all cute and just like adorable or head

880
00:50:49,301 --> 00:50:53,740
butting each other at full. They're like,
Tony, get on it and there goes, hey,

881
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:57,820
these goats get on in there and I am just,
I'm just not,

882
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,260
not the guy to be in
there with goats like,

883
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,240
oh look at the little La
Pussy boy with the goats.

884
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:08,750
Look how scared he charge
things or animals. Yeah,
absolutely. Who wants to have it

885
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,740
fist fight with a kid?
A house cat.

886
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:14,280
Do you want to have a fist fight
with a house cat? No. Fuck No.

887
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:17,570
I'm a lot bigger than a house cat, but
I wouldn't want to fuck with one. Right?

888
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:21,660
Yeah. That cat was jumping
off the furniture trying to
claw your eyes out. Yeah.

889
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,520
It gets scary animals. It's
just so different than people.
You don't want to fuck.

890
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,400
I got a little goat. I got home late
the other night, even little Twix.

891
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:33,790
He scared me. You know Brian's little
dog, little white, perfect little baby.

892
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,910
But I can,
but I know I came home late.

893
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:41,230
It's all dark and my living room and I
see something on the couch like looking

894
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,660
at me. I'm like, what the fuck is that?

895
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:48,661
Because normally Trixie's blocked
him probably about a 9.9 and uh,

896
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,320
but uh,

897
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,190
but normally she's blocked off upstairs
and stays up there throughout the night.

898
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:57,270
So this thing was on the couch and
I could see it just standing out.

899
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,780
I got really concerned.
I'm like,

900
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:01,240
what kind of fucking and am I know
that's an animal looking at me.

901
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,940
I flipped on the light and it's
the cutest dog in the world,

902
00:52:03,941 --> 00:52:07,270
but I was really scared. I'm
like, what kind of white is that?

903
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:10,780
Like an all an albino raccoon that
somehow climb through a window?

904
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:12,790
I S my brain just started flying.

905
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,000
Well, somebody left their door open.
It was a photo that was taken. Um,

906
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,630
where was that? Was that you, Jamie?

907
00:52:18,631 --> 00:52:21,930
Did you find that there a photo taken
of a coyote that was in someone's house?

908
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,930
No, somebody showed it to
me in an email. A coyote,

909
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,370
a snuck into someone's house and I
think it was in boulder and just,

910
00:52:29,371 --> 00:52:30,360
it was like in their house.

911
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:33,000
So they opened up the front door and they
see a coyote is sitting in their house

912
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:37,020
and they're like, oh Jesus Christ. How
do you get this fucking thing out? Right.

913
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,280
Did you see the mountain lion that
was a in the guy's garage? No. Yeah.

914
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:44,610
Look up mountain lion and garage and
in Colorado these guys had like a

915
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:46,890
confrontation with the
Mountain Lion Mountain Lion,

916
00:52:46,891 --> 00:52:51,540
like ran right past this guy and into a
corner and the guy goes into the corner,

917
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,780
try to chase a mountain lion out and
the mount line runs past him again.

918
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,300
And you watch this,
you on what the fuck

919
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:00,520
things are happening in Colorado.
They in and they just legalized pot.

920
00:53:00,521 --> 00:53:03,430
It sounds like the last thing you'd
want after getting really stone,

921
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,790
I'm going to go to the garage, grabbed a
soda. I'm high as fuck. Oh, this is it.

922
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,200
Yeah.
This

923
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,560
is exactly it. So these guys, they
saw the cat. There it is. Look

924
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,220
in the yelling at it like,
oh Jesus.

925
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,750
They're going after it and then look,
he steps in there.

926
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,800
She's not back yet and it's going
to run past it. Look at this.

927
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:29,940
Whoa. And he kicked it as it ran. Pastor.
That is nuts, man. Look at that thing. Go.

928
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:34,010
Wow. That's so crazy, man.

929
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,750
They weren't scared of that shit
at all. Yeah, those are hunters.

930
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,320
They were all wearing cammo does see
that there are hunters probably. Yeah,

931
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,930
but still you should be scared.
So thing decides to jump you.

932
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:46,080
You have problems with mine.
Totally. You've got problems.

933
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,070
I don't get that leverage.

934
00:53:47,071 --> 00:53:50,220
You can't choke out a mountain lion
quite as easily as you can a human.

935
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:53,490
The thing about mountain lions, those,
there's so much food in Colorado,

936
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:56,970
there's so many animals for them to eat
so many rabbits and deer to so much for

937
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:57,804
them.
To Jack.

938
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:58,801
They don't really care.

939
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:00,780
You could just probably have a
spray bottle with those guys.

940
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,170
Just sit back and chill.
Puppy. Come here, puppy.

941
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:09,830
Did you see the clip of
Steve Harvey? Uh, uh,

942
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,330
bringing up marijuana on family feud?

943
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,740
Oh No.

944
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:17,900
Well, yeah, it's pretty
funny. Check this out. Hi.

945
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:23,120
We got them top success named
something that gets passed around.

946
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,190
Oh,

947
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,940
Chris,
a joint.

948
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:32,540
Joel [inaudible] look at Steve
Harvey's in questioning closes.

949
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:38,890
I'm off. Oh, I am so wacky.

950
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:42,700
The man says I've seen this
before, haven't you? Yeah.

951
00:54:42,701 --> 00:54:43,930
Let's see what he says though.
I don't remember.

952
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,550
No,
Chris.

953
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:54,580
I don't know 100 people you thought we
were talking to at some nice little mall

954
00:54:56,241 --> 00:55:00,950
across Goodall America, but I'm pretty
sure that people didn't tell the survey.

955
00:55:00,951 --> 00:55:05,951
People Hae an illegal drug that's turned
around and see how many we'd hands are

956
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:09,370
out there with Chris hot joint.

957
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,590
I believe it. He was talking shit
against it. That's hilarious.

958
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:17,520
But this is the best part.

959
00:55:17,970 --> 00:55:22,970
[inaudible]

960
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:32,100
when you're know we're going
to hear why it's weird. Okay,

961
00:55:32,101 --> 00:55:32,540
Tracy,

962
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,630
see only four else's topic.

963
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,533
So

964
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,810
the collection played at Church

965
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,540
[inaudible] he clapped cause
he felt bad about saying joint.

966
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:49,200
Yeah, the halo and I got no knowledge.

967
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,520
So I'm like, I like the way you tried
to stop us from going there. Hey,

968
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,650
you missed you evil boy passing around.

969
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:03,490
The little thing with this funny
smell with can flush some saving here.

970
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,590
Charge
less than two weeks.

971
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:12,120
That's created then the joint.

972
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,820
This is not good. I'm
just going to do, did

973
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:21,920
you just go over that? They're
going to play this? Yes. Yeah. Wow.

974
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:24,030
Similarities though. That is pretty, it's

975
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:28,280
funny to me that you know,
if you said a beer, you know,
no one gives a shit. Right.

976
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:31,540
You know. But you say a
joint like, oh my goodness,

977
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:36,520
it really is such children. It's so
bizarre. Such children pairing it to hell.

978
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:40,060
Even he's a real like hardcore Christian.
That guy.

979
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,330
This is his audience is very,
very Christian. He does like a,

980
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:47,530
these big stadium church
shows here. She knows. Yeah.

981
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,480
You see one of those things that like
makes the women in wheelchairs or walking?

982
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,850
No, no, no, no.

983
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:55,750
He just does stand up
comedy and big church shows.

984
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:59,920
He does. Uh, he has like radio show. He
does a lot of different shit. That guy.

985
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,910
These, yeah. I admire his hustle.
Totally. Scott. A lot of things going on.

986
00:57:03,911 --> 00:57:07,540
He's got his own radio show. He
does that show. He does stand up.

987
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:12,300
He does these big church stand up shows.
It's not my style. I don't, you know,

988
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,430
not my kind of comedy, but I
admire the dude's hustle. I get,

989
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,100
I enjoy when people are hustle.
What are you guys laughing at?

990
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:22,300
My God jam band just showed me this,
this video and it's when it was fucked up.

991
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:25,960
But you know Kevin Rose of
Digg. Oh, with the rack. Yeah.

992
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:30,970
She'll show that I at one time and
rose found a raccoon attacking his dog.

993
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:35,910
Yeah. He grabbed it and threw
it off. Kevin Rose like he
founded what? What did he,

994
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:40,070
he found dig. He was on the screen savers,
you know? Yeah. On g four and stuff,

995
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:43,290
it says at 1:00 AM I heard my dog
toaster crying and yelping and Panna

996
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:46,240
discovered a raccoon and attack him.
I do not encourage animal violence.

997
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,780
I want to get the wild animals far away
from us as possible. Toasters. Okay.

998
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,160
Would have some claw and bite marks.

999
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:55,750
So that's what it says at the beginning
of the video and the video. You see this,

1000
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:59,890
this raccoon and the dog
are fucking going at it.

1001
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:03,990
And so Kevin Rose runs down
there, grabs a raccoon, slams it,

1002
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,060
and then kicks it. Holy Shit.
He's gangster grabbed that thing.

1003
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:11,080
He didn't kick it first.

1004
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:14,440
He just reached out and grabbed
his hands and then hulk slammed it.

1005
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,000
Wow. Oh Nelly. Oh Shit.

1006
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,380
Down a staircase isn't and yeah.
Whoa.

1007
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,590
Now where is that a security camera that
caught that? Yeah. Is that his house?

1008
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:29,040
Yeah. Wow. That's so crazy state.

1009
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,970
He grabbed that thing and hurled it like
a, like a pillow. Yeah. Body-Slammed it.

1010
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,330
Hey, that's how you do it when you
loved ones are in danger. You know?

1011
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:40,960
It's like when a woman picks up a
truck to save her baby, you know,

1012
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:43,210
that kind of shit. Yeah.
I hit that freak strength.

1013
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,390
Think I would have just kicked it. I
don't think I would touch it with my hand.

1014
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:48,940
I think I would just like, it's hard
as I could. Yeah, I think you're right.

1015
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,370
I think I probably would've too.
Who knows?

1016
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:55,880
Now you hear that yelping or your
favorite little pet little wiki has uh,

1017
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:58,760
you might just,
I would grab a raccoon off of your dog.

1018
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,730
You don't just go read eyed. You might
just get crazy. But God, I was scary.

1019
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,920
Would it be that thing
locked on your face? Sorry, I

1020
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:12,880
took my dog due to the vet and he had
these canines I guess like puppy teeth,

1021
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:14,470
like they're supposed to fall out,

1022
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:18,540
but a lot of times their normal teeth
will grow around their baby teeth. Yeah.

1023
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:21,980
You told me about this shit had
to pull out all these man at poor

1024
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,150
dog is just sitting there like
looking at walls crying. Yeah.

1025
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:29,900
That's fucked up man. It's weird.
Lincoln's he's a little breeds to,

1026
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,560
because you got to think like,
what are those things like, I mean,

1027
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:37,010
how healthy is it to make an animal
that weighs a pound, you know? Well,

1028
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:40,360
what's involved in that process? Is
that like normal? It's a normal salary,

1029
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,550
something like that. It's not, it's not
a tea cup or anything, it's just a shit.

1030
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:47,240
So yeah, it's a, yeah. A lot of
people think it's like a tea cup,

1031
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:49,820
but I think it's just the, a rent
or whatever it's called, you know,

1032
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:53,500
like that the baby of the litter
is small one at the litter. Hm.

1033
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:54,933
That's called a ranch.

1034
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:59,220
Yeah. I did some research on a twic
sees a thing in the peak and knees dog.

1035
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,370
You know, they used to, uh,

1036
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:05,310
the how they came was they would have
like Samurai warriors would just leave

1037
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:08,550
these beautiful little puppies
in the bottom of their sleeves,

1038
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,280
so they'd walk around and be all the,
you know, intimidating and stuff.

1039
01:00:11,281 --> 01:00:12,450
So to offset that,

1040
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,290
they'd have these adorable little dogs
as they would just walk around with them.

1041
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,320
Yeah. Speaking of animals, Brian,
I want you to go to this store.

1042
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:22,410
It's on the daily cause. Chaos.
You ever go to that website?

1043
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:26,310
Go to daily cars.com
and there's a story on,

1044
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,170
I'll tweet it because it's
so fucking crazy. You're not
going to believe it. This,

1045
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:35,670
these armed agents came into a no
kill shelter. I just tweeted it.

1046
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,040
Um,
you can find the link.

1047
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,020
These armed agents when they had a no
kill shelter for like dogs, you know,

1048
01:00:43,021 --> 01:00:45,030
so like if you don't want,
you could,

1049
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,900
you could donate money
and it's like a nonprofit.

1050
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:50,730
So like for a dog that goes to a pound,

1051
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,730
a lot of times they're in danger of being
killed. So there's a few of these, no,

1052
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,320
no kill shelters that people set up to
make sure that these animals don't die.

1053
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:58,950
Well,

1054
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:03,950
someone put a deer in one
of these no kill shelters.

1055
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,470
So aerial photos were taken.
They saw the deer.

1056
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:11,790
A warrant was issued in a raid
in sued by heavily armed agents.

1057
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:13,710
The staff was corralled,

1058
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,780
not permitted to make calls and cell
phones were confiscated to delete pictures

1059
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:19,614
of the raid.

1060
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,680
And a baby deer named giggles by the
staff was seized and stuffed into a body

1061
01:01:25,021 --> 01:01:28,140
bag and then promptly
killed by the agents.

1062
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:33,890
The presiding warden compared it
to a drug raid to justify the Swat,

1063
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:35,310
like tactics.

1064
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:40,020
They compared it to a drug raid that
having an illegal deer on the premise of

1065
01:01:40,021 --> 01:01:44,160
baby deer that they've been taken
care of was like having drugs.

1066
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:49,770
So they, this is, they came in
there and this is in Wisconsin,

1067
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:55,730
the Wisconsin Department
of natural resources agents
and the Sheriff's deputies

1068
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,880
rated this nonprofit,
no kill shelter,

1069
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:04,380
put this fucking baby deer
in a bag and then killed it.

1070
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:10,140
This is insane. This, uh, the article
says yes to your civilized world,

1071
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:15,200
heavily armed agents of a state government
and the u s of a have raided a no

1072
01:02:15,571 --> 01:02:20,460
kill animal shelter to execute with
extreme prejudice and recognized

1073
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,870
symbol for the gentleness,
helplessness, and innocence. Yes, world.

1074
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:25,621
This is America.

1075
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:28,830
Today we're a militarized assault has
become the answer to even the most minimal

1076
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:33,360
threat. It's really, um, I don't,
I mean that's a really interesting,

1077
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,760
it's a really interesting article that,
I mean, the way he just said that it's,

1078
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:42,540
it's really weird that they did that.
They went in for this,

1079
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,930
dear specifically the word. Yeah, the
word interesting is the wrong word.

1080
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:48,180
Obviously, I'm, I'm, I'm
still kind of stunned by this,

1081
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,430
but that agents would want to do this,

1082
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:52,410
that they would want to
go in armed like that.

1083
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,550
Like why are they so armed for a deer?
Have they,

1084
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:00,690
have they given a reason why or have they
made any comments? I don't know, man.

1085
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:04,020
I just read this. It's kind of crazy
though. That is, I mean it's, it's a,

1086
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:07,770
it's a new story. Um, it says 6:21 PM,

1087
01:03:07,771 --> 01:03:11,490
and right now it's 7:57 PM where we are.
Um,

1088
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:14,780
I don't know if this is Pacific
time. Yes. It's specific times.

1089
01:03:14,781 --> 01:03:19,440
So they is only a couple of hours
old. Yeah. Today's August 1st buddy,

1090
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,000
isn't it a second? Second say the
second already. Yeah. Oh my God.

1091
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:28,590
Where's this fucking life going?
Slight flying by any way.

1092
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:31,860
The story's gone viral now. It's
saying, did daily causes daily.

1093
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:35,280
KPOS excellent website. There's always
like really interesting stories there.

1094
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:37,920
So go there and, uh, and
check that out. And it's,

1095
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:41,130
if you're looking for the link to the
story itself, it's on my Twitter feed,

1096
01:03:41,131 --> 01:03:43,320
which is Joe Rogan.
Um,

1097
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:47,490
it's also has a beautiful picture of
Michelle Bachmann and on the front page,

1098
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,650
I'm that crazy conservative lady. Yeah.
I love those crazy conservatives ladies.

1099
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:57,030
Maybe that Deere was like some kind of
a government experiment and it got away.

1100
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,540
Oh, right. Maybe there's
like 28 days later, dear,

1101
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:03,570
has to be something crazy for them. I
mean, killing the deer is one thing.

1102
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,970
Maybe they just board
and then they wanted to,

1103
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:07,710
something to do and that
was like a big deal.

1104
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:11,820
Just went in there and
fucking deleting the pictures.

1105
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:15,510
That seems like a whole
nother illegal move.

1106
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:18,330
It seems like you should be able to
take whatever pictures you want your

1107
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:19,950
property. Yeah. They want,

1108
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:24,980
but they want to minimize any kind of
political situation that would come up

1109
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,430
from killing the deer.

1110
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:30,270
And they probably thought the best way
to do that is to stop any photos that are

1111
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:34,770
being taken, you know? Wow. Yeah.
Kind of crazy. Really. Yeah.

1112
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,310
Just,
it seems a little bit overkill.

1113
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:43,880
Maybe Wisconsin's just trying to act
gangster so they get some attention. Uh,

1114
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:48,480
I don't know, man. It's, uh, it's
just, it's hurts your feelings. Like,

1115
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:52,620
and this is coming from someone who's
killed a deer. I killed a deer to eat it.

1116
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:57,380
I didn't just, someone has a baby pet
deer and then send to a no kill rate.

1117
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,970
Just so crazy. I mean
the, I mean the people,

1118
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:04,260
that would be the biggest animal lovers
probably you could find with the ones

1119
01:05:04,261 --> 01:05:09,240
that will be working there. So to do
that to them it's like extra cruel.

1120
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,470
Another thing that's really bizarre.

1121
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:15,150
Did you say that they put them in a body
bag and then kill them? Yeah. Like um,

1122
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:18,280
yeah, they, they just grabbed
it and stuffed into a body

1123
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,000
bag and then probably either club that
are shot at and Kevin Rose throw down

1124
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:25,930
some stairs. Yeah. I mean, I
knows, man, who knows what it is.

1125
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:29,630
Normally you put things in a body bag
after that. Seems like a lot of hard work.

1126
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:32,480
Yeah.
Flailing leg.

1127
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:37,320
It's horrible. It's really, it's weird.
You know, you stop and think about it.

1128
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,730
It's like that someone could just just
do that in front of me screaming, crying,

1129
01:05:41,731 --> 01:05:45,900
people stuffed in a bag. And I
said, right, of all the things,

1130
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,990
it just seems like it's not necessary.
I mean,

1131
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,630
the only thing that you could say though,
and this is true,

1132
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:55,440
is that they contain ticks and
those ticks contained Lyme disease.

1133
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:56,580
That is possible.

1134
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:01,710
And if they were worried about Lyme
disease spreading into these other animals

1135
01:06:01,711 --> 01:06:06,090
and they were justifiably upset that
these people brought it possibly

1136
01:06:06,091 --> 01:06:07,170
contaminated dear,

1137
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,610
it does make sense that they would take
the deer away and examine it. At least,

1138
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,700
you know, examining but thrown
in a body bag and killing it.

1139
01:06:14,701 --> 01:06:19,320
It's pretty fucking pretty cruel.
It's like, why not? Why not be nice?

1140
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,330
Well, I do that. Pour a little deer. Yeah,
they're so cute. Really bad. Way To die.

1141
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,640
They're so cute,
but they're so fucking delicious.

1142
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,900
It's like there's a battle
going on with us, you know?

1143
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,250
You know what else is delicious? Rabbits
delicious. And for a while people just,

1144
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:36,990
they had to eat them.
There was no debate.

1145
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,750
And it's just like recently where people,
you know,

1146
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:41,130
in the last few hundred years or so,

1147
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,280
people gotten to a point where you
don't have to kill everything to eat it.

1148
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,400
So everything near us that's moving to
get hit with a rock and fucking thrown

1149
01:06:47,401 --> 01:06:50,340
into a fire. We don't have to do
that anymore. So we have pets,

1150
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:54,110
we have pets that used to be our
food. Yeah. You know, cute. Did Rapid.

1151
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:57,690
They're so fluffy. They are like, please
don't eat us. We're not aggressive.

1152
01:06:57,691 --> 01:07:00,480
We just hang out. Sometimes
you got to eat them. Yeah.

1153
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:06,360
I uh, I actually, uh, I don't
think you know this about me,

1154
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:10,160
but I thought I just tarian I'm a
Vegan. Total Vegan, right? Yeah.

1155
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,650
I knew there were some rollers. Yeah.
I've known this for a long time.

1156
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,830
I'd always thought it was funny cause I
love you're a secret Vegan bit that you

1157
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:23,310
do. And the first time I heard it was when
I was working with you in Indianapolis

1158
01:07:23,311 --> 01:07:25,320
and I'm back there cracking up and
I said to myself, you know what?

1159
01:07:25,321 --> 01:07:29,460
I'm going to keep this. I'm going to see
how long I could be the opposite Vegan.

1160
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,140
I knew you were at least a vegetarian
for a long time. Yeah. Yeah.

1161
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,460
I think he came up maybe
when we're hanging out. Yeah.

1162
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,720
Maybe till we go to dinner or something.
We eat something. Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

1163
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:42,400
That's gotta be weird, man.
When you're on the road,

1164
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,850
know, annoying. So hard
on the road. It really is.

1165
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:48,470
What do you do when you like on the road
to do stand up? Luckily, you know, the,

1166
01:07:48,471 --> 01:07:52,980
the main thing that I avoid is
dairy. Um, I still eat fish,

1167
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:57,000
Sushi, salmon, all that.
Oh, you do? Wait a minute.

1168
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:00,840
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're not a Vegan. I'm a pescatarian.

1169
01:08:00,841 --> 01:08:05,220
That doesn't eat dairy food. That
is not being a Vegan. Oh yeah. Fish.

1170
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:09,120
But it's the butter and milk.
That's the bad stuff. Yeah.

1171
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:13,930
But your vegans, most part, they're,
they're doing it more as an,

1172
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,950
well,
I would just say more,

1173
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:19,070
but one of the major considerations is
that they don't want to hurt animals.

1174
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:22,010
Yeah. That's not my consideration
on mine is so selfish.

1175
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:25,330
I just wanted to be happy all the time.
That's what I was like.

1176
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,810
It has nothing to do with the animals.

1177
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:31,850
And you found that altering your
diet has a big change on how you,

1178
01:08:32,131 --> 01:08:32,910
uh,
how you feel

1179
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:37,460
big time. In what way? Creativity.
Creatively and really, absolutely. I mean,

1180
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:41,430
we'll see what used to happen was that
down that I would get after eating.

1181
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,700
I mean, that's just exhausting
and I'm very reactive to that.

1182
01:08:44,701 --> 01:08:48,780
I like coffee and I like being able to
be in position to do something. You know,

1183
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:53,120
I'm so used to really bother me in,
first I cut out meat, I'm like, Jay,

1184
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:56,880
it's something with my eating because I
would just crashed so hard after every

1185
01:08:56,881 --> 01:08:58,020
meal I'd want to take a nap.

1186
01:08:58,410 --> 01:09:02,340
So then I went a few months and I've
done it before and both times it's been

1187
01:09:02,341 --> 01:09:04,610
this way. But this time I've kept
it for a year and a half. And,

1188
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:09,090
but once I cut out the dairy,
sour cream, the cheese, it's,

1189
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:12,600
it's hard in the beginning,
but it's not really,

1190
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:17,660
once you just go round at once you
have vegan cheese in your house.

1191
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:21,390
It's pretty much straight cause then you
can make a pizza or whatever, you know,

1192
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:25,320
you could throw something together if you
really are craving it and uh, but yeah,

1193
01:09:25,321 --> 01:09:26,071
that,
that uh,

1194
01:09:26,071 --> 01:09:30,750
that edge and the negativity and sort
of depression like symptoms that I was

1195
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:34,680
feeling pretty much throughout my
whole life up until the point really

1196
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:37,850
dissipated after the dairy Wiscon
almost instantly by the way,

1197
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:42,300
like to the meal once I
started eliminating cheese
was really the main thing

1198
01:09:42,301 --> 01:09:45,210
cause I'd have cheese on every
sandwich. So delicious though, right?

1199
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,820
I think we can choose,
you can use to it and there's,

1200
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,760
there's great ways around it.
You know, Avocados. Great.

1201
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:54,380
For me, it's one month now
with no gluten. Oh Wow.

1202
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:59,090
One month where I haven't had any,
it's a completely changed my diet.

1203
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,810
I only eat vegetables and meats and
chicken and fish and things along those

1204
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:05,690
lines. Occasionally I have
rice, but not very often.

1205
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:07,790
But I've completely cut out all pasta,

1206
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:12,650
completely cut out all bread and I know
a loan us a lot of differences. The,

1207
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,970
the, I don't feel when I eat, even if
I'm full, I don't need to eat anymore.

1208
01:10:16,971 --> 01:10:21,830
I don't feel bloated. I don't have the,
uh, there's a feeling that she eat. Dude,

1209
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:23,570
I can put away some fucking food,
right?

1210
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:27,600
I would eat a giant whole pizza by myself,
like with all sorts of shit on it,

1211
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:32,180
Pepperoni and sausage. And I will fuck
up a big pizza to the point where I just,

1212
01:10:32,181 --> 01:10:37,110
I the, the last couple of slices, I'm just
trying to prove a point, right? I'm just,

1213
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:42,050
just, just showing what a fat fucking pig
I can be in stuff this down my throat.

1214
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,900
But the feeling after that,

1215
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,410
when that cement is
digesting in my stomach,

1216
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:53,411
that paste when it's all smashed up with
my teeth in and packed into a ball of

1217
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:59,320
just barely digestible, fart fuel. I mean,

1218
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:00,021
that's what it is.

1219
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:05,021
I'm just cutting horrible farts and
listen to my stomach rumble and it just

1220
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:08,360
stretched out in ageing.
That's gone.

1221
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:12,020
I all by one of the reasons why I did
it because I talked to someone about my

1222
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:15,060
back, um, which has gotten
a lot better. Um, and,

1223
01:11:15,061 --> 01:11:19,410
and thank you everybody who's had back
injuries and given me tips whether it's

1224
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:21,120
on Twitter,
on the message board.

1225
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:24,840
A lot of people gave me some great
suggestions of different shit to do.

1226
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,550
[inaudible] um,

1227
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,840
including Dave Asprey told me
about ozone prolozone therapy.

1228
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,560
It's prolotherapy with ozone, which
helped me quite a bit. Really interesting,

1229
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:39,000
interesting stuff. But this tea, this lady
told me cut out gluten. She said she, um,

1230
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:40,240
she,
she's a therapist,

1231
01:11:40,241 --> 01:11:43,110
a physical therapist and her and her
husband both work with like high level

1232
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:45,300
athletes and one of the
things they said is like,

1233
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:49,950
we've had really good results in getting
people to stop eating gluten and a lot

1234
01:11:49,951 --> 01:11:53,790
of inflammation goes down and people
that have had like back issues just in

1235
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:55,020
cutting out the gluten,

1236
01:11:55,021 --> 01:11:58,710
the inflammation from their disc swelling
and stuff has gone down considerably

1237
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,370
to the point where it
becomes asymptomatic. And I
thought that was so crazy.

1238
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,600
I was like, how could gluten like have
that much of an effect on yeah, but man,

1239
01:12:06,601 --> 01:12:09,840
it fucking does. I'm only been a
month. It's a, it's about, you know,

1240
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:14,850
roughly a month now. But I have
much less aches and pains in joints.

1241
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,600
My face looks thinner like my
face is like and I'm, I'm not,

1242
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:22,320
I'm still eating like as much as I
want. I'm not like a, I'm not like,

1243
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:26,130
I wouldn't say I'm limiting my calories
or dieting but I'm losing body fat and

1244
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:30,240
my stomach is going down. I know this is
book wheat belly, I haven't read it yet,

1245
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:32,070
but apparently when
they talk about is like,

1246
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:36,450
like how many people have like belly fat
from eating gluten and wheat and like

1247
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:40,860
that. It just just packs it on you.
But I noticed my stomach on television,

1248
01:12:40,861 --> 01:12:41,481
I was like my God,

1249
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:44,190
it's kind of sticking out a little bit
cause I haven't been able to work out as

1250
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:46,630
much because of my back. All
that shit's gone. I'll let you,

1251
01:12:46,631 --> 01:12:49,960
it's gone as soon as I cut out
gluten. I can tell in your face. Yeah,

1252
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,820
it's my favorite skin. Pretty fat man
that's, I carry weight in my face.

1253
01:12:53,821 --> 01:12:57,330
It's one of the first places I carry
it for whatever reason in my Dick.

1254
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,550
So fortunately,

1255
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:04,350
fortunately and unfortunately my
is my Dick is looking like a runner

1256
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:10,770
but dick looks like a jogger.
Shocker.

1257
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:15,600
I was want my dick was
like a bulldog instead.

1258
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:18,450
It looks like a like a
jogger with a headband.

1259
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,790
But I would recommend anybody trying it,
you know,

1260
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:26,480
but some people say it's
nonsense. Um, but uh,

1261
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,170
one of the things I found
out about the Internet,

1262
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,930
the Internet is a beautiful
resource but no matter what,

1263
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:34,430
there's going to be a certain amount of
people that think something sucks, right?

1264
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,140
It could be the most awesome
shit that's ever existed.

1265
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,630
I've seen people say the
black keys fucking suck.

1266
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:43,260
I've seen people say Louis C K fucking
songs I've seen believe you'll say Dave

1267
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,900
Chappelle fucking socks.
Everything that is awesome in the world.

1268
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:47,790
Someone out there is saying it sucks.

1269
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:52,791
Just search the keywords on Twitter and
you'll find people saying the dumbest

1270
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:57,801
stuff in the world is so much of it is
people not talking in person to other

1271
01:13:58,441 --> 01:14:03,441
people and not like having to
like have like a sort of like a,

1272
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:10,510
an cooperative interactive exchange
with people instead of that like

1273
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:15,010
communicating with people and seeing them
in a full three dimensional to person,

1274
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:16,810
to person sort of a way. Just
the ability to like, yeah,

1275
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:21,450
Eh, right. Flagging. Just get online.

1276
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:25,590
Me fucking Tony Hinchcliffe you could
get funny. A fucking queen. Yeah.

1277
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:29,070
Yeah.
They just throw it out there and just,

1278
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:32,260
just unleash from the
bowels of their soul.

1279
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:34,350
They hide in their apartment
from the fucking bill collector

1280
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,390
[inaudible]

1281
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:39,250
from their parents who live
on the floor above them.

1282
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,940
It's a weird thing,
you know,

1283
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:44,540
if I can give any advice to anybody
that finds themselves caught doing that,

1284
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:46,910
sometimes people think they can do it to
celebrities because celebrities aren't

1285
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,980
really people. You know,
I've seen people that like,

1286
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:51,530
they seem like normal folks and then,
you know,

1287
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,820
they'll tell you look good or were you on?

1288
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,850
He's less blocked me from Twitter like,
why'd you do that?

1289
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,300
I was fucking given her some shit about
something. She blocked me on. Like,

1290
01:14:59,301 --> 01:15:01,560
why are you doing that dude? Do you
even know her? Like, what do you,

1291
01:15:01,561 --> 01:15:04,040
what do you know? Why are you having this
exchange with her? What are you doing?

1292
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:08,300
Why you being so mean? Why do you mean
focus on yourself motherfucker? It's just,

1293
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:08,900
yeah,

1294
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,920
it's weird when you meet
those people in person too.

1295
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:14,480
Like there was a guy the other day that
came to the comedy club and he was just

1296
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:17,840
like, wow, you remember that guy that came
up? He was kind of drunk. And he goes,

1297
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:22,790
he goes, he was talking to our friend
Benji and he was just like, you know, man,

1298
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,920
you suck. You're set was
this stupid? Like, like,

1299
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:31,610
and we're just like, like interrupting
our conversation. Right. And a good,

1300
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,530
it got me to the point where I was like,

1301
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:36,890
I almost just want to beat this guy's ass.
I'm not even a fighter,

1302
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,730
but I just want to smash this dude's face.

1303
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:41,840
And because I've already gone through
the, uh, the police, you know,

1304
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:44,180
just get away from iceman and
leave us alone type thing.

1305
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,500
And the whole night he wouldn't leave.

1306
01:15:45,501 --> 01:15:49,070
He kept on getting kicked out and he
would come sneak his way back and start

1307
01:15:49,071 --> 01:15:53,880
talking shit that p, uh, comics and then
like, wow. It's like he just needed,

1308
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,920
so he's like a, like a human
in real life troll. Yes. Yeah.

1309
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:59,690
He was set up like an internet.

1310
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:03,430
She was really bad at it too because he
would come up with, come up to the group.

1311
01:16:03,431 --> 01:16:07,030
He would say somebody sucked and
we're just like, okay, what else?

1312
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,060
What else do you got? Oh,
that's it. I just want to
tell you, you suck. It's like,

1313
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:14,440
okay, well then that's it. Right? So you
can go like, why you gotta be like that?

1314
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:16,360
You just told,
told me I suck.

1315
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:20,650
What am I supposed to do?
Hang out with you?

1316
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,380
It's as,
as time goes on,

1317
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:27,400
more of those people are being exposed
and they're starting to feel that,

1318
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,200
you know, they're starting to feel
the sting of being mean to be black.

1319
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,020
That like have you seen
what happened with um,

1320
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,610
that guy that was on who's a
reddit guy who was like, he,

1321
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:40,540
he was a posting you post like really
mean evil shit on reddit and they found

1322
01:16:40,541 --> 01:16:44,230
out who he was in real life. So they
contacted his employer and he got fired.

1323
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,020
He got fired for his
written and he's got like,

1324
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:49,630
he was talking about it like he's
like, look, this is just a persona.

1325
01:16:49,631 --> 01:16:52,720
I just do this to blow off steam. Like
actually a nice guy. I've got a family.

1326
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:57,880
Like he just was entertaining
himself by just doing this on online,

1327
01:16:58,570 --> 01:16:59,530
you know,
it gets weird,

1328
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:03,460
man gets weird because it's like I
don't agree with that guy getting fired.

1329
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:05,680
I'll tell you that I don't agree with
the guy getting fired for something that

1330
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:07,150
has nothing to do with this work.
Right.

1331
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:10,520
Because you find out that he posts mean
shit on Twitter, on Twitter or on reddit.

1332
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:14,060
Well he didn't know that he was
going to get caught. Like, you know,

1333
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:16,880
you have to show, you have
to show that bar. You know,

1334
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:20,190
like most people think that
the rules are pretty simple.

1335
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:23,000
Like it's a game to a lot of folks
like try to say something mean,

1336
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:26,450
try to get people to react and try to get
people to freak out because you put up

1337
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:29,020
some horrifying image and that game,
the,

1338
01:17:29,021 --> 01:17:32,240
the parameters of that game had
been pre pretty clearly established.

1339
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:36,290
No one was losing any jobs because
of that. You had an anonymous name,

1340
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,370
nobody lost any jobs.

1341
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:40,220
Well somewhere along the line people
decided that that wasn't good enough.

1342
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:43,250
So they had to go after the people
that were posting this fucked up shit.

1343
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:46,880
And the way they went after is they find
out who you are as a real human being

1344
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:50,840
and then they go after you and that's
where it's just shit gets weird because it

1345
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:55,400
was like, who are you? Are you your
online guy or are you the real God,

1346
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:56,450
the real,
you know,

1347
01:17:56,451 --> 01:18:00,020
Tony Hinchcliffe that I see out there in
the street or are you Tony Hinchcliffe

1348
01:18:00,021 --> 01:18:03,290
that pretends to be a woman
and a goes on cougar life

1349
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:06,340
and tries to tries to
get guys to fall in love.

1350
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:10,660
Have you been looking at my
browser history? How many women?

1351
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:14,560
I mean like how many dudes out there
that are online talking and they think to

1352
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:18,580
women are actually just other dudes that
are pretending to be women. Oh yeah,

1353
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,280
that happened. No, that didn't
happen to me. People are getting,

1354
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:24,330
well one of the things that
we did on this, uh, is uh,

1355
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:29,430
Scifi show is a, we went to a motion
capture studio, um, that does a,

1356
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:33,090
they do the same stuff. They
do Avatar and all. They did a,

1357
01:18:33,091 --> 01:18:36,490
a lot of other movies and they have all
these different frames that they can put

1358
01:18:36,491 --> 01:18:37,324
you into.

1359
01:18:37,390 --> 01:18:41,110
Like they put you in this motion capture
suit and they make an image of your

1360
01:18:41,111 --> 01:18:45,850
face and then they can put your face
like on a body and then you're running

1361
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:49,750
around this area. And you're, you're
running around actually like in this game,

1362
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,720
you know, you like, you could see
this character and you can have,

1363
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:54,940
you can be a woman,
you could be like a monster.

1364
01:18:54,941 --> 01:18:56,920
You can be all these different
characters in the game.

1365
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:02,250
How long is it until we have like a world
of Warcraft type three d game and do

1366
01:19:03,101 --> 01:19:06,400
is just decided to be a
check, you know? Yeah.

1367
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,450
Just because, just because it's
just for fun. Why not? You know,

1368
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,850
I'm always grow up video game characters.
Yeah.

1369
01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:16,680
You would be a girl if you
were a superhero, right?

1370
01:19:16,681 --> 01:19:19,990
Didn't you say you'd be
superwoman? Superwoman. And
if you had the choice, if it,

1371
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,110
you know,
it's,

1372
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:24,960
you would bother the other players more
by killing them being a woman anyway.

1373
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:27,450
Like, Oh man, I just got killed by it.
She let me give you a, for instance.

1374
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:30,800
So let me give you what
if, okay. Let's say, uh,

1375
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,140
I don't know anything about your
personal situation, but it's,

1376
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:36,380
let's say you're in love. You found the
girl, this is the one you want to marry.

1377
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:37,214
Okay.

1378
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:41,570
And you have the opportunity
for one day or one hour,

1379
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:46,571
let's say an hour to feel what it's
like for you to fuck her and she gets to

1380
01:19:47,061 --> 01:19:52,061
feel what it's like to be you
having sex with her so you,

1381
01:19:52,851 --> 01:19:56,690
you feel what it's like to be her getting
fucked by you and she feels what it's

1382
01:19:56,691 --> 01:20:01,550
like for you to fuck her.
Do you think you could do that?

1383
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:03,590
Do you think you could lie there
and get fucked by yourself?

1384
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:07,730
I don't think I could handle an hour.
I don't think I could handle our,

1385
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:10,140
of what I'm dealing with.
I think you could do that.

1386
01:20:10,141 --> 01:20:12,660
Do you think you could
deal with like kissing you

1387
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:16,760
and do you think you'd love her enough
to let her be you for an hour and you'd

1388
01:20:16,761 --> 01:20:17,300
be here?

1389
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,100
I really,
really love myself,

1390
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:22,890
so I'm pretty sure that if I got fucked

1391
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:27,690
to buy me and if I was a check for an
hour, I'd, I'd probably really enjoy it.

1392
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:28,524
I'd probably be,

1393
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,570
if I was, if I was a chick,
I'd probably be a squirter.

1394
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,160
Do you think you'd give up the
booty? What'd you go? Anal.

1395
01:20:37,190 --> 01:20:41,420
Would I give it if you would check taking
the ass from yourself? Well, for me.

1396
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:45,410
Yeah. I mean from yourself. Yeah.
Just spit on your head right around.

1397
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:49,340
Now it's you back and
open it up wide for you.

1398
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:53,900
I don't know if I should go ask them out
for yourself. That's the real question.

1399
01:20:53,901 --> 01:20:55,160
How much do you really love yourself?

1400
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:58,340
Because you probably don't love yourself
enough to go aft asked him mouth and

1401
01:20:58,341 --> 01:21:00,380
yourself.
But if you watch porn,

1402
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,880
girls who don't even love guys are willing
to go ass to mouth, right? So consider,

1403
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:08,250
well, the [inaudible] are
getting like 2000 bucks.

1404
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:11,630
So do I go for two thousand
five thousand to fuck myself?

1405
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,080
If that's all it takes for you to go
ask the mouth, we can have that arranged

1406
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,700
the way it has to be fucking himself.
We'll just make a mask.

1407
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:23,000
We'll just make a mask.
We'll

1408
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:28,100
just make a mass. It looks just like
you. It's not gay if it's yourself,

1409
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,190
but we make them bass looks just like
you and we put it on a girl with a strap

1410
01:21:31,191 --> 01:21:33,230
on.
So it is like you're fucking yourself.

1411
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:36,000
Not Enough now.
Definitely not.

1412
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,010
We need to actually be a girl because then
you'd say, yeah, I'm, I'm not even me.

1413
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:44,370
I'm hurting that. You look down, you
see your penis and you go, oh no, no,

1414
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:44,780
I'm still good

1415
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:47,960
guy.
Fuck on a game with my plane.

1416
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,850
I know I'm so confused.

1417
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:51,950
I don't know whether I would
fuck this thing or I wouldn't.

1418
01:21:51,951 --> 01:21:55,340
I don't know what you mean. What
did they both have? Penises.

1419
01:21:55,341 --> 01:21:59,590
Does one have a vagina? I mean I've
wondered, have you ever wondered what it,

1420
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:01,990
well, I mean, what it must
be like to be a woman,

1421
01:22:01,991 --> 01:22:05,050
to be attracted to men and to be a woman.

1422
01:22:05,051 --> 01:22:08,320
Like how a man inside of you and
to like throw the whole experience.

1423
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,760
It's so radically different. It would
be really trippy if they offered up.

1424
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:17,380
Like say if one day your,
your mind literally can be recorded.

1425
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,980
Like say if one day the memory that
you experienced now is like old school,

1426
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:22,330
they're going to have digital memory.

1427
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,330
They're going to plug it into the
cerebral cortex or wherever the fuck your

1428
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:27,820
memories are stored. And you're going
to be able to have it on a hard drive.

1429
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:29,410
You're going to have to be able to
have your memory in a hard drive.

1430
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:33,130
And I'm going to be able to take a copy
of your memory or borrow your chip or

1431
01:22:33,131 --> 01:22:36,130
whatever and sticking in my head and
experience what you're experiencing.

1432
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,620
So the question becomes,
if that is possible,

1433
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:43,180
if you can like literally one day
experienced someone's memories,

1434
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,150
will you experience you
getting fucked by you?

1435
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:51,540
That's interesting because it's like,
you know, people that are born wine,

1436
01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:55,100
people that are born blind
don't dream in color.

1437
01:22:56,060 --> 01:22:59,690
I wonder if you could feel a
vagina if you don't have one.

1438
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:03,460
That's a very good point. That's a very
good point. That's really interesting.

1439
01:23:03,461 --> 01:23:04,480
I never even thought of that.

1440
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,240
But uh, but you in the wife
would just swap hard drives.

1441
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,490
They,
it seems like they're getting,

1442
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:14,420
it seems like they're getting a more
enjoyable and I mean the noises that they

1443
01:23:14,421 --> 01:23:17,960
make the whole time. And compared to,
I mean, I don't know how you guys are,

1444
01:23:17,961 --> 01:23:22,220
but I'm brown. I'm not that loud. It's
not like, ah, I should try it. Practice.

1445
01:23:22,221 --> 01:23:23,600
It really can go crazy.

1446
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:29,080
Pretend I can't wait till this is
life changing advice I'm about to get.

1447
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:32,030
Just pretend when you

1448
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:35,240
pretend, when you're fucking
that year an animal in a movie,

1449
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:37,573
that's what you should do.

1450
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:41,360
Not even a real animal because real
animals or family quiet like a squirrel.

1451
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:45,620
Yeah,
like just a crazy wild,

1452
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:49,300
undiscovered ape that lives in Africa.

1453
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:54,320
It's one killer fucking screaming Ayp
and Claude older brother neck and try it.

1454
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,133
Let's get crazy.

1455
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:02,740
I make sea lion noises the other time
that are drying up on the beach cause they

1456
01:24:03,711 --> 01:24:04,100
have a broken

1457
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:04,933
good flipper.

1458
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:13,220
Is that how you, is that how you get
the fuck dolphins by making that noise.

1459
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:17,570
By the way, sea lions are the most
funniest sounding animal, I think.

1460
01:24:17,571 --> 01:24:22,070
Just hanging out. I wonder
what they're doing. They're
communicating. I don't know.

1461
01:24:22,071 --> 01:24:24,530
They sound so depressed and dom and

1462
01:24:26,850 --> 01:24:31,390
you ain't lying. Yeah. It's
not like the best sound. Yeah.

1463
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:35,310
I if you ever heard an elk elk,
yeah. They have this weird,

1464
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:40,800
we have like a bugle. It's called an elk
bugle pull. Pull it up. Littler guys,

1465
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:42,750
a sound.
It's the weirdest noise.

1466
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:46,140
Like animal animals have
weird fucking noises,

1467
01:24:46,141 --> 01:24:49,980
but male elks would they call bull elks
when they're calling out the bitches,

1468
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:54,240
letting him know what's up. It's time
to get some Dick Conduct. Get some deck.

1469
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:55,860
Listen to this sound.

1470
01:24:59,210 --> 01:25:01,620
You hear that? That's an elk. Hmm.

1471
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:06,590
Awesome. Sounds like Tony. That's a female

1472
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:08,373
RGT to,

1473
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,640
how weird is that

1474
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,990
elk when you look at them with their
giant fucking horns? Listen to that.

1475
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:30,120
Is that the guy that's an elk? That's an
elk making noise. Yeah, that's of male.

1476
01:25:30,121 --> 01:25:30,954
The males have horns.

1477
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:39,360
How crazy is that? That animals right
out of Lord of the rings. Oh yeah.

1478
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:42,510
It looks like a boar with antlers.

1479
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:47,310
They're weird because they're
closer related apparently
to cows than they are to

1480
01:25:47,311 --> 01:25:48,990
deer.
It looks like

1481
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:49,843
good,

1482
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:55,650
really thick necks. Well,
weird fucking, yeah,

1483
01:25:56,350 --> 01:26:01,040
I'd suck off that elk up
that's made in calls or working on me.

1484
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,160
I mean,
what a animal man.

1485
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,280
I mean, think about that
reality. Living in the woods,

1486
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:12,290
just trekking around in snow,
looking for grass to eat.

1487
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,910
And then once a year it's time
to fuck. Wow. Once a year.

1488
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:20,720
It's time to get your fuck
on. How exciting that must
be when that comes around.

1489
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,570
Woo.
Woo.

1490
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:30,390
I wish I was here for the the other day
that the car guy on. Oh, Matt Farah. Yeah.

1491
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,540
How was that? Oh, he'll be back again.
He was awesome. He was awesome fun.

1492
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:38,870
We got hammered too. Oh Geez. We
should about Volkswagen with them. Why?

1493
01:26:38,871 --> 01:26:41,980
What's wrong with your Volkswagen?
It's, it's the most dumbest thing ever.

1494
01:26:41,981 --> 01:26:46,030
I've haven't had my car for a month.
What's wrong? Well, when I first got it,

1495
01:26:46,031 --> 01:26:47,350
they had this thing where the windows,

1496
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,440
you try to roll up the windows and it
would roll up all the way and then it

1497
01:26:50,441 --> 01:26:52,150
would roll down all the way and
then you're like, God dammit,

1498
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,790
you have to do like four times in a row.
So finally I was like,

1499
01:26:54,791 --> 01:26:57,160
what the fuck's going on? They're like,
oh, there's there, there's a recall.

1500
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:01,930
So they take out the windows and they
scratch up. Uh, I had tenting on him.

1501
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:05,170
They scratched up all the tinting on it.
And so then I had to take it back.

1502
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:08,740
And then like this, uh,
like a couple months later,

1503
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:11,260
the sun roof thing broke the trunk thing,

1504
01:27:11,261 --> 01:27:13,630
which had like string
holding up the trunk broke.

1505
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:17,170
Like all these little things keep,
keep on breaking like the car. Awesome.

1506
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:21,000
But all these little stupid thing. Okay.
So then I'm, I take it back. They, they,

1507
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:23,030
they have it for two weeks.
They give it back to me.

1508
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:26,290
They didn't fix half the shit. So then
I had to take it back out of this shit.

1509
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,690
Like, like they, they were supposed
to fix this headlight thing and,

1510
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:32,160
and they didn't fix the
headlight. And then, uh,

1511
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:35,690
when they were fixing the sun roof thing,
they scratched up the top of the,

1512
01:27:35,691 --> 01:27:40,320
the interiors that they have to replace
the interior. And I ha, it's not like the,

1513
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:43,750
the general manager and the service
managers won't even call me back anymore.

1514
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:46,690
They're just this like, cause they don't
have an answer. They like, they like,

1515
01:27:46,691 --> 01:27:48,880
every time I call, I'm like, how
about now? And they're like, oh,

1516
01:27:48,881 --> 01:27:51,650
it'd be beginning of next week. Then next
week comes in, they're like, Eh, it's,

1517
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:54,550
it's going to be the
following week. And, and I,

1518
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:58,090
they just don't even answer my phone
calls anymore. It's gotten to that point.

1519
01:27:58,091 --> 01:28:01,870
You've got to, don't answer
your phone. No, no, they
won't return my calls. Like I,

1520
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:04,910
there was like three days that they
didn't return, like return my call.

1521
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:08,290
And this is the dealership, this is
the dealership. But I just contacted,

1522
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:12,330
cause I went crazy on, on Twitter. And
then of course, you know Volkswagen,

1523
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:15,610
Twitter fit page, you know, just send
me a message and what'd they say?

1524
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:19,630
So I called up and I made this happen
to make up this whole like, you know,

1525
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,510
thing where they said the district
managers just going to figure out what the

1526
01:28:22,511 --> 01:28:25,750
fuck's going on. So they had opened
up a case and but still no car.

1527
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:28,330
And like I like they gave me,
they gave me up Assad,

1528
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:32,350
which is I guess is a nice car at 2013 to,
to use for the last two days.

1529
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:35,380
But it's like one of those ones where
it's been stripped of everything where you

1530
01:28:35,381 --> 01:28:39,670
don't even have like a map, you know,
gene, I have like a four cylinder,

1531
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:41,470
like I have no pickup at all.

1532
01:28:41,471 --> 01:28:45,310
So I'm like on the La freeway trying to
like speed or do something and it's just

1533
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:47,980
like I have a little go cart.
That's bullshit.

1534
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:52,780
That's crazy that they've had it for a
month. Yeah. Um, what was the major issue?

1535
01:28:52,781 --> 01:28:56,080
What the fuck was it that made the
major issue? It's just that like,

1536
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,200
I mean there's been so many little things
I've been broke breaking on it like

1537
01:28:59,201 --> 01:29:00,460
the windows and stuff, but like, uh,

1538
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:04,090
they have net that it was over
the sunroof and you pull the net.

1539
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:06,850
What are they saying? They're
giving you a reason why they can't?

1540
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:07,421
Well,
no,

1541
01:29:07,421 --> 01:29:10,210
what they do is they fix it and they
will break something else and then they

1542
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:12,580
break something. Yeah. Like
when they fixed the roof thing,

1543
01:29:12,581 --> 01:29:15,400
they scratched up my whole interior
and so they had to replace it.

1544
01:29:15,401 --> 01:29:17,950
They're replacing the interior
now when they replaced my windows,

1545
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:21,250
they scratched up. But like all the tent,
all my windows, when they put it back in,

1546
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:26,080
like it's, it's been just nonstop and
then they're like all these little tiny,

1547
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,260
like, people warned me about this.
I already knew this about folks on,

1548
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,000
but all these little tiny,
like the cigarette lighter thing when you,

1549
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:33,610
where you plug in your iPhone charger,
when you pull it out,

1550
01:29:33,611 --> 01:29:37,030
the whole thing came out. So I had to
get that fixed. So it's a build quality.

1551
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:38,020
It's a,
yeah.

1552
01:29:38,021 --> 01:29:42,400
And what's weird is if he looked back
at like I get consumer reports and stuff

1553
01:29:42,401 --> 01:29:43,390
with Volkswagen,
they,

1554
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,310
they've had this problem for so long that
that it's always an electrical issue.

1555
01:29:48,311 --> 01:29:51,790
It's always, it's always, you
know, like the little things break.

1556
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:54,520
It's never the engine. Like I usually,
usually like everything runs fine.

1557
01:29:54,521 --> 01:29:59,410
It's just like your car will fall apart
and uh, it's, it's, it's like to the t

1558
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,980
there and I would verbally
abuse every month.

1559
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:06,820
Yeah, it was fall. Who knows what the
fuck is going on. You know, it's, I mean,

1560
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:09,610
it's not the every employee, well, no

1561
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:12,550
[inaudible] the one that, the one
that they put in front of you though,

1562
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,460
that's respond,
whoever's responsible for that location.

1563
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:19,310
There was also a point where apart part
of this Volkswagen experience where I

1564
01:30:19,311 --> 01:30:22,470
ordered a part, this headlight, like
they were like, you know, uh, uh,

1565
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,850
something on the freeway snapped up
and hit this one of the fog lights.

1566
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,730
And it was like, all right, so I
have to pay for that. I understand.

1567
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:31,970
And they were like, well, it's going to
be $200 but the labor is going to be $100.

1568
01:30:31,971 --> 01:30:36,080
I'm like, that's fine. Just need to need
it fixed. And then they didn't fix that.

1569
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:38,490
And then I was like,
why didn't you fix this?

1570
01:30:38,491 --> 01:30:40,120
And I had to take my car
back and they're like, uh,

1571
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:42,380
I went to the service manager
and I was like, well, you know,

1572
01:30:42,381 --> 01:30:44,150
why didn't you fix this? And then, oh,

1573
01:30:44,151 --> 01:30:47,900
this service guys said that you said not
to fix it. That was too expensive. Okay.

1574
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:50,680
Well this sounds like, yeah, personal.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying it. Yeah,

1575
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:54,250
it's just on for everybody.
Yeah. The um, yeah, that sucks.

1576
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:58,130
Do you want to say the name of the place?
New Century Volkswagen Glendale.

1577
01:30:58,131 --> 01:30:59,030
You can eat my dick.

1578
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,660
Oh my goodness.
How dare you.

1579
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:04,250
That's not what I was
hoping you were going to do.

1580
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,330
I was hoping you were going to say
do century Volkswagen Glendale.

1581
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:13,250
Let's work this out. Eat My dick. They
have your car still. I don't care anymore.

1582
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:16,670
Like they say, my parents ate my
deck so they might see your deck.

1583
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,790
You're going to get there. They're going
to lock the doors. I'm going to go.

1584
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:21,590
Oh yeah, we'll talk some shit. Huh? Hey,

1585
01:31:21,591 --> 01:31:23,510
our phone's been ringing off
the hook for the past two days,

1586
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:27,620
so we are going to eat you. They come out
with a fucking pair of hedge clippers.

1587
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:32,270
Chase you around the Volkswagen
shop. Okay. That's in Glendale, man.

1588
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:36,460
Glendale's Oh, I'm fucked. I'm
fucked. Don't play. You don't fuck.

1589
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:39,110
It does sound like a pain in the
Dick though. Tony Hinchcliffe.

1590
01:31:39,111 --> 01:31:41,640
Any car problems you want to
throw into the bed? No car

1591
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:45,420
problems. I did a, I did have
some bad customer service. Uh,

1592
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:48,540
two weeks ago though I was at the airport.
I had just gotten done with this gig.

1593
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:51,810
I was by myself in Corpus Christi,
Texas for a weekend. I'm at the airport.

1594
01:31:51,811 --> 01:31:53,970
I get there half hour
early about to board.

1595
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,210
I mean this is the
Corpus Christi airports,

1596
01:31:56,211 --> 01:32:00,520
so there's just me and the other people
that are on my flight there and I'm

1597
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:03,640
sitting right next to the door where
they pull the gate up to you and I'm

1598
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:04,474
sitting right there.

1599
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:09,010
I have about a half hour though to wait
before they load up the plane and my

1600
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:11,680
eyes start getting a little heavy
because I have a five o'clock flight.

1601
01:32:11,681 --> 01:32:12,730
I've been up all night.

1602
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,480
I did stand up that night so I stay up
to get the flights so I can get back to

1603
01:32:16,481 --> 01:32:21,220
la early and sleep in my bed,
you know, and sleep on the plane.

1604
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:25,990
Anyway, my eyes get heavy, I fall asleep.
All their boarding this plane, I wake up,

1605
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:29,770
it's 15 minutes after it took off and
I opened my eyes and there's still that

1606
01:32:29,771 --> 01:32:34,480
lady that works for the airline there
and I go, so that plane took off,

1607
01:32:34,481 --> 01:32:38,620
Huh? And she's like, oh, you
must be hinge cliff. I go,

1608
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:42,460
yeah. How do you know that? She goes,
because I just paid you twice. I go,

1609
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:46,510
I'm sitting right here. I
mean, sure I fell asleep.

1610
01:32:46,511 --> 01:32:50,260
But you would think that this lady,
there's nobody else in the airport now.

1611
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:51,880
She didn't.

1612
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,480
So you think this was to wake you up
because that what the fuck you're saying?

1613
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:57,910
Jesus Christ, she's
blazing bitch. She's paid.

1614
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:00,570
They're going to fly you through
the sky and a fucking metal too.

1615
01:33:00,580 --> 01:33:02,430
You want them to wake you up to,
there's,

1616
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:06,020
this is like 150 fucking people on this
plane and enough time to wake you up.

1617
01:33:06,021 --> 01:33:08,970
I wasn't even,
it was like 35 whatever it is,

1618
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:12,280
34 other people to think about why
the fuck should they wake you up?

1619
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:17,340
There's only one guy sitting nice and
wake up bench that they probably were

1620
01:33:17,831 --> 01:33:22,150
like, Hello Sir sir. You right
there? Yeah. All right. Last call.

1621
01:33:22,151 --> 01:33:24,880
Like they're not going to come up to you
and like shaking like just in case if

1622
01:33:24,881 --> 01:33:27,910
you're not Tony Edgecliff Tony, you're
a mess. That's what the fuck happened.

1623
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:29,350
You're a goddamn mess.
Wow.

1624
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,620
You couldn't even stay awake
long enough to catch your flight.

1625
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:36,480
What are you on Ambien taking drugs on?
Nice Ohio boy come over here.

1626
01:33:36,481 --> 01:33:38,730
Phones to those La ways.
Is that what happened?

1627
01:33:38,930 --> 01:33:42,440
No Man that was sitting in an airport.

1628
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:46,220
Yeah, son of a bitch, son of a bitch.

1629
01:33:46,610 --> 01:33:51,230
Did you see this article on a magic
mushrooms repairing brain damage caused by

1630
01:33:51,231 --> 01:33:55,430
extreme trauma? It's
a, it's on my Twitter.

1631
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,030
It's a study from the University of South
Florida that found that low doses of

1632
01:33:59,031 --> 01:34:04,031
the active ingredient in magic mushrooms
repairs brain damage caused by extreme

1633
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:05,054
trauma,

1634
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:10,120
offering renewed hope to millions of
sufferers of PTSD or post traumatic stress

1635
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:12,223
disorder.

1636
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:17,450
And that this study confirms previous
research by the Imperial College London

1637
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:20,840
that silicide at a naturally
occurring compound present in shrooms,

1638
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:25,940
stimulates new brain cell growth
and a races, frightening memories,

1639
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:31,400
mice condition to fear electric shock
when hearing a noise associated with the

1640
01:34:31,401 --> 01:34:36,401
shock simply lost their fear says Dr.
Juan Sanchez Ramos who coauthored the

1641
01:34:37,851 --> 01:34:38,270
study,

1642
01:34:38,270 --> 01:34:43,270
a low dose of psilocybin led to overcoming
fear conditioning and the freeze

1643
01:34:43,461 --> 01:34:48,461
response associated with it faster than
the group of mice on Catacid run Catan,

1644
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:51,170
Catan,
sarin,

1645
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:55,100
which is a drug that counteracts the
receptors that bind siliciden in the brain

1646
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,810
and a control group on amazing.
It's amazing Shit, man.

1647
01:35:00,850 --> 01:35:05,360
Yeah, they, they've linked it to curing
depression and, uh, other, uh, um,

1648
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:07,750
mental health issues as well.

1649
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:11,700
Well, they're saying, yeah.
This, this article also goes
on to talk about how, um,

1650
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:15,540
PTSD is not just psychological,

1651
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:19,920
that common symptoms. It says such as
hypervigilance, memory, fragmentation,

1652
01:35:19,921 --> 01:35:21,900
flashbacks,
this association,

1653
01:35:21,901 --> 01:35:25,800
nightmares and flight or flight responses
to triggers are generally thought to

1654
01:35:25,801 --> 01:35:29,550
be psychological and therefore treatable
by learning to change thought processes.

1655
01:35:29,730 --> 01:35:34,730
But new research suggests that they
may in fact be the result of longterm

1656
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,590
physiological mutations to the brain.

1657
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,280
That's interesting that it actually
changes the brain and that silicide and

1658
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:47,760
repairs those changes. That's
amazing, man. I totally believe it.

1659
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:52,740
I believe it too, but that's an
extreme, extreme statement, you know?

1660
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:56,220
That's really incredible. It's really
incredible that they can do that.

1661
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:58,470
It feels like it when you're on them.
Yeah.

1662
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,790
It feels like there's
renewal brain growing.

1663
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:07,000
Well, I always can see my cell.
I can see life better. Yeah.

1664
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:11,180
I can see like, uh, I get uh,
a nice path. Like, oh, there's
a nice path. You go down,

1665
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:12,770
you know,
like sometimes you get,

1666
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:16,730
especially if you're overwhelmed
with life and busy and stressed out,

1667
01:36:16,731 --> 01:36:20,120
you can get a little cloudy
on what the path is. Totally.

1668
01:36:20,121 --> 01:36:24,500
Then sometimes just one psychedelic
experience and then you see the path like,

1669
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:26,660
oh, this is what's right.
This is what's good. Yeah.

1670
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:30,260
This is my first one in a, in a while. Uh,

1671
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:34,160
just a few weeks ago with Ari,
we went out to Joshua tree. Oh,

1672
01:36:34,161 --> 01:36:39,161
you were on that little journey and we
had him a last and ever since then it was

1673
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,890
just like, I knew I needed, I
mean, it's just like clock work.

1674
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:45,930
It gets rid of all that, uh, this a,

1675
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,180
I was having regularly maybe once a
day for maybe only 20, 30 seconds.

1676
01:36:50,181 --> 01:36:54,020
These feelings of, Oh, I'm dying. You know
what I mean? Like this natural anxiety,

1677
01:36:54,021 --> 01:36:58,970
like how, how am I, you know, whatever.
Yeah, interested in those. It's just gone.

1678
01:36:58,971 --> 01:37:00,440
It's just a different it cleanse.

1679
01:37:00,441 --> 01:37:03,950
It's like giving your brain a
shower is how it feels like to me.

1680
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:05,180
It just feels scrubbed.

1681
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:08,980
I think it's amazing that you had that
incredible experience from just dropping

1682
01:37:08,981 --> 01:37:12,640
dairy that you had this
experience of no depression.

1683
01:37:12,641 --> 01:37:16,660
Feeling better and happier just from
dropping dairy. No doubt about it.

1684
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:21,120
And z immediately like that
day and so delicious though.

1685
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,230
But it's so delicious.
Do you?

1686
01:37:23,610 --> 01:37:27,510
It is, but you'll lose the, you lose the
thing for it after you don't have it.

1687
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:31,070
And once you see, once you feel
the results directly or like Ah,

1688
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:36,730
I mean I love sour cream but I don't
love it that much and it's easy to switch

1689
01:37:36,961 --> 01:37:41,760
over to almond milk and uh, you
know, or any kind of those things.

1690
01:37:41,761 --> 01:37:43,320
They make so many different kinds on.

1691
01:37:43,321 --> 01:37:47,430
I love almond milk and I never really
was a big fan of regular cow's milk.

1692
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,740
Yeah. Almond milks. Pretty bad ass
actually. Yeah. Almond, almond milk.

1693
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,710
It tastes good and it doesn't give
you that weird feeling when it's over.

1694
01:37:54,711 --> 01:37:56,300
But it does like tastes
like when you drinking

1695
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:59,580
it and sounds like you're drinking milk
but no, I can't even have fucking cereal.

1696
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:04,170
So it's a point Tony Hinchcliffe there's
no cereals that are no non gluten per

1697
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:05,820
day.
Probably tastes like ass.

1698
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,980
I'm sure someone's going to
tell me about ones that good.

1699
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:11,160
I found out there's a lot of beer that
you can drink. You can drink Budweiser.

1700
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:15,510
Budweiser has less than 20 parts per
million. That's how you do judge.

1701
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,960
Whether or not something is gluten free.
Budweiser and Heineken,

1702
01:38:18,961 --> 01:38:23,800
apparently Hanukkah. So little gluten
in it. The Corona, Sapporo, um,

1703
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:27,750
the rice beers of Japan, those, those
beers are all rice beers and not, um,

1704
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:32,460
they're not a wheat based. Some good
options. Yeah. There's some options.

1705
01:38:32,461 --> 01:38:35,730
I'm like Heineken's always been a
fan of Heinekens so, uh, that's nice.

1706
01:38:35,731 --> 01:38:39,090
But I can't drink fucking Sam Adams
and I can't drink black Butte porter.

1707
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:41,970
Like a thick Guinness type beer.
I love,

1708
01:38:42,030 --> 01:38:46,980
I love like those stouts about wines.
You can drink wine. Sweet. Yeah. Um,

1709
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,450
I think some, some blah. I don't
think, I don't know about vodka. Yeah.

1710
01:38:51,451 --> 01:38:54,330
What about whiskeys thinking
you drink whiskey? Yeah.

1711
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:57,510
I think you're allowed to drink whiskey
because whiskey whiskey me that awry.

1712
01:38:57,570 --> 01:39:01,530
Is that what it is? Yeah.
Hmm. I don't know. Corn.

1713
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,890
I think probably Tequila.
That's my scowl. Right.

1714
01:39:04,891 --> 01:39:07,860
That's made out of like a cactus or
some shit. Right? Think so. Really?

1715
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:10,800
That's what's killing me though.
That's a great question.

1716
01:39:10,801 --> 01:39:11,640
I never thought about it.

1717
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:15,770
It's clear, clear, clear for something
that fucks you up. That money.

1718
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,210
It seems like it should be rainbow kind
of made some of the worst decisions of

1719
01:39:19,211 --> 01:39:22,300
my life on Tequila. Ah,
it's so much fun. I see.

1720
01:39:22,301 --> 01:39:25,360
I've been doing this thing
lately where I'm, I'm uh,

1721
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:29,170
I rotate what I drink regularly and I
noticed that there's different kind of

1722
01:39:29,171 --> 01:39:34,090
buzzes and stuff that come along
with it. Totally. And, uh, now my,

1723
01:39:34,091 --> 01:39:37,600
one of my new favorite things is just
popping a shot at to Kiel and having a

1724
01:39:37,601 --> 01:39:41,830
beer and rock in the night
away where before I was very,

1725
01:39:41,831 --> 01:39:44,020
very hung up on a,
you know,

1726
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,850
a crown royal and coke
like whiskey and coke was,

1727
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:49,930
was originally so bad for you.

1728
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:53,210
It's made out of a Ga Bay.
And uh,

1729
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:58,190
the blue a Gavi plant is,
uh, the one where they, uh,

1730
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:02,210
they extract a goddess and eating man.

1731
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,460
That's fascinating.
Shit.

1732
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:09,580
Blew a Gavi primarily in the area
surrounding the city of Tequila,

1733
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:10,970
uh,

1734
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:15,970
which is west of northwest of Guadalajara
in the highlands of Los Altos of the

1735
01:40:16,431 --> 01:40:20,090
Mexican western state is of Jelly.
Sko

1736
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:21,690
does not sound safe around that.

1737
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,820
Not The place to take
your family on vacation.

1738
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:28,260
Excellent place to be if you're a key low

1739
01:40:32,090 --> 01:40:35,390
man. It's just weird that that
has become the reality of,

1740
01:40:35,391 --> 01:40:39,290
of Mexico and just a few
short decades. I mean, nobody,

1741
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:41,960
we didn't associate Mexico with
that when I was in high school.

1742
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:47,290
Mexico wasn't drug war and people cutting
off people's heads and the nutty shit

1743
01:40:47,331 --> 01:40:51,390
that you see down there, it's just, it's
so quick help that that's happened. Yeah.

1744
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:54,160
We would like to think that that could
never happen us. And for the most part

1745
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:55,330
I think you can never happen to us,

1746
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:59,600
but Goddamn, how's it happened?
There hasn't happened right there.

1747
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:04,100
They have the control of the, you know,
when the, when the, when the mob gets big,

1748
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:07,850
they can, they can control the
government. That's why, uh, you know,

1749
01:41:07,910 --> 01:41:12,410
they got good, you know, good
fellows and the Godfather, they did,

1750
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:13,460
uh,

1751
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:16,730
they're the ones that really pretty much
ended the mob because they made it look

1752
01:41:16,731 --> 01:41:20,900
cool and it was all about that take
off. I mean, that whole, Eh, we were,

1753
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:23,720
I don't think we were too far
away from the same type of thing.

1754
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:26,930
I think a difference is that the mob was,
you know,

1755
01:41:27,140 --> 01:41:29,870
it's called organized crime for a reason.
They're very strategic.

1756
01:41:29,871 --> 01:41:32,690
I'm not sure if that these
drug wars going down in Mexico,

1757
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:34,640
they seem to be a little
bit more unorthodox.

1758
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:38,090
They're very eager to send a message
that seems to be their main thing.

1759
01:41:38,091 --> 01:41:42,110
They will cut off heads and put
them on your mailbox, you know?

1760
01:41:42,230 --> 01:41:45,410
If you fuck with them
and you know the mob,

1761
01:41:45,411 --> 01:41:48,020
they would just put a horses head in your
bed or something like that. You know?

1762
01:41:48,050 --> 01:41:49,470
They wouldn't put up a human head on your,

1763
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:54,070
you're romanticizing the mob. The mob,
they were nice. My mom was a nice person,

1764
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:57,160
so she ran a few numbers,
but everybody was fine.

1765
01:41:57,161 --> 01:41:59,260
We killed the horse every now
and then to keep you in line.

1766
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:02,600
It's really interesting. They
really were. They, I mean,

1767
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,720
you really think so that in a lot of ways.
Yeah.

1768
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:10,780
I mean the city of Youngstown was
booming when the mob was still,

1769
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:14,090
I mean, not booming, booming. The
steel industry was dilapidating it,

1770
01:42:14,091 --> 01:42:18,710
but it's better to have organized
crime than disorganized crime.

1771
01:42:18,711 --> 01:42:23,040
And what happened when the FBI raided,
uh, Youngstown for example. And then,

1772
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:25,010
I mean that's a small,
not too small,

1773
01:42:25,011 --> 01:42:27,920
but it's a pretty small scale of what
obviously would be like in New York,

1774
01:42:27,921 --> 01:42:28,754
in Chicago.

1775
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:33,260
But what happened in Youngstown was a
black gangs took over the bloods and the

1776
01:42:33,261 --> 01:42:35,690
crips in, in a very, very big way.

1777
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:40,910
And then all of a sudden there's drive
bys and there's bullets going through

1778
01:42:40,911 --> 01:42:44,510
your window and leaving a mark on the
other side of your living room wall.

1779
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:46,310
And it all becomes a reality.

1780
01:42:46,311 --> 01:42:51,020
Whereas when the mob was there
controlling the streets, other gangs,

1781
01:42:51,021 --> 01:42:54,890
there was no other gangs. But as soon
as they got rid of the mob, they let,

1782
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:58,760
they don't mind disorganized crime
as much as they mind organized.

1783
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:00,020
It's very bizarre.

1784
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:03,950
Yeah. That is pretty crazy.
You know, that's what people
say about Vegas. You know,

1785
01:43:03,951 --> 01:43:04,784
people,

1786
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:08,390
they're always talking about the good
old days when Vegas was run by the mob,

1787
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:12,530
you know, the mom just ran Vegas. Right.
Everyone was polite. Everywhere you go,

1788
01:43:12,531 --> 01:43:16,940
you've got a nice lobster. People love
to talk about that. Yeah. My Brand Vegas.

1789
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,660
Yeah,
they did.

1790
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,780
Did you see the, uh, speaking of Vegas,
the, um, uh, the video with our, the,

1791
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:28,410
the film rather with, um, Michael Douglas
and Matt Damon, or they played Liberace.

1792
01:43:28,411 --> 01:43:29,500
Liberace slower.
Yeah.

1793
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:33,390
Watching it. How was it? Was it
like on a, on a Brokeback mountain

1794
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:37,570
scale is amazing. It's, it
buries Brokeback mountain.
Really? Yeah. Barry. Barry's it.

1795
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:42,220
Brokeback mountain is Brokeback mountain,
first of all.

1796
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:43,900
I don't remember who said it.

1797
01:43:43,901 --> 01:43:46,570
I think it was Ricky Gervais'
said something really funny.

1798
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,940
I think it was him that
was quoted this saying,

1799
01:43:48,941 --> 01:43:53,810
it's surreal watching Gordon
Gecko get fucked by, um,

1800
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:57,860
uh, Jason Bourne because, you know,

1801
01:43:57,861 --> 01:44:02,590
Matt Damon is Jason Bourne and Gordon
Gekko was Michael Douglas and you know,

1802
01:44:02,690 --> 01:44:07,220
my 15 minutes fucking, you know,
Michael Douglas show that? Yes.

1803
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,060
First of all,

1804
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:12,320
Michael Douglas is one of the baddest
motherfuckers that ever lived.

1805
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:17,300
He is Liberace. I mean,
he fucking is him. Wow.

1806
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:21,780
It's amazing. I mean, if you watch
Liberace and watch the films and watch,

1807
01:44:21,781 --> 01:44:26,120
like how he talked and behaved,
I mean, he literally is him.

1808
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:29,540
It's amazing.
The transformation is spectacular.

1809
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:32,460
He makes you realize what a
great actor he really is. Yeah.

1810
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:38,120
And Matt Damon to you fucking buy it.
You buy it, hook, line and sinker.

1811
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:43,100
You know, he's Jason Bourne.
Okay. You know, he was the
guy from goodwill hunting,

1812
01:44:43,101 --> 01:44:47,840
you know all those things. And
yet you still buy it. Hook,

1813
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:51,960
line and sinker. They are too
bad motherfuckers. And I went,

1814
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:55,850
before I saw it, I was like, how
good could this bay to Jesus Christ,

1815
01:44:55,851 --> 01:44:59,180
you're shooting your balls and waxing
and oiling it up. No. Before that,

1816
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:02,030
in preparation for that, I
don't, I don't, you know,

1817
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:06,620
I don't watch gay films
naked anyway. The, um,

1818
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:11,090
the, the, the, the act again, it was
incredible. The story though is really,

1819
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:15,110
it's kind of a weird story because all
it is essentially is one guy who got

1820
01:45:15,111 --> 01:45:17,030
pissed at Liberace,
didn't want to fuck him anymore.

1821
01:45:17,031 --> 01:45:19,910
So he told the Liberace story,
you know,

1822
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:24,260
and the Liberace story to be told in
this film is basically the Liberace liked

1823
01:45:24,261 --> 01:45:28,640
to fuck. He was really super
talented. He liked to play music.

1824
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,350
Most of the old ladies came to the show,

1825
01:45:30,351 --> 01:45:32,900
didn't know he was gay and
after the show was over,

1826
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:37,040
he wanted to get guys and fuck
them. You know, and like that's it.

1827
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:40,460
Like that's he and you know, painted
out to be this like horrible, horrible,

1828
01:45:40,461 --> 01:45:42,440
horrible person.
But in reality,

1829
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:47,450
he was just a guy who had $500 million
and like to fuck. Yeah. You know, I mean,

1830
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:49,030
it really didn't hurt anybody in the mill,

1831
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,840
kicked the guy out when the guy got crazy.

1832
01:45:50,841 --> 01:45:55,841
But it also is interesting because
the guy who Matt Damon is playing,

1833
01:45:56,511 --> 01:46:00,860
like his character in the movie is hooked
on pills and all these amphetamines

1834
01:46:00,861 --> 01:46:04,250
and you watch like Matt Damon's
character changes personality and stuff.

1835
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:05,970
It's fucking great, man. I love it.

1836
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:09,030
It's amazing to see how some actors,
you know,

1837
01:46:09,031 --> 01:46:12,510
a lot of great actors and play some of
the same types of characters through

1838
01:46:12,511 --> 01:46:16,920
movies or the most impressive
to me is a Walter White, um,

1839
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:20,830
uh, Krantz, Bryan
Cranston, Bryan Cranston,

1840
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:25,050
because I didn't realize until like
season four or five of breaking bad.

1841
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:27,260
I don't know if you
watch it. Yeah. But he,

1842
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:30,040
but he also plays the dad in
Malcolm in the middle. Oh yeah.

1843
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:32,430
Like this is positive,
happy. Like who who do that?

1844
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:36,330
And Walter White is the complete
opposite about he these.

1845
01:46:36,570 --> 01:46:41,010
So he's got so much to him and he's not
just a something that's just a little

1846
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:44,220
bleak character like the
Malcolm in the middle of dad.

1847
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:48,450
He is so developed and it's so deep and
sell emotional and you see so much of it

1848
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:50,070
that agility that

1849
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,970
he could play that guy and that
guy. Yeah. Andy plays that guy.

1850
01:46:53,971 --> 01:46:56,910
So while you want me wins like
every year, pretty much, uh,

1851
01:46:56,970 --> 01:47:01,600
or at least a few now for his work on
that and to think that he can play that

1852
01:47:01,601 --> 01:47:04,080
guy too. Just a Malcolm
in the Middle Dad. He's,

1853
01:47:04,150 --> 01:47:09,120
his portrayal of a teacher
is so goddamn good.

1854
01:47:09,121 --> 01:47:09,954
I mean he,

1855
01:47:10,140 --> 01:47:14,880
he sets the parameters of like the way
a teacher would behave so perfectly and

1856
01:47:14,881 --> 01:47:18,600
precisely. It's masterful.
It really is masterful.

1857
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:23,010
He's incredible. They ever really
is. Yeah. The guys who can do that.

1858
01:47:23,011 --> 01:47:25,980
Like you gotta really admire that,
that, that, that's just such a very,

1859
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:29,580
it's such a very specific level of acting.
You know,

1860
01:47:29,581 --> 01:47:32,340
like this like Daniel Day Lewis,
which I harp on too much,

1861
01:47:32,341 --> 01:47:34,350
but so that level of acting,

1862
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:37,670
it's so much different than most of the
Douche bags you see at Starbucks going

1863
01:47:37,671 --> 01:47:40,620
to their scripts. Totally in
Cranston. Such a cool guy too.

1864
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:43,920
I don't know if you saw this,
but it comicon. Oh yeah, yeah.

1865
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:46,840
I just saw the thing with
the mask and then uh,

1866
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:49,770
they brought him up for the panel and
he took off the mask place went crazy.

1867
01:47:49,771 --> 01:47:52,950
Why do I feel like we played Liberace
music on this podcast before?

1868
01:47:52,951 --> 01:47:55,230
Have we know this is
what I want to pull up.

1869
01:47:55,231 --> 01:47:58,800
Then I want to pull up the
song when Liberace winks at me.

1870
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:04,440
Cause this is like, this was like some
real shit. This is in 19, you know,

1871
01:48:04,441 --> 01:48:07,380
fifties ish. When Liberace
was like, you know,

1872
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:11,940
I guess this was like a scene in a movie
and a woman is singing a song about how

1873
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,100
enthralled she is by
Liberace. And it's, it's,

1874
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:17,610
it's amazing.
First of all,

1875
01:48:17,611 --> 01:48:20,520
it's amazing when you stop and think
about how much our culture's changed since

1876
01:48:20,521 --> 01:48:24,480
then because this is like, you know,
whatever the hell it is. 19 we'll pull it.

1877
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:25,800
What does it say? What year is it? Say,

1878
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:27,440
uh,

1879
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:32,210
1955. 1955. Watch this
shit. This is incredible.

1880
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:37,640
It's like strange time machine.
Oh,

1881
01:48:37,641 --> 01:48:41,210
it's just the watch this
Liberace and Libby Morris,

1882
01:48:43,970 --> 01:48:48,170
she's sitting in front of her TV and
she's on her knees in front of a little

1883
01:48:48,171 --> 01:48:52,610
desk writing a letter and she's
staring wistfully into the TV.

1884
01:48:53,220 --> 01:48:55,550
Oh, Liberace plays
piano. He's so handsome.

1885
01:48:57,370 --> 01:48:59,440
And he winks at you.
And when he winks clinks

1886
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:06,440
[inaudible]

1887
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:21,483
like it.

1888
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:25,530
[inaudible]

1889
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:27,500
so are

1890
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:39,460
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

1891
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:47,830
my says Clinton that's allowed to

1892
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:51,290
that loud clink his, his, his eyeball.

1893
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:53,333
No.

1894
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:15,080
How many fucking weird listening to it.
I'll tell you what, man, after that movie,

1895
01:50:15,081 --> 01:50:17,650
I went on the Liberace
kicked for several days. Wow.

1896
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:21,880
I resisted it at first because I was
like, what am I Liberace fam. Um,

1897
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:26,990
but, and then, but so somewhere along
the line, somewhere along the line,

1898
01:50:26,991 --> 01:50:28,840
I embrace it. And, uh,

1899
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:33,850
I just started just googling Liberace
and listening to interviews or watched to

1900
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:37,460
him give a tour of his house. He had
like a, it was weird. He had like,

1901
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:39,800
his house is like real regularly
looking on the outside,

1902
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:43,640
but then when you went inside of it,
it's like a fucking palace and he,

1903
01:50:43,641 --> 01:50:46,910
he had like a normal front to the
house but then he had like, he goes,

1904
01:50:46,911 --> 01:50:49,100
I had two houses built inside of it.

1905
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:53,510
Like inside the house it just
says like this fucking massive,

1906
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:57,920
huge place. And apparently,
um, one of his houses,

1907
01:50:57,950 --> 01:51:02,000
one of his big houses is for sale
right now. I think it's palm springs.

1908
01:51:02,001 --> 01:51:05,510
I think that's where it is. But it's
for sale real cheap, like 500 grand.

1909
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:09,590
Like you could buy Liberace's house and
it still has like the painting over the

1910
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:12,020
see if he could find it.
Liberace's house for sale.

1911
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:15,030
I bet his house had a giant
closet that he would say.

1912
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:19,310
Well he sued,
um,

1913
01:51:19,610 --> 01:51:24,610
he sued a newspaper in England because
they claimed that he was gay and he sued

1914
01:51:25,251 --> 01:51:29,910
them in one apparently. Wow.
Yeah, there were different times,

1915
01:51:29,911 --> 01:51:33,950
but for reporting the reporting of that,
he was a homosexual. Well today. Yeah,

1916
01:51:33,951 --> 01:51:38,951
his mansion for sale for $529,000 which
is a lot of money for that fucking house

1917
01:51:39,051 --> 01:51:41,870
cause you never going to get it back.
It probably smells like shit,

1918
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:45,200
dicks and shit.

1919
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,700
When he died,

1920
01:51:49,701 --> 01:51:54,260
apparently he had like a half a billion
dollars or something close to that.

1921
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:58,610
He was just so gangster.
What he did was so crazy.

1922
01:51:58,790 --> 01:52:02,390
He made his boyfriend get
plastic surgery to look like him.

1923
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:05,070
So it goes back to like what
we were talking about earlier.

1924
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:08,380
He wanted to fuck himself. Yeah.
That's what he wanted. Yeah. He,

1925
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:12,830
he made his boyfriend's handsome guy get
a chin implant to look like Liberace.

1926
01:52:13,190 --> 01:52:14,660
Wow.

1927
01:52:15,410 --> 01:52:19,400
Handsome phrase I read that is
going deep with the crazy. Yeah.

1928
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:20,840
That's going really,

1929
01:52:20,841 --> 01:52:24,590
really deep with the crazy fucking a man.

1930
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:30,080
Yeah. A Chin implant here. Hey, get a chin
implant and learn how to play the piano.

1931
01:52:30,081 --> 01:52:34,580
Like a fucking genius dude.
He didn't give a fuck. Wow.

1932
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:38,150
He didn't give a fuck.
And he was a brilliant,

1933
01:52:38,151 --> 01:52:40,670
brilliant fucking penis. Man. I mean,

1934
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:45,620
he was like a fantastic pianist.
It was really,

1935
01:52:45,621 --> 01:52:50,390
I mean, it's really amazing to watch.
Did he ever date Leno and how dare you?

1936
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:54,900
How dare you. I'll get it to
Linda has a big chin too. Oh,

1937
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:58,880
they're around him for years.
I see how this crazy fuck works.

1938
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:05,660
Um, did you guys hear about the unmarked
graves in Florida at the reform school?

1939
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:09,470
Oh my God. Go back to July
31st on my Twitter. Brian,

1940
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:11,570
you find this story in Florida,

1941
01:53:11,571 --> 01:53:14,930
a clash over at zooming
bodies out of reform school.

1942
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:18,320
There's this reform school in
Florida and it's called the,

1943
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:20,150
they're called the White House boys.

1944
01:53:20,151 --> 01:53:24,140
And there were a group of men and
many of them now in their sixties and

1945
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:27,170
seventies who were sent to this
reform school when they were children.

1946
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:31,880
And they remember beatings where
people were beaten to death.

1947
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:36,110
Where were students there were
beaten to death like they had,

1948
01:53:36,410 --> 01:53:41,390
like they ran the place with an iron
fist and when kids got out of line,

1949
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:46,690
they gave them frightening beatings and
say they knew children who died from the

1950
01:53:47,151 --> 01:53:48,500
beating.
So a few years ago,

1951
01:53:48,501 --> 01:53:53,470
the state investigator said that they
found no evidence that anyone at the staff

1952
01:53:53,471 --> 01:53:58,250
at the school had been responsible for
any student deaths. But then these people,

1953
01:53:58,251 --> 01:53:59,270
with the state's permission,

1954
01:53:59,271 --> 01:54:02,900
they've got a team of researchers and
they use ground penetrating radar to

1955
01:54:02,901 --> 01:54:07,901
locate nearly 100 unmarked graves
at the school more than a hunt.

1956
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:13,610
Oh yeah. So they thought it was 50 at
first and then people were freaking out.

1957
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:14,630
And then they found,

1958
01:54:14,631 --> 01:54:18,410
they kept finding more the state reports
of the 50 boards or believed buried in

1959
01:54:18,411 --> 01:54:19,430
unmarked graves,

1960
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:22,850
but said that it would not be possible
to identify and zoom the remains from

1961
01:54:22,851 --> 01:54:25,850
individual grade sites.
So then they started like admitting it.

1962
01:54:25,851 --> 01:54:28,910
And that's when forensic
anthropologists, uh, Aaron,

1963
01:54:28,911 --> 01:54:33,911
Kimberly Kimery and Aaron Kimery got
invested interested in the story.

1964
01:54:34,430 --> 01:54:37,280
So He's ground penetrating radar,
found a hundred fucking bodies.

1965
01:54:37,281 --> 01:54:41,380
And now what's interesting is that
the governor does not want them fun.

1966
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,280
They don't want them
zooming all these bodies.

1967
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:46,580
They're trying to like keep the lid on
this shit. They're like, Jesus Christ.

1968
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:50,720
So the government, the governor
Scott is a fighting exhumation.

1969
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:54,590
But Kim Marie and her team are supported
by Florida's attorney general members

1970
01:54:54,591 --> 01:54:59,090
of the legislature and by Senator
Bill Nelson. This is incredible, man.

1971
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:03,230
The state of Florida has the
worst publicist in the world.

1972
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:07,010
Everything out of Florida. It's
never like great, like, uh, hey, uh,

1973
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:10,520
great stuff discovered in Florida. No,
it's either sinking into the ground,

1974
01:55:10,521 --> 01:55:13,790
people killing each other.
100 bodies,

1975
01:55:13,791 --> 01:55:18,260
hundred a hundred bodies,
an unmarked graves. Well,

1976
01:55:18,261 --> 01:55:23,120
they're dead. The, these people are,
this is all from like the 1930s and shit.

1977
01:55:23,150 --> 01:55:26,840
No, but like when it happened, like, like,
Hey, my son never came home from school.

1978
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:30,020
I don't know. Hey, my, my other son
didn't come home from school. I mean,

1979
01:55:30,021 --> 01:55:32,480
I think there you're dealing with,
you know,

1980
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:37,580
I'll probably decades of,
you know, one a year missing,

1981
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:41,690
you know, and they've hundred
fucking bodies, you know. I mean,

1982
01:55:41,691 --> 01:55:44,040
I guess it's more than that. It means
it needs to be more than one a year.

1983
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,680
One every few months. I mean,
how many of they kill him?

1984
01:55:45,681 --> 01:55:48,990
And I wonder how long they were open
for. That's a good question. Actually.

1985
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:52,620
Let's say this. Yeah, you would think
somebody would be like, wait a second.

1986
01:55:52,621 --> 01:55:55,350
There's been a hundred missing
students in the last 10 years.

1987
01:55:55,351 --> 01:55:58,680
Just what they call them, the White
House boys. Ooh, this is so creepy.

1988
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:00,630
Just think about this group of men,

1989
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:04,110
many now in their sixties and seventies
who were sent to this school who when

1990
01:56:04,111 --> 01:56:08,130
they were children who knew boys
that had been beaten to death.

1991
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:14,610
Jesus Christ. That's what,
that's insane. Yeah man.

1992
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,890
Brutal,
brutal beatings.

1993
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:22,260
Florida has a website or a Twitter
account called Florida man.

1994
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:25,380
It's underscore Florida man at Twitter.

1995
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:28,770
It is maybe the best Twitter account ever.

1996
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:33,360
It's all shit. That dude's who live
in Florida have been arrested for.

1997
01:56:33,810 --> 01:56:34,261
I mean,

1998
01:56:34,261 --> 01:56:39,261
and it's updated all fucking
day every day and it's awesome.

1999
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:41,903
It's awesome.

2000
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:46,140
Florida man tells police he has a gun
so they respond to is nine one one call

2001
01:56:46,141 --> 01:56:48,750
quicker Florida man,
the cops,

2002
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:52,740
I'm not going anywhere until I
get my weed. It's humidity, man.

2003
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:54,360
Humidity drives people crazy.

2004
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:58,830
Florida man arrested twice in
one week for sex with dogs.

2005
01:56:59,970 --> 01:57:03,120
Florida man taken to police station
for driving without a license.

2006
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,820
Urinates on x ray machine.
And detention officer.

2007
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:12,150
Florida man stops to help woman after
a motorcycle crash steals her purse.

2008
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:16,180
Oh, I heard about that. Yeah, no, this,

2009
01:57:16,610 --> 01:57:21,050
this woman was in a car accident.
She was trapped in her SUV and uh,

2010
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:24,600
this guy came up and just store
purse and then left her in there.

2011
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:27,690
Florida man leaves six year old son
and crashed car because he thought his

2012
01:57:27,691 --> 01:57:32,340
driver's license was
suspended. It wasn't. Wow.

2013
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:35,550
Florida man crashes car three
times in one night of drunk driving

2014
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:42,780
three times.
Oh Man.

2015
01:57:42,810 --> 01:57:46,230
People are awesome.
But Florida is just so strange.

2016
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:52,080
It's just so strange. It's so, there's
a whole weird thing going on over there,

2017
01:57:52,081 --> 01:57:55,950
man. That all swamp land. That's like
the, it's like the devil's Gooch. Yeah,

2018
01:57:56,100 --> 01:57:59,760
just swamp lands and fucking, they
put Disney world there, but it's like,

2019
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,840
it doesn't seem like Disney world should
be in the middle of that state. Well,

2020
01:58:03,841 --> 01:58:08,160
you don't, they said about Florida
is that within this decade,

2021
01:58:08,161 --> 01:58:12,270
within the next 10 years, they believe
that Miami's going to be underwater.

2022
01:58:12,950 --> 01:58:15,380
It's like they're the most
recent estimates. They're there.

2023
01:58:15,381 --> 01:58:18,300
They're worried that Miami
and a lot of Florida,

2024
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:22,830
the ground is apparently very porous and
so it's not like New Orleans where you

2025
01:58:22,831 --> 01:58:27,420
could set up a levy though. Like
once that water rises, it's a wrap.

2026
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,440
Yeah. You know, so I don't know if
this is right, but if that's right,

2027
01:58:31,441 --> 01:58:33,690
think about all those giant ass
condos that are like on the,

2028
01:58:33,691 --> 01:58:38,010
on the beach in Miami. Those were all
what it's going to be like Venice.

2029
01:58:38,011 --> 01:58:39,210
There'll be like Venice,
Italy.

2030
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:41,680
It'd be way great carries in that
because it's going to be no one in those

2031
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:45,850
things. Like what are they going to do
if all that's under the ocean? Like,

2032
01:58:45,851 --> 01:58:50,170
do you know how freaky would be if you
could drive a boat through Miami and see

2033
01:58:50,171 --> 01:58:53,140
all these,
these giant buildings in 10 years?

2034
01:58:53,380 --> 01:58:57,150
Do you think people wake up
then and realize what the
fuck is going on out there?

2035
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,740
They're going to have to at single,
like people are gonna be like, hey man,

2036
01:58:59,741 --> 01:59:01,780
I think maybe we should fucking
stop building right on the water.

2037
01:59:01,781 --> 01:59:05,530
What do you think? Right. I think
think this water's coming up on us.

2038
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:10,310
Oh, it's happening. Do you see the,
uh, the videos of the North Pole?

2039
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,710
That looks like a swimming
pool? No, you haven't seen that?

2040
01:59:12,740 --> 01:59:17,050
[inaudible] is fucking crazy. See if
it pulled that up. North Pole melting.

2041
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:20,140
Wait, what do you see this? Just like,

2042
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:25,440
they have videos of Greenland and like
these Manhattan size chunks of ice are

2043
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:29,830
fallen off glaciers into, into
the ocean. Oh my God. It's like,

2044
01:59:29,831 --> 01:59:33,520
it's all happening like right there.
It's like you watch it every day.

2045
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:38,380
I wonder how long I am.
Hey, I just don't even know.

2046
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:39,483
I wonder,

2047
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:44,940
I wonder when like common sense and
technology are going to just buttheads.

2048
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:50,270
Yeah. And people are just
going to, they'll no longer be,

2049
01:59:50,271 --> 01:59:53,900
eventually there's going to be no longer
debates about things. You know, like, hey,

2050
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:56,680
is there global warming? Well here
you go. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,

2051
01:59:56,890 --> 02:00:00,270
and just diagrams and stuff and yeah,
there's a, you know, I mean it's got,

2052
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:04,210
it's going to get realer as technology
keeps getting better at the arguments are

2053
02:00:04,211 --> 02:00:05,044
all,
yeah.

2054
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:09,400
Hg Wells had a great quote that
history is a race between education and

2055
02:00:09,401 --> 02:00:13,330
catastrophe. Wow. A great quote. Yeah.

2056
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:16,720
He wrote that shit in
the 18 hundreds you know,

2057
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:20,170
it's just shows you people saw trends.

2058
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:22,720
We're have crazy shit is a long time ago.

2059
02:00:23,050 --> 02:00:27,370
It's just like we're hoping that one day
it's going to get to a point where it

2060
02:00:27,371 --> 02:00:31,630
doesn't happen anymore. It's like it's,
but it seems like that's not how it goes.

2061
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:36,930
How it goes is just you manage the chaos
as must chew as much as you can while

2062
02:00:37,361 --> 02:00:40,090
it's around you.
What is,

2063
02:00:40,091 --> 02:00:44,890
this is supposedly a a Webcam.
The melt pool.

2064
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:45,240
Yeah.

2065
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:50,240
Just slowly starts turning into a
lake and this area of the North Pole.

2066
02:00:57,720 --> 02:00:58,553
Oh Wow.

2067
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:05,140
Oh boy. Oh Wow. That's crazy.

2068
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:09,100
That is so strange.

2069
02:01:10,670 --> 02:01:14,840
While you're watching something that was
completely covered in ice and then all

2070
02:01:14,841 --> 02:01:18,280
of a sudden that melts, but we don't know
if that happens every year. Right? Yeah.

2071
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:20,900
If it just went back to being
frozen like two days later. Yeah.

2072
02:01:20,901 --> 02:01:23,570
Maybe that was their summer. Yeah. Because
you remember in March of the penguins,

2073
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:26,330
there's that whole thing about it thaws
out and then they fuck and then they,

2074
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:31,640
then they go and have babies and shit
and then it was freezing cold out.

2075
02:01:31,641 --> 02:01:34,400
They have to hide the eggs. Did you
ever see that now? I didn't catch that.

2076
02:01:34,401 --> 02:01:38,150
Maybe for a great, maybe
it's an interesting movie,
but it's a brutal existence.

2077
02:01:38,630 --> 02:01:40,650
These poor penguins,
they have to huddle up together.

2078
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:42,650
The block each other from the wind.

2079
02:01:42,740 --> 02:01:46,880
They just get together and stand up
and the wind just whips them fucking 50

2080
02:01:46,881 --> 02:01:51,770
below zero and just, and then just trying
to cover their eggs with their feet.

2081
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:53,720
It's so primal.
Wow.

2082
02:01:53,780 --> 02:01:57,260
It's amazing when you stop and think about
what kind of environment that life is

2083
02:01:57,530 --> 02:02:01,760
not just living in but thriving
year after year, year after year.

2084
02:02:01,761 --> 02:02:05,000
These things keep fucking in that
same spot. Keep making babies,

2085
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:07,640
keep walking miles across
the ice to get to the ocean.

2086
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:11,660
Keeps surviving and you can plan
when your Internet goes down. Yeah.

2087
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:16,940
Penguins. I mean they're just
born in negative temperatures.

2088
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:20,390
This is the suckiest spot on the
planet. Right? Is there a suckier spot?

2089
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:24,500
Would you rather live in the North Pole
or in the jungle or South Pole or South

2090
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:29,060
Pole jungle. I live in the jungle. I don't
know. It does the same shit. Both frozen.

2091
02:02:29,061 --> 02:02:32,690
I think South poles frozen like Argentina.
Like this is glaciers in Argentina.

2092
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:34,670
Why don't we hear anything
about the South Pole?

2093
02:02:34,671 --> 02:02:36,560
It's always the north pole
because that's where Santa lives.

2094
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:40,430
South Santa lives in the North Pole
with the fuck lives in the South Pole.

2095
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:44,330
Is it that one article as the south
port, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2096
02:02:44,630 --> 02:02:49,370
It's creepy down there. Yeah. It's tricky.
They don't even say they. Is that true?

2097
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:51,350
They don't even really know.
Let's see. Map of the world.

2098
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:56,000
Was that true that the NRA,
I don't know if you say to me people,

2099
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:58,630
Antarctica is down there. People say, um,

2100
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:02,120
like I've got a lot of criticism
when we did the Dan Carlin podcasts.

2101
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:05,840
You're so ignorant for me.
Is 40 years old up out some shit.

2102
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:10,850
Yeah. But you know what? I'm
fucking honest about what
I know what I don't know,

2103
02:03:10,851 --> 02:03:13,730
man. Yeah, there's a lot of
shit. I don't know, but there's
a lot of shit. I do know.

2104
02:03:13,731 --> 02:03:16,970
There's no room for all of
it. Okay. God dammit, you,

2105
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:19,220
you can only know so
many things in this life.

2106
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:23,480
It doesn't make you stupid because
you don't know things. Okay. You know,

2107
02:03:23,481 --> 02:03:26,090
and it makes you,
you're interested in other shit folks.

2108
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,390
People have to get that into your head
just because there's certain data that

2109
02:03:29,391 --> 02:03:31,780
you should have probably accumulated.
But if you haven't,

2110
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:33,510
it doesn't mean you're stupid right now.

2111
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:36,590
And people are so quick
to call stupid on people,

2112
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:39,350
but there's plenty of shit that
I've done that makes me stupid.

2113
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:43,280
That's not one of them. Yeah. South
America, it's below South America.

2114
02:03:43,281 --> 02:03:48,010
Antarctica is essentially the South Pole.
And I just signed the other day that a,

2115
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:52,970
we're still in the ice age. We are.
Yeah. If you look up ice age, uh,

2116
02:03:52,971 --> 02:03:55,700
it's, uh, it's, that's what we're,

2117
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:58,310
we're still in that cause it's a huge,
you know,

2118
02:03:58,311 --> 02:04:00,410
tens of thousands or whatever of years.

2119
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:05,650
And because Antarctica and the North Pole
and Greenland or something like that,

2120
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:08,840
there's another one or Iceland or
Greenland, because these things exist.

2121
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:13,940
We're still in the ice age until they
melt that we're still in that. Whoa.

2122
02:04:13,941 --> 02:04:16,880
That's crazy. Wow. I never
even thought of that.

2123
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:21,350
So until these frozen areas melt,
yep. We're still in the ice age.

2124
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:25,400
So when the dinosaurs were around,
there were no, no, icebergs are shut.

2125
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:27,350
I'm not sure about that.
I don't know.

2126
02:04:27,351 --> 02:04:32,000
I don't know whether that was in that
period or not of tens of thousands of

2127
02:04:32,001 --> 02:04:36,230
years. That's the hardest thing
to wrap your head around. Yeah.

2128
02:04:36,270 --> 02:04:39,720
That this thing changes so often.
It's just constantly the,

2129
02:04:39,950 --> 02:04:44,130
the oceans moving and changing. When I
was in Montana, when we were hunting, um,

2130
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:47,850
one of the things that was so weird seeing
seashells there, he would climb these,

2131
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:52,920
these tall hills, and as you're climbing
up the ground is actually like silt.

2132
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:55,470
It's silt because that
used to be the ocean.

2133
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:59,580
They used to be the great western inland
seas. So as you're walking around,

2134
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:03,690
you're walking in this real mucky
sort of clay ish, muddy thing,

2135
02:05:03,870 --> 02:05:07,410
and as you're walking out, but you'll
find seashells. It's such a mind,

2136
02:05:07,411 --> 02:05:10,350
fuck Joshua tree.
You're looking at these rocks.

2137
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:13,800
Sometimes it's like a movie set because
you're like, how's that a perfect circle?

2138
02:05:13,801 --> 02:05:17,280
How's that rock perfect half. Who
rolled that here? How did this get here?

2139
02:05:18,060 --> 02:05:20,740
Will you ever see those
rocks that they found? Um, I,

2140
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:25,410
I want to say Billy's Billy's stones.
Let me say bullies.

2141
02:05:25,650 --> 02:05:30,120
I loved that picture you in salmon that
you caught that giant hug of a salmon.

2142
02:05:30,190 --> 02:05:34,740
Your smile was ear to ear. I Laurie
and I caught a bunch of them, man. Oh,

2143
02:05:34,741 --> 02:05:38,940
you were up there with him? I didn't,
yeah, Ari and I, we did a, the bear tooth,

2144
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:43,290
I think it's called the bear tooth lodge.
It's bad ass place in Anchorage.

2145
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:43,861
And we uh,

2146
02:05:43,861 --> 02:05:47,570
went salmon fishing and put those bad
boys or is it we didn't need those. Yeah,

2147
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,140
because um,
we,

2148
02:05:49,141 --> 02:05:53,400
when we went it was a catch
and release time, but they,

2149
02:05:53,410 --> 02:05:57,570
they base it on how many salmon come
through the we're, the weird is like a,

2150
02:05:57,580 --> 02:06:01,680
like a salmon to have to come into this
box area and they count them then they

2151
02:06:01,681 --> 02:06:03,870
let them through.
But right before we got there,

2152
02:06:03,871 --> 02:06:06,000
we couldn't have asked for a
better day before we got there.

2153
02:06:06,001 --> 02:06:09,510
There was like hundreds of salmon came
through, so it was like a crazy amount.

2154
02:06:09,511 --> 02:06:11,820
We're in the river while we were there.
It was so fun.

2155
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,010
They're so big that it's weird though.

2156
02:06:14,011 --> 02:06:18,390
Being up there and seeing moose
everywhere, seeing Musen Eagles and shit.

2157
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:21,870
Alaska's amazing. Have you
been up there yet? Not yet.

2158
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:25,430
You guys gotta to do a show up there.
We're in talks right now about four. Five.

2159
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:29,460
It's supposed to be a wet two days for
shows. I don't know if two days, what?

2160
02:06:29,461 --> 02:06:34,110
Two days, four shows in our where and
remember where it was now. I don't know.

2161
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:37,360
Fairbanks or anchorage? Anchorage. Were
you going to go? Do you know the place?

2162
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:40,920
I don't know the place. Two days of shows.
That'd be fun. You'll have a great time.

2163
02:06:41,050 --> 02:06:43,680
The people up there, coolest
shit. The girl said that, uh,

2164
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:47,040
the girl that's booking it said that
it's one of those places that they never

2165
02:06:47,041 --> 02:06:50,610
had anybody come out there.
So like if anybody comes out,

2166
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:54,480
everybody just goes to the show.
Like no matter if they're a fan or not,

2167
02:06:54,481 --> 02:06:58,980
they just want, you know, they find out
about it because that's it. Yeah. Yeah.

2168
02:06:58,981 --> 02:07:01,310
Well it's uh, it's an
awesome town, man. There's,

2169
02:07:01,311 --> 02:07:04,360
there's something really cool about those
people up there and I think part of it

2170
02:07:04,370 --> 02:07:07,140
is because they just, uh,
it's like they're real bonded.

2171
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:10,470
It's a real interesting
kind of a community and
they're very progressive too.

2172
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:14,160
We saw um, uh, Christians free quality,

2173
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:16,140
this big group of Christians for quality.

2174
02:07:16,141 --> 02:07:19,080
They were standing on the corner with
like the gay flag, the rainbow flag,

2175
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:20,100
and they were,
you know,

2176
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:24,690
like waving these signs and like waving
to people and people like honk at them

2177
02:07:24,691 --> 02:07:27,720
when they drove by like
agreeing with them. It was
kind of interesting, you know,

2178
02:07:27,721 --> 02:07:31,260
I didn't expect that in Alaska. I
mean, I don't know prejudice word,

2179
02:07:31,270 --> 02:07:32,700
I've never heard of that group of four.

2180
02:07:32,701 --> 02:07:36,010
That says a lot about Alaska
Christians for equality.

2181
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:41,170
Normally Christians are very
Christian. Yeah, no, not up there, man.

2182
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:44,530
It was really cool. I it the,
the f the shows were cool.

2183
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:47,140
Everything about it was
cool and it's just, it just,

2184
02:07:47,141 --> 02:07:50,050
you feel weird being up
there. The fact is, any trend,

2185
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:52,840
how much Canada loves comedy,
the farther north you go,

2186
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:56,080
then it must be like heaven,
comedy heaven up there.

2187
02:07:56,081 --> 02:07:59,620
Because I love the few times I've
been in Canada to do comedy shows,

2188
02:07:59,621 --> 02:08:01,540
it's always been some of the highlights.

2189
02:08:01,570 --> 02:08:04,870
And so I can't imagine what it's like
farther north. Did you Seattle? Yeah,

2190
02:08:04,970 --> 02:08:07,430
I've done Seattle. Seattle's
on fucking awesome. Yeah,

2191
02:08:07,750 --> 02:08:09,850
they got a cool comedy scene there too.
You know,

2192
02:08:09,851 --> 02:08:12,550
they have a couple of comedy
clubs now. They got that, um,

2193
02:08:12,610 --> 02:08:17,260
the parlor live to that place.
It's connected to a pool
hall. I just did, uh, the,

2194
02:08:17,261 --> 02:08:20,870
uh, the Moore theater up there with
Thompson girl last weekend. Oh,

2195
02:08:20,890 --> 02:08:25,330
it's fucking so fun. Yeah.
Seattle's a great place.

2196
02:08:25,331 --> 02:08:27,970
I did that venue, I think with
Jeff. Does it have like church,

2197
02:08:27,971 --> 02:08:31,480
like a things on the walls?
Like those big, yeah. Yeah.

2198
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:35,620
They actually just shut down to do some
renovations, I think to clean it up,

2199
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:40,930
but it's, uh, it's amazing. Man is so
fucking funny. Yeah. He's very funny.

2200
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:45,040
You guys gotta show tonight, right? Where
are you at tonight? What time? 10 o'clock.

2201
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:47,680
10 o'clock. If you listen to
this shit right now, folks,

2202
02:08:47,681 --> 02:08:51,220
you can get in your car and make it
there and use coupon code RSS and you get

2203
02:08:51,221 --> 02:08:54,400
two for one tickets. Who's
there tonight? Uh, we've got me,

2204
02:08:54,401 --> 02:08:58,750
we've got Tony powerful judge cliff,
Jason Tivo.

2205
02:08:58,780 --> 02:09:02,740
Jesus Cringila calling. Oh
my goodness. Uh, Matt Edgar.

2206
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:07,270
He couldn't make it in this too
much comedy. Is Tiana Sarah Tiana?

2207
02:09:07,271 --> 02:09:10,930
I think maybe. Excellent. Do you gotta do
an icehouse chronicles as well? Uh, no.

2208
02:09:11,140 --> 02:09:14,050
Yeah. Too much, right? Yeah.
We, I'm over saturated. I know.

2209
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:17,030
If you don't like me folks, I don't like
me either. I'm going to have about that.

2210
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:19,450
How about that?
I'm tired of hearing me talk as well.

2211
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:22,120
If you're like Joe Rogan's everywhere.
