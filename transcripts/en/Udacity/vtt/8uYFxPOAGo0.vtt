So the purpose of this quiz was to get you thinking

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.939
about where you fit on the scale of design versus develop.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah and we're going to use quizzes like this throughout the course. So

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.760
these quizzes are really to help you

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.750
start thinking differently, like a design minded

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.350
developer. And to really practice the design skills. So we hope that you'll take

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.860
some time and effort, and take these seriously, and really work hard on them.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The more effort you put into

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.470
this, the more easily you will level up and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.950
become an awesome design minded developer that

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.660
creates amazing apps that blows their users minds.
