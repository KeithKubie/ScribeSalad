00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:04.156
- [Voiceover] Find the
components of vector AB.

00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:05.826
So when they're talking
about the components,

00:00:05.826 --> 00:00:07.135
at least in this context,

00:00:07.135 --> 00:00:09.584
they're just talking about
breaking it down into

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:12.335
if we start at point A and
we're finishing at point B,

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:14.880
how much do we have to
move in the X direction?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.780
So this is going to be
essentially our change in X.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.112
And then how much do we have
to move in the Y direction

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:22.214
to go from point A to point B?

00:00:22.214 --> 00:00:25.632
So this one over here is
going to be our change in X.

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:28.811
I just wrote the Greek
letter Delta for change in X.

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:33.255
And then, the second
component is going to be

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:35.332
our change in Y.

00:00:35.332 --> 00:00:36.607
And to think about that,

00:00:36.607 --> 00:00:38.254
let's just think about what our starting

00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:39.692
and final points are,

00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:42.096
our initial and our terminal point are.

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:44.383
So, this point right over here,

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:48.572
point A, its coordinates are (4,4).

00:00:48.572 --> 00:00:51.334
And then point B, its coordinates are,

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:56.307
let's see its X coordinate is (-7,-8).

00:00:56.307 --> 00:01:00.386
So let's first think about
what our change in X is,

00:01:00.386 --> 00:01:02.374
and like always, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:04.536
and try to work through it on your own.

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:07.901
Well let's see, if we're starting at four

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.619
and then we are going from X equals four.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.937
That's where we're starting,

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:16.115
to X equals negative seven.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:19.568
So that right over there
is our change in X.

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:22.935
And there's a couple of
ways you could compute that.

00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:27.011
You could say, "Look, we
finished at negative seven.

00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:28.646
"We started at negative four."

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:31.871
You take your final point
or where you end up,

00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:34.169
so that's negative seven,

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:37.554
and you subtract your
initial point, minus four,

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:40.272
which is going to be equal to negative 11.

00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:44.053
The negative tells us that
we decreased in X by 11.

00:01:44.053 --> 00:01:45.020
And you could see that.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.022
If you could just visually
count the squares,

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:48.461
you could say, "Look,
if I'm going from four

00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:50.137
"to negative seven, I have to go down four

00:01:50.137 --> 00:01:51.973
"just to get back to X equals zero,

00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:54.052
"and then I have to go down another seven.

00:01:54.052 --> 00:01:56.357
"So I have to go to the left 11 spaces."

00:01:56.357 --> 00:01:58.005
So that's negative 11.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:01.012
So that's my X component, negative 11.

00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:03.520
And what is my change in Y?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.820
Well I'm going from Y equals four.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.870
In fact, I'll start at
this point right over here.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.107
I'm starting at Y equals four.

00:02:10.107 --> 00:02:12.953
And I'm ending up at Y is equal to,

00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:14.911
let me do that in that other color.

00:02:15.617 --> 00:02:18.543
So, I'm starting at Y is equal to four,

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:22.313
and I'm ending up at Y is
equal to negative eight.

00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:24.062
So our change in Y,

00:02:24.062 --> 00:02:28.226
our change in Y, what's
going to be my final Y value,

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:29.586
which is negative eight,

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:32.645
minus my initial Y value, which is four,

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:36.782
minus four, which is equal to negative 12.

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:40.220
So negative 12.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.401
And you could see that here.

00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:42.314
If I'm starting up here,

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:45.150
I have to go four down just
to get back to the X axis.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.762
Then I have to go down another eight,

00:02:46.762 --> 00:02:49.127
so I have to go down a total of 12.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:50.719
And you can see something interesting

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.992
that I've just set up here.

00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:56.484
You could also view this bigger vector.

00:02:56.484 --> 00:02:59.674
Vector AB is being constructed of this X,

00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:02.277
this vector that goes
purely in the X direction,

00:03:02.277 --> 00:03:04.860
and this vector that goes
purely in the Y direction.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.594
If you were to add this red
vector to this blue-green,

00:03:08.594 --> 00:03:10.001
dark blue-green vector,

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.468
you would get vector AB,

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:15.676
but we'll talk more about
that in future videos.
