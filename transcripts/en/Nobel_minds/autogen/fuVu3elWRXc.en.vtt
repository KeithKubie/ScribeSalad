when we study a picture of molecules
that are in solution and this is an

solution here then all the molecules are
randomly distributed in the solution so

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:06.380
randomly distributed in the solution so
 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.040
randomly distributed in the solution so
they are difficult to find so the

damage the molecules to actually see
 

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.820
damage the molecules to actually see
them and see where they are then we have

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:18.830
them and see where they are then we have
 

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.980
them and see where they are then we have
to see how order oriented relative to

to see how order oriented relative to
 

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.740
to see how order oriented relative to
each other because we must know in order

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:37.400
and it's illustrated in this schematic
 

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.240
and it's illustrated in this schematic
illustration so here are the molecules

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.250
illustration so here are the molecules
 

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.280
illustration so here are the molecules
in solution they have different

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:42.290
in solution they have different
 

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.220
in solution they have different
orientation when these molecules are

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:45.230
orientation when these molecules are
 

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.510
orientation when these molecules are
illuminated by the electron beam we see

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:48.520
illuminated by the electron beam we see
 

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.530
illuminated by the electron beam we see
projections of these molecules like

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:50.540
projections of these molecules like
 

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.390
projections of these molecules like
shadows of these molecules and these

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:55.400
shadows of these molecules and these
 

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.270
shadows of these molecules and these
shadows differ in shape depending on the

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:58.280
shadows differ in shape depending on the
 

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.130
shadows differ in shape depending on the
orientation of the object that was

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.140
orientation of the object that was
 

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.510
orientation of the object that was
illuminated this can be now sorted those

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:04.520
illuminated this can be now sorted those
 

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.960
illuminated this can be now sorted those
that have the same shape or originate

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:07.970
that have the same shape or originate
 

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.370
that have the same shape or originate
from molecules with the same orientation

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:09.380
from molecules with the same orientation
 

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.620
from molecules with the same orientation
or sorted in groups and then an average

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:14.630
or sorted in groups and then an average
 

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.350
or sorted in groups and then an average
of all these pictures can be taken in

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360
of all these pictures can be taken in
 

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.170
of all these pictures can be taken in
each of these groups and in this way one

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:20.180
each of these groups and in this way one
 

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.420
each of these groups and in this way one
can obtain sharper pictures one can

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:22.430
can obtain sharper pictures one can
 

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.640
can obtain sharper pictures one can
increase the signal relative to the

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:24.650
increase the signal relative to the
 

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.620
increase the signal relative to the
background noise and this is the way now

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:26.630
background noise and this is the way now
 

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.220
background noise and this is the way now
to obtain better resolution pictures

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:29.230
to obtain better resolution pictures
 

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.140
to obtain better resolution pictures
then these pictures can be combined to

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:32.150
then these pictures can be combined to
 

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.200
then these pictures can be combined to
build a three-dimensional structure and

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.210
build a three-dimensional structure and
 

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.510
build a three-dimensional structure and
this is an example of such a structure

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:37.520
this is an example of such a structure
 

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.420
this is an example of such a structure
but in order now to to obtain

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:40.430
but in order now to to obtain
 

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.910
but in order now to to obtain
information about the details about the

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920
information about the details about the
 

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.220
information about the details about the
atoms what the water molecule looks like

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:45.230
atoms what the water molecule looks like
 

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.120
atoms what the water molecule looks like
inside better sample preparation methods

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:49.130
inside better sample preparation methods
 

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.520
inside better sample preparation methods
were needed and many people believed

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:51.530
were needed and many people believed
 

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.670
were needed and many people believed
that a way to prepare samples was to

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680
that a way to prepare samples was to
 

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.250
that a way to prepare samples was to
free would be to freeze them the problem

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:57.260
free would be to freeze them the problem
 

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.800
free would be to freeze them the problem
is that if you place a biological object

00:10:59.800 --> 00:10:59.810
is that if you place a biological object
 

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.330
is that if you place a biological object
in ice in

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:01.340
in ice in
 

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.060
in ice in
in in water and freeze then ice crystals

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.070
in in water and freeze then ice crystals
 

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.580
in in water and freeze then ice crystals
are formed around the object and the ice

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:06.590
are formed around the object and the ice
 

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.490
are formed around the object and the ice
crystals diffract the electron beam so

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:09.500
crystals diffract the electron beam so
 

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.260
crystals diffract the electron beam so
when it's illuminated all the

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:11.270
when it's illuminated all the
 

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.240
when it's illuminated all the
information is lost because the ice

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.250
information is lost because the ice
 

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.260
information is lost because the ice
crystal diffract

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:14.270
crystal diffract
 

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.920
crystal diffract
the electron beam but people also

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:17.930
the electron beam but people also
 

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.450
the electron beam but people also
believe that it would be possible

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:19.460
believe that it would be possible
 

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.040
believe that it would be possible
perhaps to freeze the sample fast enough

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.050
perhaps to freeze the sample fast enough
 

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.380
perhaps to freeze the sample fast enough
so that water would not have time to

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:26.390
so that water would not have time to
 

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.200
so that water would not have time to
arrange itself into crystals to form ice

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:29.210
arrange itself into crystals to form ice
 

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.890
arrange itself into crystals to form ice
but would be a structure that is is like

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:32.900
but would be a structure that is is like
 

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.750
but would be a structure that is is like
a liquid all the water molecules are

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760
a liquid all the water molecules are
 

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.510
a liquid all the water molecules are
randomly distributed and not not forming

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:37.520
randomly distributed and not not forming
 

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.060
randomly distributed and not not forming
the ice crystals and if this is the case

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.070
the ice crystals and if this is the case
 

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.950
the ice crystals and if this is the case
then it would be possible to obtain a

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:41.960
then it would be possible to obtain a
 

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.170
then it would be possible to obtain a
short picture because all the electron

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:44.180
short picture because all the electron
 

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.750
short picture because all the electron
beams would be evenly absorbed by the

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760
beams would be evenly absorbed by the
 

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.590
beams would be evenly absorbed by the
body

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600
body
 

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.340
body
there's vitrified water at it's cold and

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:51.350
there's vitrified water at it's cold and
 

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.730
there's vitrified water at it's cold and
in this way Jacques to Bashar could

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:53.740
in this way Jacques to Bashar could
 

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.050
in this way Jacques to Bashar could
develop the technique that allowed to

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:56.060
develop the technique that allowed to
 

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.710
develop the technique that allowed to
see biomolecules it could contrast the

00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720
see biomolecules it could contrast the
 

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.230

method is described in this picture so

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240
method is described in this picture so
 

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.670
method is described in this picture so
the the sample is applied to agreed and

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680
the the sample is applied to agreed and
 

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.300
the the sample is applied to agreed and
the the sample then in water is sponsor

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:10.310
the the sample then in water is sponsor
 

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.480
the the sample then in water is sponsor
the distance across this the holes in

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:13.490
the distance across this the holes in
 

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.890
the distance across this the holes in
this grid and then the sample is frozen

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:17.900
this grid and then the sample is frozen
 

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.980
this grid and then the sample is frozen
in a time that is cooled by liquid

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:20.990
in a time that is cooled by liquid
 

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.230
in a time that is cooled by liquid
nitrogen so the temperature is about my

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240
nitrogen so the temperature is about my
 

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.990
nitrogen so the temperature is about my

across these holes this is a setup that

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240
across these holes this is a setup that
 

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.260
across these holes this is a setup that
was built by Jacque - Borgia and we see

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:38.270
was built by Jacque - Borgia and we see
 

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.720
was built by Jacque - Borgia and we see
here it's like a catapult that is used

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:40.730
here it's like a catapult that is used
 

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.329
here it's like a catapult that is used
to to inject the sample that is here

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:43.339
to to inject the sample that is here
 

00:12:43.339 --> 00:12:44.500
to to inject the sample that is here
into the cold

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:44.510
into the cold
 

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.300
into the cold

technique and it was then rapidly used

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:07.370
technique and it was then rapidly used
 

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.829
technique and it was then rapidly used
by many other in and many other

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839
by many other in and many other
 

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:11.650
by many other in and many other
laboratories the technique has

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:11.660
laboratories the technique has
 

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.400
laboratories the technique has
transformed the

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:13.410
transformed the
 

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.859
transformed the
electron microscopy from technique that

00:13:15.859 --> 00:13:15.869
electron microscopy from technique that
 

00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:18.049
electron microscopy from technique that
could be used to just see the shapes the

00:13:18.049 --> 00:13:18.059
could be used to just see the shapes the
 

00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:20.900
could be used to just see the shapes the
outer shapes of molecules into one that

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:20.910
outer shapes of molecules into one that
 

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.900
outer shapes of molecules into one that
is now used to see the details the atoms

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:23.910
is now used to see the details the atoms
 

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.439
is now used to see the details the atoms
inside the molecules and the latest

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:27.449
inside the molecules and the latest
 

00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:30.019
inside the molecules and the latest
technical developments occurred very

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:30.029
technical developments occurred very
 

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:32.089
technical developments occurred very
recently so it's very recent

00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:32.099
recently so it's very recent
 

00:13:32.099 --> 00:13:33.739
recently so it's very recent
developments that we can actually see

00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:33.749
developments that we can actually see
 

00:13:33.749 --> 00:13:37.279
developments that we can actually see
the details of of these molecules the

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:37.289
the details of of these molecules the
 

00:13:37.289 --> 00:13:39.739
the details of of these molecules the
technique is also relatively rapid so

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:39.749
technique is also relatively rapid so
 

00:13:39.749 --> 00:13:42.619
technique is also relatively rapid so
once one has samplers that can be

00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:42.629
once one has samplers that can be
 

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:45.499
once one has samplers that can be
studied the structure can be determined

00:13:45.499 --> 00:13:45.509
studied the structure can be determined
 

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:46.939
studied the structure can be determined
relatively rapidly and this was

00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:46.949
relatively rapidly and this was
 

00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:50.719
relatively rapidly and this was
exemplified it last year when the

00:13:50.719 --> 00:13:50.729
exemplified it last year when the
 

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.669
exemplified it last year when the
structure of the Zika virus was

00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:52.679
structure of the Zika virus was
 

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:54.859
structure of the Zika virus was
determined in just a few months and it's

00:13:54.859 --> 00:13:54.869
determined in just a few months and it's
 

00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:57.139
determined in just a few months and it's
in here and this structure shows the

00:13:57.139 --> 00:13:57.149
in here and this structure shows the
 

00:13:57.149 --> 00:13:59.479
in here and this structure shows the
atomic details of the surface which of

00:13:59.479 --> 00:13:59.489
atomic details of the surface which of
 

00:13:59.489 --> 00:14:01.489
atomic details of the surface which of
course is important when developing

00:14:01.489 --> 00:14:01.499
course is important when developing
 

00:14:01.499 --> 00:14:06.019
course is important when developing
drugs against the virus but the

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:06.029
drugs against the virus but the
 

00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:07.639
drugs against the virus but the
technique is not only about seeing

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:07.649
technique is not only about seeing
 

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:10.009
technique is not only about seeing
molecules and I think this is fantastic

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019
molecules and I think this is fantastic
 

00:14:10.019 --> 00:14:13.639
molecules and I think this is fantastic
for the developments that we has already

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:13.649
for the developments that we has already
 

00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:16.159
for the developments that we has already
started but we'll be seeing me also in

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:16.169
started but we'll be seeing me also in
 

00:14:16.169 --> 00:14:18.590
started but we'll be seeing me also in
the future and that is because the

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600
the future and that is because the
 

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.309
the future and that is because the
molecules are frozen in solution each if

00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:22.319
molecules are frozen in solution each if
 

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:24.469
molecules are frozen in solution each if
a molecule does some work like the one

00:14:24.469 --> 00:14:24.479
a molecule does some work like the one
 

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:26.989
a molecule does some work like the one
shown here then all these molecules are

00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:26.999
shown here then all these molecules are
 

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:29.869
shown here then all these molecules are
frozen in exactly in the moment in the

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:29.879
frozen in exactly in the moment in the
 

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:31.549
frozen in exactly in the moment in the
different states in different structures

00:14:31.549 --> 00:14:31.559
different states in different structures
 

00:14:31.559 --> 00:14:34.909
different states in different structures
and it's like frames of a movie in each

00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:34.919
and it's like frames of a movie in each
 

00:14:34.919 --> 00:14:36.829
and it's like frames of a movie in each
each of these pictures represents a

00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839
each of these pictures represents a
 

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:39.109
each of these pictures represents a
frame and they can be put together into

00:14:39.109 --> 00:14:39.119
frame and they can be put together into
 

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:41.929
frame and they can be put together into
a movie like the one shown here and we

00:14:41.929 --> 00:14:41.939
a movie like the one shown here and we
 

00:14:41.939 --> 00:14:44.299
a movie like the one shown here and we
can see what the molecules do so I think

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:44.309
can see what the molecules do so I think
 

00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:46.789
can see what the molecules do so I think
in the future this is not only about

00:14:46.789 --> 00:14:46.799
in the future this is not only about
 

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:48.769
in the future this is not only about
getting structures of molecules which

00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779
getting structures of molecules which
 

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:50.509
getting structures of molecules which
are in itself it's of course fantastic

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519
are in itself it's of course fantastic
 

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:53.869
are in itself it's of course fantastic
but it's also for the future we'll be

00:14:53.869 --> 00:14:53.879
but it's also for the future we'll be
 

00:14:53.879 --> 00:14:56.210
but it's also for the future we'll be
able to see processes what is happening

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220
able to see processes what is happening
 

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.819
able to see processes what is happening
what is going on inside the cells how do

00:14:58.819 --> 00:14:58.829
what is going on inside the cells how do
 

00:14:58.829 --> 00:15:00.979
what is going on inside the cells how do
they molecules interact how do they move

00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:00.989
they molecules interact how do they move
 

00:15:00.989 --> 00:15:03.829
they molecules interact how do they move
what do they do and I end this

00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839
what do they do and I end this
 

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:06.289
what do they do and I end this

resulted in a hundred thousand that are
 

00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:12.070
resulted in a hundred thousand that are
all available and they now form the

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080
all available and they now form the
 

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.700
all available and they now form the

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:32.420
your electron microscope I think it's
 

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.500
your electron microscope I think it's
the way it's a revolution because now

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:35.510
the way it's a revolution because now
 

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:39.550
the way it's a revolution because now
it's possible to extract molecules from

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:39.560
it's possible to extract molecules from
 

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.710
it's possible to extract molecules from
the cell that are in in the same

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720
the cell that are in in the same
 

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:44.110
the cell that are in in the same
environment as they usually in a saline

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:44.120
environment as they usually in a saline
 

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.610
environment as they usually in a saline
in the water and also see the structures

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:48.620
in the water and also see the structures
 

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.100
in the water and also see the structures
of these molecules but also see how they

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:51.110
of these molecules but also see how they
 

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.350
of these molecules but also see how they
interact with each other how how they

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360
interact with each other how how they
 

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.250
interact with each other how how they
operate one can get since the only

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:57.260
operate one can get since the only
 

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.380
operate one can get since the only
particles molecules that have studied

00:33:59.380 --> 00:33:59.390
particles molecules that have studied
 

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.260
particles molecules that have studied
are in solution you're frozen in a

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:02.270
are in solution you're frozen in a
 

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.480
are in solution you're frozen in a
different state and one can then combine

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:04.490
different state and one can then combine
 

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.360
different state and one can then combine
the different pictures to to understand

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:07.370
the different pictures to to understand
 

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:10.000
the different pictures to to understand
function as well dynamics and that's the

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.010
function as well dynamics and that's the
 

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.630
function as well dynamics and that's the
sake to understanding life

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:12.640
sake to understanding life
 

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.220
sake to understanding life
everybody knows for the microscope is

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:15.230
everybody knows for the microscope is
 

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:19.800
everybody knows for the microscope is
but how does this one look like it's a

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:19.810
but how does this one look like it's a
 

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:23.410
but how does this one look like it's a
big box that is I think in here 3 4 x be

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:23.420
big box that is I think in here 3 4 x be
 

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.590
big box that is I think in here 3 4 x be
taller than we are and and then there is

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:26.600
taller than we are and and then there is
 

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.950
taller than we are and and then there is
a chamber where one place is a sample

00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960
a chamber where one place is a sample
 

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.580
a chamber where one place is a sample
and then it's illuminated inside there's

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:33.590
and then it's illuminated inside there's
 

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.880
and then it's illuminated inside there's
vacuum inside the school and and then

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:36.890
vacuum inside the school and and then
 

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:38.830
vacuum inside the school and and then
there's a camera which is one of the key

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:38.840
there's a camera which is one of the key
 

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.730
there's a camera which is one of the key
components oh they say they keep

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:42.740
components oh they say they keep
 

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.520
components oh they say they keep
components developed most recently that

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:45.530
components developed most recently that
 

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:46.520
components developed most recently that
is the

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:46.530
is the
 

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.409
is the
use them to detect the pictures and

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419
use them to detect the pictures and
 

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:53.080
use them to detect the pictures and
monitor it so it's taking like a room

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:53.090
monitor it so it's taking like a room
 

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.550
monitor it so it's taking like a room
it's a whole room yeah and it must be

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560
it's a whole room yeah and it must be
 

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.250
it's a whole room yeah and it must be
very stable the floor must be stable

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260
very stable the floor must be stable
 

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.470
very stable the floor must be stable
because it's sensitive to vibrations and

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480
because it's sensitive to vibrations and
 

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.360
because it's sensitive to vibrations and
so so it's it's a big expensive machine

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:04.370
so so it's it's a big expensive machine
 

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.510
so so it's it's a big expensive machine
there's one in Stockholm which is shared

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520
there's one in Stockholm which is shared
 

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.640
there's one in Stockholm which is shared
between Stockholm University and other

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:10.650
between Stockholm University and other
 

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.460
between Stockholm University and other
universities and it's I love love and

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:13.470
universities and it's I love love and
 

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:18.770
universities and it's I love love and
then there is one Union me awesome hey

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780
then there is one Union me awesome hey
 

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.140
then there is one Union me awesome hey
yes we do use it we just started

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:21.150
yes we do use it we just started
 

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.510
yes we do use it we just started
recently because it's instrument is neo

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520
recently because it's instrument is neo
 

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.480
recently because it's instrument is neo
because there we do use it in my

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:26.490
because there we do use it in my
 

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.810
because there we do use it in my
research also I think a lot of people

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820
research also I think a lot of people
 

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.370
research also I think a lot of people
are really interested in using the

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:31.380
are really interested in using the
 

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.530
are really interested in using the
instrument because it can provide so

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.540
instrument because it can provide so
 

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.880
instrument because it can provide so
much information that is it's it's very

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:37.890
much information that is it's it's very
 

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.760
much information that is it's it's very
important for understanding function so

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:40.770
important for understanding function so
 

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.170
important for understanding function so
what would be your dream discovery

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:44.180
what would be your dream discovery
 

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.260
what would be your dream discovery
I think for for the future I mean first

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:48.270
I think for for the future I mean first
 

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.600
I think for for the future I mean first
of all it is to see the molecules we

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:50.610
of all it is to see the molecules we
 

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.960
of all it is to see the molecules we
work on I mean that's in itself it's

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:53.970
work on I mean that's in itself it's
 

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.960
work on I mean that's in itself it's
it's something very warm rewarding to be

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:56.970
it's something very warm rewarding to be
 

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:59.780
it's something very warm rewarding to be
able to see the objects you work on but

00:35:59.780 --> 00:35:59.790
able to see the objects you work on but
 

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.240
able to see the objects you work on but
I think for the for the future and which

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.250
I think for the for the future and which
 

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.910
I think for the for the future and which
is now more and more become possible is

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920
is now more and more become possible is
 

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.630
is now more and more become possible is
to observe as I mentioned before these

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640
to observe as I mentioned before these
 

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.730
to observe as I mentioned before these
different states that one can freeze the

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740
different states that one can freeze the
 

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.580
different states that one can freeze the
sample why a freeze the the molecules

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:13.590
sample why a freeze the the molecules
 

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.310
sample why a freeze the the molecules
why they do something to actually

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:15.320
why they do something to actually
 

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:19.030
why they do something to actually
combine the information into a movie or

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040
combine the information into a movie or
 

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.160
combine the information into a movie or
they understand the dynamics how how

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:22.170
they understand the dynamics how how
 

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.540
they understand the dynamics how how
they interact what they do

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:23.550
they interact what they do
 

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.190
they interact what they do
how

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200
how
 

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.920
how
what happens in inside the cell I mean

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:27.930
what happens in inside the cell I mean
 

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:29.780
what happens in inside the cell I mean
this is with purified proteins of course

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:29.790
this is with purified proteins of course
 

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.880
this is with purified proteins of course
but one can learn and I've tried to

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:31.890
but one can learn and I've tried to
 

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.890
but one can learn and I've tried to
understand what happens inside the cell

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:33.900
understand what happens inside the cell
 

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:39.710
understand what happens inside the cell
is really more secrets that are not

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720
is really more secrets that are not
 

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.750
is really more secrets that are not
revealed in the living cell not yet

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760
revealed in the living cell not yet
 

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.120
revealed in the living cell not yet
because the technique or the at the

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.130
because the technique or the at the
 

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:49.700
because the technique or the at the
style at the status is relatively new so

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:49.710
style at the status is relatively new so
 

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:53.150
style at the status is relatively new so
the possibilities to use this technique

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160
the possibilities to use this technique
 

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.839
the possibilities to use this technique
to in this way way that is used today it

00:36:56.839 --> 00:36:56.849
to in this way way that is used today it
 

00:36:56.849 --> 00:36:59.900
to in this way way that is used today it
has only been possible since just a

00:36:59.900 --> 00:36:59.910
has only been possible since just a
 

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.960
has only been possible since just a
couple of years so I think now it's an

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:02.970
couple of years so I think now it's an
 

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.210
couple of years so I think now it's an
explosion and a research and what is

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220
explosion and a research and what is
 

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.010
explosion and a research and what is
limiting now it's it's access to the

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:07.020
limiting now it's it's access to the
 

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.650
limiting now it's it's access to the
microscope actually so it's a waiting

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660
microscope actually so it's a waiting
 

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.309
microscope actually so it's a waiting
time it's very long I think we no new

00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319
time it's very long I think we no new
 

00:37:13.319 --> 00:37:16.250
time it's very long I think we no new
microscopes and more microscopes

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260
microscopes and more microscopes
 

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.079
microscopes and more microscopes
I think I'm there's a lot to be seen

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:20.089
I think I'm there's a lot to be seen
 

00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:22.819
I think I'm there's a lot to be seen
there's also a very long way to develop

00:37:22.819 --> 00:37:22.829
there's also a very long way to develop
 

00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:30.670
there's also a very long way to develop
this one it's like since 70s or 80s I

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680
 

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:33.440
think it's I mean from the beginning the

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:33.450
think it's I mean from the beginning the
 

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:36.200
think it's I mean from the beginning the
the problem was that studies of

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:36.210
the problem was that studies of
 

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.599
the problem was that studies of
biological objects in an electron

00:37:38.599 --> 00:37:38.609
biological objects in an electron
 

00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:39.890
biological objects in an electron
microscope it's not trivial

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900
microscope it's not trivial
 

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.660
microscope it's not trivial
because there is vacuum inside which the

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:43.670
because there is vacuum inside which the
 

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.770
because there is vacuum inside which the
biological samples contain primarily

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:45.780
biological samples contain primarily
 

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.500
biological samples contain primarily
water so they dry inside and shape

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:48.510
water so they dry inside and shape
 

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.299
water so they dry inside and shape
changes and the pictures are useless

00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:50.309
changes and the pictures are useless
 

00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:52.849
changes and the pictures are useless
then the electron beam burns the

00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859
then the electron beam burns the
 

00:37:52.859 --> 00:37:55.280
then the electron beam burns the
molecules which also changes the

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:55.290
molecules which also changes the
 

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:57.250
molecules which also changes the
structure even more dramatically and

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:57.260
structure even more dramatically and
 

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:01.099
structure even more dramatically and
this has been a challenge to to to be

00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:01.109
this has been a challenge to to to be
 

00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:03.680
this has been a challenge to to to be

water ice crystals are formed and ice

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:30.790
water ice crystals are formed and ice
 

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.980
water ice crystals are formed and ice
crystals diffract electrons so that the

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:33.990
crystals diffract electrons so that the
 

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:35.850
crystals diffract electrons so that the
information is lost because the

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:35.860
information is lost because the
 

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.780
information is lost because the
electrons go diffracted always so the

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:39.790
electrons go diffracted always so the
 

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:42.690
electrons go diffracted always so the
idea was to to freeze the water so fast

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:42.700
idea was to to freeze the water so fast
 

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.970
idea was to to freeze the water so fast
that the crystals would not have time to

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:44.980
that the crystals would not have time to
 

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.660
that the crystals would not have time to
form so and this is called vitrified

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:48.670
form so and this is called vitrified
 

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.580

the same way here yes
 

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.980
the same way here yes
and so it means the same way here freeze

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:13.990
and so it means the same way here freeze

it's it's like a uniform glass that is
 

00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:26.490
it's it's like a uniform glass that is
transparent or actually it does interact

with electrons but in a uniform way and
 

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.740
with electrons but in a uniform way and
this allowed the technique to be

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:31.750
this allowed the technique to be
 

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.300
this allowed the technique to be
developed such that contrast to be

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:33.310
developed such that contrast to be
 

00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.280
developed such that contrast to be
increased and anyone could see the

the latest breakthrough they are not
 

00:40:52.099 --> 00:40:55.180
the latest breakthrough they are not
perfect there is still a lot to do to

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:55.190
perfect there is still a lot to do to
 

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.950
perfect there is still a lot to do to
improve them

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960
improve them
 

00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.609
improve them
also the the sample preparation methods

00:41:00.609 --> 00:41:00.619
also the the sample preparation methods
 

00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:04.390
also the the sample preparation methods
could be improved the way there's cryo

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400
could be improved the way there's cryo
 

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.609
could be improved the way there's cryo
stage and whatever kept that the

00:41:06.609 --> 00:41:06.619
stage and whatever kept that the
 

00:41:06.619 --> 00:41:10.120
stage and whatever kept that the
temperature is kept constant because a

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:10.130
temperature is kept constant because a
 

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:13.290
temperature is kept constant because a
variation in the temperature can cause

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:13.300
variation in the temperature can cause
 

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.750
variation in the temperature can cause
movement so so there are a lot of

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760
movement so so there are a lot of
 

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.000
movement so so there are a lot of
techniques and also I mean it's in

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:19.010
techniques and also I mean it's in
 

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.130

to further studies but since one has to

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:25.700
to further studies but since one has to
 

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:29.080
to further studies but since one has to
apply a droplet to this grid one has to

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.090
apply a droplet to this grid one has to
 

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.900
apply a droplet to this grid one has to
remove almost all the sample and very

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:31.910
remove almost all the sample and very
 

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.490
remove almost all the sample and very
very small fraction it's like a droplet

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:33.500
very small fraction it's like a droplet
 

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.099
very small fraction it's like a droplet
in a bathtub that is actually left so if

00:41:36.099 --> 00:41:36.109

one could develop techniques that would

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:38.420
one could develop techniques that would
 

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.870
one could develop techniques that would
allow applying very small amounts of

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880
allow applying very small amounts of
 

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.520
allow applying very small amounts of
samples and there is of course my many

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:42.530
samples and there is of course my many
 

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.470
samples and there is of course my many
more molecules that could be studied

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480
more molecules that could be studied
 

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.829
more molecules that could be studied
because it's not possible to to purify

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839
because it's not possible to to purify
 

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.410
because it's not possible to to purify
all molecules in an amount at an amount

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:50.420
all molecules in an amount at an amount
 

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:53.079
all molecules in an amount at an amount
that is allow studies so there are not a

00:41:53.079 --> 00:41:53.089
that is allow studies so there are not a
 

00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:55.420
that is allow studies so there are not a
lot of pieces that can be improved and I

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:55.430
lot of pieces that can be improved and I
 

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.380
lot of pieces that can be improved and I
think for the future it will

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:57.390
think for the future it will
 

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.330
think for the future it will
and I think that technique has locked

00:41:59.330 --> 00:41:59.340
and I think that technique has locked
 

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.310
and I think that technique has locked

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.440
some problems with with a telephone line
but those that I heard were very happy
