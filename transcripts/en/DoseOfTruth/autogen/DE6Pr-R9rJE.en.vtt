dart pyar 2 says how can you dispute the

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580
dart pyar 2 says how can you dispute the
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.640
dart pyar 2 says how can you dispute the
theory that Jesus is just a rewrite of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650
theory that Jesus is just a rewrite of
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.940
theory that Jesus is just a rewrite of
the sun-god myth well I wouldn't

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
the sun-god myth well I wouldn't
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.120
the sun-god myth well I wouldn't
necessarily dispute that theory although

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
necessarily dispute that theory although
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.999
necessarily dispute that theory although
I would dispute the just I mean the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
I would dispute the just I mean the
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.560
I would dispute the just I mean the
strange things about the biblical

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570
strange things about the biblical
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.570
strange things about the biblical
stories and let's say about the New

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
stories and let's say about the New
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.460
stories and let's say about the New
Testament stories is that they echo

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
Testament stories is that they echo
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.740
Testament stories is that they echo
across multiple levels of analysis and

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
across multiple levels of analysis and
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.380
across multiple levels of analysis and
so there is an astrological element to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
so there is an astrological element to
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.179
so there is an astrological element to
the Christ story that Jung wrote about a

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
the Christ story that Jung wrote about a
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.099
the Christ story that Jung wrote about a
fair bit in a book called ion which is a

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109
fair bit in a book called ion which is a
 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.870
fair bit in a book called ion which is a
very terrifying book and there are

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
very terrifying book and there are
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240
very terrifying book and there are
echoes of the myths of the sun-god and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
echoes of the myths of the sun-god and
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240
echoes of the myths of the sun-god and
but the funny thing is and this is one

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
but the funny thing is and this is one
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770
but the funny thing is and this is one
of the things I can't really understand

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
of the things I can't really understand
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.889
of the things I can't really understand
about the biblical stories is that they

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899
about the biblical stories is that they
 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.990
about the biblical stories is that they
manifest themselves at multiple levels

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
manifest themselves at multiple levels
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090
manifest themselves at multiple levels
of interpretation simultaneously and you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
of interpretation simultaneously and you
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.619
of interpretation simultaneously and you
could say that that's merely a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
could say that that's merely a
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.660
could say that that's merely a
consequence of continual historical

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
consequence of continual historical
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.700
consequence of continual historical
reworking and I suppose that could be

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
reworking and I suppose that could be
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.970
reworking and I suppose that could be
the case but the fact that they manifest

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
the case but the fact that they manifest
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.400
the case but the fact that they manifest
themselves as a personal story and as a

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
themselves as a personal story and as a
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.680
themselves as a personal story and as a
cosmic story and as a historical story

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
cosmic story and as a historical story
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.319
cosmic story and as a historical story
and as a mythological story and that it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
and as a mythological story and that it
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.539
and as a mythological story and that it
all works at the same time strikes me as

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549
all works at the same time strikes me as
 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.310
all works at the same time strikes me as
as pointing to something that's really

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
as pointing to something that's really
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.830
as pointing to something that's really
somewhat beyond our current level of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
somewhat beyond our current level of
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.300
somewhat beyond our current level of
understanding

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
understanding
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.330
understanding
I can't elaborate on that a lot because

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340
I can't elaborate on that a lot because
 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.890
I can't elaborate on that a lot because
it would take us into places that I

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900
it would take us into places that I
 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410
it would take us into places that I
really would rather not go but I do

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
really would rather not go but I do
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.100
really would rather not go but I do
believe that like there's something

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110
believe that like there's something
 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.749
believe that like there's something
synchronous using Jung's terminology

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
synchronous using Jung's terminology
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.270
synchronous using Jung's terminology
about the about death and resurrection

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
about the about death and resurrection
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.920
about the about death and resurrection
story and the synchronous element is is

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930
story and the synchronous element is is
 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.210
story and the synchronous element is is
associated with the fact that the story

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
associated with the fact that the story
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460
associated with the fact that the story
echoes across so many levels of analysis

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
echoes across so many levels of analysis
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.179
echoes across so many levels of analysis
and my sense is that when something

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
and my sense is that when something
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280
and my sense is that when something
echoes across many levels of analysis

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290
echoes across many levels of analysis
 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170
echoes across many levels of analysis
that means that it's approaching

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
that means that it's approaching
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.289
that means that it's approaching
something like a very deep truth so I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
something like a very deep truth so I
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.910
something like a very deep truth so I
know that isn't normally how we go about

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
know that isn't normally how we go about
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100
know that isn't normally how we go about
determining what constitutes truth but

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
determining what constitutes truth but
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200
determining what constitutes truth but
we don't know everything about how to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
we don't know everything about how to
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.569
we don't know everything about how to
determine what constitutes truth yet and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
determine what constitutes truth yet and
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.539
determine what constitutes truth yet and
there are many things that we have yet

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549
there are many things that we have yet
 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.249
there are many things that we have yet
to figure out and that's certainly one

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
to figure out and that's certainly one
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.100
to figure out and that's certainly one
of them as far as I'm concerned so there

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
of them as far as I'm concerned so there
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.499
of them as far as I'm concerned so there
is a sun-god myth element certainly and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509
is a sun-god myth element certainly and
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.870
is a sun-god myth element certainly and
parallels between Christ and Horus for

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
parallels between Christ and Horus for
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.650
parallels between Christ and Horus for
example but that doesn't mean you can

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
example but that doesn't mean you can
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.510
example but that doesn't mean you can
just say it's just a real

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
just say it's just a real
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.060
just say it's just a real
I don't think that the I don't think

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070
I don't think that the I don't think
 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.920
I don't think that the I don't think
that that's historically or a

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
that that's historically or a
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.610
that that's historically or a
psychologically accurate
