00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.490
- [Jamal] First of all, let me thank you
all for coming. My name is Jamal Khokhar,

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.680
and as of three weeks ago, I'm the new
President of the Institute of the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.300
Americas, having just finished five years
as Canada's Ambassador to Brazil. And I

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.820
have to say this is certainly not a bad
tradeoff, Lieutenant Governor coming up

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.340
from Brazil. The only thing my Brazilian
colleagues would tell me is that, "Yeah,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.490
but do they play soccer there?" So we'll
have to work on that. Today's an important

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.890
day for all of us in the sense that we're
really using this opportunity to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.100
underscore the importance of the North
American economic space and economic

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.230
integration. And whether you approach it
from the perspective of being a Mexican, a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.220
Canadian or an American, or a Californian,
North American economic integration is an

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.240
absolutely key issue for all of us in
terms of prosperities and jobs. And today

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.220
we have no one better than the Lieutenant
Governor Gavin Newsom to speak to that

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.600
issue. None of this could take place
without our sponsors, and we're delighted

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.280
to have Debra Reed from Sempra here with
us. Debra, thank you very much for your

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:20.610
contributions. And Luis Escarano, Duty
Free Americas and UETA, our UCTV sponsor.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.660
And without further ado, I'm going to ask
Chancellor Pradeep Khosla to introduce the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.510
lieutenant governor.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.420
- [Pradeep] Thank you, Jamal, and welcome,
everybody. UC San Diego is pleased to play

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.030
a key role in this 20th anniversary
celebration of SENTRI and I'm told a San

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.140
Diego innovation. When I think about San
Diego, I think about UC San Diego in

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.720
addition to other things, but I did not
realize until I got here three and a half

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.990
years ago that this was a San Diego
innovation, and I must say I think it's an

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.660
extremely impactful innovation. So it's an
honor to join our colleagues and partners

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.580
as we continue our collaboration to
enhance, as the ambassador said, border

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.650
innovation. I think one cannot understate
or overstate one as good and the other

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:16.590
cannot overstate the importance of
cross-border innovation. Okay. Are you

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.898
looking for votes here?

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.606
It's all right. I can help.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.210
Sorry, sorry. I had to say that.
Typically... I'll get to that in a second.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.100
He sits in the center seat at the Board of
Regents and he gets to pick on everybody,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.230
so this is my chance to... Anyway, SENTRI
was born out of a series of discussions in

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.030
the early to mid '90s. This was a
discussion amongst university people,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.250
business and civic leaders, scholars and
people who were in general concerned about

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.950
San Diego's future growth and prosperity
and quite like the roundtable discussion

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.510
we have today. So before we can get to
that, though, we are fortunate to have my

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.330
boss' boss. No, seriously. My boss being
the Office of the President and her boss

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.060
being a regent, and in this case,
Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. He's our

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.350
keynote speaker and he is the ideal person
to talk about how California's future and

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.620
economy depend on partnership with Mexico,
as his key priorities are economic

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.240
development, job creation, improving
access to higher education, and bolstering

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.350
California's environmental leadership. He
has an amazing background, a background in

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.220
both private industry, having started 15
small businesses and created more than

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.530
1,000 jobs, and background in local
government. And we all know what he's

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.230
famous for. He was one of the visionaries
who saw something that many of us even

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.350
today cannot see, which is unfortunate,
but thank you for your leadership in that

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.090
area. And having served as supervisor and
later Mayor of the City and County of San

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.110
Francisco. Okay. So I've had the pleasure
of getting to know him through the UC

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.790
Board of Regents as he serves on the
board. He is one of the most articulate,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.930
one of the most... How should I say it?
The ability to put complex ideas in very

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:31.420
simple terms and crisply interrogate,
investigate and get to the gist of the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.910
conversation and really bring it back home
to, for us even as chancellors, think

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.220
about what is it that we are trying to get
the regents to approve. So with that said,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.430
sir, this is yours.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.613
- [Gavin] Thank you, Chancellor.
- Welcome.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.010
- Thank you, Chancellor. Thank you very
much for the introduction. Jamal, thank

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.990
you for very much for hosting us and
organizing this event. And welcome,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.830
everybody. Thank you for the opportunity
to be here in the governor's stead. It is

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.240
always good to have the governor out of
the State of California when you're the

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.570
lieutenant governor. So as your acting
governor today, let me welcome you on

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.930
behalf of a grateful state. You always
take advantage when the governor is out of

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:24.480
the state, and I will do so. Back not
until Saturday at 3:00, in case you need

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.160
me. Let me try to contextualize my
thoughts. I won't take too much of your

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.550
time. I'm here because we're all here to
celebrate leadership, to celebrate vision.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.910
But we're also here to celebrate each
other and what I think makes us great. If

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:47.610
you're like me, it's frustrating picking
up the newspaper, listening to the radio,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.320
watching the news with everything that's
going on around the world, in Syria,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.610
what's going on today, and Putin's
bringing in drones and tanks into Syria,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.050
what's happening with ISIS and what's
happening in Iraq and Yemen, around the

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.810
rest of the world, where nations and
people are literally being torn apart

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.740
because of racial, religious, ethnic
controversies, with field fanaticism and

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:18.170
field terror. But here we are in San
Diego. Here we are in one of the most

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:24.100
diverse regions in the most diverse state,
the State of California, in the world's

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:30.520
most diverse democracy, the United States
of America. And what brings us together is

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.520
a fundamental principle, a value that
transcends. And that is when we are at our

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.680
best, this is a state that doesn't
tolerate its diversity. We truly celebrate

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.830
that diversity. We celebrate, as Bill
Clinton would say, all our interesting

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:51.820
differences. But at the end of the day, we
unite around our common humanity, what Dr.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:57.400
King talked so evocatively about. We're
all bound together by a web of mutuality.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:05.310
We're all in this together. For me, that's
an antidote to the stress to the anxiety,

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:11.740
to the fear that a lot of us have. And in
so many ways, it's what we're celebrating

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.450
today is a recognition and an
understanding of that fundamental

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:25.230
principle that we are at our best when we
practice pluralism, when we strengthen our

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:32.680
connections, when we celebrate all that we
have to offer and unite around the things

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:39.650
that bring us together. That's exactly
what Congresswoman Lynn Schenk understood

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:47.820
in the early 1990's. And what a backdrop
the early 1990's in this state because

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:56.160
every single thing I just said, it wasn't
self-evident in 1992, 1993. It sure as

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.582
heck wasn't self-evident in 1994 in the
State of California. Xenophobia was raging

00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:09.844
wild. The nativist attitudes were raging
in this state. The isolationist attitudes

00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:15.619
were alive and well. We had a governor at
the time that was advancing something that

00:09:15.619 --> 00:09:23.274
three out of five Californians embraced,
that proposition known as Prop 187. The

00:09:23.274 --> 00:09:32.206
embers of that were being lit in 1992 when
Lynn became a congresswoman, 1993, and

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:38.816
ultimately advanced in 1994. The backdrop
of that time, don't forget, was not only

00:09:38.816 --> 00:09:47.260
the xenophobia, the fear of other, but
this white fear that was being advanced by

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.314
politicians, that whistle we all know too
much about. They changed the language,

00:09:52.314 --> 00:09:57.485
didn't they, at the time? They talked
about quotas, including chancellor quotas

00:09:57.485 --> 00:10:02.725
that ultimately led to that same Board of
Regents of which I serve on had 14 of its

00:10:02.725 --> 00:10:07.390
members to eliminate at this time
affirmative action at the UC system, a

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:13.970
price that is still being paid today, not
just here on this campus but all 10

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:19.650
campuses at the UC system. That fear, that
white fear that promulgated in other

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:23.840
efforts. Three strikes initiative.
Remember at this exact same time in

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:31.070
California a backdrop that is dramatically
different than I would argue that exists

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:38.620
today. How can that be? How could it be
that a young congresswoman could

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.880
understand that we could do more and do
better? How could it be that she can

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.340
partner with folks like Rudy Murillo,
connect the dots with some of our nation's

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:56.180
most prolific leaders at the time, Fritz
Hollings, Lloyd Bentsen and others in a

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.460
backdrop of a revolution that was about to
come with its leader by the name of

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:08.830
Gingrich about to ascend to that
leadership position to then advance the

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:15.220
same year the SENTRI Lane opened a
government shut down? How familiar these

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:23.510
words are in so many ways today. What an
extraordinary backdrop. See, what I admire

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:29.360
more than anything is leadership. We're so
desperate for it in this world. And one

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:34.550
thing I recognize, and Lynn recognizes
though she had formal authority as a

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:40.130
congresswoman at the time, but one thing I
recognize is leadership can come from

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:45.550
anywhere. When people recognize they have
agency, that they can help shape the

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:52.060
future. Even in a position of formal
authority, it was very unlikely that

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:59.510
Congresswoman Schenk would be successful.
Extraordinarily unlikely. So what she had

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:05.710
to do was exercise her moral authority,
and that's where true leadership resides.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:11.070
It's that dialectic between those in power
and those outside of power, the

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:16.190
partnerships that are formed that push us
along to stand up on principle and do the

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:23.040
right thing. At a time when everyone was
focusing on what's wrong in Mexico, she

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.910
changed the conversation. She changed the
narrative. All of a sudden, Mexico wasn't

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:34.900
just about drugs and violence and
trafficking. All of a sudden, we started

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:40.000
looking at a hundred plus million people,
at least today, very differently. Started

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.560
thinking about Mexico in terms of
entrepreneurs. Thought in terms of

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:52.070
cultural identity, artistic excellence,
innovation. A country that today, over

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:58.730
half the population is under the age of
30. We recognized that true measure of

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:08.340
power is found in forming new connections.
That's real power. She practiced the art

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:14.030
of inclusion and created an on-ramp,
literally and figuratively, in a world

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:20.040
where everyone was trying to sever those
ties and create more off-ramps. It's an

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:26.290
extraordinary story. I know I'm here and
it makes sense that I say that, but it

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:32.440
truly is an extraordinary story. And one
thing we know in life generally, success

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:38.800
leaves clues, and the success of this
program 20 years ago has not only been

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.130
replicated through other ports of entry,
as you all know well, in California, but

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:51.840
in Texas and in Arizona. It's an
extraordinary example and an extraordinary

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:58.030
story. And so Lynn, I just want to say
long-windedly how proud we are of you for

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:06.400
your willingness to step up and step in,
to recognize that you not only had a voice

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.200
but you had an obligation to change that
narrative and to change the dialogue. And

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.430
we are all better off for it. I don't want
to overstate it, but I'm not going to

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:22.550
understate it. And I just think what you
did and what you accomplished is important

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:28.800
to memorialize at a time when those
nativist attitudes, those xenophobic

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.760
attitudes, are being revisited by folks
that are running for higher office,

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:41.870
talking about 1900-mile walls, talking
about dystopian state of police raids,

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:51.910
talking about taking children from parents
and ripping up the echo of Abe Lincoln's

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:59.190
contribution, the 14th Amendment. We need
to be reminded of what you all achieved 20

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:06.480
years ago and what we all stand for in
California and here in San Diego today. So

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.980
that's my message. It's one of gratitude
and appreciation, and I hope that we all

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:20.720
recognize that in this state, if we can
find a way to put aside those differences,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:27.070
to reconcile those differences and focus
more on strengthening our connections that

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:34.060
there's no doubt in my mind, as the old
song says, "The best is yet to come."

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.810
Thank you all very, very much.

00:15:38.945 --> 00:15:47.100
- So thank you, Mr. Acting Governor. That
was truly an inspiring and an amazing

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:52.930
talk. Thank you very much. Okay. So before
we begin our panel titled "SENTRI, Against

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.580
All Odds," I'd like to give a little bit
of a background on the efforts of an

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.990
extraordinary group of community leaders
who work with key government partners,

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.640
like Congresswoman Lynn Schenk, who we
heard so much about, in fact, I learned a

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.810
lot in listening to Gavin just now, and U.
S. Attorney Alan Bersin to make SENTRI

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:17.060
possible. So it all began in 1990, as we
heard, with the idea for San Diego

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:22.560
Dialogue, a series of discussions that
were happening right here, aimed at

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:27.030
identifying issues and strategies that
will enhance San Diego's promise. So UC

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.320
San Diego was a strong partner in our
community and a contributor to our

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:36.650
region's growth back then, just as we are
today and just as we will be tomorrow.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.720
Innovation is in our DNA and we've always
had a mission of finding solutions to

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:45.360
societal challenges. So UC San Diego
played a leading role in the dialogue with

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.480
our community partners which led to the
consensus that San Diego's greatest

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.830
potential for growth lay in its proximity
to Tijuana, but the congestion and wait

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.860
times at the border proved a barrier to
border commerce and innovation. So of

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.560
course the story doesn't end there. And as
anthropologist Margaret Mead was spot on

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.120
when she said, "Never doubt a small group
of thoughtful, committed citizens can

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.850
change the world. Indeed, it is the only
thing that ever has." So our panelists

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.670
right now will share with you what was
done to work on those challenges and

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.800
hurdles to create SENTRI, including
Congresswoman Lynn Schenk's role at the

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.140
federal level to secure approval. And I
think nobody could have said this better

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:31.030
than Lieutenant Governor himself. So with
that said, I want to turn this over to my

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:37.610
dear friend, my dear colleague, our
well-known leader in the community,

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:42.910
somebody who knows everybody and everybody
knows her. Need I say her name? Mary

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.173
Walshok.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:55.610
- [Mary] While everybody's getting on the
stage, our panelists, Lynn, I want you to

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:03.490
know that Kevin Faulconer declared today
SENTRI Day in San Diego. I know Lynn's

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:11.400
house. I know her office. I hope you can
find room for this declaration from the

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.670
mayor acknowledging the 20th anniversary
of SENTRI. And I'm not going to read all

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.561
the whereases.
- [Lynn] Good.

00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:29.260
- But I think echoing Gavin's comments,
this was a pivotal moment in this region's

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:34.730
history and I think in California, and
it's recognized across the political

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.640
spectrum. And so congratulations, Lynn. I
hope you carry it home tonight.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.459
- Oh, no. It's going to hang in Pradeep's
office.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.910
And while Mary's coming up here, I just
want to re-echo the invitation I gave to

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:04.050
our lieutenant governor. I hope that
you'll speak at my funeral.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.030
Oh, you're the emcee.

00:19:08.921 --> 00:19:14.160
- So what I would like to do as a
beginning because of who's here in the

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:23.110
room, Lynn, is thank and acknowledge a
group of San Diego and Tijuana leaders

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:31.350
who, 20 years ago, began working together
to define where they thought the region

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:42.530
can go in terms of building an economy
that would be prosperous and equitable and

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:48.950
leverage the assets of both the United
States and Mexico. I'm only going to take

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:55.720
a moment because I really want the light
to shine on Lynn's work today because if

00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:02.060
we hadn't gotten this legislation, nothing
else would have happened. But as of 1990,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:09.130
people like Bill Rick, Bill Nelson, Mickey
Fredman, Brute Krulak (some of you

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.630
remember him), the editor of the Union
Tribune. Debbie and I were talking about

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:20.390
Tom Page, then the CEO of San Diego Gas
and Electric; the Chancellor Pradeep of

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:29.150
UCSD; Dick Atkinson came together to talk
about the leadership void in San Diego.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:35.590
Thank you for mentioning leadership
because there was a leader waiting to make

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:41.010
things happen. And very quickly, those
roundtable discussions led to the

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:47.800
importance of our connection to Mexico.
And I remember Malin Burnham saying to me,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:53.460
"If when I had joined this group, I had
thought I would be looking south rather

00:20:53.460 --> 00:21:00.430
than north for our future, I'm not sure I
would have joined the group." And he has

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:06.920
become one of the most outspoken champions
of the integration of our cross-border

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.880
region, both socially and economically.
Mention was made of Dick Atkinson but also

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.070
Bill McGill, who many of you will
remember, who was the retired president of

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:24.150
Columbia University, chaired this group
and he coached Chuck Nathanson, the

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:30.320
director of the San Diego Dialogue, and me
on how to move an agenda forward. So this

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.110
organization was building a kind of
readiness in San Diego, and Lynn and I

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:44.450
have had animated conversations, a
readiness to make the border work if

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:52.210
someone could champion, as you described,
legislation that would turn the tide. And

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:58.740
that person was Lynn. So what we'd like to
do in this session is start with Lynn. Now

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:04.840
he stole some of your thunder, but I have
heard these wonderful stories over the

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:13.350
years from Lynn about how she, with the
help of Rudy Murillo, but also thanks to

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:18.430
Mel Katz and Chuck Nathanson coming in,
talking to her early in the process,

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:24.310
picked up this mantle and ran with it.
Laurie and I are here to be the local

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:31.050
yokel lore that is the context, what was
going on here while she was working in

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:37.310
Washington. And Sally is very important
because the legislation was signed... I

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:46.250
think it was January? August '94. But the
lane didn't open until November '95, and

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:53.240
that's where Sally's history and the work
of many of the people in this room kicked

00:22:53.240 --> 00:23:00.900
in in a very important way in terms of
coming up with an approach to implementing

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:08.550
what then we called the commuter lane.
Trusted commuter lane? I can't remember

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.390
what we called it.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.510
- [Sally] It initially had a lot of names.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.430
- Yeah. It initially had a lot of names.
Sally is right.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.290
- It was a DCL, dedicated commuter lane.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.970
- Yeah. So with that, Lynn, you get to
start.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:24.590
- Well, one thing. Laurie was my chief of
staff.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:25.570
- This is why Laurie--

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:30.770
- And as every person who has a chief of
staff knows, including Gavin, they go

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.300
first.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:37.260
- [Laurie] I don't want to go first. The
only thing I want to say is, Lieutenant

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:42.480
Governor, and you'll appreciate it, Lynn
was a freshman member of Congress. Okay?

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.070
Lynn was a freshman member of Congress. It
usually takes at least two or three terms

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.500
just to find the restroom. That being
said--

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:56.870
- I never found it. All right. Yeah.
Really, I feel like I'm at my own eulogy

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:02.730
or something. But first of all, to
Lieutenant Governor, thank you very much,

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:10.220
and your able aide here, Tracy, who got
her start with me. I saw her fine

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.520
fingerprints there and certainly Rudy's.
But thank you. Chancellor, thank you.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:21.990
Ambassador, thank you for hosting this.
And for all of the men in the audience,

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:29.290
thank you for wearing a coat and tie on a
day like this. So you've gotten a lot of

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:36.930
the backdrop. Here, pre-1993 San Diego,
lots of things going on, business

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:43.930
communities. Certainly, the role of the
university and especially the San Diego

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:49.880
Dialogue, looking south, looking to what
is going on. Lots of things anecdotally

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:55.830
that we knew. Lots of things intuitively
that we knew. But the Dialogue, being an

00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:00.730
academic institution under Mary's
leadership and Chuck Nathanson, the late,

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:07.240
great Chuck Nathanson, decided to get
facts and figures. And they came out with

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:13.350
a report of who crosses the border. Well,
again, for San Diegans it wasn't shocking

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:18.170
but for others it was. Ninety-seven
percent of those who cross the border both

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:25.170
ways do so for work, for education
purposes, for visits to family, visits for

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:31.600
tourism. In other words, for the everyday
of life. And what was the big blockage,

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:40.630
like a blockage in an artery? That was the
border. So we had Chuck and his group and

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:48.200
Mary's group coming up with all of these
wonderful public policy background papers

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.310
that are so necessary, as the Lieutenant
Governor knows, to implement, to get the

00:25:53.310 --> 00:26:01.100
start in legislation. But there were other
things going on pre-1993. We here in San

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.630
Diego were represented by simply one of
the most extraordinary members of Congress

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:12.220
ever to have served, Lionel Van Deerlin,
and he represented the South Bay area. His

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:19.530
chief of staff was Rudy Murillo. Rudy was
very nuanced and knowledgeable in what was

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:27.340
going on in this area, and by the time I
got to Congress, Lionel Van Deerlin, then

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:35.110
had retired and Rudy was at what was then
called INS, one of the precursors to the

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:45.480
border and customs agency now. Rudy was in
that agency at a time when, coming from

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:52.770
San Diego, he knew what needed to be done
as well and he was looking for initiatives

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:59.720
to increase the number of inspectors not
for power purposes, but to open more

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:04.950
lanes. In fact, one day there was an
experiment and all 22 lanes were open and,

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:11.580
lo and behold, cars went through in two,
three, four minutes. So he was trying to

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:17.538
do that. There was at INS, and I don't
know if they were working with the

00:27:17.538 --> 00:27:24.496
university but maybe, also sort of a
nascent approach to having a dedicated

00:27:24.496 --> 00:27:33.289
commuter lane. So that was all there when
I took office in 1993. There were a number

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:40.457
of key turning points, and Laurie, as I
said, was my chief of staff. And unlike

00:27:40.457 --> 00:27:46.068
most members of Congress, I had my chief
of staff in the community, in the district

00:27:46.068 --> 00:27:53.699
so that she was in charge here and going
back and forth. So she really had her ear

00:27:53.699 --> 00:28:01.930
to what was going on and had under her
some staff who she directed and she will

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:05.570
tell you. Jump in anytime you want about
this one. There was a young woman by the

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:12.960
name of Rochelle Roseman, Rochelle Bold
now, who would on a daily basis look for

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.800
initiatives. So we weren't going to just
be reactive. We were going to be

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.270
proactive.
- After 2:00.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.200
- After 2:00. Yes.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:25.130
- After 2:00, we learned from the
congresswoman, you put down the react file

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:27.630
and you go to the proact file.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:33.260
- Well, Rochelle came across this
interesting tidbit that in Blaine,

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:39.990
Washington, there was a commuter lane to
Canada. And she brought that to Laurie,

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:46.320
and Laurie got in touch with Rudy because
we were all friends. If you take away

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.790
anything from this, and I'm just going to
interrupt myself, and those of you in

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:56.320
government and politics will know this to
be true and maybe even in academia, it's

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.290
luck and it's who you know and it's the
relationships that you develop. It's

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:08.120
something that, at least today, robots and
machines can't do yet. It's coming but not

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:16.890
yet. So my staff and Rudy, lots of back
and forth, and lo and behold, one day I

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:23.890
get a call that Chuck Nathanson of the
Dialogue wants to come and see me and Mel

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:29.330
Katz, who was then just I think cycled off
as president of the local Chamber of

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:34.470
Commerce but was on the Dialogue board,
that they wanted to come and see. And they

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:43.000
came in with this proposal for a dedicated
commuter lane as one tool to ease the

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.130
congestion at the border. Well, sounded
great to me, sounded great to Laurie. See,

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:53.730
we were so naïve in the ways of
Washington. We had no idea that there was

00:29:53.730 --> 00:30:03.380
this huge artery blocking, roadblock, by
the name of Congressman Jack Brooks. Jack

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.530
Brooks, may he rest in peace, I love the
guy. He was just like he could have played

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:15.320
himself on television. Congressman from
Texas, Chairman of the House Judiciary

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:25.070
Committee. Very powerful. Very powerful
committee. Jack had a personal bias, shall

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:31.340
we say. Am I saying that diplomatically,
Ambassador? A personal bias against a

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:37.040
commuter lane at the southern border so
much so that the pilot project... And if

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.490
I'm going to get too deep in the weeds,
just yawn or something and I'll get the

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:51.150
message. The pilot project at the norther
border was expiring and there had to be an

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:58.260
appropriation to continue it. So the '94
appropriations bill, which was written in

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:05.260
'93, extended the pilot project in Blaine,
Washington and specifically in language in

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:10.140
the bill prohibited one at the southern
border. So not only do we have a

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:18.340
congressman who was opposed to this. We
got a law against it. All right? So we

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.520
proceeded to write the legislation. The
staff and myself, we write the

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:30.800
legislation. Meanwhile, locally, Laurie is
gathering up the support, the business

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.130
community, the Dialogue and another very
key player. And you're going to hear

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:40.730
names, and I'm not namedropping. I'm
giving due to the people who made this

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:45.170
happen because when something is
successful, there are a lot of parents.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:49.870
It's only failure that's an orphan, right?
So there were a lot of parents to this. A

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:57.050
key person was then the U. S. Attorney
Alan Bersin. With a less visionary U. S.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:03.110
Attorney, it could have been dead on
arrival. But Alan embraced this. He

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:09.360
endorsed it. He became really like a
cheerleader. He and Laurie locally talked

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:15.150
to everybody that needed to be talked to
and then some, especially with local INS

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:21.500
and Customs. And Sally was there. You'll
remember, of course, that more so at the

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.230
federal level than the local level, there
was pretty strong opposition from INS and

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:36.010
Customs to have a commuter lane. So
anyway, Alan agreed to get on board and

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:45.120
Laurie created a local task-force, a
commuter... What did you call it, a

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.450
commuter task-force?

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.930
- Yeah. It was under the offices of the U.
S. Attorney's Office and the Congressman's

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.180
Office, so it was both.

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:57.000
- So I chaired it, Alan co-chaired it, and
there were regular meetings. So what came

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.310
out of this was that we would bring...
What?

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.260
- Go ahead.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:11.660
- That was later. She's still telling me
what to do, and I still have to listen. We

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:18.540
wrote the legislation and introduced it.
So the task-force was created January or

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:25.230
February of '94, and by that spring we had
some legislation that would overturn the

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:30.160
prohibitive language in the prior year's
appropriations bill. I can't believe I

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:36.660
still remember this. All right. So Jack
Brooks was not amused. And as Laurie

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:45.150
pointed out, I'm a freshman. Freshmen get
maybe one priority in a cycle, mainly

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:51.780
none, but this was one of my priorities
and I wanted to get this done. So on the

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:57.790
floor of the House, Congressman Brooks
very sweetly and in a charming way told me

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:03.670
that it was going to his committee and it
was going to be assigned to a subcommittee

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:08.780
that will kill it. So I have a little
hearing impairment and sometimes when I

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:14.780
hear no, it sounds like yes. And I know
Laurie has the same kind of an impairment.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.770
So we said, "Oh. Okay. We're going to
figure this out." But we didn't know what

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:25.990
to do. So I pick up the phone and I call
Rudy Murillo, and Rudy just hates this. He

00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:27.310
loves to be behind the scenes.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.670
- We tried to get him on the panel. He
declined.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:40.560
- Go step out or something. Anyway, Rudy
became absolutely the genius that I let

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.120
out of the bottle there, the adviser that
I needed on the strategy, what to do, how

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:51.190
to do it. Now there is an old saying that
if you have a weak stomach, you do not

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:56.300
want to watch how they make sausage or
laws. So now you're eating lunch. I'm not

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:02.100
going to get too deep into my recipe for
the sausage, but suffice it to say that

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:08.500
Rudy had two very important pieces of
advice. One was that INS and Customs had

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:13.800
to get something big out of it. That meant
money. That meant more people. That meant

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:20.710
facilities. All right? And the key was
introducing another person into the

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:27.100
equation, and that is a senator from South
Carolina by the name of Fritz Hollings. In

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.470
the '80s, I was very involved... And
Republicans, you can plug your ears, but

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:36.380
you have one of these committees, too. I
was very involved in the Democratic Senate

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:43.030
Campaign Committee to elect United States
senators, and so a number of them and my

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:49.820
friend Bill Lerach here was very involved
with me in that, and Sol Lizerbram. And we

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.020
elected a lot of U. S.senators. In fact, I
knew more senators than I knew members of

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.740
the House at one point. Fritz Hollings was
one of them. But more important, he was a

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:04.380
friend of Lionel Van Deerlin and Rudy
Murillo. Now why is he important? Well,

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:09.280
Senator Hollings was Chair of the
Authorization Committee, the Senate

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.020
Commerce Committee. But even more
important than that, he chaired the

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:19.060
subcommittee on appropriations on commerce
and the judiciary through which these

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:26.770
monies go. So basically Rudy was, and I'm
going to be very blunt here, counseling an

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:33.300
end run around Jack Brooks in the House
Judiciary Committee. A very risky move but

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:39.250
as I say, we were naïve and we said, "Oh,
that sounds like a good move." So we met

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:46.890
with Senator Hollings and he, because of
Van and Rudy, agreed that if we could get

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:53.600
it in the House Appropriations, that he
would be inclined to support this in the

00:36:53.600 --> 00:37:00.170
Senate. Lots of back and forths. Staff
talking to staff behind the scenes. And

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:05.920
Laurie knew more about this than I because
she was part of it, talking to the House

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:12.440
Appropriations Committee. Meanwhile, we
got other people involved. I think the

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:20.050
Chancellor or maybe you, Gavin, mentioned
Lloyd Bentsen. Lloyd Bentsen was a former

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:25.000
United States senator from Texas and was
at this time the Secretary of the

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.300
Treasury, under which Customs resided.
Now, Lloyd Bentsen loves San Diego. He

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:38.270
spent a lot of time here. He had a home in
Rancho Valencia, and he and his wife B.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:44.520
A.and my husband and I would socialize. So
when he was here one time, and Bill, I

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:52.270
think it was at your house that I hit him
up for the dedicated commuter lane and he

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:58.590
said he would see what he could do with
one of his departments, that is, Customs.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:03.600
Meanwhile also, we had a friend in the
White House, and it wasn't the President.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:11.850
John Emerson, who is now our Ambassador to
Germany. Anyway, so John, a Californian,

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:18.330
again a friend that we could call on, we
wanted to make sure that he got the

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:23.460
message to Customs and INS and others and
to Congressman Brooks that the White House

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:28.420
was supportive of a commuter lane at the
southern border. So all of this is going

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:34.980
on. Meanwhile, Alan Bersin invited Janet
Reno, his boss, the U. S. Attorney, to

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:38.960
come to San Diego. You want to comment on
that visit because you were very involved

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.090
in that?

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:46.170
- I will when we talk about collaboration.
But everybody who was anybody that needed

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:51.120
to be at that meeting at the border was
there. From the business community, from

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.000
the Dialogue, from the university.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.290
- And we did a very large forum from
Teresa with her, which many of you may

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.750
remember.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.640
- Coincidental with that visit.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.770
- It was very powerful.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:05.100
- But here's just a little tidbit. So in
Washington, Janet and I lived in the same

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.280
apartment building, right off Pennsylvania
Avenue. She liked to walk to the Justice

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.490
Department. I would take a bus up to the
hill but I would walk with her to the bus

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:21.030
stop. I did this because she had this
phalanx of security guys in cars behind

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:26.510
her. And so I ran into her in the hall one
day and said, "You're getting this

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:31.080
invitation from the U. S. Attorney in San
Diego. Here's what it's about." And it was

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.870
wonderful because to have the Department
of Justice, under which INS resided at the

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:43.950
time, be supportive was very, very
important. So meanwhile, we're pushing

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:51.420
this and the outcome of it, and I will get
to the point here, the outcome which was

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:59.780
very important: The House Appropriations
Subcommittee Chair agreed to put in what I

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:04.770
called wishy washy language, but it was
enough. It wasn't going to overturn the

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:10.090
prior year's appropriation but it was
enough to get it over to the Senate, where

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:16.460
it landed in the office of none other than
Senator Hollings, who immediately amended

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:24.110
the appropriations bill to overturn the
restriction on a southern dedicated

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:31.300
commuter lane and to appropriate funding
for one here in San Diego specifically.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:35.930
What this meant was now it could go to a
conference committee between the House and

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:42.290
the Senate conferees. And meanwhile, Jack
Brooks is getting calls from the White

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:48.840
House, from Dianne Feinstein who we
engaged, getting calls from Lloyd Bentsen,

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:58.300
from a whole variety of people that he
rethought it. And one day, I got the word

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:04.050
that he would not oppose the conference
language being changed to the Senate

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:11.060
language, and that's how we got that. And
he wanted to deliver this message to me

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:18.130
personally in his office. I was not asked
to sit down. There were a couple of things

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:24.110
on his agenda, shall we just say, that he
needed some votes on in the future. So the

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:30.830
local paper said that I outmaneuvered one
of the most powerful people in the House.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:36.300
It wasn't outmaneuvering. It was
collaboration, it was negotiation, it was

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:41.180
cajoling, it was not giving up, and it was
just plain old-fashioned horse trading and

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:46.160
being very lucky. I often say I'd rather
be lucky than smart. And I'm not very

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:51.800
smart so I have to be lucky. And it was
just a lot of luck of the right people

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:58.750
here in San Diego, in Washington, the
people who knew one another being knitted

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:04.080
together. And in August of 1994, President
Clinton signed the bill. So it's a

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.560
long-winded way of saying what happened
over a two-year period.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.880
- Fantastic story.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:17.870
- Twenty years ago, 1995, correct? That's
when we opened the door. But prior to

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:22.280
that, I would say about maybe eight months
prior to that, they started to assemble a

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:29.360
team of officers who were going to work
and design the enrollment center for a

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:36.040
dedicated commuter lane on the southwest
border. So we just had to basically put

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.880
our skills that we used every single day
on the border as officers: our

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.890
interviewing, what we required of people
when they came across the border. And we

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:52.080
didn't change that. We just stuck to those
basic functions that we perform every day.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:57.160
We did not want to make it the impossible,
but because we were initially in a test

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:03.250
phase, we did have to be very cautious on
how we rolled out the program. We did not

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:08.560
want the program to fail. We received our
marching orders from our district director

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.290
at the time who was Mr. Mark Reed. I think
Mr. Mark Reed should get some credit also.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:22.530
And Rudy Murillo was his chief of staff.
Right, Rudy? You were Mr. Mark Reed's

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:27.970
chief of staff or special assistant to the
district director in the INS days. And so

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:34.470
I was an INS inspector who was assigned to
the initial team. I think we were four.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:39.520
There were three male officers and one
female, I'm going to have to say that, and

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:50.810
I was the lead. Thank you very much.
And I just have a question. What kind of

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.970
communication devices were we using 20
years ago?

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.760
- [Male] Yeah.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.710
- You took my line. No cellphones. No
cellphones.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:04.750
- No cellphones, right? So you can only
imagine what type of technology was rolled

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:11.780
out 20 years ago for us to deploy or put
together a dedicated commuter lane. So on

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.430
the way here, I was telling our DFO, Mr.
Flores, and our port director at San

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:23.660
Ysidro, Mr. Aki. I had totally forgotten
about the first fingerprint system that we

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:29.580
received at Otay Mesa. It was a state of
the art. It was probably the size of three

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:35.550
huge commercial freezers.
But we were so excited because we never

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:40.390
had this type of technology before, and so
we were getting all of this what we

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:46.450
thought was... It was brand new
technology. For 20 years ago, it was the

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:53.270
best technology that was out there. And
so, using the technology 20 years ago,

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:59.800
working with the two contractors--there
was EDS and SAIC, one for hardware and one

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:05.920
for software--and working with the
community, we couldn't have done it

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:12.680
without the Otay Mesa Chamber, the San
Ysidro Chamber, our Mexican partners. I

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:18.080
recall myself going over to Tijuana
weekly, monthly to give presentations

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:22.720
about SENTRI or the dedicated commuter
lane, giving presentations to the

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.420
maquiladoras. And so with all of that,
putting all that together and then coming

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:35.470
up with those first 500 businesspeople
that were going to assist with the test of

00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:40.240
the concept on the southern border. And
then Otay Mesa, of course, being selected

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.480
was huge for us. You mentioned "Against
All Odds." We had some of that internally

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:53.950
also, right? We had to change the mindset
of our officers, of our partners there on

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:58.200
the border. And so I think one of the
biggest challenges for us was that we were

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:01.860
going to have this lane and the people
that were going to be using the lane were

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:07.510
trusted travelers. We had set the
parameters. You couldn't have a felony.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:12.480
Misdemeanors, it was going to be two. You
had to have employment. You had to cross

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:18.350
the border frequently initially. And so,
with all of these things set into place

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.680
and discussing them with the officers
because the officers had to feel

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.570
comfortable. That was a huge challenge is
that those officers that were going to be

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:34.010
manning the lane had to feel security,
that it was a secure lane, in order to

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:38.830
have an expedited crossing. And so lots of
discussion with the officers. And so

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:44.860
initially built into the program were what
we call random compliance. How many of you

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:51.540
here were one of the first 500? Anybody?
Wow. Great. Okay. So you remember that

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:56.270
initial compliance. Okay. So with 500
people, you had people going into

00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:01.180
secondary. Well, the officers said, "No.
We want to see them more." So we changed

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:05.490
the compliance rate. "Okay, we'll make it
higher." So we made it higher, requiring

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:09.840
the users to go into secondary more. A
couple of weeks later, they said, "We're

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.190
not catching anything. Lower that rate.
You're just creating a lot of work for

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:18.210
us." So we went back and forth with a lot
of that dialogue internally with the

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:26.130
officers. And so me being one of those
officers, it had a negative tone to it if

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:30.250
you belong to the dedicated commuter lane
staff. And so you were kind of like the

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:35.850
enemy because you were going against what
was traditionally the standard for working

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:41.490
at a port of entry. And so we proved them
wrong real soon because there were no

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:46.740
apprehensions. And so as people continued
to go into secondary, everyone was

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:53.410
compliant. And shortly after that, we went
from 500 to 2000 to 5000. Expansion to San

00:47:53.410 --> 00:48:01.470
Ysidro. Expansion to Texas. Expansion to
Calexico. And so, the concept did not take

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:07.710
long for us to demonstrate that San Diego
was definitely the right location to test

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:13.110
the concept and then expand further. And
so very happy that I was part of that and

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:15.100
to see it 20 years later.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:27.070
- As my good friend Laurie Black says, "It
takes all kinds of leadership." It takes

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:31.130
leadership at the national level, but I
think we just heard an example of

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:36.690
leadership here at the local level. Thank
you for that. So Laurie, you get to

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:38.150
editorialize now.

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:44.190
- Oh my God. I love editorializing. Jack
Volante, the late Jack Volante, if you

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:51.630
remember, he used to represent the motion
picture industry, about 24 years ago

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:58.150
introduced Lynn Schenk and he said, "In
politics, there are two kinds of people,

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:04.230
two kinds of horses. There's work horses
and there's show horses." And boy, don't

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:13.250
we know those show horses who watch the
Republican debate. I don't care. My

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:19.870
Republican friends were mortified. Lynn
Schenk is a work horse. She's a work

00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:26.340
horse. It's one of the reasons I wrote to
her back in 1979 when I was in college and

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:31.000
said, "Whatever you do in life, I want to
be a part of it." And when she decided to

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:39.620
run for Congress, I had a 10-week old, a
2-year old and a 4-year old, and I

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:46.460
said, "Don't do it." She said, "I'm doing
it." And so we did it and it was quite the

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:54.100
ride. But the best part of working with
Lynn is that we worked with the community.

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:58.490
And as her chief of staff, so you keep in
mind the politics, this was not a safe

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:04.280
seat. This was an even-steven
Republican-Democrat seat, the new 49th.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:11.450
It's very important you know that because
in 1992, what was very helpful was that

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:17.350
Ross Perot ran and took 29% of the votes
so it allowed our democratic friends to

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:21.540
win. And Bob Filner and Lynn Schenk, two
democrats, won.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.470
- Don't say that name--

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:31.860
- I am going to say something.
Let me just go back to work horses and

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:40.710
show horses. I think it's a part of the
story. Bob is nowhere on this thing and

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:46.570
he's district representative, for God's
sake. So excuse me. It is for the record,

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:53.580
right? The other thing I want to make a
point of. We did do this and this is

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:58.280
really important. We did this without
cellphones, smartphones. We were just

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:02.740
getting computers in. This was about
relationships, and it hasn't changed in

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:07.890
our community. When we get things done,
like the library and like Petco and North

00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:11.540
Embarcadero Visionary Plan, and I could
keep going through, those are all

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:16.120
collaborative efforts with elected
officials and with community, with

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:22.550
business groups and the very level. I mean
community groups want to be here but the

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:26.780
community groups who really know what they
want their neighborhoods, their villages,

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:30.920
their cities and their counties to look
like, and that's really what this was

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:37.300
about. But somebody has to be the leader,
the leader that we can depend upon because

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:41.780
we can't always depend on the leadership.
We had two things we used to say in the

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:47.110
office. Like "Milk does a body good, " I
came up with this right after Lynn won and

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:51.380
I said, "Lynn Schenk takes care of
business." I'm sure I got some look from

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:55.150
her. "Yeah, right." I said, "That's what
we're going to be." And we went to the

00:51:55.150 --> 00:52:01.470
Chamber of Commerce. I had never been to
the Chamber of Commerce building. I was a

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:06.730
little younger than Lynn but I was still
over 30. And we walked in and Gil Partida

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:12.240
was the new president. Remember that name.
We had a Hispanic President of the Chamber

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:16.170
of Commerce, and Mel Katz, a Jew, was the
head of the board. I mean, "Oh my God."

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:25.110
But I realized we got things done. These
weren't people who were show horses. These

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:29.690
are people who wanted to do something. And
then you take a visionary like Chuck

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:36.030
Nathanson and you add that vision into it
and you take somebody like an Alan Bersin,

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:40.600
who along with Lynn, two of the smartest
people I know on the planet Earth. Alan is

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.770
working in Interpol today, representing
our country around the world for this

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:54.160
president. And so you have all of these
legal minds. You have lots of color in the

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:59.480
room. That's not the kind of thing we were
seeing because of the xenophobia of

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:09.220
Proposition 187 which passed in 1994. So
all I can say is from my two years, there

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:14.160
were a lot of things that got accomplished
during the two years of a freshman woman

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:19.590
member of Congress. She was the first
woman south of L.A. Some people will look

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:23.110
at me and say... I'm sure you get this.
She does, too. She says, "Once you're a

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:27.270
chief of staff, you're always a chief of
staff." So between Governor Brown and

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:32.490
Governor Davis, she nails me because I'm
still the chief of staff after all these

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:37.810
years. But it was such a pleasure and an
honor to be a part of it. I think what's

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:43.410
also very important in contemporary world,
I had a baby, a two-year-old and a

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.610
four-year-old when we were doing this. We
were changing diapers on Lynn's desk when

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:54.300
she was in Washington. And you know what?
That was okay because she wanted me there.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:54:01.030
We had a serendipitous relationship. And
between myself, Rochelle, Bill Bold and

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:06.740
others who are still some of the smartest
in our community, with Lynn's leadership,

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:10.300
we could really depend and do some really
great things. And whenever I go through

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:17.320
there, I think of you and Jack Brooks. He
was tough. So thank you very much for the

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:22.430
honor of being here today. Chancellor,
thank you for watching my daughter. And

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:27.502
Lynn, thank you for being my sister, and
Mary, in life. I am grateful.

00:54:27.502 --> 00:54:28.826
- Thank you.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:35.570
- [Debra] It is my great pleasure to be
here on the 20th anniversary of SENTRI. I

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:39.990
think the mayor misnamed the day because I
think it should have been named Lynn

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:42.900
Schenk Day. How many of you agree with
that? Yeah.

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:50.180
When you hear the story of what was done

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:55.460
to accomplish getting the SENTRI Lane in
place, it tells a lot about the people.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:55:02.530
But I know Lynn because she's on our board
of directors. And so what we just heard

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:09.450
about the relentlessness and the continued
effort to get something that was

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:16.780
unachievable or seemed unachievable done
is so much about this person. And it just

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:23.510
did so much for our region to be able to
have a flow of traffic across the border.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:28.230
And here we are now, 20 years later,
looking at how we improved the flow of

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:34.570
traffic across the border so that people
and cars can flow as easily as energy does

00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:39.020
across the border as our company works
with many of the Mexican utility

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:49.450
companies. So it is my great pleasure to
have Lynn come up and join me. Yep. I'm

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:57.230
not acting as Chair of the Board today,
Lynn. But it is my great pleasure to honor

00:55:57.230 --> 00:56:03.380
Lynn in the 20th anniversary of SENTRI and
all of the work that she did to make this

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:08.150
happen for our region. So please join me,
and a round of applause for this wonderful

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:10.111
lady. Thank you.
