00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
Let me summarize. You learned two really important

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.673
things that we use every day in robot programming

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:07.606
and they were somewhat complementary. First

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:09.574
we talked about smoothing which took a discrete

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:13.239
path and turned it into continuous smooth path.

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:14.565
And then we turned about how the robot can

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:16.949
follow this smooth path, using a control

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.417
mechanism called PID. With this, you can

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:21.132
actually implement quite a bit of robotics,

00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:23.386
with no matter what robot you have, apply

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:26.953
a planner, apply a smoother, apply a controller

00:00:26.953 --> 00:00:29.648
and it will do just fine. In fact, this is about

00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:31.799
the level at which our DARPA Robot Challenge

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:33.599
car won the DARPA Robot Challenge . The

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.327
Google car itself has a little bit more juice

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:38.719
in it. It considers the case that the steering

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.942
wheel itself has inertia and that the steering

00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:42.889
wheel was driven by something called torque

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:45.124
, not by position, but leaving this aside, you

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.275
really got a gist out of what’s happening in

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:49.152
robotic driving. And now we’re able to really

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:52.325
control an actual robot. Congratulations,

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:56.325
that is really, really cool.
