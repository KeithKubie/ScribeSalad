[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.110
JS RAFAELI: We're here
to talk about drugs.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.980
But I'm just going to start
with a little kind of quiz.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.250
Who here in the
context of drugs has

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.810
heard of a thing called
the British System?

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.050
Like, capital B capital S,
British System, formal thing.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.120
For viewers, at home
that's zero people.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.310
And you guys are Google.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.980
I mean, you have
access to information.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.190
But don't feel too bad,
because we've done--

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.520
I've asked the same question
at criminology departments

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.990
in major universities
with people

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.980
who specialize in drugs policy.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.480
And the results weren't
actually that much better.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.630
It's a really interesting thing.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.900
So we started researching--

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.900
I mean, we were researching
drug policy for a long time

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.040
together for another book.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.260
And we started researching
the history of it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.780
And what we uncovered was
this really fascinating kind

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.200
of lost thread of
British history.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.440
And we found it very
revealing, not just

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.000
about drugs and the
way they're governed,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.250
but about the intellectual
and political traditions

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.070
of this country and about how,
like by reflection, the nature

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.110
of global drugs policy and how
it works, and more importantly,

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.730
how it doesn't work.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.320
So we're conscious of time.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.700
Give you a very quick,
like, potted history

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.280
of how drug policy developed,
particularly in Britain.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.430
From the 19th century, the drugs
that we consider illegal today

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.960
were basically actually legal.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.290
You could buy them in
apothecaries, corner stores.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.570
People brewed poppy
head tea as a sort

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.510
of folk remedy, painkiller, in
the absence of, like, a health

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.590
system.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.480
And aspirin hadn't
been invented yet.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.490
As the 19th century
ends, there's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.820
the emergence of a professional
class, a new professional class

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.380
of a pharmacist.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.000
This had never
been heard before.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.240
Immediately what breaks out is
a sort of turf war between two

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.030
also newly emerging sets
of professional classes.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.990
You have medical
health professionals,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.320
which has been a newly
professionalized industry,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.990
and you have civil servants
and a newly emerging

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.048
professional bureaucracy.

00:02:26.048 --> 00:02:27.840
There's this little
tussle between the two.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.730
And this happens all over
the sort of developed world

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.030
as to who is going to control
the supply of medicines,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.982
but also these illicit
drugs, like opium.

00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:40.190
Cannabis eventually became
part of that conversation,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.290
and cocaine when
it was invented.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.160
All three of which Queen
Victoria was quite partial to,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.550
incidentally.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.590
So this tussle sort of
goes on over the end

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.020
of the 19th century
as science advances.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.510
And then World War I happens.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.340
Post-World War I, the first
British Ministry of Health

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.990
is formed in 1919.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.600
And they figure, right, we
need to figure this stuff out.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.032
Drugs are actually
becoming an issue

00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:07.490
on the international scene,
particularly from the US, which

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.200
we'll talk about in a minute.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.680
We need to figure this out.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.190
So they formed a committee
called the Rolleston committee.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.190
The Rolleston committee
meets and they basically

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.690
figure out a system which became
known as the British System.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.740
And what the British System
entailed in its most basic

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.920
iteration was that if
you are a heroin addict--

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.850
and it was specifically
largely about heroin,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.875
which is the most
addictive drug--

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:34.250
if you were addicted to heroin,
you can go to your doctor

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.820
and say, listen,
I'm a heroin addict.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.500
And with no judgment, they'll
say, OK, that's unfortunate.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.060
But we'll supply your heroin.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.100
We will give you
heroin-- not methadone,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.160
none of these other substitutes.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.502
We will supply you
heroin from your doctor.

00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:51.960
You don't need to
go to a gangster.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.775
You don't need to go
to a black market.

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:54.650
We'll give it to you.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.380
And what's very
interesting about--

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.000
that might be quite
shocking that this

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.800
happened sort of in living
memory in this country.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.070
You go to your doctor
and they give you

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.370
drugs which we consider
evil or illegal.

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:12.440
What's very interesting about
the way the Rolleston committee

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.370
and the British
System as it emerged

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.440
is the language that was used.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.390
There was no moralizing.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.990
There was no sense
that drugs were evil

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.260
or that taking drugs or
being addicted to drugs

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.930
was a moral failing.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.907
We sort of refer to it as
like these unfortunate people

00:04:31.907 --> 00:04:32.990
who are addicted to drugs.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.782
It was an accident.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.740
And this system was instituted.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.720
And it worked for decades.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.670
What's interesting is that there
was another system emerging

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.610
across the Atlantic
in the United States,

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.550
a different way of
dealing with drugs, which

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.120
was intensely
moralizing, where drugs

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.090
were considered a moral evil.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.840
And the only way with
which to handle them

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.670
was not through the
medical profession,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.420
as it was under
the British system,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.833
but by law
enforcement, which is--

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.250
one can read many
things into that

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.130
about American approaches
between the individual

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.410
and the state and the
Sheriff with the badge

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.740
and a gun and all this stuff.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.380
But another time.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.750
So the American way of
dealing with these drugs

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.950
was, A, moralizing,
and B, super racist.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.050
Like, it was rooted absolutely
in racism, particularly

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.210
in its real origins in
anti-Chinese racism.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.250
Hundreds of thousands
of Chinese workers

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.000
have been brought to the United
States to build the railroads.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.640
As soon as the
railroads were finished,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.840
the establishment and
white America, suddenly

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.960
had to figure out, right,
there are thousands-- hundreds

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.840
of thousands of now
unemployed Chinese people.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.110
And it became a
problem for them.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.990
And attacking
opium, the practice

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.050
of taking opium, which had been
largely forced on the Chinese

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.860
by the British--

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.460
again, another
story-- became a way

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.070
to attack Chinese
communities and to limit

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.570
Chinese immigration.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.240
And there's some really--
like, these quotes started

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.740
flooding out from newspapers.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.610
This is a newspaper from San
Francisco describing opium dens

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.590
where white women
and Chinamen sit side

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.620
by side under the effects
of this drug, a humiliating

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.340
sight to anyone with
anything left of manhood.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.510
And just stuff that you
hear today and you go, yeah.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.290
The campaigner
Richard Hobson, he

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.300
was a major guy in the US
incipient war on drugs--

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.160
"Like the invasions
and plagues of history,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.850
the scourge of narcotic drug
addiction came out of Asia."

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.520
Again, you hear that
today and it's just

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.570
profoundly disgusting.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:54.220
But this was the tenor
of language at the time.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.210
Opium and eventually heroin
was particularly associated

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.020
with the Chinese community.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.110
Cocaine-- they replicated
it with cocaine

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.190
in African Americans.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.670
There's quotes in the book
which I will not read now

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.450
which are profoundly disturbing.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.270
And marijuana with Mexicans
and Hispanic Latin Americans--

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.090
community.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.420
It was a process which was
repeated again and again

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.930
to attach a certain drug to
a certain ethnic community

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.860
and use that to make the drug
illegal as a way of attacking

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.220
minorities.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.150
This resulted in this sort of
early version of what we now

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.530
call the war on drugs and
the American way of making

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.290
all drugs illegal, which is--

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.760
that idea didn't
exist here, as I said.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.690
We had the British
System over here.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.060
In the States, they
made everything illegal.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.020
Now, which system works better?

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.245
If your aim is to control
drug use, we can--

00:07:56.245 --> 00:07:59.410
and limit drug use and limit
the dangers of drug use--

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.550
we can look to the numbers.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.970
The exact numbers for,
let's say, the '40s and '50s

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.150
in America are
sort of unknowable.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.585
But it's in the mid to high
hundreds of thousands--

00:08:10.585 --> 00:08:12.460
NEIL WOODS: Low to mid
hundreds of thousands.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.640
JS RAFAELI: Several hundred
thousand heroin addicts

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:21.580
in the United States in
the mid-40s, early-50s.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.870
In the United Kingdom--

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.760
I'll read you a
quote from the book.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.650
"In 1959, there were 62 known
heroin addicts in the UK.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.490
By 1964, this had risen to 342."

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.080
Now, this five year rise
from 62 to 342 heroin addicts

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.520
here was considered
a crisis here.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.270
It was like, oh my
God, we have 350 heroin

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.870
addicts in the entire country.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.570
You can compare the numbers.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.170
I mean, I remember going over
these statistics and thinking,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.340
there was a time in living
memory when the entire heroin

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.610
addict population of the UK
would be a bit of a squeeze

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.220
but it could fit in this room.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.720
That's in living memory, 1964.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.210
It's not that long ago.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.840
The Beatles' first LP had only
come out two years earlier.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:21.970
So in terms of the effectiveness
of controlling addict numbers,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.910
we see the British System
actually was actually

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:25.790
much more effective.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.570
There are very technical
reasons for that, which I'd

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.920
like to get into in a minute.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.160
But I'm going to let Neil
get on in one second,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.810
because I just want to
keep it clipping along.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.460
Why did the British
System get shut down?

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.390
Essentially, I mean,
the short answer

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.360
is American what we call
cultural imperialism.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.100
The Second World War happens.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.680
Every single developed economy
ends the Second World War

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.346
poorer except one,
the United States.

00:09:54.346 --> 00:09:57.350
The United States
ended the war richer.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.060
There are these
very shocking quotes

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.730
we found where in
the aftermath of war,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.140
as the incipient organization
that grew into the United

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.940
Nations comes about, the
American organization which

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.870
became the FBI, the predecessor
to the FBI, goes [INAUDIBLE],,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.910
you want that military aid?

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.010
Make drugs illegal.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:20.990
You want our political
and diplomatic support?

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.850
Make drugs illegal.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:28.190
And what we now as the war
on drugs was forced on the--

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.650
through the United
Nations was forced

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.710
on an unwilling
rest of the world

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.170
by United States
diplomatic, military,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.390
and economic pressure.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.050
The major holdout, the
major developed economy

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.740
that resisted that,
was the United Kingdom.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.740
It's a surprise-- we think
of Anglo-American relations

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.370
and we think of the UK
following the US's lead a lot.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.750
It's a cliche.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.510
In fact, it's interestingly,
in this particular field

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.980
of policy, Britain was
a resistor to that,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.390
and led a really kind of
noble diplomatic resistance.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.190
But I'm going to let Neil
jump in to tell you how this--

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.880
Neil has experienced the
results of this on the streets.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.910
And I'll let him take over and
tell you about his experience.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.620
NEIL WOODS: Well,
I mean, I grew up

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.480
seeing the drug war as a war.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.520
So when I went into
the police, I was--

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.460
I understood it, I
thought, quite clearly.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.240
And as JS says, there was only
a few hundred problematic heroin

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.640
users in the UK in the 1960s.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.870
That went up to 350,000
by the end of the 1980s.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.020
So there's a very clear
cause and effect there.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.340
But of course, that
cause and effect,

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.780
that's what brought
me into the drug war.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.822
As a young police officer,
I've got an attachment

00:11:46.822 --> 00:11:53.630
to the drug squad because of
the moral panic about crack

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.750
and heroin on our streets.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.930
And I got roped into
working undercover.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.055
And it was just beginning.

00:12:01.055 --> 00:12:03.050
It's this type of
undercover work just begun

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.170
at that time in 1993 in the UK.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.210
And the first time I
worked undercover, I

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.850
was sent to a door
with a 20 pound

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.560
note to buy some crack cocaine.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.150
And the guy-- this huge,
scary guy, I thought--

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.150
but then when he
sold me the crack,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.830
he said, now you take care now.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.860
Don't get arrested.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.510
He was quite considerate
to me, really.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.060
And so I went back
to the drug squad

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.680
with my 20 pound stone of crack
cocaine, said, I've got it.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.630
But then that defined the
next 14 years of my life.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.780
And that's the work I then
did for the most part--

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:43.320
for the biggest proportion
of that time for 14 years.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.472
Now, I say it was
easy the first time

00:12:45.472 --> 00:12:46.680
and he was quite considerate.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.900
But of course, drug
dealers get sent to prison.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.980
And they speak to
other drug dealers.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.560
So quite quickly
they knew that there

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.340
was a new tactic out there.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.740
And so the next people
were more suspicious.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.420
And it was more
difficult. So I realized

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.150
that I had to spend time
manipulating people.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.970
I also worked out that the
easiest people to manipulate

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.290
are the most vulnerable.

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:13.800
It's true.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.350
It's a basic-- it's a
truism of undercover work.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:20.122
You manipulate the most
vulnerable people the easiest.

00:13:20.122 --> 00:13:21.830
And of course, the
most vulnerable people

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.067
are the most problematic heroin
and crack cocaine users--

00:13:25.067 --> 00:13:26.900
and also the most
vulnerable people, they've

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.067
got all the contacts, as
well, because they're using

00:13:29.067 --> 00:13:30.740
more drugs than anybody else.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.320
So I got to know the people
who were self medicating

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.760
for childhood trauma.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.770
I spent time speaking to them.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:41.030
People who had been abused,
beaten by their fathers,

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.730
sexually abused by their
uncles, or neglected

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.130
in one way or another.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.150
The people who are
problematically using heroin

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.228
tend to have those kind
of things in common.

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:51.020
So I spent a lot of
time listening to them.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.560
One of these people who had
a very difficult childhood I

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.970
got to know in an undercover
operation in Nottingham.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:02.910
He was called [? Cammie. ?]
Now, I spent weeks wooing him.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.592
I even brought him presents.

00:14:05.592 --> 00:14:07.550
I set, oh, [? Cammie, ?]
I've been shoplifting.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.210
I said, I didn't sell this
last cap, I said to him.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.530
Shoplifting is great
fun, by the way.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.188
If you can-- if you've got--
you'd get out of jail free card

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.980
and you can get away
with it, it really is.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.410
It's great fun.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.660
But I digress.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.790
Anyway, so I gave him
this baseball cap.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.400
And I'll never forget the
day he took his old one off,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.320
his tatty cap off, and
he put his new one on

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.598
and checking out his profile
in the glass doorway.

00:14:30.598 --> 00:14:31.640
He says, oh, thanks, man.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.690
That's really great.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.140
Thank you.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.140
Anyway, I spent a lot of
time with [? Cammie. ?]

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.030
And he introduced
me to the people

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.460
I needed to be introduced
to, particularly

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.840
some people who were involved
with this gangster called

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:50.150
Colin Gunn who ran the
Bestwood cartel in Nottingham.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:54.210
So he was the person who
got me to the introductions.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:59.450
Now, at the conclusion of
that operation, of course,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.957
[? Cammie ?] had also
been committing offenses.

00:15:02.957 --> 00:15:04.790
In fact, he was committing
offenses on bail.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.490
He'd been dealing
heroin himself.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.180
So he also got arrested.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.020
And I found out,
when all the people--

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.230
60-odd people arrested
for that operation.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.680
And I found out that when
he was in the police cells

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.790
he ended up on minute-to-minute
watch, suicide watch.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.360
And the reason for
that is he thought

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.380
I was his one friend in the
world, the only person he

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.120
could trust with the things
that he was talking about.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.200
And of course, you know, I used
my empathy to get to know him.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.230
I knew exactly what I was doing.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.430
But for him, for someone who'd
had that difficult a childhood,

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.250
that was just one
betrayal too much.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.400
So when I finished
the operation,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:55.970
I actually decided I had
to stop working undercover.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.988
And I did, for a few weeks,
until I got a phone call

00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:01.155
from the detective sergeant.

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:06.110
And he says, Woodsy, we
need you to do this job,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:11.660
because these guys are even
more vicious than the last ones.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.020
This gang, the Burger
Bar Boys, are using rape

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.440
as reputation building, just
to be the scariest gangsters

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.290
out there.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.150
And they were taking over the
supply of heroin and crack

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.520
in the town of Northampton.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.910
They were a gang that was
coming out of Birmingham.

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:33.790
So I spent months, again,
manipulating people

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.390
in Northampton to get the
introductions to them.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.950
And they were a terrifying
bunch, the Burger Bar Boys.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:43.150
In fact, one day--

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.290
I had been wearing a camera,
because eventually you

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.915
have to have some
kind of corroboration

00:16:46.915 --> 00:16:47.740
of what's going on.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.018
I had been wearing one,
but one day I thought,

00:16:50.018 --> 00:16:51.810
I don't like the way
they're looking at me.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.440
They're being a bit
suspicious of me.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.035
So the next morning, I thought,
shall I wear the camera?

00:16:56.035 --> 00:16:56.770
And I didn't.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.440
I left it off.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.650
And wow, I was pleased that I
did, because when I met them,

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.740
they snatched me off the
street into this big van,

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.329
took me to the edge
of the racecourse

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:09.780
in the center of Northampton.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.829
And one of them lifted his
shirt up and showed me a gun,

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.040
and said, right, come on, strip.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.150
You're 5-0, man.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.650
You're 5-0.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:18.400
And yeah, they do.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.230
They use the word 5-0.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.000
I remember looking
at them thinking,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.060
you're not old enough to
have seen that program on TV.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.410
5-0?

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.080
Anyway, they made
me strip, which

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.675
was a terrifying experience,
especially with a gun there

00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:33.820
and they're crowded
around me laughing at me

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.530
and trying to humiliate me.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.390
And it was humiliating.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.660
But I was still thinking, thank
God I didn't wear the camera.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.510
But with all the horrors
that they were doing

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:52.420
and the casual violence
that they dished out,

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.022
eventually it dawned on me.

00:17:54.022 --> 00:17:55.480
You see, when I'd
been manipulating

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.397
[? Cammie ?] and other
people and causing harm

00:17:57.397 --> 00:17:59.740
to those people, I knew
I'd caused the harm.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:00.940
I knew.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.750
I knew that their lives would
be much worse for meeting me.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.870
But I thought the end
justified the means.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.480
But eventually, after years
and years of doing that work,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.240
it dawned on me
that these gangsters

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.470
were getting more and
more violent every year.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.380
They weren't wishing
me luck and telling me

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.650
not to get myself arrested.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.775
They were threatening me with
guns and knives and swords.

00:18:21.775 --> 00:18:23.650
And eventually, I had
the penny dropped and I

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:27.890
had to face the fact that the
reason for that is down to me,

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.990
or rather, people like
me, because this drug war,

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.970
if it's a war, it's
more of an arms race.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.450
Because every tactic
the police develop,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:43.948
organized crime develop
a tactic to deal with it.

00:18:43.948 --> 00:18:45.740
And the best tactic
organized crime have is

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.590
the use of fear and violence.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.383
So it's a cause
and effect, again.

00:18:51.383 --> 00:18:53.300
It's like we've gone
from a few hundred heroin

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.820
addicts to 350,000.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.210
There's a cause and effect.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.360
By trying to police this
problem, that's what we do.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.180
We cause the violence
as the pushback.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.150
So that was hard for me,
because all those times I took

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:08.570
the decision that the end
justified the means, it didn't.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.560
It didn't at all.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.120
All I've been doing
is causing harm.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.520
But I think that
perhaps would you

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.742
explain a bit better about
how the arms race work?

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:20.450
JS RAFAELI: Yeah.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.670
Well, I can put it
in context, I guess.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:28.010
So that process of an
arms race that Neil

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:33.020
saw where the police get smarter
so the gangsters get more

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.600
violent, so the police
have to get smarter,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.270
and the gangsters have
to get more violent,

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.330
it's an ever-escalating
arms race.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.950
And because of the
particular nature

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.410
of drug addiction
and the drugs market,

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:50.240
there's never any
option of de-escalation.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.200
It can only go one way because
of the structure of policy.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.390
Neil experienced
that very-- like,

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.330
in a brutal sort of
firsthand way on the street.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.240
When we were researching
this book, essentially what

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.760
we were trying to
do, we realized,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.270
was to show the war on drugs
not as a sort of process

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.590
of like headline by
headline by headline

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.550
sort of daily
hysteria over drugs,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.540
but as a process of [? chits ?]
or change over time,

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.540
and to see how, actually,
over decades this has changed

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.360
and it's grown and
sort of metastasized

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.680
into the crisis we see today.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.970
And we also-- we hung out
with quite a few pretty heavy

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.250
gangsters, interviewing
them, because they

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:35.640
have an important view on this,
the people who sell the drugs.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.760
And we were up in
Liverpool, which

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.000
occupies a very specific
place in the sort of drugs

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.810
map of the UK, for various
historical reasons.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.980
And we ended up interviewing
three generations

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.710
of Liverpool gangsters.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:56.250
The first one came up in
the late '70s, early '80s.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.900
I think he was first
arrested at 14 for robbery.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.650
Got into very serious
armed robbery.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.820
This was a scary guy.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.180
Neil, as a cop, and
me as a journalist

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.600
have both interviewed
some pretty heavy people

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.190
in our careers.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:17.270
And both of us came out of
this interview going, whew.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.350
That guy is serious,
serious news.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.410
A big guy.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.640
He'd been shot four times
or-- three or four times.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.140
I forget.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.560
He had hands-- you could see
the damage from his hands

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.350
from where he had
damaged other people.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.790
And he described how he had
come up in the armed robbery

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:41.030
world of the '80s and seen
the process by which the drugs

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.330
crisis, as it
emerged in the '80s,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.030
wiped out the armed robbers--
or at least co-opted

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.710
the armed robbers.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.810
And everyone became
a drug dealer

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.120
because there was just simply--

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.320
the risk to reward that you
can make from dealing drugs

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.970
far outweighs the
risk to reward you

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:02.070
can make from having to actually
take a gun, go to a bank,

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.105
you might get shot
by the police.

00:22:04.105 --> 00:22:05.480
And the amount of
money you might

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.710
make in one armed robbery you
can make week in and week out

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:14.600
selling heroin to vulnerable
addicts without incurring

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.110
the kind of risk that
armed robbers do have.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.150
Now, interestingly,
armed robbery actually

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.510
sort of went up when the drugs
crisis emerged because everyone

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.830
was trying to--

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.330
all the criminal
world were trying

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.030
to do an armed robbery in
order to get the capital

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:31.475
to invest in selling heroin.

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:35.960
So it's just bad
from all angles.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.210
But what's interesting, as
much as this guy used guns,

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.335
he also talked about fighting
a lot-- like, actual,

00:22:40.335 --> 00:22:41.780
physical fist fighting--

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.240
to solve turf wars and stuff.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:49.250
The next guy was a slightly less
physically imposing, but just

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:50.480
as worrying a guy.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.280
He'd been a very serious
gangster in the '90s.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.790
He'd come up with the
ecstasy generation,

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.310
the early rave scene, made
a lot of money in that,

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:06.150
and then diversified his
portfolio into cocaine, heroin,

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.420
and guns.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.920
And it was very interesting.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.720
What he described
was a process of sort

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.120
of professionalization of this.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.982
As opposed to the sort of
chaotic '70s and '80s world,

00:23:16.982 --> 00:23:18.440
he was like, no,
no, what we did is

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:23.930
we read the biographies of
terrorists and figured out

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:28.520
how to divide our organization
into cellular structures

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.530
so that if one guy got
caught he wouldn't be

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.610
able to rat on the other guys.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.250
And was this very
interesting process

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:39.050
of almost like corporatization,
professionalization.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.540
And the money was phenomenal.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.530
They came up.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.510
But he also said
like, yeah, and if we

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.718
had a problem with the guy,
we took him to the event,

00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:49.460
stuck a gun in his mouth, and
told him not to come back.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.308
Or told him to stop
what he was doing.

00:23:51.308 --> 00:23:53.850
And that was our thing, but I
don't think this guy had ever--

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.225
I know he'd never
been shot and I

00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:57.300
don't think he'd ever
actually shot anybody.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.370
But he the threat--
and people he knew

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.530
had certainly shot other people.

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:09.880
The third person we spoke
to was 16 years old.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.460
And he'd been dealing
drugs since he was 13

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.370
and carrying a knife
since he was 13.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:23.970
He had stopped dealing drugs,
he said, about six months

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.980
before we sat down and talked.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.740
But he had-- yeah,
he had grown up

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.130
in a world where
that was normal.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:37.310
And he described a--

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:42.180
sort of the chaos of the
currency, the monop-- sorry.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.180
The monopolization,
which I described before,

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.910
from the '90s heavy
gangster, had been sort of

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.410
smashed up a bit by the police.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.210
They'd had certain successes.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.580
And what that had led to
is a sort of fragmentation

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.220
of the drug world, where the
guys at the very top are still

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.280
corporate and monopolized,
but the people at the low end,

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.450
this 16-year-old kid, there's
a chaotic element to it,

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.000
which suits--

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.390
it makes it harder for the
police to work to catch.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.640
This kid described one
situation where he had--

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.620
at 15 years old, he'd had
a beef with another couple

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.720
of 15-year-olds.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.068
They'd come looking for him.

00:25:20.068 --> 00:25:21.485
They hadn't been
able to find him,

00:25:21.485 --> 00:25:23.110
so they kicked in
the door of his house

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.190
and slashed his father
across the face with a knife.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.800
15.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.320
This kid, Alex-- the kid,
15-year-old we were talking

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:30.860
to--

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.450
he went to the boss--

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.200
his immediate boss in his
drug dealing organization

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.240
who is in his mid-20s and
said, look, these kids

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.160
have slashed my father
across the face.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.730
I need a gun.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.100
His boss said, you know what?

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.870
I've just sold my last gun.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.500
I've got a hand grenade.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.540
So this 15-year-old kid sat with
the hand grenade in his sock

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:54.788
drawer for six months waiting,
trying to find the other kids.

00:25:54.788 --> 00:25:56.830
He wasn't able to find
them because they were off

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:58.640
doing something called
county lines, which

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.723
Neil is about to describe.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.590
So he eventually sold
the hand grenade off.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.560
What's interesting about this
is what we describe in the book

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.110
is it's a process of
three generations,

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:16.180
that the British drug war is
now in its third generation.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.590
You have the generation
where drugs sort of came up,

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.800
where the armed robbers
became drug dealers.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.820
You have the generation
of monopolization

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.460
and corporatization,
when the money flooded in

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.460
and the drug gangs
became organized and made

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.966
a lot of money.

00:26:33.966 --> 00:26:36.060
And now you have
this third generation

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:40.230
of kids on the street who
have only been socialized

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:45.110
in the norms of the drug war.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.098
And for them, these are
kids like this 16-year-old

00:26:48.098 --> 00:26:48.890
who we interviewed.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:49.890
This is normal.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.150
This is what it is.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.230
It's a process that
gets worse over time.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.260
The arms race that
Neil describes

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.960
experiencing personally,
this is how it plays out

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.832
over a process of decades.

00:27:01.832 --> 00:27:03.290
And what's interesting
is these two

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:08.620
hard gangsters, the guy who'd
been shot three times and the--

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.250
Mr. Gun In The Mouth--

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.080
they looked at the
14, 15-year-olds who

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.770
they knew on the street
now and were like, whoa.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.115
I mean, we did some stuff, but
these kids now, they're crazy.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.970
They're just-- and they looked
on with horror and fear,

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:30.860
like real fear, about what
the process, the arms race

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.630
had produced.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.140
We asked the kid,
the 16-year-old,

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.060
how long would it
take for you right now

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.460
to get us a gun
if we wanted one?

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.500
Said about two hours, maybe an
afternoon, a whole afternoon

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.790
maybe.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.310
We asked the older
guy, the '70s guy,

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:53.240
who had literally been shot
several times, how would

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.430
you have gone about
getting a gun in your day?

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.930
He said, well, what
I would have had

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.080
to have done is go to one
of the older gangsters, one

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.810
of the older heads, and been
like, look, I've got a beef.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.967
I need a gun.

00:28:03.967 --> 00:28:06.050
And they would have said,
you're not having a gun.

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:07.640
If you shoot somebody,
you'll have--

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.807
you'll bring the heat on us.

00:28:08.807 --> 00:28:10.520
You'll bring the
cops down on us.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.080
If you have a
problem with the guy,

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.540
go knock the hell out of each
other a bit and sort it out.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.210
But don't bring the
police involved.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.490
Don't get the police involved.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:25.910
And the way that the older
gangsters talked about the kids

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:30.470
today, it was actually genuinely
terrifying, genuinely chilling.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:36.890
And for a window into this sort
of emerging dystopia of what

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.970
the future holds if we proceed
with the same policies,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:43.050
I'll let Neil jump in.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.300
NEIL WOODS: OK.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.980
So we talked about county lines.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.430
Has everyone heard of
county lines drug dealing?

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.450
So in the UK, county
lines drug dealing

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.700
is the children being involved
in the supply of heroin

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.100
and crack.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.642
It's primarily those two drugs,
but there's some other drugs,

00:28:55.642 --> 00:28:56.170
as well.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.590
And it's basically about--

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.350
it's about expanding monopolies
and the city gangs wanting

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.890
to take over the
businesses of other towns.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.740
So if anyone's watching
this from America,

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.870
it's about the United
Kingdom finally catching up

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.820
with the amount of
children exploited

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.520
in America for drug
dealing, because it's

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.290
a sort of inevitability.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.450
I say it's inevitable,
though, but actually

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:19.850
when I look at county
lines and what's happening,

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.940
that's my fault, because when
I caught the Burger Bar Boys,

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.820
they were adults who were taking
over the drug supply in one

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.260
town from the larger city.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.918
But they were doing
it themselves.

00:29:31.918 --> 00:29:32.710
They were hands on.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:33.910
They were doing the dealing.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.118
They were carrying the money.

00:29:35.118 --> 00:29:37.990
They were stashing the money and
transporting it all themselves.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.730
But successes like mine
and other police successes

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.080
have meant that the
natural strategic response

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.320
to that police success is
to start using children.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.490
And that's what's happened.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.060
It's a logical step.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.490
This is what success looks like.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.160
You see, police are
really, really good

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.435
at catching drug dealers.

00:29:55.435 --> 00:29:58.030
They're brilliant at it.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.100
Across the world they are.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.177
If you give UK police
twice the resources

00:30:02.177 --> 00:30:03.760
they can catch twice
the drug dealers.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.280
It's true.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.260
But police never reduce
the size of the market.

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.120
Never.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.050
You catch a burglar,
burglaries will go down,

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.300
because there's a
limited amount of people

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.352
willing to commit that crime.

00:30:17.352 --> 00:30:19.560
If you catch a drug dealer,
you create an opportunity

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.162
for somebody else.

00:30:21.162 --> 00:30:22.620
And often, you
create the violence,

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.380
because then there's competition
for that opportunity.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.690
And there's nothing that
police can do about that.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.250
So the harder you try,
the worse things get.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.550
So the youth, the children
dealing in county lines,

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:40.280
that's caused by
trying to police drugs.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.660
So we now have--

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.120
we've gone-- we've talked
about the British System

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.520
and heroin being controlled
by the prescription pad.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.100
It's now being controlled
by, as we've heard,

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.230
15-year-olds with hand grenades.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.910
This is the reality
on the streets.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.340
And it can only go
in one direction.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.435
But there's something else I
need to explain to you all.

00:30:59.435 --> 00:31:01.310
Again, for the British
audience, has everyone

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.680
been watching "Line of Duty"
or do you know about it?

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.580
Yeah.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.367
Well, for Americans, it's
a cop show which exposes--

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.700
it's a drama which exposes
corruption, which some people

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.290
think is far fetched.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:15.470
Well, let me tell you, it's
not necessarily far fetched.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:19.200
Certainly not the corruption.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.530
If I go back to [? Cammie's ?]
story in Nottingham,

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:27.990
the person he introduced me to
was a rather vicious guy called

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.380
[? Stets. ?] He interrogated
me with a knife pressed

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.730
into my groin.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.110
It was a terrifying experience.

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:37.050
But he got me closer to the
gangster that I wanted to get.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.480
I didn't actually get
the gangster I wanted.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.740
That took another operation.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.810
But a few months
later, Colin Gunn

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.350
was caught, the head of the
Bestwood Cartel in Northampton.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:51.550
A brilliant operation by
Nottinghamshire police.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.980
But at the time that I was
introduced to that guy,

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.980
[? Stets, ?] two of my
backup team went off sick.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.480
And so two new
police officers were

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.850
brought in that I didn't know.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.740
The first one of those,
I shook his hand.

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:04.760
It was fine.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.740
The second one,
I shook his hand,

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.040
and the hairs went up
at the back of my neck.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.328
Instinctively, everything
about this guy screamed wrong.

00:32:13.328 --> 00:32:14.620
Now, when you've been working--

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.338
at that point, I'd been working
that job for 4 and 1/2 months.

00:32:17.338 --> 00:32:19.130
When you're working
undercover, your senses

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.615
tend to be fairly fine tuned.

00:32:21.615 --> 00:32:23.990
And I was picking up on just
some nuance of body language

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.870
that made me very unhappy.

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.370
So I spoke to the guy running
the operation, and said, boss,

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.470
I cannot have this guy
knowing what I'm doing.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.270
I do not trust him.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.000
So they were both excluded to
save them asking any questions,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.940
and they didn't know
what I did that day.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:40.840
It turns out, when
Colin Gunn was arrested

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:45.140
that this police officer, a
guy called Charlie Fletcher,

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.410
was an employee of Colin Gunn.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.485
Not just a corrupt cop, he'd
been paid to join the police--

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.760
paid to join the police.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.820
By the time I met him, he'd been
in the police for seven years.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.580
He was paid 10,000
pounds a month

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:06.670
on top of his police wages, plus
bonuses for good information.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.230
I was quite shocked.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.360
Even though I'd come across
corruption many times,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.800
it was still unsettling.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:17.290
But senior police said to me,
Woodsy, of course this happens.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.330
We know this happens.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:24.653
With this much money involved,
how can it not happen?

00:33:24.653 --> 00:33:26.820
See, I say that police are
good at catching dealers.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.030
They are.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.640
But by arresting lots
of dealers, what you do

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:35.780
is you thin out the competition
and help the monopolization.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.090
So the gangsters who are
at the top of the tree,

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:40.100
they love the police
taking out the competition

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.390
because their part
of the empire grows.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.080
And where you concentrate
the wealth into fewer hands,

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.810
you make corruption more
possible because there's

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.470
greater wealth to do it.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.760
And let me make something
perfectly clear.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.530
The only form of
criminality that

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.470
can pay for that
level of corruption

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.020
is the illicit drugs market.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.620
There's no other
form of criminality

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.750
that can corrupt our
police and criminal justice

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.720
system like that.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.750
10 billion pounds a year--

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.159
the value of the UK
illicit drugs market.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.409
That's a lot of money that
can corrupt the system.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.724
But it is the mechanism
of policing it

00:34:14.724 --> 00:34:17.420
that creates the monopolies
that allows that corruption

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:17.920
to happen.

00:34:22.831 --> 00:34:24.010
In the book--

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.889
I mean, I've come across
corruption many times--

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:31.719
but in the book, we interviewed
someone called Frank Matthews

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:36.460
who used to be a
supervisor of people

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.429
who went into the witness
protection system.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.760
So the witness protection
system is in itself

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.280
a creation of the drug war.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.710
Because until we
had the drug war,

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.929
witnesses were not too
scared to give evidence.

00:34:50.929 --> 00:34:54.219
But such are the stakes
and the value in the market

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:55.989
that the whole system
is being corrupted.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.790
So if someone wants
to give out evidence

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:01.320
against the leading
gangster in a city,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.040
that gangster has all
the tools that they

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.950
need to try and intimidate
that witness to prevent them

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:07.300
from giving evidence.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.640
So the witness protection
system is born.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.730
So if someone, perhaps
to avoid a chunk of jail

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.730
sentence themselves, is
willing to give evidence

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.310
against an organized
crime group,

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:20.230
they are given a new identity.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.990
They're never allowed to see
their family again or friends.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:24.657
They go to the other
end of the country.

00:35:24.657 --> 00:35:27.070
They're given a new
name and everything.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:31.760
So there are people who
don't exist out there.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.770
But what shocked us is what
Frank Matthews was able to tell

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.440
us-- 'cause he used
to work within that--

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.790
is that even that last defense
against organized crime--

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:44.380
the witness protection system--

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.120
even that is corrupted.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:50.350
We were able to show
that with evidence

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.900
from Frank Matthews in the book.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.310
He was a whistle-blower for
the Metropolitan Police.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.470
Frank is not his real name.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:04.900
He had to have a false
identity himself.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.800
And you know, Frank spent a
career fighting the highest

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.720
echelons of organized crime.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.290
But the first time he felt that
his life was truly in danger

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.590
was when he was crossing
up corrupt cops.

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:21.250
That's when he assumed
there was a hit on his life,

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.200
when he was most at risk.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.210
So I think--

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:31.920
I hope we've established
the cause and effect here.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.930
And I hope we've
established what direction

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.130
this is going in.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:40.320
As each generation goes
on, for every year, decade

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.930
that this drug war is
entrenched in our policy,

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:47.170
it's only going
in one direction.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.960
And if you look
around the world,

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.360
the monopolization effect
doesn't just happen in the UK.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.650
It happens in other
countries as well.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.275
Look at how Mexico--

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.080
the cartels go to
war with each other,

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.390
and then eventually,
someone has dominance,

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.143
and the monopoly takes over.

00:37:06.143 --> 00:37:07.560
The biggest violence
increases are

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.280
when someone's actually caught,
like anywhere in the world.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.750
But in Mexico,
the detection rate

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.150
of murders, the rate
where a murder is solved

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.810
is less than 1%.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.810
And that's because you're
as likely to be killed

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.670
by one of the police
officers as you

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:27.495
are anybody else, because they
tend to work for the cartels.

00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:29.370
The corruption is
spreading across the world.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:33.030
You now have narco states
in West Africa just where

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:38.380
the production, the
transport of drugs happens,

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.900
because they have low economies,
and they are easily corrupted.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.670
This corruption is spreading,
and it is inevitable

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:49.690
until we take control of
drugs by regulating them.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:54.220
So I'm part of an organization,
an international organization

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.437
called the Law Enforcement
Action Partnership.

00:37:57.437 --> 00:37:59.020
It started in the
United States, which

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.603
I think is fair enough because
they lumbered us with this drug

00:38:01.603 --> 00:38:03.430
war in the first place.

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:07.300
In America, we have
prosecutors, chiefs

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.080
of police, lots of former
senior police officers.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.040
In the UK, we have former
chief constables, former MI5,

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.020
lots of other former
undercover cops like me.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.670
And we're growing rapidly.

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:22.690
We've just registered
LEAP Europe and Paris.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:25.870
Last year we launched
LEAP Scandinavia.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.270
And thank you for the
introduction earlier on, Chris.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:30.550
We slightly changed our name
since you introduced us.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.435
We used to be
against prohibition.

00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:34.310
We still are but, we
just have a better name.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.060
So we're the Law Enforcement
Action Partnership.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.800
So anyone watching from
America, please support

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:43.220
LEAP as much as you can.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.730
And in UK, it's much the same.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.910
So I'm going to see now from
JS if I've missed anything,

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.473
or to sum up for us?

00:38:52.473 --> 00:38:56.632
JS RAFAELI: No, I think
let's open up for questions.

00:38:56.632 --> 00:38:57.340
NEIL WOODS: Yeah.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.590
JS RAFAELI: We'll have a chat.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.870
AUDIENCE: Does the political
influence from the US

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.450
that you mentioned that
started this whole demise

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.610
of the British System
after World War II,

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.940
does that still exist today?

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.480
Or is our drug policy
still influenced

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.678
by what the US wants?

00:39:12.678 --> 00:39:13.678
JS RAFAELI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:13.678 --> 00:39:18.430
NEIL WOODS: Yeah,
well the US influence

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:21.910
reached its pinnacle and a
fairly indelible pinnacle

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:24.820
in 1961 with a treaty--

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.520
the United Nations
Conventions on Narcotic Drugs.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.010
And that was a
treaty that everyone

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:31.810
had to sign up to, really.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.390
They'd spent a couple of
decades winning everybody around

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.983
to do that.

00:39:34.983 --> 00:39:37.400
And it's interesting that that
single treaty in the United

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.790
Nations, which forces everyone
to follow the prohibition model

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:45.520
according to the
United States doctrine,

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.290
how it's described in
the United Nations.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:50.090
Drugs are described as evil.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:57.320
It's the only United Nations
treaty which uses that word.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.930
Genocide, they don't
use the word evil.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.240
So genocide's not
evil, but drugs are.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.580
So you can see that even in
the writing of the treaty

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.010
that sort of moral judgment
is written into it.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:11.480
So each individual nation
state is actually quite limited

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.500
according to international
law in how they

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:16.690
shape their own drug policy.

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.310
It actually restricts
innovation now.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.870
But that's starting
to break down.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:22.942
Because in 2001, Portugal--

00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:24.650
which the United
Nations said at the time

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.150
they were breaching the treaty--

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:27.620
Portugal decriminalized drugs.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.820
It's not a perfect system
because organized crime still

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.290
controls the supply,
so they still

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.010
have the same level
of corruption.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.280
But people don't go to
jail for using drugs.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:41.750
And whereas, they used to
have more deaths than us.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.845
Now, whereas, we have
50 deaths per million,

00:40:44.845 --> 00:40:46.470
they now have three
deaths per million.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:49.040
So you can see that a
health-based approach helps.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.380
But there are, of
course, bigger breaches

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.450
of that treaty by the
United States themselves.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:56.510
They have several states
which legally regulated

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.040
cannabis for adult use.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.465
So they've broken the treaty.

00:40:59.465 --> 00:41:01.340
Which really, so it's
the United States which

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.690
has opened the floodgates.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.300
That means everything's
on the table.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.980
The rules have
already been broken.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.290
Canada has just legally
regulated cannabis

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:11.270
for adult use right
across the whole country.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.437
So they've gone even farther
than the United States.

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:15.320
Obviously, Uruguay
does the same.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.330
Switzerland prescribes
heroin like we used to do.

00:41:18.330 --> 00:41:20.450
And as a result, they've
cut burglaries in half

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.500
and saved countless lives.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.510
So there are examples of good
drug policy which is coming--

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:28.940
now, it's almost
like we're starting

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.690
to cast off those shackles
of the United Nations

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:35.914
single convention in 1961.

00:41:35.914 --> 00:41:39.300
AUDIENCE: There's an argument
that the privatization

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.160
of the prison
systems across the US

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.340
has actually resulted in
higher levels of incarceration.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:45.840
Is that a similar
system, you think,

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.930
is now playing out in the UK
as we adopt a similar model?

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:51.750
Do you think that's actually
one of the driving forces

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.216
behind the laws not changing?

00:41:54.216 --> 00:41:56.110
JS RAFAELI: Neil, I
think you should-- yeah.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:58.110
NEIL WOODS: Yeah.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.600
There's a different type of
corruption in America as well.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.080
And that is like--

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.470
so corporate corruption.

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.680
And the influence of
both the financing

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.320
behind private prisons and also,
actually, the prison officers

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.810
unions put great
pressure on politicians

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.790
to not change the drug laws.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:18.570
And the reason for that
is America has only 5%

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:19.860
of the world's population.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:24.510
They have almost a quarter of
the world's prison population.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:28.760
One in three black
families have a male adult,

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.720
a male parent in prison.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.850
I mean, this is
absolutely extraordinary.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.960
From the redeclaration of
the war on drugs from Reagan,

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.000
at that time they had around
200,000 people in prison.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.475
Now they have 2.2 million.

00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:43.100
That's an incredible
increase, and it's

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.930
all about the war on drugs.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.020
And it's made things worse,
because they have the highest

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.920
opioid problem in the world.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.360
They have the
biggest drug deaths.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.500
It's causing carnage.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.625
You know, there is another
cause and effect there.

00:42:54.625 --> 00:42:56.000
So to answer your
question, there

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.950
is a huge political influence
in lobbying in the USA,

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.500
and it is one of the
many stumbling blocks

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.245
to reform in the United States.

00:43:05.245 --> 00:43:06.620
But as to the
question in the UK.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.420
No, we don't have that excuse.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.550
I think our private
prisons have actually

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.590
reduced in the last few years.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.010
There was one closed.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.760
I think there's only
seven, actually.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.790
And, of course, the way that
the system works in the United

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:22.760
Kingdom, there
are limits to what

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.133
financial lobbying can be done.

00:43:24.133 --> 00:43:26.300
So you're not going to have
quite the same influence

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.720
on politicians--
financial influence.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.532
So we don't have the
same excuse, really.

00:43:31.532 --> 00:43:32.990
Our politicians
don't, I would say.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.550
JS RAFAELI: So can
I just jump in?

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.950
There is a absolute
indelible connection

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:45.980
between the war on drugs and not
the prison industrial complex

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.300
that they have in the States.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:51.830
But there is a massive crisis
in UK prisons right now.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:56.210
And it's worth remembering that
over 50% of prisoners in the UK

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:58.250
are there for
drug-related offenses.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.640
So you get occasional
commentators across the media--

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.210
I will not mention names, but--

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:05.210
who say, well, the war
on drugs has never really

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:07.040
been fought in the UK.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:12.170
It's an absurdity, because over
50% of the prison population

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.890
is there, yeah, for
drug-related offenses.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.940
There was a report
just the other day--

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.630
I mean, just two days ago about
a new unit, a special unit that

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.380
has been formed to combat
police officers sneaking drugs

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.520
into prisons.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.842
There's a drug crisis
inside prisons.

00:44:30.842 --> 00:44:32.300
We can't keep drugs
out of prisons.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.220
How are we going to keep
them out of society?

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.450
If you come from the reading
that Neil and I have done,

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.750
you, say, oh, there's a new
unit to combat corruption

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.130
among prison guards.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:46.790
I give it three weeks before
that unit is corrupted, too.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:53.210
So then that is the,
like you said, is--

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:56.750
unique to drugs
prohibition policing

00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.610
is that creating
a market which can

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.500
corrupt the institutions
which are meant

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.630
to combat it on that level.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:06.740
And it's absolutely unique
to the war on drugs.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:10.230
AUDIENCE: Given America
obviously tried prohibition

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.157
with alcohol, and it
failed pretty badly,

00:45:13.157 --> 00:45:15.240
do you have any insight
into why, therefore, there

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.540
was such a drive to try not only
prohibition within the States

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.370
but outside of the
States with drugs?

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.320
Because it seems that
it's an odd lesson

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.060
to take from how they tried
prohibition with alcohol.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.060
JS RAFAELI: Interesting.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.980
The prohibition
of drugs precedes

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.160
prohibition of alcohol.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.860
So the Harrison
Narcotics Tax Act

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:40.130
was 1914, which
is what made drugs

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:44.510
we now consider illegal illegal
inside the United States.

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:50.060
Interestingly-- this
is my geeky historian--

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:54.020
the first American
prohibition regime

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.880
wasn't instituted in
the United States.

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.490
It was instituted
in the Philippines

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:02.420
after the Spanish-American
War when America

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.400
took over the
Philippines, and it

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:10.820
was an extension of that racist
impulse and discourse in the US

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.640
that, ah, well, there are
Asian people doing these drugs.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.170
We have to clamp down on it.

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.960
So it was sort of when we
describe the war on drugs

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.050
as a process of
American imperialism,

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.710
cultural imperialism, and
just imperialist imperialism,

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:30.470
it's actually, if you look
at the history of this

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.770
and how it grew,
it's quite literal.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.080
It was literally a
process of when America

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.900
became an imperial
power and had colonies

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.860
beyond its own borders, it
instituted drug prohibition

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.930
regimes then.

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:47.030
What the campaigners
within the United States,

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:49.820
they tried to institute
it on the world stage,

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.568
internationally before they
banned drugs in America.

00:46:53.568 --> 00:46:55.110
And, of course, the
rest of the world

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.170
went, well, we're
not banning drugs.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:59.960
You don't even ban
drugs inside America.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.990
And it was mainly the
British saying that.

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:03.650
And so the Americans
went, oh, right.

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:07.040
Well, we better prohibit
drugs in America

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.080
so that we can then export
it to the rest of world.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:13.310
And that's the process
by which it happened.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:16.832
So, yeah, no lessons
were learned.

00:47:16.832 --> 00:47:18.040
NEIL WOODS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.850
And another lesson
which, of course,

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:22.070
should have been learned
from alcohol prohibition

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.440
is that actually, there
are various reasons why

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:25.380
it came to an end.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.850
But the most important
reason is the public realized

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:32.000
just how much it was
corrupting the police.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.813
So you hear that Eliot
Ness and The Untouchables.

00:47:35.813 --> 00:47:37.730
The reason that he was
called The Untouchables

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:38.988
because the press mocked him.

00:47:38.988 --> 00:47:40.530
Because he did an
interview and said,

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:42.240
well, my team are untouchable.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.020
So the press had their full
front pages the next day

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.680
saying, finally, we found some
cops which are untouchable.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.360
So that there's only 12 of them.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.348
And that's how he
got the nickname.

00:47:53.348 --> 00:47:55.390
And it was that knowledge
of the corruption, what

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.390
it was doing to the system
which actually turned

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:58.850
public opinion against it.

00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:01.880
Which is why it's so
important to realize

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.248
just the level of corruption.

00:48:03.248 --> 00:48:04.790
And, of course, it's
really difficult

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:07.550
to highlight the corruption
because the Home Office

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:12.143
instructs chief constables to
maintain public confidence.

00:48:12.143 --> 00:48:13.310
Of course, that's important.

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:15.110
If you lose confidence
in the police then

00:48:15.110 --> 00:48:18.180
the fabric of society could
break down, et cetera.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.660
Well, I've got news
for you, Home Office.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.970
The fabric of society
is breaking down,

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.050
and people are losing confidence
because we're not being honest,

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.010
and we're not actually dealing
with the problems that exist.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.590
So yeah, please,
please, wish more people

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.366
and studied what happened
in the 1920s in America.

00:48:35.366 --> 00:48:37.970
AUDIENCE: If you had
a magic wand, what

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.288
would be your first
policy, and what

00:48:40.288 --> 00:48:42.080
do you think would have
the biggest impact?

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.915
NEIL WOODS: Oh,
well, that's easy.

00:48:43.915 --> 00:48:46.755
And it's easy for all reasons
because it's already legal.

00:48:46.755 --> 00:48:47.880
The policy's already there.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.300
I wouldn't have to change
any law whatsoever.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.080
You prescribe heroin liberally
to those people that need it.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.050
So you go back to
the British System.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:01.610
You do that, overnight, 80%
of the market for county lines

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.620
drug dealing by
children exploited

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.190
would disappear completely,
because that's mostly

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.130
about heroin.

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.560
The crime, the hard
core of those people

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.170
who are having a problem
with heroin commit,

00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:16.970
disappears overnight.

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.590
Shoplifting stops.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:20.670
It sounds easy.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:21.300
Well it is.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.950
It's in our history.

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:23.900
It's there.

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.860
OK, OK, it's a bigger
scale problem now.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.490
We're talking
200,000-plus people.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:32.400
But if you've got to start
taking care of people,

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:38.520
not everybody would need to
keep on a heroin prescription.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.380
Many people would have
found the stability

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.272
in their life to move on to
then another kind of treatment.

00:49:43.272 --> 00:49:44.730
But if you invest
in the treatment,

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:49.760
even a fraction of what is spent
on law enforcement, a fraction,

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.890
you would tackle the problem
that law enforcement cannot do.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:56.320
And taking care of people's
cheaper than treating them

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.460
as criminals, significantly.

00:49:58.460 --> 00:49:59.860
So that's the
first thing I'd do.

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.900
Then you can start breaking
all the other drugs

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.560
into the individual regulatory
needs that those drugs have,

00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.990
because they do have
different regulatory needs.

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:12.010
Cannabis, you have to decide
what strength product, what

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.316
type of product can be
sold to whom and where,

00:50:14.316 --> 00:50:16.060
and where can it be used?

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.740
It's much like alcohol, really.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:20.530
But we can do better than we
did with alcohol because we can

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.838
ban advertising straight away.

00:50:22.838 --> 00:50:24.880
We can take out those kind
of commercial elements

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.490
and base it on a
health-based approach.

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:30.970
For MDMA, for
example, MDMA is not

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.580
prohibited because
it's dangerous.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:36.070
It's dangerous because
it is prohibited.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:38.320
People are dying because
that's a unregulated product.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.050
You pick any death
over the last few years

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:42.760
and look at what's caused it.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.720
It's been caused because it
wasn't MDMA that they bought

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.010
or it's four times too strong.

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.980
Regulation will save
lives and reduce harm.

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:54.680
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what's MDMA?

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.990
NEIL WOODS: MDMA's ecstasy.

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:57.706
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:57.706 --> 00:50:59.440
NEIL WOODS: You know,
in British summer,

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:05.110
there might be a million people
dancing in a field on MDMA.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:06.790
Are they deviant,
or do they just

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:09.220
like to dance in a
field with the help

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.488
of a certain stimulant?

00:51:11.488 --> 00:51:13.030
And if you agree
with me, then you're

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:14.320
part of the social movement.

00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.780
And please, start passing
on this information

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.840
to other people, because
that's how we win.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:22.430
We speak to a lot of politicians
between us a great deal.

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.940
And it's good to try to
influence politicians.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.860
You're more important,
because you're

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:29.155
part of a social movement.

00:51:29.155 --> 00:51:33.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so given the
relaxation of the US policy

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.360
with regards to
marijuana, what do

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.800
you see as the biggest obstacle
internally to changes that you

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.200
described in UK drug policy?

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.690
NEIL WOODS: The biggest
obstacles in the UK.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:48.407
Oh there's a few.

00:51:48.407 --> 00:51:50.740
JS RAFAELI: It's a really
interesting, complex question,

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.680
because it's really
multifaceted, isn't it?

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.507
I mean, inertia would
be a massive one.

00:51:56.507 --> 00:51:58.840
NEIL WOODS: Is there a argument
that actually journalism

00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.410
is the biggest--

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:01.160
JS RAFAELI: Well, I
was going to say that.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.750
But, yeah, yeah, my profession
are a massive problem.

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:06.440
Massive problem.

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.630
I read out some quotes
before of these racist quotes

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:13.780
from the early 20th
century in the US.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.440
And everyone in the
room just winced.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.715
[GASPS] And I've done
these events before,

00:52:18.715 --> 00:52:20.590
and I've done much
further, and I've read out

00:52:20.590 --> 00:52:22.060
quote after quote after quote.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:27.700
And there's this cringe that
people, go, uh, people actually

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.210
wrote that.

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:31.180
Uh.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.150
Addressing my
profession, the members

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.100
of the media, journalists
and editors who

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:38.980
are writing today right now.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:42.890
In 25 years, maybe
sooner, maybe 10 years,

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:48.510
we will look back on how drug
users are described today

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:52.930
with the same cringe
that we, today, look back

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:55.900
at the racist language used
to describe drug users,

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:58.420
and people who didn't use
drugs, just ethnic minorities,

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:00.380
in the early 20th century.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:04.670
And I warn journalists, and
I warn editors of that a lot.

00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:07.680
When people talk
about spice zombies

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.840
it's the dehumanization
of people

00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:14.920
who use drugs in the media,
especially the tabloid media.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:19.250
It's a huge toxic problem.

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:22.240
And the tabloid media
has a particular--

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.850
because of the media
landscape in the UK--

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:25.990
it's particularly strong.

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:27.640
It has a particular weight here.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.940
And politicians are particularly
scared of crossing it.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.210
Politicians are trailing
public opinion at this point.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:37.570
But the media has a
huge toxic role in it.

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.450
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
organized crime is successfully

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:44.240
lobbying through corruption
to resist reform?

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.070
Like, are they, you know,
corrupting or pouring money

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:51.150
into resisting this
societal change?

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:54.940
NEIL WOODS: I would
say that's inevitable

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.460
because at the very highest
echelons of organized crime

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:01.900
and international cartels there
is a very thin and blurry line

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:08.380
between genuine business and
the money for the drugs markets,

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:11.960
because the drugs markets'
money makes the world go round.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.300
You only have to look
at the scandal with HSBC

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.090
a few years ago.

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:19.840
They were seen to be laundering
huge amounts of money

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.610
from the illicit drugs market.

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:25.790
And no one was prosecuted.

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:27.920
It wasn't even
seriously considered.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:32.100
So there is an obvious
interconnection

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.390
where money meets money
at the top of the pyramid.

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:37.298
But what I would say
is as we move forward.

00:54:37.298 --> 00:54:39.840
And we will move forward because
there is lots of innovations

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.400
happening across the world.

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.930
That influence will
become stronger

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.560
because where big
business of any kind

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:50.490
finds itself threatened, whether
it's the oil lobby in America,

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:54.040
paying politicians, the same
kind of thing will happen.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.425
And it will be very difficult
to spot, I would say.

00:54:58.425 --> 00:55:02.940
JS RAFAELI: Yeah, I mean,
I've spoken to drug dealers.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.512
And I've explained
my position on it.

00:55:04.512 --> 00:55:06.720
And they say, expletive,
expletive, expletive, you're

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:09.810
going to do me out of a job.

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:12.990
The drug dealers on a big
scale, high-level gangsters,

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:16.077
are far more scared
of the reform movement

00:55:16.077 --> 00:55:17.160
than they are of the cops.

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.285
NEIL WOODS: Mm, absolutely.

00:55:18.285 --> 00:55:20.250
JS RAFAELI: We will
do much more damage

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:24.705
to murderous, bloody
cartels across Latin America

00:55:24.705 --> 00:55:25.830
than the police there will.

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:26.455
NEIL WOODS: Mm.

00:55:26.455 --> 00:55:28.080
JS RAFAELI: It's much
more of a threat.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:28.788
NEIL WOODS: Yeah.

00:55:28.788 --> 00:55:32.480
JS RAFAELI: Because
we're not pro-cartel.

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:33.510
They do bad things.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:34.710
They're awful.

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:37.977
The threat to them is
through a regulated model,

00:55:37.977 --> 00:55:39.810
not through continuing
a failed system which

00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:43.170
is going to create even
more dystopian outcomes 20

00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:44.072
years down the line.

00:55:44.072 --> 00:55:45.780
SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for coming in.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.920
JS RAFAELI: Thank you.

00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.820
Thanks, thanks.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:50.870
