00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:09.410
 
when you look at the historical

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420
when you look at the historical
 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.830
when you look at the historical
experience of african-americans in the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840
experience of african-americans in the
 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.279
experience of african-americans in the
United States you have to start with the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
United States you have to start with the
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.240
United States you have to start with the
experience of slavery and the vestiges

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
experience of slavery and the vestiges
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.670
experience of slavery and the vestiges
of slavery in terms of the Trump the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
of slavery in terms of the Trump the
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.040
of slavery in terms of the Trump the
trauma associated with it and I think

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
trauma associated with it and I think
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.849
trauma associated with it and I think
that you know blacks continue to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
that you know blacks continue to
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.510
that you know blacks continue to
experience trauma in certain ways and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
experience trauma in certain ways and
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.049
experience trauma in certain ways and
certainly with respect to those who live

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
certainly with respect to those who live
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.750
certainly with respect to those who live
in urban communities that are sort of

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
in urban communities that are sort of
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.930
in urban communities that are sort of
infested with drugs or that are

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
infested with drugs or that are
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.360
infested with drugs or that are
particularly violent those are traumatic

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
particularly violent those are traumatic
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.970
particularly violent those are traumatic
situations that they experience on a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
situations that they experience on a
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.110
situations that they experience on a
daily basis certainly as we seen in in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
daily basis certainly as we seen in in
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.959
daily basis certainly as we seen in in
recent events interactions with the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
recent events interactions with the
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.720
recent events interactions with the
police can be again particularly

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
police can be again particularly
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.170
police can be again particularly
traumatic so when you talk about mental

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
traumatic so when you talk about mental
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240
traumatic so when you talk about mental
illness and a black community I think

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
illness and a black community I think
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.780
illness and a black community I think
you have to begin with the experience of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
you have to begin with the experience of
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.200
you have to begin with the experience of
trauma and how trauma continues to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
trauma and how trauma continues to
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.070
trauma and how trauma continues to
abound in and their experiences and in

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
abound in and their experiences and in
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.340
abound in and their experiences and in
their daily lives I think that what

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
their daily lives I think that what
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.649
their daily lives I think that what
happens for a lot of individuals is that

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
happens for a lot of individuals is that
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.690
happens for a lot of individuals is that
they suffer in silence with respect to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
they suffer in silence with respect to
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.800
they suffer in silence with respect to
having a mental illness and so what I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
having a mental illness and so what I
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.830
having a mental illness and so what I
mean by that in the greater society

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
mean by that in the greater society
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.749
mean by that in the greater society
there's certainly a lot of stigma

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
there's certainly a lot of stigma
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.160
there's certainly a lot of stigma
associated with mental illness it's sort

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170
associated with mental illness it's sort
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.039
associated with mental illness it's sort
of antithetical to the American ethic

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
of antithetical to the American ethic
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.530
of antithetical to the American ethic
which is to you know be strong and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
which is to you know be strong and
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.450
which is to you know be strong and
courageous to pull yourself up by the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
courageous to pull yourself up by the
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.350
courageous to pull yourself up by the
bootstraps to weather the storm etc I

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
bootstraps to weather the storm etc I
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.359
bootstraps to weather the storm etc I
think the second part of that you know

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
think the second part of that you know
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940
think the second part of that you know
point is what's happening at the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
point is what's happening at the
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.399
point is what's happening at the
community level or the society level and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
community level or the society level and
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.010
community level or the society level and
I think what happens is that within the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
I think what happens is that within the
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.819
I think what happens is that within the
black community I think that again you

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
black community I think that again you
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.300
black community I think that again you

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.749
know that ethic about what it means to
be strong and courageous is particularly

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
be strong and courageous is particularly
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.320
be strong and courageous is particularly
pronounced because

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330
pronounced because
 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.559
pronounced because
of trying to you know combat those

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569
of trying to you know combat those
 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.800
of trying to you know combat those
forces like discrimination or racism and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
forces like discrimination or racism and
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.030
forces like discrimination or racism and
you know it's just adds to the burden of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
you know it's just adds to the burden of
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.050
you know it's just adds to the burden of

signs and presentations of mental
 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.259
signs and presentations of mental
illness but I think that the church

illness but I think that the church
 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.330
illness but I think that the church
could be sort of a triage unit if you

believe that culturally competent care
 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.029
believe that culturally competent care
is critical to everything if patients

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039

perceive that providers are inauthentic
 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.800
perceive that providers are inauthentic
and do not care about their unique

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810
and do not care about their unique
 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.019
and do not care about their unique
circumstances then they're likely to be

circumstances then they're likely to be
 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.570
circumstances then they're likely to be
turned off at a baseline providers

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580
turned off at a baseline providers
 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.200
turned off at a baseline providers
should understand their the history of

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210

should understand their the history of
their neighborhoods for example or the

history of the experience of of
 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.159
history of the experience of of
african-americans and Latinos such that

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169
african-americans and Latinos such that

african-americans and Latinos such that
they can put the clinical presentation

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440
they can put the clinical presentation
 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.269
they can put the clinical presentation
into context and understand what unique

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:10.279
into context and understand what unique
 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.980
into context and understand what unique
factors are in play with respect to the

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990
factors are in play with respect to the
 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.320
factors are in play with respect to the
clinical presentation and how that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330
clinical presentation and how that
 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.870

person is seeking to you know survive

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880
person is seeking to you know survive
 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.810
person is seeking to you know survive
and live in the world as an African

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820
and live in the world as an African
 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.990
and live in the world as an African
American or Latino and so I think that

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000
American or Latino and so I think that
 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.350
American or Latino and so I think that

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360
it's the onus is on the provider to
 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.110
it's the onus is on the provider to
understand that context and to

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120
understand that context and to
 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.100
understand that context and to
understand what it means for that person

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110
understand what it means for that person
 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.080
understand what it means for that person
to live and

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090
to live and
 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.660
to live and
