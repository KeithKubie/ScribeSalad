00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.389
There are a couple of things that are very interesting about Harvard. One of them is that the students here are truly fantastic. 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.789
You can never tell what the source of innovation

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.870
will be from someone at Harvard.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.439
It could come from medicine, it could come from the sciences, it could come from politics, it can come from nearly any direction.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.199
The objective here is to try to put together 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.320
a system in which

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.060
smart kids come in

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.600
and they actually learn how to be independent scientists. We've developed a style in the group in which-

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.000
I describe it by saying that they don't
work for me: I work for them.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.010
The whole idea of
professional schools is a uniquely Harvard idea.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.530
It started with preachers training preachers to be preachers. It ended with businesspeople teaching businesspeople to be businesspeople. 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.480
With lawyers and doctors in the middle. The real product of the group

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.950
is the students. They see the world as it is and and they want to change it into what they hope it will be. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.580
What they can do is just

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.080
staggering. It's really astonishing. If you look at the history of Harvard, 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.110
you're looking at the history of innovation.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.910
My name is Radhika and I'm a professor
of computer science at Harvard. All throughout 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.980
nature we see the power of groups. 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.729
Bees, cells, ants, fish, even humans.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.260
A single termite is tiny and weak.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.270
But a colony of termites can construct
amazing structures that are skyscrapers

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.790
to themselves and

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.930
no one is in charge. Each of the termites
does their part and somehow together

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.830
they're all able to do the right thing.
Technologically we can apply the same

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.930
principle.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.690
So we can design very simple small robots
that can cooperate to achieve complicated

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.390
tasks like build structures that we
need in the environment. This research is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.970
really exciting.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.970
Ask anyone in the group!

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.379
Something in our body called telomeres

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.969
is what helps ourselves to regenerate and heal. But as

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.510
telomeres become weaker

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.739
deterioration begins. Aging. My housemaster just published a study. It shows that

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.579
by increasing the levels of a certain enzyme

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.259
telomeres stay healthier.

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:33.259
This has actually reversed the symptoms of aging.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.629
This project has eternal benefits.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:55.799
Just over a decade ago I myself
was an undergraduate at the college

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.759
quite wary of taking a course called CS50. Fast forward to 2011 and I'm somehow at the helm of that same course. For the first time this fall in Fall 2010, the number one reason for taking CS50 among our five hundred students was

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.539
simply as an elective. It isn't just applicable to those  who want to pursue a 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:14.759
computer sciences vocation but rather
students go off into the sciences, to the 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.979
social sciences, even to the humanities.
So we try particularly hard in computer

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:23.209
science to make sure that on day one
they can in fact step into the classroom

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.680
and then three months later step out
having succeeded in that new field. 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.149
And exit,

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:33.169
even from these introductory courses whether
in computer science, physical sciences or beyond,

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.399
and then return to their own fields, return to their own

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:41.349
concentrations and use some of those new ideas, those new skills. For instance, programming

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.349
skills and savvy to tackle new
and unfamiliar problems in their own domain.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.169
We have a tremendous ability to solve the
world's health problems. The mission of

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:00.489
the FXB center

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.650
is to promote their welfare and
well-being

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.059
of children the most difficult
circumstances worldwide. Health care in

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:12.619
general has been reactive in the past. Someone's sick and we react to that and try to make them better.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.299
We're trying to anticipate treatment

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.539
before it's needed and ideally prevent the need. What we're trying to do is to create material systems

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.919
of small pieces of plastic that we can place in the body and move all the biology that is now done in a lab into the human body.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.319
So this is an enormous advance. Now instead of studying things in animals, we

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.880
animals we can study the right cell

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.349
in the right organisms. The real challenge of our generation and of the next century

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.180
is how

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.150
to get those things to the people that need them.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.360
Global health now is recognized as a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.110
crucial input to

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.729
world survival. Harvard not only has the
intellectual power across the university

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.120
but we also have the glue

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.930
that helps to connect

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.279
the various parts of the

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:04.080
university that can use that intellectual power much more collaborative and

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.909
interactive way.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.970
As the first private college in the new world

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.550
Harvard is responsible for the first intercollegiate  athletic event, the creation of the

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.680
first automatic digital computer

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.990
the first urban superintendents program,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.430
the first baseball catcher's mask, the first theory of presidential power,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.610
the first introduction of insulin into the United States, the first university law

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.259
school in the United States. Some of the first breakthroughs in the

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.439
understanding of AIDS, the first iron lung. You know, this could go on for quite some time.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.340
The first nonsectarian of theological
school in the country. The first MBA.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.330
The first external pacemaker.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.009
The first designated driver campaign in
the US and the first artificial skin.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:09.500
The first successful kidney transplant. The first executive education program.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.430
The first to discover that deer ticks carry lyme disease. The first use of case method.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.009
The first university school of dentistry.

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:24.690
As a member of the Harvard community

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.740
feel free to add to the list.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.740
You won't be the first. You won't be the last.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.199
We call it "Vertigrow." Vertigrow is a vertical gardening device that allows families to 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.460
grow food on the walls

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.219
of their homes and on their roofs.

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.419
We thought that with Vertigrow we could design 
design a structure that would conserve

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:52.020
water that could actually reinforce unstable
housing structures and maximize growing

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.490
space. The bottom line is that Vertigrow solves two major problems:

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.159
rapid urbanization

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:03.780
and malnutrition.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.069
My job is about creating an environment. I create an environment for innovation. To create an environment where ideas are celebrated.

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:14.189
One the biggest challenges i have a
uh... as a professor here: it's taking that straight-A student and pulling them outside the box.

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:19.539
I mean, they were raised in the classroom. They get straight A's. And then you put them in the lab

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.479
and you're asking them to tear apart everything they know, everything about their safe zone.

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:29.719
I know the demographic from eighteen
to thirty years of age. I know them on the battlefield and I know them in the laboratory. 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.730
In both situations they're trying to push and achieve something extraordinary.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.899
I have seen what they can do in these environments. I know what they are capable of, and I know there's no limit.

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:41.979
Innovators don't follow the rules. The rules are for the herd.

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:43.529
At Harvard, we're trying to train people not to be scientists and engineers, but to be 

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.869
leader scientists and engineers.

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.759
They're in front.

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:54.139
And there's no substitute for the kinds of work that I have to do

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:57.379
 to build resources, to build a team, and encourage people to think outside the box, outside their comfort zone.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.850
I'm into history. And I'm into technology.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.930
Because countless books have recently digitized, we have a

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.430
digital fossil record of human culture. So
we developed a way to make it searchable

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.080
and we called it "culturomics". Computer-aided analysis can yield undiscovered

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.030
trends in history, culture, language and
thought. This tool is easy to use, and it's available to everyone.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.800
It's a new way to look at the past and a great

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.100
way to learn new questions. And that's what I'm doing at Harvard.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:39.160
Me too.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.510
One of the world's most famous
archaeological sites is the Giza plateau.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.060
Today the artifacts are scattered
museums all over the world so we are

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.850
building realtime interactive 3D
model of the entire site.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.890
Enter a decorated tomb chapel.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.550
Descend down a burial shaft

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.350
to view the sarcophagus,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.630
five thousand-year-old wall reliefs, paintings, inscriptions come to life

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.370
in a 3D environment based on sound
archaeology

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.500
and linked to the original archival records.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.480
As a teaching tool it breaks new ground

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.830
As a research tool

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.670
it allows us to pose new questions we
could never have asked before.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.770
It gives us a perspective on Giza
that no one has had

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:27.770
for nearly five thousand years.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.910
Worldwide

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.770
twenty five percent of kids grow up without
electricity.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.600
In africa ninety five percent of
people have to go without.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.000
In my engineering class we made a unique soccer ball.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.150
We put an inductive coil inside.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.080
So playing with the ball generates energy which is captured by charging LEDs and batteries.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.850
Just fifteen minutes of play can provide three hours of light.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.120
So no matter who's playing

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:04.120
everybody wins.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.810
My team lives at the intersection of art and science. We're using innovative technology  to

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.589
preserve

00:10:10.589 --> 00:10:15.469
medieval illumniated manuscripts,
antiquarian maps, rare illustrations and

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:20.279
over eight million vulnerable and aging photographs. It's all part of special

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:23.620
collections of the Harvard library and it's going to be around forever because that's what I'm doing at Harvard.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.230
I'm Diane Paulus. I am the artistic director at the American Reparatory Theater. 

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.140
So often at the theater we think theater is an auditorium. You come, you sit in a chair and it's bolted to the

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.660
 floor. The lights go down. You're quiet. You watch a play. When it's over

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.000
the usher asks you to leave. You know, we think,  that's what theater is. But no, actually we have to request ion it, redefine it, change it.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:54.060
And people think change is scary and think, I want to see the

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.080
Shakespeare play the way I want to see it. But I am convinced that

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.770
if Shakespeare was alive today he'd be playing with

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.780
technologies, language, Twitter, you know...
are you kidding?

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.040
he'd be all over that. You know, my mission
here at the ART is if I can make every undergraduate

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.750
that comes through Harvard experience a transformative experience in

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.160
theater,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:23.160
I am making them understand the necessity
in value of the arts.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.279
We are developing

00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:33.389
new sources of hydroelectric energy.
We are improving dental health worldwide.

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:38.520
We are repairing the cells that cause infectious diseases.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.540
We are teaching bacteria to digest toxic gas.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.830
We're launching the careers for the next generation of journalists.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:52.830
We're developing new multimedia approaches to historical research and curation.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.960
We carry out economic analyses of environmental policies.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.649
We're studying deep brain stimulation to

00:12:00.649 --> 00:12:04.060
cure Parkinson's. We're interested in the
mobility of cultures.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.800
We're finding a way to restore lost brain cells.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.030
We're using documentary film to eliminate
social injustice.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.220
We are teaching over thirty African languages and impacting the future of the continent.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.360
We are harvesting the power of the sun to create cleaner and more affordable energy.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:27.610
We are changing the art of performance.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.580
We're discovering life from the depths
of the oceans to the edge of the

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.300
universe.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.530
We're using dance to improve health care
in the inner city. We are using computer-generated light to

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.480
restore modern masterpieces.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.060
We are using complex mathematics build more profound architecture. We are reinventing

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.900
television.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.319
We're developing a turbine

00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:50.520
on the ocean floor.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.480
We are working on the development of new materials and new technologies based on biological strategies.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.070
We are studying how lasers altered properties of matter.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.160
We're working on a wireless network of sensors to coordinate maritime trade.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.900
We are developing the leaders who will transform public education in America.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.079
For every discipline

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:19.079
For every school.
