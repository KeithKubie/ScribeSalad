♪♪

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.334
Narrator: THE CAN IS
FULL OF COMPRESSED GAS.

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:09.200
UNDER PRESSURE, IT'S LIQUID.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.133
HIT THE NOZZLE,
AND IT SPRAYS OUT AS A GAS.

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:17.534
BUT WHAT ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL
FOR COMBUSTION CATASTROPHE?

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:22.634
TO FIND OUT, FIRST,
A FLAMMABILITY TEST.

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:23.868
SAFETY IS OFF.

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:25.400
Allie: PLAYING THE ROLE
OF OUR IGNITION SOURCE

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.667
WILL BE THIS HERE LIGHTER,

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.767
WHICH WILL BE LIT
FROM A SAFE DISTANCE

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.434
BY OUR HANDY-DANDY
INCINERATOR 8000

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.467
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
TRY NOT TO LOSE AN EYEBROW.

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:37.667
HEY.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.200
IT'S TIME FOR US TO HAVE A TALK.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.234
I KNOW I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU
NOT TO TRY THIS AT HOME,

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:43.133
BUT THIS STORY INVOLVES
A PAPER SHREDDER

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.734
AND CANNED AIR, TWO THINGS
YOU FIND IN A LOT OF HOUSEHOLDS,

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:50.100
SO LET ME ADD ONE MORE BIT
OF DISCOURAGEMENT TO THIS MIX,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.167
AND THAT IS THE PROPELLANT
OF THIS CAN.

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:53.767
IT'S GREAT FOR OUR OZONE.

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:59.934
IT DOESN'T DEPLETE IT, BUT WHEN
YOU SET THAT PROPELLANT ON FIRE,

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:05.067
IT CREATES A COUPLE OF
REALLY POISONOUS COMPOUNDS,

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:08.033
SO PLEASE DON'T
TRY THIS AT HOME.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.834
Narrator: WITH EVERYONE
SAFELY IN POSITION,

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.067
IT'S TIME FOR IGNITION.

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:15.834
THIS IS CANNED-AIR
FLAMMABILITY TEST

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:18.567
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:24.067
DID THIS LIGHT?

00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:26.467
Narrator:
BUT THERE'S NO LIFTOFF.

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:27.934
-NOTHING!
-NADA.

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:29.067
OH, MAN.

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:31.234
OH, IT'S JUST PUTTING
THE FLAME OUT.

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:32.834
TRY IT AGAIN.
TRY IT AGAIN.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:36.033
Narrator:
YEP, THE LIQUID PROPELLANT
IS VAPORIZING INTO GAS.

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:40.033
THE AIR IS JUST PUTTING
THE FLAME OUT.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:44.067
Narrator: BUT TEAM SHREDDER HAS
AN IDEA TO ALTER THE MIX.

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:45.501
MAYBE IF WE FLIP IT
UPSIDE DOWN,

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.334
THEN IT WILL GET
A BETTER RESULT?

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:48.534
-OKAY, LET'S DO IT.
-YEAH.

00:01:48.534 --> 00:01:50.000
WE'LL TRY IT.
LET'S GO TRY THAT.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.634
TIME TO FLIP THIS
CAN UPSIDE DOWN.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.100
OH!

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.701
Narrator: THE THEORY IS THAT
GRAVITY WILL PUSH MORE LIQUID

00:01:57.701 --> 00:02:03.000
DOWN THROUGH THE NOZZLE,
ADDING MORE FUEL TO THE FIRE.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.133
OKAY, THIS IS CANNED-AIR
FLAMMABILITY TEST,

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:10.567
UPSIDE-DOWN CAN,
IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:17.033
-OH!
-THERE!!

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:21.534
♪♪

00:02:21.534 --> 00:02:24.701
-THERE WE GO!
-DO IT AGAIN!

00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:26.801
WHOA!
AGAIN!

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:28.434
-THAT IS SO COOL!
-THAT IS REALLY COOL.

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:30.133
YEAH.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.033
THAT WAS AWESOME.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.501
SO CANNED AIR
IS FLAMMABLE.

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:39.267
-UPSIDE DOWN.
-UPSIDE DOWN.

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:41.400
-WOW.
-NICE.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.534
Narrator: SO BY INTENTIONALLY
MISUSING THEIR BUST OFF,

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:46.634
THE TEAM
HAS THE DESIRED OUTCOME.
