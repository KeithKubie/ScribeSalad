The adoption program has three
co-dependent components.

00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:10.686
EHR certification specifies
the minimal acceptable EHR

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:14.890
capabilities that vendors must provide.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.010
So it's the vendors of the EHRs
who obtain EHR certification.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.750
Meaningful use specifies
the minimal provider

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.490
usage of a certified EHR in order
to qualify for incentive payments.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.670
And of course the incentive
payments themself are specified and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.260
come from either the Medicare program or
the Medicaid program to hospitals and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.580
eligible providers, but
they can't be paid by both programs.
