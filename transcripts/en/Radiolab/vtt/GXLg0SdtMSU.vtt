1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.540
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad here with Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.353
Cyclo thank you.

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.970
This hour we're trying on a way of looking at the world that has nothing to do

4
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:12.600
with presidents or queens or mayors and everything to do with ants in science.

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.970
This is an idea called emergence. How many,

6
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:18.950
many stupid things can add up to something very smart like a colony or in our

7
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.070
case, a city. Now, speaking of us, it's,

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.880
it is often and was often assumed that [inaudible] is a bad thing,

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.170
a very dangerous thing.

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.770
And this was especially the case in the late 19th century, early 20th,

11
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.620
which is our next stop. It was a time when throughout Europe,

12
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:36.400
hostile irrational crowds were everywhere in the streets.

13
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.070
You really see this enormous backlash in large part in reaction to, uh,

14
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.710
the rise of democracy. This is James Sheer Wiki author of the book,

15
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.820
the wisdom of crowds.

16
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.730
And he's talking about the people on the other end of the riots,

17
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.000
the intellectual elite. Look at people like Thomas Carlyle, Gustava, Bong,

18
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.080
France, Nicha. Obviously for all these people,

19
00:00:56.081 --> 00:00:59.470
crowds were really the epitome of irrationality institutes

20
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.950
<v 1>[inaudible] but that was about to change [inaudible] he tells this story of a</v>

21
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:10.020
guy named Sir Francis Galton. Yeah,

22
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.230
I'm sure Francis Gauld and who was this sort of famous British scientist and is

23
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:16.650
actually a most famous because he was the founder of what we now know as

24
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.550
eugenics. Oh, is that so, yeah, he's sort of a notorious elitist.

25
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.590
And what's funny is that this is a story about him finding the opposite of,

26
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.670
of his basic assumptions to be true.

27
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.040
Story goes on a nice fall day in 1906 Sir Francis Galton,

28
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.590
the guy who truly believed that only the better classes should be allowed to

29
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:36.840
vote rule or even have children.

30
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.900
He decides to spend the day in the country.

31
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.540
<v 2>Ladies and gentlemen, step right this way.</v>

32
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.150
[inaudible] county fair right over here.

33
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.880
Now this is going to be quite an experience for you young man.

34
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.920
<v 1>The thing that caught Golden's attention that day was a competition involving</v>

35
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.150
and ox.

36
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.140
<v 2>When you write it on this way,</v>

37
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:57.660
you might want to avoid that unfortunate property right there. And I didn't

38
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.970
really know. What I want you to do please,

39
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.780
is I want you to examine this very fat ox [inaudible] touch the opposite.

40
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.630
What we do is we look at the ox and we weigh it in our mind.

41
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.993
Yes.

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.870
<v 1>You know, the group was, was, was a really diverse crowd. Family members,</v>

43
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:22.370
local merchants, most of whom were not experts at all in weighing oxen,

44
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.250
<v 2>young lady, you know how to weigh a package,</v>

45
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:28.480
don't you give [inaudible] I carry luggage sometimes that can weigh a package.

46
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:32.130
Then you can weigh an ox. Here's how you do it. You take a, I don't know, uh,

47
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.140
a couple of packages and put them in your head and say, well,

48
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:40.141
this all seems to be about 70 packages to multiply the weight of a package by 76

49
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.470
<v 1>pants. And they would, you know,</v>

50
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:46.100
make their guests in the people that had the best guesses, woodwind prizes,

51
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.850
<v 2>large cash prize.</v>

52
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.110
<v 1>So quite a few people. Yes.</v>

53
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.920
There's something like 800 paper [inaudible] 800 and while none of those 800 or

54
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:57.820
so people guessed the exact weight of the ox prizes were awarded,

55
00:02:57.821 --> 00:02:58.690
people went home,

56
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.010
but the ever inquisitive Sir Francis Hung around after the contest was over,

57
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.030
<v 2>excuse me, gotten went up to the organizers. Would you mind Kelly and said,</v>

58
00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:12.050
can I have the guesses if I take possession of all 787 ticket,

59
00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:14.720
you know the slips they had written the guesses on all right, you can have them.

60
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:17.600
I suppose. I don't see anything wrong with that, but why?

61
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.610
Because I'm wondering something

62
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.770
<v 1>Caesar. Francis figured these common people wouldn't have a clue.</v>

63
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.530
Most of them were overwhelmingly uninformed.

64
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.550
An expert in bovine matters and he just assumed that if you added up a lot of

65
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:35.230
uninformed on expert individual opinions, you'd get a very uninformed,

66
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.800
an expert group opinion. That's what he was counting on.

67
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.350
One of the things he did was he just calculated the average gap.

68
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.880
That is the mid point. The me of all the guesses. He figured they'd be way off.

69
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.310
But when he did that,

70
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.180
it turned out that collectively the citizens of Plymouth said the ox weighed

71
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.030
1,187 pounds,

72
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.730
181,187 pounds, hope a cure, which was astonishingly

73
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.010
<v 3>close. A oxys actual weight was 1,188 pounds.</v>

74
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.020
<v 1>What else is there a pound off?</v>

75
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.070
They were basically perfect and they were actually better than any single

76
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.150
individual in the group.

77
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.220
Colton was stunned and this went against everything he knew to be true,

78
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.850
but you have to give him credit because he didn't publish the results. He was,

79
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:31.240
you know, curious enough to acknowledge possibilities

80
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.930
<v 3>that this experience that, uh, that's gotten had.</v>

81
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.640
We went up to a lot of dumb people and collectively they somehow were smarter as

82
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:44.330
a group than any one of them.

83
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.910
[inaudible] is an experience that has been experimentally tested over and over

84
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:51.670
and over. So it, liberal arts colleges all over the United States,

85
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.040
professional liberal arts college because that's where these kinds of things

86
00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:57.400
happen. See, a science professors never happens. Vocational schools.

87
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.760
Just that the liberal arts. Hello. All right.

88
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.560
I'm being a Snob at schools everywhere. A science professor,

89
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:06.070
a psychology professor usually puts a bowl of jelly beans in front of the room

90
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:06.341
and says,

91
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:10.900
how many people here can you just guess the number of jelly beans and over and

92
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.470
over and over again, no one in the room gets the exact number,

93
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.920
but everyone in the room at the mean comes closest.

94
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.360
Somehow the group is smarter than even the smartest kids in the class.

95
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.930
And according to James or Wiki, this is not just a history lesson,

96
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.100
but that it actually is,

97
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.510
is something you can see at work in a lot of other places and can be used to

98
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:33.190
solve much more complex problems,

99
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.010
<v 5>much more complex problems. Well, let's just take one example.</v>

100
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.540
The Internet,

101
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.400
if you go back and read a lot of the discussion of the Internet from 1995 to

102
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:52.630
1998 it was totally dominated by people saying, yeah, the Internet is neat,

103
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.990
but you can never find anything and nobody says that anymore. I mean,

104
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:58.300
it's just a problem that Google just completely solved.

105
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.330
<v 3>It's an amazing thing. This if your member is Steven Johnson,</v>

106
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:05.840
author of the Book Emergence, and here I used that exact same,

107
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.070
the mysterious crowds smarts that was president of the ox guessing contest is

108
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:14.450
what allowed Google to become such a great search engine almost overnight.

109
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.040
So what Google does

110
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.620
<v 5>decided to do was to solve the problem of organizing the web in a,</v>

111
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.960
in a bottom up rather than a top down approach.

112
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.220
And what Google said was anytime somebody decides to link to a page,

113
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.020
we're going to count that as a vote,

114
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.140
as a positive endorsement of the page that they're linking to. Oh,

115
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.380
so this is like a little democracy. So it's a little democracy. Exactly.

116
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.850
And so what they said is pages that have a lot of people pointing to them are

117
00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:43.050
going to be more highly valued in the Google kind of system or algorithm than

118
00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:46.240
pages and nobody points to. So if some guy has a blog, which hand,

119
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.200
which is really great and, and a ton of other people linked to him,

120
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.800
he gets in essence what you're saying, a lot of votes. He wins the election.

121
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.130
He went to vote and they added a second layer to it,

122
00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:58.830
which is that when that guy points to somebody else,

123
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.640
his link is more valuable than your average schmoes because a lot of people

124
00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:07.830
point to him too. He has more kind of Google juice.

125
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.370
When you think about the way that city neighborhoods forum,

126
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.061
you asked the question,

127
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:13.570
where does city neighborhoods come from and the answer is, you know,

128
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.660
well everybody and nobody at the same time as kind of creating this. Yeah.

129
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.230
When you search for something on Google and you get a list of results,

130
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:24.410
that is often really, really good because Google gives these great results.

131
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.110
Ask Yourself, who decided that this result?

132
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:29.120
Here is number one in this result is number two. Well,

133
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:33.770
the answer is everybody and nobody. It's nobody on staff at Google. You know,

134
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:37.130
Google isn't deciding that this is the premier site for.

135
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:39.530
If you search for Steven Johnson and this is the second best site,

136
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:40.670
if you searched for Steven Johnson,

137
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.350
collectively all the people who are offering documents on the web have decided

138
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:48.110
that this is the best site by choosing to link or not link.

139
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:52.130
Basically the intelligence of Google is an emergent property of all of these

140
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:53.420
local decisions to link,

141
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.280
none of which were made until recently with the intent of influencing Google.

142
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.190
Now what's happened recently is that people have started to try and trick. Yeah,

143
00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:04.640
that was my next question to me. You can manipulate, you can manipulate it.

144
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.210
So I, I actually have this experience.

145
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.500
This is one of the most annoying things that's happened to me in the last year.

146
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.490
And it's ironic because it comes out of precisely the thing that I celebrated

147
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:18.340
and championed and I've been an advocate for them for the last five years. Um,

148
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.830
I have a website that a lot of people linked to and thus I have a

149
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:27.610
disproportionate power over Google here. When I pointed something,

150
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.720
they will jump up. Yeah, yeah. Have you seen this in, in practical terms? Oh,

151
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:34.780
absolutely. Well one way you can tell is that for a stretch of time,

152
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.110
if you searched Google for Steven, I was a number one result.

153
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.240
Just Steven just evolved the students in the novel,

154
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.880
Stevenson the world of the Steven Spielberg's is Stephen King's.

155
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.600
I was the number one Steven and obviously on some level Google is wrong in

156
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.540
thinking that I have the number with Steven in the world.

157
00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:51.490
I mean I think very highly of myself,

158
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:53.020
but I'm not the most important Steven in the road.

159
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.750
But it's because I a website that a lot of other bloggers and people in the kind

160
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.610
of Internet community point to, well maybe you in the mind's eye,

161
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.290
according to Google, I'm no longer Irish. I've dropped to number five or six,

162
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.370
which has been a great tragedy in my life. Who's number one now? Uh, I think it,

163
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:11.520
last I looked it was this, I think he's a country music star.

164
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.900
Like Steven Curtis Chapman. Yeah, I'm still up there. So you know, it's alright.

165
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:20.910
But anyway, so because I have this power with Google on my website,

166
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.360
there's an open comment area where anybody can come and post a thought in

167
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.450
response to something that I had posted and about a year ago people started

168
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:32.370
posting these random kind of nonsense posts that would have a link in at

169
00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:37.220
pointing off to some you know, free Viagra site or to a porn site or to,

170
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.980
you know, kind of get a mortgage, you know, site. It was a coattails thing.

171
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.800
I'm like, this guy is good, so I'm going to get on his coattails. Exactly,

172
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:45.510
and initially I was like, look,

173
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.960
I don't have that many people coming here that it makes sense to advertise in my

174
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:50.130
comments area,

175
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.220
but I finally realized that they weren't trying to attract the people who were

176
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.290
hanging out at my site. They were trying to attract Google.

177
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.310
They were talking purely to Google's automated kind of searching.

178
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:00.144
They were saying, look,

179
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.560
Google will see this as an endorsement from Steven Johnson pointing to this free

180
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:08.820
gambling site and this is what separates us from the ants right here is we're

181
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.680
aware. Yes, Colon. Yes,

182
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:15.430
you can step out and play the system because people are smart and they have this

183
00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:17.860
ability to kind of reflect on the system that they're a part of.

184
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.290
We're able to advance faster. But you also have cheats and spoilers.

185
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.860
We'll destroy the system. And I eventually, you know, this is this tragic thing,

186
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.520
but I had to,

187
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.480
I had basically to shut down these conversation areas that I had on my site

188
00:10:31.481 --> 00:10:32.980
because, because these fans,

189
00:10:32.981 --> 00:10:37.981
I would get literally a hundred of these spam posts in a day and a lot of them

190
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.360
were really obscene. So it was like, you know,

191
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.840
my mother would come to my site and be like,

192
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.250
<v 3>what can you do? What is going on?</v>

193
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.170
Steven Johnson is the author of the book emergence as well as mind wide open and

194
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:53.100
he's working on a new one,

195
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.880
which will be out soon about how everything that's bad for you is actually good

196
00:10:56.881 --> 00:11:00.330
for you. So it is no surprise that he is currently number four,

197
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.680
Stephen on Google, behind Steven Spielberg, Steven Sonnenburg, Stephen King,

198
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.153
but head of this guy

199
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.923
<v 6>to</v>

200
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.550
Tuesday the Massey and die.

201
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.190
<v 3>This is Steven Curtis Chapman saw from a crowd,</v>

202
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.820
even a pretty dumb crowd can emerge magically.

203
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.500
Beautiful complexity.

204
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:29.640
And this after all was the great insight of Adam Smith wealth of nations seven.

205
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.170
Now you're gonna have to fill me in 1776 he wrote a book in which he proposed

206
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:37.680
that there's an invisible hand when everybody wants to buy something and

207
00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:39.180
everybody else wants to sell something.

208
00:11:39.181 --> 00:11:41.700
Somehow it all comes together and a perfect balance.

209
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.080
Speaking of which, my name's Ben Ruben,

210
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:51.110
I'm a sound artist in New York City and what you're about to hear is a piece I

211
00:11:51.331 --> 00:11:53.850
made called open outcry. We'll hear an excerpt.

212
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.070
<v 2>Silver 44 78</v>

213
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:03.810
<v 6>crude oil, 33 two silver, silver</v>

214
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.890
[inaudible] nine zero zero

215
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.020
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].

216
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.080
<v 2>Sometimes I say to people, did you ever bidding? And I know if they say,</v>

217
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:28.531
I didn't hear you,

218
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:32.730
I know they're not telling me the truth because people always hear my voice.

219
00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:36.990
It's, it's unique and it's a strong voice too. If I'm selling October's,

220
00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:37.141
you know,

221
00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:40.260
you don't say [inaudible] say [inaudible] and you don't say the full hand.

222
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.890
I'll just say like oc at 10 so I just yell at OCHA 10

223
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.620
<v 6>oh it's 75 I'm 25 so 25 bucks, 75 bed at 78</v>

224
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.850
seven block seven beds. 25

225
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.740
84 85

226
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:01.750
by a hundred

227
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.340
<v 7>yeah. I listen to one person at a time.</v>

228
00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:05.230
You're hearing everybody speak at the same time.

229
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.590
It's like going to a symphony and hearing every piece of the orchestra but yet

230
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:13.330
hearing the music at the same time and in the midst of that you may observe

231
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.100
instance a broker that you've traded with for years.

232
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.500
You notice face looks like when he's laughing,

233
00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:24.850
you know what his face looks like when he's upset about something at home and

234
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:28.200
suddenly he's got a nervous look. You can tell when someone is bluffing,

235
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.670
when somebody is not bluffing in this.

236
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.530
These are all skills that are learned over time.

237
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.810
It's really an internal gut feeling.

238
00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:37.180
And as far as just seeing the expression on someone's face,

239
00:13:37.181 --> 00:13:40.270
the way that somebody breathing, the way that somebody leaning on someone else.

240
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.440
I always knew when the guy behind me had a real order. Cause when he had a big,

241
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:44.981
big order,

242
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:47.350
he used to take my shoulder and shove it to the ground trying to hold it.

243
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.310
<v 6>He's too bad. He's too good too. So 50 decent toe.</v>

244
00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.810
[inaudible] five to 10 I'll bet no younger. Why he's too big.

245
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.850
Nobody in a half. Nobody. Five and a half.

246
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.103
[inaudible]

247
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.160
so orange juice.

248
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.340
[inaudible] gasoline.

249
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:33.920
Natural Gas, Huh? [inaudible]

250
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.950
<v 0>thanks to sound artists,</v>

251
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.500
Ben Reuben and the next big thing for letting us borrow that piece.

252
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.860
Coming up the story of the biggest search and possibly discovery since the

253
00:14:43.871 --> 00:14:46.540
double helix. And it involves the same guy.

254
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.140
I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich and I will continue in a minute.

255
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:55.900
You're listening to radio lab. Keep listening. Okay.
