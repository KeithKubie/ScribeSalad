00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:08.930
We’re surrounded by it every winter, but
how much do you really know about snow?

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:16.441
It falls out of the sky, we shovel it off
the sidewalk, we ski on it, sled on it, make

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.189
snowballs with it - but do you ever stop to
think about what makes snow?

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.189
I do!

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.769
Cuz it’s my job.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.319
Snow is made of a few basic ingredients: air,
water and a tiny bit of dust, volcanic ash,

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.929
mica or even particles from space that made
it through that atmosphere.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.590
As the temperature drops, 180 billion molecules
of water condense around the dust particles

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.859
and freezes into an ice crystal; the colder
the temperature the sharper their points will

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.890
be.[a] These crystals eventually clump, forming
a snowflake.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.370
What you see falling isn't a single crystal,
but these massive clumps.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.329
Though, a single flake can grow quite large
-- like, inches wide -- and contain hundreds

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.690
of individual paper-thin crystals.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.801
All snowflakes have six sides, always six…
which means contrary to popular belief, they're

00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:05.390
not all different or unique, in fact, they
form a crystalline pattern and crystals follow

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.579
specific rules, so they're all very similar.

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.640
Snowflakes fall at 3.1 mph (5 kph) and as
they do, the temperature, humidity and wind

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.700
speed will all affect the flake's consistency.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.211
The crystalline structures of snow are NOT
white, but translucent and colorless, just

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:26.079
like ice., They only appear white because
they scatter all wavelengths of light equally.

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.170
However, sometimes what's in the air can change
the color of snow.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.150
Pollen, dust, ash or other particles that
the flakes pickup as they call can make it

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.369
look yellow, red or even black.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.799
As much as 95 percent of the snowflake is
made of air, trapped in-between the crystal's

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.799
arms and filaments.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.730
Once it snows enough, all that air in the
snowflakes will begin to absorb sound, which

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.200
is why snowy nights feel sooooo silent…..

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.750
Additionally, once the snow starts to pile
up, the air in between the flakes makes for

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.030
a very good insulator.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.920
Which is why igloos and caves of snow are
really quite warming.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.760
Of course, lifting all that snow to make a
cave could get heavy, so dress in layers.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.120
The fattest flakes only weigh 0.02 grams,
so for a pound of snow, you'd need 22,325

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.120
flakes.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.571
To put that in perspective a light snowfall
can result in between 10-20 snowflakes per

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:17.440
second for every square meter of ground.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.380
If you get enough snow, and it get heavy…
avalanches happen.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.610
When enormous amounts of snow piles up on
a mountain with a 30-degree or steeper grade,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.220
things get crazy.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.070
The weight becomes too much for those tiny
crystals to hold onto one another and eventually

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.080
gravity pulls a sheet of the snow together,
shearing it off the main body and here comes

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.030
an avalanche!

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.660
Due to snow's ability to melt and re-freeze,
the layers of a mountain snowfall make layers

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.140
just like sedimentary rock, which is why avalanches
are very unpredictable.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.370
Shout all you want, loud sounds don't cause
avalanches.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.620
I know, I know, the question on everyone’s
mind every winter is how do you make the perfect

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.620
snowball?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.830
Wait til it's 32 degrees (0C) and use snow
with a bit of moisture.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.320
Melting it in your hands will make it pack
better.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.430
Your hands will hurt after a while and if
you do it for too long, so be careful…

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.560
That sustained cold temperature could permanently
damage your skin, but if you can last for

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.290
a short burst; the tiny crystals will stick
together just right.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.570
Just pick your target wisely…

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.120
