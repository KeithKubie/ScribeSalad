00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:07.990
The world is a vast and often unmanageable
place - so no wonder if we sometimes display

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:16.180
a powerful attraction to the idea of miniaturisation.
We seem to love dollhouses, teddies, train

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.430
sets, bonzai trees, model airplanes and tiny
cups and saucers sitting on the sides of miniaturized

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.980
kitchens.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.380
These please us by symbolising a taming and
humanising of the gigantic dimensions of much

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.090
of life.
By far the easiest and fastest way to miniaturise

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.040
the world is not by making models of it, but
through the use of what linguists call:

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.839
DIMINUTIVES
A diminutive is a word that has been modified

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.480
to suggest the smaller version of itself - usually
through a tweak to its ending.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.640
Interestingly, the moment we’re tempted
to use a diminutive is often the moment we

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.980
start to love someone or something. The more
we feel drawn, the more we want to possess

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.260
them, to tame their otherness and intimidating
scale, and therefore to shrink them down to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.290
something more manageable, something that
might slip into our pocket.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.610
When a couple, let’s call them Emma and
Brad get together, they might swiftly add

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.770
some diminutives to their burgeoning relationship.
His vagabond footloose sides can be tamed

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.660
by a little y, so that he becomes Brad-y.
And Emma might shrink by being called Emm-ie.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.740
It’s particularly interesting to find that
not all languages use diminutives to the same

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.810
extent. The champion is Spanish, especially
as spoken in Latin America. Latin Americans

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.370
are constantly trying to shrink everything.
In Mexico “ahora” (in a minute) becomes

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.210
“ahorita”, in just a little second. “Un
poco”, a little, gets changed in “un poquitín”,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.190
just a smidgeon. A coffee, “un café”,
is constantly changed into “un cafelín”

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.890
or “un cafelito.” That doesn’t make
your coffee any smaller, but it brings you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.520
into a more intimate relationship to it. Italian
is another language very keen on diminutives,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.069
usually with the addition of an “ino”
or “ina”.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.910
An old man: in Italian un vecchio becomes
un vecchietto

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.310
A little boy ragazzo → ragazzino
A woman (donna → donnetta)

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.110
A small car (macchina → macchinetta) German,
often seen as a formal, harsh language, also

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.700
has a flair for diminutives. The suffixes
“-chen”, “-lein” can be added to many

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.730
words. A sausage, “ein Wurst”, can be
turned into “ein Würstchen”, which isn’t

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.910
necessarily a smaller sausage but one that
is particularly irresistible. Likewise “ein

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.010
Hündchen” isn’t necessarily a smaller
dog than “ein Hund” but it’s probably

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.020
one you have a soft spot for. The major language
notable for its lack of diminutives is English:

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.790
at best, we can add a “-y” or a ‘let’,
very poor moves compared the great richness

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.980
of diminutives in other languages. We might
wonder why this is. Perhaps English, the global

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.050
language, the language of conquest and Empire,
resists the accommodation with the modest,

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.950
the everyday and the tender which other languages
pave the way for. We may lack diminutives

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.970
because it is that little bit harder to be
tender in English - or, more importantly,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.989
as an English person.
Diminutives do the valuable job of rehabilitating

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.370
sweetness. They remind us that we have come
from childhood and that when we love, we want

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.020
to shrink the world back down to a more manageable
and loveable scale. We know that we are the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.370
objects of someone’s affection when they
start to shrink us down - and we shouldn’t

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.400
hesitate to shrink down the bits of the world
we have begun to care for. This has been a

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.319
message from what the germans might term The
School of Life-lein (german) or the Italians

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.070
The School of Life-etta.
