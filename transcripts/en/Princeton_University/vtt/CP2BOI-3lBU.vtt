CHRISTOPHER SHIN: Every
time I walk into the chapel

00:00:02.185 --> 00:00:05.180
through the front
entrance, a few steps

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.540
and you enter the main
space of the chapel.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.750
The ceiling opens
up, and you have

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.630
the whole entire space of the
chapel comes rushing at you.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.500
And it's an incredibly
moving and humbling feeling

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.980
to just be part of
such an open space.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.430
In the daily life
of being a student,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.370
a lot of times our
world is very narrow.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.120
It's very small.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.055
It's whatever we see on our
screens or in our books.

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:44.430
When you enter a
space like this,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.440
you can't help but
let your mind wander.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.590
You can't help but --

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.380
just your heart soars
because of just the beauty

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.430
and the grandeur of this place.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.640
I also come here often by myself
just to sit alone in the chapel

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.470
because this place is one
of the rare sanctuaries

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.120
for reverent silence.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.170
