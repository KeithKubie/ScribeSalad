00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.890
This is Nela Zisser…

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.250
She ate a 10,000 calorie english breakfast
in 42 minutes!

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.210
20 eggs, 3 pounds of meat and almost a whole
pound of butter.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.049
Ok, I gotta admit, it looks delicious, but
still...

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.340
Competitive eating has taken off in the US
and around the world, and doing it really

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.490
comes down to three things: What’s happening
biologically, what’s happening mentally,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.070
and how they got like this?!

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.509
Let’s start at the beginning, before eating,
the stomach muscles relax in a process called

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.850
- gastric accommodation.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.150
It’s a way the body anticipates a meal.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.800
Saliva builds up in the mouth and the stomach
is bombarded with acid and enzymes that help

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.420
in the digestion process.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.239
This happens with everyone, and competitive
eaters are no different.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.170
But, it’s about there the similarities between
thanksgiving and competition end.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.809
When you eat, your body has systems to tell
you when it’s full.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.379
Competitive Eaters -- like distance runners
-- have trained themselves to push through

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.469
these kinds of natural barriers.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.699
So the eater shoves the first pie, hot dog,
or taco into their mouth and it travels down

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.730
the esophagus and enters the stomach.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.471
The stomach recognizes this is food, and starts
to stretch to accommodate.

00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:12.690
A regular human stomach starts out about the
size of a clenched fist, and can expand five-fold,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.950
but a competitive eater’s stomach can stretch
quite a bit more.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.580
A study from 2007 published scans of a competitive
eaters stomach before, during and after he

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.600
ate 36 hot dogs.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.220
Look at this!

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.580
THIS IS A HUMAN.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.850
Before, shoving these tube-steaks into his
body -- the stomach looks pretty wrinkly,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.330
kinda like an uninflated balloon.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.780
Then, after the bushel of brats it looks like
this.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.200
Look at that!

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.820
THIS IS HORRIFYING.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.380
The researchers found this eater’s stomach
could accept a quote “almost unlimited volume

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.540
of food”.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.020
It’s hard to know exactly how much competitive
eaters’ stomachs could expand… because

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.600
studies are thin on the ground, but here’s
what we think is happening.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600
Eaters eat.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.650
A lot.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.390
Chronic overeating stretches the stomach,
making it easier to consume massive amounts

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.120
of food during competition.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.600
But there’s more to it than that…

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.910
The Enteric Nervous System is like a mini-brain
specifically for your gut.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.840
It is made up of more than 100 million nerve
cells that line the walls of our digestive

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.730
tract and it’s there to keep food moving
and communicate problems -- like a crammed

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.730
tummy, perhaps?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.400
Some people’s Enteric Nervous Systems may
just be less sensitive than others, allowing

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.600
them to chow down on crazy amounts of food.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.150
Maybe Competitive Eaters have that advantage?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.980
Scientists have found links between the brain
and the gut too.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.700
The bacteria living down there share a two-way
channel with the brain -- stress and depression

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.570
can suppress gut function but perhaps there’s
a way to consciously tap into that to eat

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.650
more food?

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.520
More research is needed.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.870
Competitive eaters say the key to speed eating
is the ability to zone out and ignore the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.400
feeling that they’re full.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.660
So that’s it, stretch your stomach, overcome
the feeling of being full and just… really

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.660
like hot dogs.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.660
But then what?

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.280
Let’s say you ate 70 hot dogs, which is
like, 15 pounds (7kg) and over 19,000 calories.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280
Then what?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.500
You know what I mean?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.780
Once eating competitions are over, no one
realllly knows what happens because competitors

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.730
aren’t gabbing to reporters about their
bodily functions, but I bet you it’s not

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.730
great.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.180
And if that’s not enough, there are absolutely
some serious downsides to eating like this.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.010
Researchers have called competitive eating
“potentially self-destructive.”

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.570
It can cause things like water intoxication,
obesity, But also the need for a gastrectomy

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.590
(which means removing part of the stomach!)
and gastroparesis, which is when a stomach

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.810
so stretched it becomes unable to digest food.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.540
In fact, depending on what kind of foods are
being consumed, this behavior can increase

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.459
the risk of heart attack or kidney damage!

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.110
But aside from that, eaters also risk choking
during these challenges.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.360
While professional contests have medics standing
by, amateur contests often don’t.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.280
People die at these things.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280
Seriously.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280
So FYI.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.150
I love hot dogs too, but don’t try this
at home, people.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.410
Just don’t!

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.870
I’m hungry.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.010
Maybe you are a competitive eater.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.920
In which case, you should prooobably have
your own website.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.260

Biggest meal I ever ate was a double whopper with cheese, two

sets of fries, three Dr. Peppers, and three Hershey's sundae pies.
