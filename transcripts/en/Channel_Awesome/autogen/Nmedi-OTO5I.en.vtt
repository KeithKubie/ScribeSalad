Poppins Returns was a more faithful
sequel but you could argue that it is

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520
sequel but you could argue that it is
 

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.220
sequel but you could argue that it is
because it does hit all those same beats

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.230
because it does hit all those same beats
 

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:39.750
because it does hit all those same beats
but as you pointed out in the fan

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760
but as you pointed out in the fan
 

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.610
but as you pointed out in the fan
scription video it doesn't have the

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:41.620
scription video it doesn't have the
 

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.710
scription video it doesn't have the
heart sort of that the original one does

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720
heart sort of that the original one does
 

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.840
heart sort of that the original one does
yeah it's like having a mathematical

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:45.850
yeah it's like having a mathematical
 

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.840
yeah it's like having a mathematical
formula that reaches a hundred and use

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:48.850
formula that reaches a hundred and use
 

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:50.310
formula that reaches a hundred and use
the same formula but you change the

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320
the same formula but you change the
 

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.110
the same formula but you change the
numbers it's like but the numbers are

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120
numbers it's like but the numbers are
 

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.490
numbers it's like but the numbers are
not gonna add up to a hundred but we

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:53.500
not gonna add up to a hundred but we
 

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.620
not gonna add up to a hundred but we
have the formula it it doesn't work that

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:55.630
have the formula it it doesn't work that
 

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:58.650
have the formula it it doesn't work that
way there's a reason you know 50 plus 50

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:58.660
way there's a reason you know 50 plus 50
 

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.070
way there's a reason you know 50 plus 50
equals 100 not 50 plus you know 5 equals

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080
equals 100 not 50 plus you know 5 equals
 

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.980
equals 100 not 50 plus you know 5 equals
Andre you know you need the same you

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:04.990
Andre you know you need the same you
 

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.230
Andre you know you need the same you
need the same elements that add up and

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240
need the same elements that add up and
 

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.150
need the same elements that add up and
it's tricky because you want to change

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:09.160
it's tricky because you want to change
 

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.500
it's tricky because you want to change
things but you want to do things exactly

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:10.510
things but you want to do things exactly
 

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.160
things but you want to do things exactly
the same too and there's very few times

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:14.170
the same too and there's very few times
 

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.250
the same too and there's very few times
where I feel like that can work I'm top

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:17.260
where I feel like that can work I'm top
 

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.350
where I feel like that can work I'm top

so blatant in how they do the exact same

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:25.570
so blatant in how they do the exact same
 

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.540
so blatant in how they do the exact same

I think that wasn't the right time we're

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:41.890
I think that wasn't the right time we're
 

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.340
I think that wasn't the right time we're
now with stuff like you know that Pixar

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:44.350
now with stuff like you know that Pixar
 

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.810
now with stuff like you know that Pixar
with the Toy Story movies and even

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:45.820

Disney with like frozen and stuff like
 

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.140
Disney with like frozen and stuff like
that their messages are getting a little

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:49.150
that their messages are getting a little
 

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.780
that their messages are getting a little
bit more complex but they can also still

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:51.790
bit more complex but they can also still
 

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:56.400
bit more complex but they can also still
tap into those dark moments for the most

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:56.410
tap into those dark moments for the most
 

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:57.660
tap into those dark moments for the most
part I don't know I don't know what

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:57.670
part I don't know I don't know what
 

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.190
part I don't know I don't know what
they're doing now but for a while they

00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200
they're doing now but for a while they
 

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.280
they're doing now but for a while they
you know passed like maybe a you know

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:02.290
you know passed like maybe a you know
 

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.870
you know passed like maybe a you know
nine years they've really been tapping

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880
nine years they've really been tapping
 

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.910
nine years they've really been tapping
to the dark stuff but bringing you back

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:05.920
to the dark stuff but bringing you back
 

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.770
to the dark stuff but bringing you back
to the light again I think that's why

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:07.780
to the light again I think that's why
 

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.050
to the light again I think that's why
you've been responding to them so well

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:10.060
you've been responding to them so well
 

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.490
you've been responding to them so well
and that's why I think people are really

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:11.500
and that's why I think people are really
 

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.860
and that's why I think people are really
missing that now because there are so

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:13.870
missing that now because there are so
 

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.750
missing that now because there are so
many remakes and they're whatever

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760
many remakes and they're whatever
 

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.860
many remakes and they're whatever
they're try and do to them they're just

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:16.870
they're try and do to them they're just
 

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.900
they're try and do to them they're just
sticking to that formula none of them is

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:18.910
sticking to that formula none of them is
 

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.420
sticking to that formula none of them is
headbands go as the original sure it
