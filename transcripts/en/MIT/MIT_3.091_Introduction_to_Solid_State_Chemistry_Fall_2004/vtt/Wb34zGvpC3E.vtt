00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:38.900
Let's see. A couple of
announcements.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Tomorrow there will be quiz six
based on homework six just on the

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.500
crystallography.
There is a little bit at the end of

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
homework six on x-rays.
And we will just start to talk

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500
about x-rays today,
so I think that we will leave that

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
out. It will just be based on
crystallography.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500
And I have asked the recitation
instructors to administer the test

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
at the end of the period so you can
have some chance to ask questions.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:52.260
Last day we talked about
crystallography.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.530
We were introduced to the seven
crystal systems and the 14 Bravais

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.790
lattices which are shown up on the
slide taken from the lecture notes.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.060
And we saw that if we wanted to
describe the arrangement of atoms in

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.330
a crystal, we could do so by
combining the notion of the Bravais

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.590
lattice of which there are 14
distinct types with a basis.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.860
The basis could be a single atom.
Could be a group of atoms. Could

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.860
be an ion pair.
Could be atom pair.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.590
And we saw that got us through an
elaborate set of crystals.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.330
And then towards the end we focused
on cubic crystals because cubic

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.060
crystals are representative of a
large number of metals in the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.790
Periodic Table,
and it is much more tractable

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.530
mathematically.
We are going to focus on cubic

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.260
crystals, and I am going to continue
along with that today.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:02:03.853
In particular, I want to start
looking at notation.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:51.640
And the reason I want to look at
notation is I want to be able to

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.290
define a point,
a line and a plane so that when we

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.930
start characterizing crystals,
I can give you a mathematical

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.580
notation that represents the face of
the cube, the body diagonal of the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.230
cube, a line going on the body
diagonal, a line going along the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.880
edge. Instead of writing it in
words, I want to be able to do so

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.520
mathematically.
And so for that we are going to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.170
turn to this handout which has the
elements of crystallographic

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.880
notation.
I want to quickly go through this.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.640
I think last day we started talking
about position,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.410
so I have drawn a little sketch here.
This is the unit cell.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.170
The unit cell is the cube because
we are talking about a cubic system,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.930
and this is just the lattice. I
have not put atoms here.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.700
So I am just talking about lattice
points in space.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.460
And, just to remind us,
a, b and c are the unit vectors,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.230
and in a cubic system a equals b
equals c. And each of them is equal

00:02:47.230 --> 00:03:07.393
to a, the lattice constant.
This is the lattice constant, a.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:54.620
That's the dimension a,
the lattice constant. And all

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.240
angles are right angles,
so alpha equals beta equals gamma

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.870
equals 90 degrees.
Just to practice, the origin,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.490
as I have shown here, all we do is
write zero, zero,

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.120
zero, as you would in your math
class. But don't put parentheses

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.740
around it because parentheses are
reserved for planes.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.370
We are going to use parentheses
later on. Crystallographers have

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:35.273
their own notation.
So here is point a.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:24.260
What do we see?
It is in the yz plane.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.530
By the way, I have chosen a set of
coordinate axes that are in

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.790
conformity with the right-hand rule.
I don't care which axis you choose

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.060
to be x. It doesn't matter.
I generally like to make z vertical,

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.330
but I don't care,
as long as you use the right-hand

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.590
rule. You need to observe the
right-hand rule because in physics

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.860
you are going to find that there are
certain vector forces that

00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:09.586
are the cross-product.
And, if you don't use the right-hand

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
rule convention,
you will get things identically

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
backwards. The thumb is your x-axis,
y-axis, z-axis,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
however you want to do it.
I have the x-axis coming out of the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
board, and the y-axis and the z-axis
are in the plane of the board.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
If we come here, this point A is
zero units out on the x-axis,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
it is one unit out on the y-axis and
one unit up on the z-axis,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
so this will be zero, one, one.
And b, as I've drawn it,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
looks like it is one unit out on the
x-axis, it is no units out on a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
y-axis and a half a unit up on the
z-axis. That is one,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
zero, one-half. That is about the
last time I am going to talk about

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
these things. It is more
interesting to talk about lines.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
For lines, I am going to say let's
just follow along on the slide.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And the slide imitates what is
going on here.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Let's see. I've got a couple of
them I want to try.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:53.520
Let's look at,
for starters, OB.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.050
I want to look at OB.
I am going to start at the origin,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.580
and I am going to come out to the
point B. And I have a vector on

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.110
this. It is emanating from the
origin out to B.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.640
And what does it say to do?
It says define a vector from origin

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.170
to the point on a line,
choose the smallest set of integers

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.700
and no commas.
I put the origin,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.230
which conveniently here is the
origin, out to the point

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:36.793
along that direction.
The vector OB,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
as written, will go from there out
to one, zero, one-half.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
But then it says no commas,
enclose in brackets and clear the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
fractions. They don't like to have
fractions when you are talking about

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
lines, so clear the fractions and
multiply through,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
then that will just double it,
two, zero, one. And you could say

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
what are they doing?
If you can imagine going out one

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
more unit cell,
this line would actually go through

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:54.250
the point two, zero, one.
You are just looking at the

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.750
projection along here.
You are just multiplying it.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.250
And then it says no commas and
enclose in brackets.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.750
This is called a bracket.
These staple-like things are called

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.250
brackets. That is the direction OB.
Let's see. What is the other one

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.750
we are going to do?
AO. It says you have to move the

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.060
origin to the base of the vector.
If I want to do AO,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.190
I have to put the origin up here at
the tail of the vector.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.330
If this is the origin, I am moving
actually what?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.460
I am not moving anywhere in the
x-axis, but I am moving minus one in

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.590
the y-axis and minus one in the
z-axis in order to get this

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.730
direction. I am really going zero
in the x, I am going minus one in

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.860
the y and minus one in the z.
And you can see that since we don't

00:06:45.860 --> 00:07:05.253
use commas, putting minus signs
would look cumbersome.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:54.610
In crystallographic notation,
the minus sign is represented as a

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.220
macron. A macron is a line over.
This is zero, one bar, one bar.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.840
That is equal to minus one.
Crystallographers use the term one

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.460
bar. This is 0,
one bar, one bar for this line A

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.070
down to origin.
That is how that is done.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.690
Then it says we can denote an
entire family of directions

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.140
by carats.
Let's do that.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.420
Suppose I wanted to say all of the
body diagonals.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.710
Well, how would I get a body
diagonal? If this is the origin and

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.990
I want to go up the body diagonal,
it would be out one unit, out one

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.280
unit, out one unit.
So one, one, one, would be a body

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.570
diagonal. But suppose I want to say
all body diagonals?

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.850
That is one, one, one this
direction, one, one,

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.870
one that direction.
I want to get this body diagonal.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.620
I want to get that body diagonal.
How do I do that? I can do that by

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.370
putting carats.
These are called carats.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.120
Those of you who have done some
editing and proofreading know these

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:16.506
terms. This is all body diagonals.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.400
We could do a few others while we
are at it. Suppose I wanted to do

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:20.800
all of the face diagonals like this,
like this, and then over here like

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.850
this, like this?
Well, what is a face diagonal?

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:34.570
Zero, one, one. All the face
diagonals. What about all cube

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:42.280
edges? What is a cube edge?
A cube edge could be this one: zero,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:57.160
zero, one. This would
be all cube edges.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
What does it mean?
It means write this out in full.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
That is O, O, one; O, O, one bar; O,
one, O. I am using O for zero.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I am cluing you into
crystallographers' talk.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
That is how they talk. O and one
bar. You are going to be really hip

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
if you end up in an elevator with a
bunch of crystallographers.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And there are two others here.
One, O, O, and one bar, O, O.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:23.860
Well, how many faces are there?
Six. How many face edges? Six.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.730
And, look, just going through the
permutations and combinations gives

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.590
you exactly the number that you
should have. This is mathematics

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.460
imitating reality.
That is good. And likewise here.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.330
If you go through all the
permutations, combinations of zero,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.190
one and one bar, you will end up
with all of the possibilities for

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.060
face diagonals,
all the possibilities for body

00:09:47.060 --> 00:10:05.053
diagonals.
I think I have a cartoon here that

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
shows all of the different diagonals
that are possible when you mix one

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and one bar. That is good.
So far so good. That is pretty

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
simple. Now let's look at planes.
For planes we use something called

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the Miller indices for describing
planes. And they are named after

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
the British mineralogist William
Hallowes Miller who,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
back in the 1830s, gave us this
means of describing a plane.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And I think, rather than writing it
down, we will just follow along here

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
because you have the notes in front
of you. You know from your math

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that the equation of a plane is x
over a plus y over b plus z over c

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
equals one, **x/a + y/b + z/c = 1**
and a, b and c are the intercepts

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
with the x, y and z axes
respectively. What Miller did is he

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
said let's let h be one over a,
k be one over b and l equals one

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:56.270
over c.
So this becomes the equation of the

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.810
plane, hx plus ky plus lz equals one.
**hx + ky + lz = 1** And now what

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.360
you do is take the h,
k and l and enclose those in

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.900
parentheses. In other words,
he is taking the plane index to be

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.450
the reciprocals of the intercepts
with the three axes.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:33.366
And you will see why in a second.
Why do it that way?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Because every once in a while
something like this happens.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Here is a simple one just to get
our feet wet. Here a,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
b and c are the unit vectors,
so this is the x-axis in the same

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
convention I have chosen.
X is coming out of the plane of the

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
slide, y is moving to the right and
z is moving up.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Here is a plane that is shaded in.
And what do you see? It cuts the

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
x-axis at x equals plus one-half,
it cuts the y-axis at y equals plus

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
one, and it never cuts the z-axis.
It is parallel to the z-axis.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Mathematically,
we would say the z-intercept is

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
infinity. And who wants to have
infinity? Now you see the wisdom of

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Miller. Miller said let's describe
this in terms of the reciprocals.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
What is the reciprocal of one-half?
It is two. What is the reciprocal

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
of one? It is one.
And what is the reciprocal of

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
infinity? Zero.
We can describe this plane as the

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:18.940
two, one, zero plane.
Whenever you see a zero,

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.820
whatever place the zero lies that
means that plane is parallel to that

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.700
axis, so right away I can say that
is a plane that is parallel to the

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.580
z-axis. It does not cross the
z-axis. So there it is.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.460
There is the formula. You take the
reciprocal of the intercepts,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.350
put them side-by-side, no commas,
and this is why we save the

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:42.230
parentheses. That is why we don't
put our position in parentheses

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.110
because we are saving parentheses
for the plane.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:13:05.753
Let's do a few more.
This is a lot of fun on a Monday.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
See, you are excited to be back in
class. There is a cool thing that

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
happens when you use Miller indices.
You see what I just did? I just

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
drew a direction,
and that direction is the two,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
one, O direction. And what do you
notice about the position of two,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
one, O versus the two, one, O plane?
When you write directions,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
according to this formula and planes
according to Miller indices,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
the two, one, O direction is
perpendicular to the

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:22.070
two, one, O plane.
Two, one, O direction is

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.210
perpendicular to the two,
one, O plane. Let's do another one.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.350
This is a good one. This is a
plane that cuts the y-axis at y

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.490
equals one. It is parallel to the
x-axis and parallel to the z-axis.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.640
It never cuts the x or the z-axes,
so that is an O, one, O plane. I

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.780
mean, you can do that in your head.
That is an O, one, O plane, that is

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.920
an O, one, O plane and so on and so
forth. Here is an O,

00:13:46.920 --> 00:14:06.373
two, O plane. Why?
Well, because it cuts the y-axis at

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
y equals one-half,
you take the reciprocal,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
which is two, so O, two, O.
And let's try again. Well,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
there is O, one, O direction.
And what do you know? The O,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
one, O direction is normal to the O,
one, O plane and O, two, O direction

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
is normal to the O,
two, O plane. What do you know

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
about the O, one,
O direction and the O,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
two, O direction? They are the same
direction. O anything O is going to

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:23.330
be along the y-axis.
Now, that is an O,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.990
two, O plane. I could shift the
origin to here,

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.660
couldn't I? Then that would be an O,
two, O plane and that would be an O,

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.330
two, O plane. Oh, here is some more.
One, one, one.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.990
Well, look at this plane here.
It cuts the x-axis at x equals one,

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:46.660
the y-axis at y equals one, the
z-axis at z equals one.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.820
Shade that in.
That is the one,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.460
one, one plane, but that is also a
one, one, one plane.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.110
We can keep shifting the origin.
I don't know where the origin of

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.760
the universe is,
so I can move this anywhere along.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.400
Here is one. Here is backwards.
See, this now is one,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.050
one, one bar, because if I put the
origin here I am cutting the x-axis

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.700
at plus one, I am cutting the y-axis
at plus one, but I have a negative

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.350
tilt to this plane so the z-axis is
being cut at minus one.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:35.166
Again, we try to avoid the minus
sign.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:24.280
And, instead, we put the macron over
the number. In that way we give the

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.570
minus indication on a number,
no commas in parentheses. Now,

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:32.850
let's do the test. Here is the one,
one, one direction. And, sure

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:37.140
enough, the one,
one, one direction cuts the one,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.420
one, one plane normally. Let's try
over here. There is the one,

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:45.710
one, one bar direction. It cuts
through the one,

00:15:45.710 --> 00:16:03.953
one, one bar plane normally.
Fantastic.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And we can do families of planes as
well. Let's look at families of

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:46.000
planes. What kind of families could
we come up with if we want to do

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:54.000
families of planes with brace
brackets? Families of planes use

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
braces. If I want to say all cubed
faces that would be O, O, one.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:26.150
Because O, one,
O we saw cuts the y-axis parallel to

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.300
the x-z plane.
That is going to tell you to roll

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:34.460
over zero, zero,
one and one bar in this manner.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.610
Only instead of brackets you have
braces. How many faces on a cube?

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.760
There are six. How many
combinations of zero,

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.920
one and one bar are there?
Six. There you go. By the way,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.930
one other thing.
If you want to be hip with the

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.810
crystallographers,
this is one way of writing it.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.680
Another way of writing it is one,
O, O, which is equivalent to O, O,

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.550
one. But crystallographers like to
put things in ascending order.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.430
A crystallographer would never
write one, O, O.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:10.300
A crystallographer would write O,
O, one. That is a cool factor there.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.180
You never know when you are going
to meet a crystallographer on an

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.060
elevator. It could be the
icebreaker because

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:22.300
they might be shy.
Now, the last thing I want to do is

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.920
talk about the distance calculation,
another virtue of using Miller

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.530
indices. I want to put this up here
because it is on the handout,

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:36.150
but I want to make sure that it gets
on the board. The hkl plane is

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.760
perpendicular to the hkl direction
when we use such a notation.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.380
And then I want to go back to the
previous slide.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:18:04.226
Go back two of them because it is
easier to see here.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:58.280
I want to calculate the distance
between adjacent planes of the same

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:06.570
index. We can calculate the
distance between adjacent planes of

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:14.850
the same index.
What is the distance between two

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:22.090
adjacent planes of some value hkl?
That is given by the following

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:28.290
formula, which again is a testimony
to Miller. The distance,

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:34.490
and I am going to subscript it hkl
because they are all the same index,

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:40.690
is given by a, which is the lattice
constant, divided by the square root

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:46.890
of h squared plus k squared plus l
squared where a is the

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.870
lattice constant.
Let's test it.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.620
If hkl is O, one,
O, trivially that separation should

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.370
be a, the lattice constant.
And I think you can see that quite

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.120
nicely up on the screen here.
It is one lattice constant between

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.870
successive O, one,
O planes. Let's try it with O,

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.620
two, O. It is going to be the
square root of two squared which is

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.370
a over two. And,
sure enough, what is the distance

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.120
between O, two,
O and the adjacent plane comparable

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.720
to it?
It is only half a lattice constant.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.180
In essence, if you look here, every
O, two, O plane is only half a

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:33.630
lattice constant away.
Every O, one, O plane is full

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:39.080
lattice constant.
What you are really seeing then is

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.540
that the d goes down,
the distance between planes goes

00:19:44.540 --> 00:20:03.413
down as the Miller index goes up.
What is the lowest Miller index?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:54.120
The lowest Miller index is O,
O, one. That is a lattice constant.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.240
That is the maximum separation.
And I think you can see that as you

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.370
move hkl to higher values,
what you are doing is you are

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.490
cutting at a higher angular slice.
And, as you cut for a higher

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.620
angular slice,
the distance between successive

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.740
planes is going to be reduced.
Mathematically what is going on,

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.870
this is getting larger in the
denominator, this is remaining the

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:38.540
same, so that distance becomes
closer and closer together.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:26.590
And why am I showing you this?
Because we are going to use it in

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:30.190
the very next unit.
Not three years from now.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.790
We are going to use it in the next
unit when we take this information

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:37.390
and characterize crystals.
And we are going to characterize

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.990
atomic structure by the use of
something that is comparable in

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.590
dimension. If we are going to
measure the dimension of the human

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.190
hair, we are not going to use a
yardstick. What kind of numbers are

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.710
we looking at for these distances?
We are looking at something down

00:20:53.710 --> 00:21:01.140
around some number of angstroms.
We better find some tool that gives

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:08.570
me units of some number of angstroms.
And that tool will be x-rays.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:25.406
Now let's look at characterization
of atomic structure by x-rays.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:25.120
Today I want to talk about the

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.370
discovery of x-rays and the
underlying physics.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.620
And then next day we are going to
look at application.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.870
First of all, what are x-rays?
X-rays are a form of

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:50.473
electromagnetic radiation.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:52.140
What does that mean?
That means all of these formulas

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:57.280
apply. E equals h nu equals hc over
lambda equals hc nu bar.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:02.420
That applies. And the special
characteristic of x-rays is lambda

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:07.560
is very short and typically there is
no hard rule on this,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.710
but just in round numbers we are
looking at between one one-hundredth

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.850
to one hundred angstroms.
It is centered at about one

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:37.166
angstrom where one angstrom is equal
to ten to the minus ten meters.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:26.630
I know it is not an SI unit,
and you know my aversion to the

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.270
nanometer, but I will put it up here
because I am required by the

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.900
International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry on the Systeme

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.540
International to put this
contemptible unit here,

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.180
but I love the angstroms.
This is just my personal preference.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:23:00.160
Let's plug in a value.
Suppose we have one angstrom as the

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
wavelength if I use hc over lambda
where lambda equals one angstrom,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
or ten to the minus ten meters. I
end up with 12,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
00 electron volts per photon.
And this is clearly going to be

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
powerful radiation.
Let's take a look here.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I pulled this out of the back of
the text. This has ionization

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
energies for the first
seven elements.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
If you look here,
in green I am showing the first

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
ionization energy.
And this is right off your Periodic

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Table. 13.6 electron volts.
I have rounded it to two

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
significant figures.
It is 13.6 for hydrogen,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
it is 25.0 for helium, it is 5 for
lithium and so on.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
These are tiny, tiny numbers.
These are electron volts. Now what

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:49.930
we can do is look down this row.
This is the last electron to come

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.810
off. The second ionization energy
of helium is for a one electron atom.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.680
Helium has two electrons.
If it loses one, it only has one

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.550
left, so this is a one electron atom,
this is a one electron atom and this

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:05.430
is a one electron atom.
And look at the energies.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.300
This is for the inner most electron.
One electron atom,

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.180
that will conform to the Bohr model.
And, sure enough, look at the

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.060
ratios of these numbers.
These are determined by x-ray

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.300
photoelectron spectroscopy.
And roughly 14 times four is 56,

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:25.920
so there it is. One to four to nine
to 16. And it is just a

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:30.530
manifestation of what you have seen
as the ground state energy in the

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:35.150
Bohr model goes as the square of the
atomic number.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.760
Everything is making sense,
but what I draw your attention to is,

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.380
look, this is the innermost held
electron of nitrogen.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:25:04.226
It is 668 electron volts and I have
12,400. This has enormous power.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:55.190
This has the power to ionize inner
shell electrons.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:01.390
This is like a bowling alley.
All the pins are going flying here.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:07.590
This is incredible energy. What
are the underlying principles here?

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:13.790
Well, I think we have to start with
a history lesson.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:29.913
We will go back to November 8,
1895.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:29.140
It was a dark and stormy night,
really. It was a dark and stormy

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:38.280
night on November 8,
1895 in WŸrzburg, Bavaria,

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:47.420
which is now part of Germany.
There was a physics professor there

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:54.130
by the name of Wilhelm Roentgen.
And he was doing research,

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:58.390
as many people were at that time,
on gas discharge tubes. We have

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:02.660
seen gas discharge tubes a number of
times in 3.091,

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.930
and Roentgen was part of that army
of researchers.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.190
And what Roentgen's specialty was,
he was pursuing gas discharge

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:15.460
spectral analysis under reduced
pressure. He was pumping down with

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.730
a vacuum pump to get the gas
pressure very,

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:37.926
very low, and very,
very high voltage.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:28.720
That is what his take was.
He wanted to look at high voltage

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.450
and very, very low pressure.
And let's take a look at what his

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:38.180
apparatus looked like.
Well, we will start with the tube.

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:42.900
As you have seen many times, we
will put the cathode to the left and

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.630
we will put the anode to the right.
And he had the laboratory on the

00:26:47.630 --> 00:27:06.093
second floor.
His apartment was on the first floor.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.500
And down in the basement he had a
bunch of batteries.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:42.500
Chromic acid in open beakers down
in the basement.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.500
Let's indicate that with the
classical symbol.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.500
And this altogether put out about
20 volts. And he was a professor of

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.500
physics who understood some
electrical engineering. He

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:03.000
had a choke coil here.
The choke coil would take the

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
current, store up,
and eight times a second it would

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
discharge. And it would discharge
at 35,000 volts.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
He could take 20 volts and up it to
35,000 by the use of this choke coil.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Eight times a second he had 35,
00 volts coming off the cathode here.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:52.300
You have bam, bam, bam.
But speed that up about eight times.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.920
That is what is going on. And so
with 35,000 volts he launches

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.530
electrons off the cathode,
and they go zooming across what is

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:06.150
very, very low pressure gas and
crash into the anode.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.760
In the meantime, to keep this thing
dynamically at low pressure,

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:15.380
this goes to a vacuum pump to keep
this thing pumped down as low as he

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:35.026
can. And he was measuring what was
going on inside this gas tube.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:25.380
And so he had a detector.
His detector was over here off to

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.760
the side. The detector consisted of
either a piece of cloth or a paper

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:36.150
towel which had been painted with a
chemical that would glow when it was

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:41.530
struck by something.
What would the something be?

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:46.920
The something would be electrons or
photons that have an energy high

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:52.300
enough to cause excitation of
something in the paint and then

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:58.220
reemission in the visible.
It doesn't do any good to excite

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:04.660
electrons in the detector to have
them reemit outside the visible.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:11.110
That is what is going on. This was
paper or cloth,

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:17.550
and it was painted with an aqueous
solution of barium plantinocyanide

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:33.500
which glows green when
it is excited.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:29.190
And this is called a scintillation
screen. It comes from the Latin

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:34.390
word for spark.
Scintilla means spark in Latin.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:39.590
When the screen is struck by some
form of energy it will glow.

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:44.790
And so he had dinner. He was up on
the second floor cranking away after

00:29:44.790 --> 00:30:03.313
dinner. It was dark and raining.
He had the windows open.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:53.730
And a streetlight was coming in.
Oh, by the way, Roentgen suffered

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.460
from Daltonism.
He was red-green colored blind.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.190
And this was a green screen. And
with 35,000 volts,

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.930
even at reduced pressure,
given the capacity of those days for

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.660
vacuum pumps, he still had a lot of
glow from the tube.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:12.390
The tube is glowing,
he has a streetlight in the

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:16.130
background, so he decides to close
the drapes and take out

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:34.793
the streetlight.
And then, furthermore,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
he decides to darken the room so he
puts a cardboard box over the tube.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Now the tube is enclosed in a
cardboard box so it is not glowing

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
visibly to him.
It is glowing inside the box.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
And he continues to see
scintillation,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
continues to see things glowing.
He says that is something

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
interesting. The other thing that
happened which was kind of

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
interesting, his graduate student
who had prepared some

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:52.410
of the apparatus --
I guess he was practicing painting

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:57.240
the scintillation screen.
What the student had done was to

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:02.080
paint the letter A on a paper towel,
and he left the paper towel on the

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.910
lab bench. Now,
Röntgen has the tube enclosed in

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.740
cardboard, this thing is glowing and
he looks down and sees the letter A

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:16.580
and the letter A is glowing.
He is going, wait a minute, this is

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:21.210
crazy.
He takes a piece of black paper and

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.640
puts it here in between the tube and
the screen, and the screen continues

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:30.070
to glow. He had a deck of playing
cards in his lab.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.490
Don't laugh. That is how Mendeleev
discovered periodicity.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:38.920
He takes a playing card and puts it
in front and the tube continues to

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.350
glow. And then he takes a book and
puts it in between and the tube

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:47.780
continues to glow.
He is going wait a minute.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:52.410
Then he grabs a piece of lead foil.
He puts the lead foil in here.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:57.240
And what happens is that where the
lead foil is the screen is not

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.080
glowing, but then he sees the
outline of the bones of his hand on

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.910
the lead holding the lead foil.
All of this stuff is going on, and

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.740
he just goes to town.
He says, you know what,

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.580
this cannot be electrons because
electrons cannot live in air.

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:21.280
They will be stopped by air.
And he knew about radio waves from

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.850
Hertz and said could this be some
form of mysterious radiation that is

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.420
capable, and he was really afraid to
say this, of penetrating matter?

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.990
It is 1895. Are you going to come
out publicly and say I have a form

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.570
of radiation that can penetrate
matter? He gets a magnet out.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:44.140
He moves a magnet and it doesn't
change, so this stuff is not

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:48.710
sensitive to magnetic field.
But, if he puts a magnet here,

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:53.380
of course he gets changes.
He cannot see this stuff.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.150
He can only see evidence of it.
It is mysterious. He calls it x,

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:02.920
the unknown quantity. It is x
radiation. This is November 8,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.690
1895. And, to show you what a great
scientist he was,

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:12.460
rather than rushing to publication,
he spends all of November and

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:17.230
December repeating the experiment
and trying it in different ways

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:35.460
until he is convinced that
the effect is real.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:26.610
And then around Christmas time of
1895 he sends off a manuscript.

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:31.220
And it is published in the first
week of January of 1896 and takes

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.840
the world by storm.
He is announcing that there is a

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:40.460
form of radiation that can penetrate
matter. And, furthermore,

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:45.070
he has an x-ray of a human hand.
This is the 1890s and people are

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:49.690
very prude, very private,
and he has a form of radiation that

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.450
can look inside the human body.
This is really shocking stuff.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.360
Already on January 16, 1896 there
is an article in The New York Times

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.270
about this stuff,
a mysterious form of radiation.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:09.170
By the way, when he was doing these
experiments how was he recording his

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:14.080
results? He was recording his
results on photographic film,

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:31.626
and his photographic film was
fogging.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:23.280
He had his photographic film stored
in a cabinet on the other side of

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.560
the lab, and half of the time he
would take the photographic film out

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.850
and it was fogged.
He said whatever this stuff is,

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:36.140
it is penetrating everything. It is
penetrating the doors of his file

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:40.420
cabinet. They weren't steel cased.
They were probably wooden file

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:44.710
cabinets. So,
widespread adoption,

00:34:44.710 --> 00:35:03.686
some of it silly. What are some of
the silly ones?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:53.130
In London there was a manufacturer
who announced,

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.260
remember this is prudish Victorian
England, that he could sell you

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:01.390
x-ray proof ladies underwear.
In France, there was no such thing.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:05.530
The French don't care about such
matters. Remember,

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.660
the French Daguerre had invented
halide photography.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:13.790
So someone in France offered to
x-ray the human soul.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.930
This is very good. I am ashamed to
say what happened in

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:22.800
the United States.
The New York City College of

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:28.400
Physicians and Surgeons announced
that they would use x-rays to

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:47.333
project anatomical diagrams from
textbooks onto the brains of medical

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:39.600
students, thereby creating,
and I quote, an enduring impression.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:45.190
In Iowa, somebody offered to x-ray
copper pennies and thereby turn them

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:49.770
into gold. That is what happened.
But, seriously,

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:53.330
what really did happen very quickly
was the use of x-rays as a

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.880
diagnostic tool.
Already in February of 1896 there

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.440
was a Scottish physician who used
x-rays. It is simple.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.990
You could do this in a high school.
I mean what is it? It is just a

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.550
gas discharge tube,
a pair of electrodes with a feed

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.100
through, and he has 35,
00 volts, I mean that is the kind of

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.660
stuff that comes off the chassis of
your television set.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.220
This is trivial stuff.
People were putting these things

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:21.870
everywhere.
They were sitting in offices in open

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:25.620
view. Nobody knew.
This physician had a seamstress

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:29.370
come to him. She was involved in an
industrial accident in a mill.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.120
A needle broke off in her hand.
Now, how would you find the needle

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.870
in a hand? You cannot.
X-ray, they identified the location

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:40.620
of the needle,
performed the surgery and boom.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.370
For dental applications it was
immediately adopted.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.120
They were already using it in 1899
as a form of treatment for cancer.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.300
Very interesting.
It took over. What is the relative

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.920
physics? What is going on here?
Where do we have to go? I say we

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.530
have to look at the anode because
that is where the electrons are

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:06.150
crashing into.
That is the site of the collision.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:10.760
Something is happening at that
anode. Let's look inside the anode.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.380
Suppose it is copper, what could we
say about it? This is where the

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:34.026
electron collision is.
That is the maximum impact.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:25.270
Let's just see what might be going
on. I want to show you the power of

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:30.540
estimation. I have shown you that
with nitrogen it is 668 electron

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.810
volts to get to the inner shell
electrons. What about in the case

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:41.080
of the anode? What is going on
there? Well, I can say what is the

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:46.360
energy of the 1s electron in copper
28 plus? That is a one

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.270
electron system.
And you know that in real copper

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.810
with all of its electrons this value
is going to be an over-estimate

00:37:55.810 --> 00:38:00.360
because the presence of all the
other electrons is going to sap some

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.900
of the protonic Coulombic force.
This will be an upper bound of what

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:09.450
that energy could be.
And we know that is simply equal to

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:28.100
the energy of the 1s in hydrogen
times z squared.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
If I take 13.6 electron volts times
29 squared, I get 11.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
thousand electron volts,
which is still less than the 35

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
thousand electron volts that
Roentgen had. Roentgen is running a

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
huge bowling alley here.
He is able to knock out 1s

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
electrons from copper.
And what happens when you knock out

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
inner shell electrons?
What is the next thing that happens?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Let's look at an energy
level diagram.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:53.130
Let's suppose that this is the anode.
This is the anode in the gas tube.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:57.260
This is an energy level diagram.
This is going to be n equals

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.390
infinity. And we will just do a few
of them. This is n equals four,

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.530
n equals three, n equals two and n
equals one. Not to scale.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:09.660
I am trying to show that they are a
little bit farther apart as you go

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.790
lower and lower.
And so this is ground state energy

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:17.930
E1, this is n equals two shell,
n equals three shell, n equals four

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:22.300
shell.
And out here it is zero.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:26.920
And so what do I have? I have some
incident electron that comes zooming

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.530
in here. This is incident.
This is the one that has been

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:36.150
accelerated. The energy of this
electron is all kinetic.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:40.760
And that is equal to product of the
charge on the electron which is

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.380
elemental e times a plate voltage
which is 35 thousand volts.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:40:04.626
That is how I get 35 thousand
electron volts as the energy.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:54.610
And we have just shown that it has
enough energy that it can even knock

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.220
out an inner shell electron.
It can even dislodge an inner shell

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:03.840
electron. Let's see what would
happen if that were the case.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.460
It dislodges an inner shell
electron. What is the next thing?

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:13.070
I have a vacancy down here. What
will happen? One electron will fall

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.690
from n equals two to n equals one.
And when it does so it gives off

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:31.380
radiation.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:28.570
Well, if it falls from n equals two
to n equals one,

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.140
there is a slim chance it might even
fall from n equals three to n equals

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.710
one or maybe even n equals four to n
equals one. Well,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:39.280
heck, if it can go from two to one,
there is a vacancy in two. I might

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.850
get three to two,
I might get four to two,

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:46.420
and you get the picture. You get a
whole cascade here.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:41:06.306
Each one of these gives off photons,
photon emission.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:56.900
You have expulsion of k shell all of
the electrons,

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:03.810
but you can go all the way down to
the k shell electrons and then

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:10.720
cascade and accompanied by
photoemission.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:17.630
The difference is that instead of
being in the visible or the infrared,

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:24.540
these energy levels are so,
so tightly bound that this is in the

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:42.113
x region of the spectrum.
And we have labels for these

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:15.500
different photons.
And, first of all,

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.500
the spectroscopists don't like the
numbers. This is the chemist

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:25.500
notation, n equals one,
n equals two, n equals three,

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.500
n equals four. The spectroscopists
call the ground state k shell,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:56.220
this is m shell, this is n shell.
I left out a letter in the alphabet.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:02.660
K, l shell, m shell, n shell. We
can label this as a photon that came

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:09.110
from a cascade down to the k shell.
And to distinguish this k shell

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:15.550
electron from the k shell electron
involving a transition from n equals

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:32.700
three down to n equals one,
we have a second indicator.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:30.750
And that is the subscript alpha.
This means the cascade down to k

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:46.533
shell and the alpha represents how
far the electron traveled from one

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:48.250
shell away. That means from n
equals two to n equals one,

00:42:48.250 --> 00:43:02.766
this is a k beta photon, this is a k
gamma photon.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:43:00.830
This is like a Lyman series.
This is like a Balmer series

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:04.660
because it always ends at n equals
two. N equals three to n equals two

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.490
gives us a photon,
and that photon is going to be

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:12.330
called L alpha.
N equals four to n equals two will

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:16.160
give us a photon,
and that is going to be called L

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:34.986
beta. I am going to get
a whole spectrum.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:24.830
Let's take a look at what that
spectrum might look like.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:29.660
I could calculate any one of these.
I could say lambda of copper k

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.490
alpha would equal what?
It is the same as you have seen

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:39.330
before, hc over what?
The energy of n equals two shell to

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:44.160
energy of n equals one shell.
**lambda Cu K alpha = hc/(E2-E1)

00:43:44.160 --> 00:44:01.653
What can we do? We
can measure this.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:53.610
We know h and c.
We can calculate what those energy

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:58.220
levels are. Let's plot this out.
I could make a plot of wavelength

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:02.840
intensity and I will get an entire
spectrum of lines.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.460
This is high wavelength so that
means energy is increasing from

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:12.070
right to left.
The highest energy is over here.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:16.690
What's the highest energy up there?
The highest energy looks like n

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:21.900
equals four down to n equals one.
And that is going to be over here.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:27.700
This could be k gamma, then k beta,
k alpha. And then the L lines are

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:33.490
three to two, four to two,
so they are over here. This is L

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:39.290
alpha, L beta and so on.
And these different wavelengths are

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:45.090
associated with different energies.
And these different energies are

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:50.900
associated with what?
They are associated with the binding

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:56.720
inside the atom,
inside the target.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:02.540
Every target has its own number of
protons, its own number of electrons,

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:08.360
so this set of lines is
characteristic of the target.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:14.180
And I had to do a whole year of
x-ray crystallography as a junior

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:32.560
back at the University of Toronto.
We used copper as the target.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:25.070
And I will know on my deathbed that
the wavelength of copper k alpha is

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:30.150
1.5418 angstroms.
If I walk into the room and see 1.

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:35.220
418 angstroms, that is copper. It
comes from copper.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:40.300
And any other element is going to
give me a different set of lines.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:45.380
What I am learning here is I have a
way of identifying elements.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:50.460
This is now turning into something
that could be a technique

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:55.750
of chemical analysis.
And we will return next day to see

00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:01.250
what else we can do with it.
For the last five minutes, I am

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:06.750
going to show you a little bit more
about Roentgen and his discovery.

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:12.250
But I wanted to just draw attention
to our winner from Friday who was

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:17.750
unable to attend the lecture.
And so I want to ask Nivair Gabriel

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:23.250
to stand and accept her
acknowledgment for the fine job she

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:27.800
did on the Actinides thing.
And she is wearing her scarf.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.400
Why don't you come down and people
can see you wearing the really super

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:50.866
hot American Chemical Society
scarf. [APPLAUSE]

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:46.660
Now, here is the dark and stormy

00:46:46.660 --> 00:47:05.986
night the following morning.
It is sunny.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:55.810
This is Roentgen's laboratory on the
second floor of his flat in WŸrzburg.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:47:01.630
It is a museum today.
And you can see the tubes and the

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:07.450
lead wires going down to the
basement and so on.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:13.270
Hold it. I don't want a lot of
noise. This is the first radiograph

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:19.090
ever. This is Roentgen's wife
Bertha. He noticed that there was a

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:24.150
shadow with the lead.
Roentgen was smart.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:28.460
He had to share the glory so he
said, honey, would you mind coming

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:32.760
upstairs, I would like to take your
picture. And so Bertha put her hand

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.070
in the path of the x-ray,
and for 15 full minutes waited while

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:41.380
those x-rays went through.
You can see the ring on her finger

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:45.690
and so on. She endured in that 15
minutes greater than a lifetime dose

00:47:45.690 --> 00:48:06.046
of what we would consider safe today.
People just did not know. Anyway.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:54.920
This gave birth to medical
radiography. And I would,

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:59.840
just out of curiosity, like to know
if there is anybody in this room who

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.760
has never had a medical or dental
x-ray. I see very few.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.690
I see a few hands. To you I say
congratulations and I hope you keep

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:14.610
up the good work.
Here is the second thing.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:19.530
We have radiography that came out
of Roentgen's discovery.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:23.860
Roentgen had a torsion balance.
Like the Justice,

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.590
she has the two scales.
On one scale you put the unknown

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:31.330
and the other scale you put the
calibrated mass.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:35.060
He had a set of brass weights here
in a wooden box,

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.790
and he closed the wooden box and
irradiated the box with the x-rays

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.530
and took this photograph.
And what do you see? You see that

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:46.260
different materials have different
electron densities and,

00:48:46.260 --> 00:49:06.453
therefore, the wood is transparent,
more or less, to x-rays.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:55.090
Whereas, the brass is less so.
You have a differentiation. The

00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:00.180
way we see things is by
differentiation.

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:05.270
Here you have a differentiation.
He could identify what was in the

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:10.360
box when the box was closed.
That gives rise to security

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:15.450
technology. Every time you go to
the airport you are subjected to

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:20.640
this, and it started with Roentgen.
Roentgen also had a gun.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:25.920
It was a musket. He wasn't holding
up convenience stores.

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:31.210
What are you laughing at?
He had a gun. He went hunting.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:36.490
He took an x-radiograph of his gun.
And this is used today. It gives

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:41.780
birth to the technology of failure
analysis. In fact,

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:47.070
there are certain types of weld,
typically involving very dangerous

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:52.350
circumstances such as pressure
vessels that are going to contain

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:57.800
steam at very, very high pressures.
The code is that every inch of the

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:03.400
welded seam must be inspected by
x-radiation in order to find what?

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:22.466
Internal cracks. Because, if there
is a crack, there is a difference in

00:49:49.000 --> 00:50:14.600
electron density.
And so you will see contrast in the

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:20.190
x-ray photograph.
From that experiment come three

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:25.150
technologies.
And for his work,

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:29.460
Roentgen was the recipient of the
very first Nobel prize in physics.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.760
It was awarded in 1901. He was the
unanimous choice of the world

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.070
physics community for what he had
done. And you are going to see next

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:42.380
day more that the discovery of
x-rays enabled.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.690
But one last thing,
what a fine human being he was.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:51:04.913
You know what he did with his
winnings?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.500
He donated them to the University of
WŸrzburg to be made an endowment for

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.000
student scholarships.
And, to this day, physics students

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:44.500
at the University of WŸrzburg are
recipients of scholarships that were

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:49.000
endowed by Roentgen with his Nobel
prize winnings in 1901.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.866
I will see you on Wednesday.
