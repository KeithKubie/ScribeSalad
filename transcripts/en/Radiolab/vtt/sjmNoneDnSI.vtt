Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab, the podcast.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.640
Okay. So a little while ago we were talking to our friend, right.

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:12.180
Am I on or do I send a regular guest? Steve Strogatz. Yeah, try that.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.450
He's a math professor at Cornell. Talk out of the shot in my mouth. Shane.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.000
He does have some mic positioning issues,

6
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.850
but he came to our studio because he wanted to tell us about something he'd

7
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.170
seen. It kind of made him go, Whoa, man.

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.350
And I just had all these funny deep thoughts and it had to do,

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.213
oddly enough.

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.100
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.630
<v 0>with a slinky. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.120
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.520
<v 0>no, there's, I mean there's actually a little more of a story.</v>

14
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:44.580
I don't know if you want to make it a real story. Yeah. Story it up there. Okay.

15
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:47.910
The real story is, I was in England, um, you know,

16
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:51.390
the past few months and there's this character,

17
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.240
like England is good with characters. They have these eccentric kind of guy.

18
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:58.200
So they have this eccentric physicist named Tadashi.

19
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.170
He was a philologist. He speaks like 12 languages.

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.770
Then you decided to be a physicist and not only is today she a multilingual

21
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.760
pseudo philologist turned physicist. He also likes magic. Yeah,

22
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.490
he's very good like a magician at entertaining little kids. And so, uh,

23
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.410
one day Steven,

24
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.950
his kids are having lunch with Tadashi and at some point during that lunch today

25
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:21.750
she turns to Steve's kids and he's like, Hey, you guys want to see a trick,

26
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.280
a magic trick. And he shows my kids, you know, here, you know what a slinky is.

27
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.770
Yes. The kids know. And then he holds out this slinky,

28
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:31.890
which is at first it's all compressed, you know, it's a tight coil.

29
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.310
Then he lets it the bottom stretch as much as it wants to,

30
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.220
but he's still holding onto at the top, you know, so it's all stretched out.

31
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.250
And then he says, now watch carefully. I'm going to let go of the top,

32
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.600
but watch the bottom. Watch closely. So he's holding it out.

33
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:50.160
The kids eyes are open wide and then he lets go.

34
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.310
It's like he falls to the ground. But the weird thing,

35
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.370
the unbelievable thing is that the bottom doesn't move at first.

36
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.540
The bottom doesn't go down. The bottom does not go down. He's held the top.

37
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:04.470
He released the top and the top starts to fall. But the bottom doesn't.

38
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.960
When you see the volume doesn't go down, what does that mean?

39
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.950
What does the bottom doing? You're just, the bottom is hovering in midair. No,

40
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.250
like a flying carpet. It's just sitting there, but not for long.

41
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.900
For a fraction of a second.

42
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:19.860
The bottom of the slinky seem to defy the laws of physics.

43
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.310
It looks impossible. Where are they now? Why is it put?

44
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.090
So what would we normally, what would we normally think this link should do?

45
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.080
That it would fall. It would all fall together for you. It's a coil.

46
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:36.890
So can you say the top is pulling on the bottom, holding it up? Well,

47
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.910
let's remember how we prepared it first. We let the slinky come to equilibrium.

48
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.020
We hold the top,

49
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.180
we will let the bottom stretch out as far as it wants to till everybody's happy.

50
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.160
It goes one and a damps itself out and sits there. Yeah.

51
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.220
Okay, so that means the bottom is at rest,

52
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.400
it's at rest because it's being pulled up just as hard as it's being pulled

53
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:00.700
down. It's being pulled up by the slinky,

54
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.970
by the tension in that slinky coil pulled down by gravity.

55
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.110
They're exactly matched. So it says, I'm cool. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.

56
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.290
Now at the top,

57
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.310
the tension in the spring is pulling the top down as well as gravity is pulling

58
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.350
it down. The only thing holding it up, your fingers,

59
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:21.460
the fingers that the next thing that happens is the sinister magician.

60
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.080
Let's go of the top.

61
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.390
There are actually videos of this online where you can see people dropping

62
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.650
gigantic slinkies like a hundred feet long slinkies off of balconies,

63
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.450
and in the video they also slow the frame's way down.

64
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.760
So you can see everything that happens and here's what you see.

65
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.130
You see the top of the slinky,

66
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:45.790
the first coil for his turn collapses onto the turn just below it,

67
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.030
and then just below that one and just below that one,

68
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.630
and you can watch the thing collapse hitting towards the bottom. Meanwhile,

69
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.610
the bottom of the slinky is just hovering.

70
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.530
Even though the top has been let go,

71
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.360
the bottom doesn't know anything has happened. Wait what?

72
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.380
The bottom doesn't know that the top is free where we did the bottom doesn't

73
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:11.650
know where the verb knowing is throwing me. So let's,

74
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.120
here's the way that a physicist would talk about it is the bottom doesn't feel

75
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.240
anything except that little bit of metal right above it.

76
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.170
And as long as the little bit of metal right about hasn't changed in any way,

77
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.920
then the very bottom doesn't know that it's supposed to fall.

78
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.290
That is exactly right. There's these two ideas there.

79
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.830
There's a kind of physicsy idea about what the top is doing relative to the

80
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:34.810
bottom and then there's this concept of knowledge,

81
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.630
which is why I thought this would be fun to talk about cause we don't usually

82
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:42.160
think of things like slinkys as having information and knowledge. Hmm.

83
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.690
There's a con a much deeper meaning to the idea of information in the world

84
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:49.060
around us than we're used to thinking. And Steve says,

85
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:53.740
this goes way beyond slinkies when I drop a pen. In fact,

86
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.160
the bottom hovers for a few billions of a second while the top is falling and

87
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:03.430
compressing the pen, but it's all ha. Yeah, it really has to be like that.

88
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.950
When anything falls, it falls like a slinky.

89
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:09.490
Just the difference being does it so fast that you can ignore it.

90
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.200
<v 2>By the way. Go ahead. Oh, you should know this. That's Neil.</v>

91
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.810
I'm Neil degrasse Tyson and excitable physicist with the American Museum of

92
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:17.590
natural history.

93
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.230
We actually brought them this argument so we could find out what he thought.

94
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.200
I P I played with the slinky are too in my day. I mean,

95
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:26.460
it's my generation's toy. Right, and you never knew, however,

96
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.880
that there was this levitating thing.

97
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.410
I never knew about the levitating properties of the slinky.

98
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.790
After he thought about it for a bit,

99
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:38.791
he told me something surprising that there's an awesome consequence to the fact

100
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.940
that one part of an object has no idea what's going on in an adjacent part.

101
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.690
For example, and anti-tank warfare,

102
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.080
you want to get through armor or an armored tank,

103
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.120
you can fire a bullet into the side of the tank and the bullet flattens and puts

104
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.630
a little dink and nothing else happens. So what the military,

105
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.490
according to Neil, what they do, they shoot rods at the tank,

106
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.460
not bullets, rods. And why do they do that? Why do they do that?

107
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.970
If you shoot a rod, the first part of the rod hits the tank,

108
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.860
it gets pulverized.

109
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.520
But the second part of the rod does not know that yet.

110
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.580
It's waiting around for the wave to reach it.

111
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.010
So then the next piece hits and the next piece,

112
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.040
every molecule of that rod is hitting the tank without ever knowing that there

113
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.310
was a molecule in front of it that got vaporized. There's a bow and arrow.

114
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.090
Same thing with a bow and arrow. He says, if you can you take an Arrow in,

115
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.680
just use your your arm and shove it into a tree. No,

116
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.560
but with a bow, you can with a bow, a powerful enough bow,

117
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:47.561
you can fire an Arrow fast enough so that every segment of the Arrow doesn't

118
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:51.270
know that the front of the Arrow just hit something and it keeps pushing it.

119
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.030
It's, it's, so, in other words,

120
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:55.280
you think once the front of the Arrow hits something,

121
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:57.740
it slows down the whole Arrow. Yes. It's what I think. It doesn't,

122
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.430
the last bit of it hits it at the same speed that the front of it did.

123
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.750
The Arrow saying coming in, Oh God, next part coming in. Ooh, goes away.

124
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.000
It's coming here. Ooh. Sequentially. Straight in.

125
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.360
But now the next bit of Arrow comes in and gets further dig to get further dink

126
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:14.270
to Exxon. It just, it just keeps getting a bigger and bigger. So if you,

127
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.630
if you have a rod that is the length of 10 bullets,

128
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.840
that single rod is effectively 10 consecutive bullets hitting exactly the same

129
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.570
spot. So the military has exploited this fact,

130
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.700
this simple slinky fact that one part of the slinky has no clue what's going on

131
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:32.390
with the rest of it.

132
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.700
<v 0>That's right. This is the nature of reality.</v>

133
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:36.710
The slinky shows you how it really is,

134
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.490
so you're saying the slinky reveals something about the nature of everything.

135
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.511
There you go.

136
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:46.240
That's why I think it's so cool that what it's revealing is what physicists call

137
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.113
it locality.

138
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.530
All you can feel in this world and in this life is what's right on you.

139
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.120
What's right on your fingertips, what's right on your senses and you don't know.

140
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.590
I don't want to say what I want to say.

141
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.730
You don't know anything until the right wave hits you.

142
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.700
<v 2>The example I like to think of is the sun. The Sun is there.</v>

143
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.130
We feel its gravity. It's warm Fitz light.

144
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.670
If some cosmic force plucked the sun from the center of the solar system

145
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.210
instantaneously, we would have no clue.

146
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.750
We would continue to orbit this empty spot in space.

147
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.920
We would continue to feel sunlight and warn. When we see a glow,

148
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:30.040
you would see the sun for eight minutes even though it's not there because,

149
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.500
but you don't know. It's not there.

150
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.690
The edge of the way it hasn't reached you yet. The earth doesn't.

151
00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:41.691
Nobody knows it for eight minutes and 20 seconds because eight minutes and 20

152
00:08:42.301 --> 00:08:44.850
seconds after it's plucked from the center of the solar system,

153
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.200
your world goes dark,

154
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.310
it goes cold and earth flies away at a tangent to be lost forever in

155
00:08:50.311 --> 00:08:52.860
interstellar space. Have a nice day.

156
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:59.230
Now this feels like an extraordinarily rich notion in some Greek tragic way or

157
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:04.560
something like you are. When something changes in your world,

158
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:07.860
you are faded to some kind of experience,

159
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.360
but you don't know it and yet it's inevitable. It's coming at you. Yes,

160
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.250
coming at you as the perfect way to think about it,

161
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.340
but what does this do to you to the thought that you are in charge of your own

162
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:24.840
experiences? If if it's just a time, it's just a time delay.

163
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.410
I mean you want to get philosophical and I and I respect that and your one month

164
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.730
you're a philosophical man about town but it's just a time delay.

165
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.250
I mean suppose it happened instantaneously.

166
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:37.860
They knew it happened now instead of a half a second from now.

167
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:39.330
What difference does it make to you? Well,

168
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.960
because I have a period of being in the dark that is in a,

169
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:47.961
later on I'll have knowledge that I was faded to a certain consequence and all

170
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:52.470
that time the rest of this thinking was coming at me, coming at me,

171
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:54.420
coming at me, coming at me, coming at me, coming at me,

172
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:58.470
coming at me and I had no idea. I was just innocent in my

173
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.390
end of sneakiness by the way, that happens all the time. For example,

174
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.000
the dinosaurs,

175
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.450
there was an asteroid headed their way and I'm not a last one of them knew about

176
00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:12.180
it until it was too late. This happens all the time.

177
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.670
That makes it seem sort of matter of fact,

178
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.550
I being the man about town as you just described,

179
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.340
but think of this philosophical man like, yes,

180
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.340
I feel that there's something somewhat frightening about this notion as opposed

181
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:25.200
to just simply there. It's not my fault.

182
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:29.610
If your brain operates differently from the inevitability of something from not

183
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:34.000
knowing that it was going to happen at all. You are so calm about physical guy.

184
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.610
I'm not gonna you know I'm not going to scratch my head over this one. No.

185
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.060
If it's when you know about it, you know about it,

186
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.900
but you're anxious about something about to happen to you, but you don't know,

187
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.170
so you're going to worry about the thing that might've happened to you that you

188
00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:51.060
don't know. I can't.

189
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.770
Life is too short for me to worry about something like a Jewish thing.

190
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.400
They had no control over. They don't, don't even know what happened.

191
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.210
Someone said if earth is going to be swallowed by a black hole or if there's

192
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:07.530
some disturbance in the space time continuum, should we worry about it?

193
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.140
No, because you won't know it until it crosses your, your place in space time.

194
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:16.020
So the life lesson here is like you live in your own tempo, you know,

195
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:17.580
and you get your beats and that's just it.

196
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.440
Your beats come to you when nature decides it's the right time. Yeah.

197
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.740
Be at the speed of sound, the speed of light, the speed of electrical impulses.

198
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:31.070
We will forever be victims of the time delay between information around us and

199
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:32.850
our capacity to receive it.

200
00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.620
<v 1>Yeah, that's it. That's the picture.</v>

201
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.180
<v 2>You're always the bottom of the slinky.</v>

202
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.820
Big thanks to Steve Strogatz who is a professor of mathematics at Cornell

203
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.220
University. His new book is called

204
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.030
<v 0>the big X. No, it's the joy of x or the joy of x,</v>

205
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.640
which is like the joy of sex,

206
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:05.530
but it's missing the s in e and e and the sex and the sex.

207
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.990
But you get the last letter,

208
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:09.970
which is of course the only thing that really matters.

209
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:12.650
As many calculating couples have always said at the end, you know,

210
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.660
just before the cigarette.

211
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.640
I really like the x part and I think we all do it that it takes,

212
00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:20.020
did Neil degrasse Tyson,

213
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.920
his latest book is called Space Chronicles facing the ultimate frontier and

214
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:25.950
things. Also, Matthew Kielty for production health.
