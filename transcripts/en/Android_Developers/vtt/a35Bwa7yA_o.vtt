BEN FRENKEL: Hi,
just to be clear,

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.990
I am Ben-- that
person right there--

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.490
and we are extremely excited
to talk to you about all

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.320
the different awesome
things that Play

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.310
brings to the table to help grow
your games business on Play.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.640
And we kicked off with something
pretty exciting earlier today.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.200
It's about time we retired
the 50 megabyte limit,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.950
and now it's 100 megabytes.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.640
The 50 megabyte limit is dead.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.230
Long live 100 megabytes.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.460
This is definitely
the top request

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.320
for a very, very long time.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.330
So, I figured we probably
can't stress this point enough.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.460
JOHN MCGUIRE: Thanks, Ben.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.230
Hi, everybody.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.530
I'm John McGuire.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.630
I'm on the Google Play
business development team.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.910
And I think that's really
exciting news as well.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.950
So thanks for bearing with
us there while it was at 50.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.760
So we're with a bunch
of-- going to need this.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.220
We're with a bunch of game
developers in the room,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.230
but I want to take
a quick audience

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.970
poll to see how many of you
have made a mobile game.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.740
So, put your hands in
the air if you have.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.030
Almost everybody.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.430
Keep your hands in the air
if you thought it was easy.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.850
It was one or two, or three.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
Well, making a mobile
game is not easy.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.970
And I've done it myself as well.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.459
And I want to take you through
the five phases that we,

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.250
and I went through
making the game and then

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.660
how play can help you there.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.860
So first, you have
the ideation stage,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.840
and this is really
the most fun stage.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.080
It probably involves a
conference room, some pizza,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.990
a lot of stickies,
and you're coming up

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.620
with an idea, maybe the zombie
match-three card battler.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.320
Pretty quickly, then
decide on an idea

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530
that you want to then
bring to a prototype.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.680
And you want to move
as quickly as possible

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.240
to get your game on a device.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.290
And the theme of the prototyping
phase is all about iteration.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.940
How quickly can you turn
around feedback in your game

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.520
and make the game better?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.720
And once you're ready to get
some real KPIs behind the game

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.600
you might move into soft launch.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.600
And this is where you're picking
a territory or maybe several

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.800
and you're soft
launching it to get KPIs,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.180
and see how the market's
reacting to your game.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.394
And then finally, if you
decide to launch your game,

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:25.810
that's a pretty
big moment and you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.350
want to build as much consumer
anticipation as possible.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.520
There's a lot of champagne,
a lot of celebration--

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.180
BEN FRENKEL: A lot of champagne.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.840
JOHN MCGUIRE: --and
that was actually

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.390
the easy part, because
then you have to run

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.790
your game as a live service.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.114
And that's actually
the hardest part.

00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:38.530
So we're here to
talk to you today

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.040
about all the ways
that Play can help you

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.490
in these various phases.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.340
Now, we can't quite help you
yet with the ideas phase,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.590
but we might get there one day.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.370
So, Alpha/Beta testing--
earlier today, Ellie mentioned--

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.030
talked about Alpha/Beta testing.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.430
So this is a feature in
the developer console.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.880
It allows you to upload in APK.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.410
And you can upload it
to either Alpha or Beta.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.820
There are two important
characteristics of this.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.460
The first is that
users always have

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.580
to opt in to either
Alpha or Beta.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.110
And the second is that
they can't leave reviews.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.460
And so while your game is
in the prototyping phase,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.210
this is actually a
really good way for you

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.710
to iterate quickly without
being penalized for something

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.580
going wrong in a game or a bug.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.300
Secondly, Alpha or Beta
can be open or closed.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.920
And this is something we
launched several months ago--

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.310
I think it was two months ago.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.610
So, in closed
testing, this might

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.000
be a set of trusted
testers where you actually

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.800
invite via email.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.010
So, you have to invite
them, and then they opt in,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.340
and then they can be
a part of your group.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.410
Open Beta, or Open
Alpha, either one,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.440
is where you actually
get a URL, and then you

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.030
can distribute that URL.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.700
And anybody with the URL can
download and play your game.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.270
And I think back to when
I made a game in 2012,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.740
a long time ago, we
actually didn't have this.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.050
And this would have been
a really useful feature.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.560
How I would have used it,
is I would have started off

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.650
in Closed Beta with a set
of family and friends,

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.080
and maybe our game team.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.300
And then I would have
moved to Open Beta

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.290
after that to collect greater
feedback from a broader

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.730
set of people.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.100
One of the ways you can
distribute the game,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.460
if you have marketing channels,
you can put the URL there.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.580
And I think it's a really great
feature and one that we're

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.830
going to continue to build on.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.330
So you're ready to take
your game to soft launch.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.820
Soft launch is a
really important phase

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.030
because it's one of
the first moments

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.264
where a consumer's
actually seeing your game.

00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:42.680
And we've built
some features that

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.735
allow you to help optimize
your game during soft launch.

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:48.610
And this is called store
listing experiments.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.390
So, to give some context
the store-listing experiment

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.850
solutions that are in
the marketplace today

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.200
are expensive.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.480
They are imperfect as well.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.380
And you can see here
a quote from Rovio.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.130
They spent $50,000 testing
over a six month period

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.390
their icons and
descriptions in the game.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.470
And that is an
imperfect solution

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.200
and we wanted to make it better.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.650
So, a few months ago we launched
store-listing experiments.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.485
So, this allows you to test your
icon, your video, your images,

00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:24.985
and your short and
long description.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.720
I mentioned earlier that this
is one of the first times

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.180
that a consumer's
actually seeing

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.750
your game in a marketplace.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.680
So, while your game
is in soft launch,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.110
you could imagine testing
things like your icon, which

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.869
is actually the most
visible thing to a consumer,

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:45.160
and one of the things you
might have the most questions

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.580
about during your development.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.430
Here's an example
from a developer

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.720
that we work with
called named Kongregate.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.220
You can see here that there's
the-- during their soft launch,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.520
they optimized or tested
their game-- games icon--

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.020
and they saw a 91% increase
in the number of installs

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.150
they got per impression.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.600
And you think about
the effect of that,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.570
where you're effectively
halving the cost of your CPI,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.430
just by making these
types of improvements.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.430
BEN FRENKEL: When I look
at something like this,

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.580
I have truly no idea in
advance which one of these

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.430
could possibly work.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.040
Is it is it Mr. Eyepatch?

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.090
Is that the best one?

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.580
Is it the girl with the gun?

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.340
Is it the girl
with the red hair?

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.440
Or is it the helicopter?

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.035
Nobody knows, it's
impossible to tell.

00:06:29.035 --> 00:06:31.160
JOHN MCGUIRE: Exactly, and
that's one of the things

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.330
we really recommend is a best
practice during soft launch,

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.170
optimizing these kind
of unknown things,

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:41.620
like which icon is going to
resonate well with players.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.940
So you've made the
decision to launch a game.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.860
That's a really
big moment, and we

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.220
want to help you build as
much consumer anticipation as

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.115
possible.

00:06:49.115 --> 00:06:51.740
So, a few months ago we built a
product called preregistration.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.010
So, I'm a big Arnold
Schwarzenegger fan.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.350
There was a movie that
came out this summer that

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.430
was called Terminator Genisys.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.070
It had the 1984 Arnold in it
and the 2014 Arnold in it.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:13.400
And I went to the developer--
Glu created a game that was

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.160
in conjunction with
the movie release--

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.940
and I go to this marketing
page that they've created,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.060
and I click on the
click-here-to-pre-register

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.790
button.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.640
I'm then taken into the
store, where I can then

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.910
see a big, inviting
green button that

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.800
says Click Me To Preregister.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.732
I then get a notification
that says, hey

00:07:32.732 --> 00:07:34.190
when we launch
we're actually going

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.050
to send you a push
notification to let

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.560
you know that we've launched.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.900
I really like that, so
I click OK, I got it.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.950
I can then go down
the page and see

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.250
a bunch of videos of explosions,
some marketing material,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.730
and things of that nature.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.610
I can also share the game
and see what other games

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.540
that the developer has made.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.090
We're all busy people.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.060
Sometimes we forget
about launches,

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.130
although I didn't
forget about this one.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.000
But when the game
launched, I got

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.640
a push notification that says,
hey, the game is launched;

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.510
come play it.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.390
So I click on the
push notification,

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.310
I'm taken to the store, and
I can start playing the game.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.360
We think this is a really
important feature that

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.110
will allow you to build a
ton of consumer anticipation

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.310
for your game.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.870
If you're interested
in this feature,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.250
talk to your business
development manager about it.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.352
So that's all the
stuff up until,

00:08:26.352 --> 00:08:27.560
and when you launch the game.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.934
Now Ben's going to talk to
you about the stuff of running

00:08:29.934 --> 00:08:32.740
your game as a live service.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.440
BEN FRENKEL: See if we
can-- Yay, that worked.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.900
All right, as John
mentioned, you now

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.890
have launched your game.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.860
You got it in the
market, and now it's

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.190
time to figure out how to
go from merely launching

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.690
a game to having a thriving,
successful business on Play.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.820
And Play Game Services, the area
that I'm a product manager for,

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.810
is built from the ground up
to support this transition

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:02.360
to being a successful franchise
and a very successful game.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.570
And when I think about
what we're trying to do,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.340
it's about giving people
and developers a way

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.520
to create new and exciting
goals for players,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.930
new things for them to do
inside of the game that

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.040
go beyond the core game loop--
things like achievements,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.560
leaderboards, Player
Analytics, quest, multiplayer.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.870
All these different
services together

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.650
make a cohesive
product that allows

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.930
you to be more successful.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.210
And when I think
about what we're

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.920
trying to do, our core mission
as a play game services team,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.620
I like to frame it
around the story

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.180
of a guy named Eric Froemling.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.520
Eric is the archetype
of the developer

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.180
we want to help with
play game services.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.480
He's a one man army that
does literally everything

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.560
for his game.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.820
He is the artist.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:53.950
He is the animator.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:55.160
He is the game designer.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.260
He's also head of
user acquisition.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.590
All of the things.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.600
But for Eric to
be successful, he

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.020
needs to think
about his business

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:08.220
as an ongoing service
he delivers to players.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.320
And a big chunk of
what he has to do right

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.105
is to compete with the largest
possible developers, who

00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:18.364
have armies of quants,
and armies of developers,

00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:19.280
and armies of artists.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.400
So our mission is
to help make Eric

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.060
competitive with big
studio capabilities.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.550
And that's what we're trying
to do with Play Game Services

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.320
And it really starts
off with the idea

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.200
of giving people
the insights they

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.190
need to run their business.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.280
And so that's why we
launched Player Analytics

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.485
earlier this year.

00:10:40.485 --> 00:10:42.860
And Player Analytics is a set
of reports in the developer

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.970
console that give you
insight into what's

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.430
going on in your game.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.390
And this is a
great example so we

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.194
have something called
the Sources &amp; Sink report

00:10:52.194 --> 00:10:53.360
that we offer to developers.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.540
And in the buildup to
GDC earlier in the year,

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.190
we spent a lot of
time with Eric.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.930
We built numerous prototypes
of different reports

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.010
so that we could vet the ideas.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.000
And when we took a
look at the data,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.410
and we shared these
reports with Eric,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.190
we found that there
was a major imbalance

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.840
in his in-game economy.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.580
It's a classic problem.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.280
You're giving away too
much premium currency,

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:23.010
but you don't have enough
uses of that premium

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.650
currency in the game.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.920
And in his case, he has premium
currency called tickets,

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.950
and he was giving tickets
away at an outrageous rate.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.930
And ultimately it was making it
virtually impossible for people

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.810
to have a moment in the
game when they needed

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.490
to make an in app purchase.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.800
And, so, we gave
him this report.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.800
He was able to quickly
identify clearly

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.540
that there was something going
on, that he needed to improve.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.924
So he made a couple of
changes to his game.

00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:49.590
And he could immediately
see the impact.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.460
The line switched.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.300
The blue line, the
sinks, actually

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.720
exceeded, for the first
time in his game ever,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.126
the rate at which he
was giving them away.

00:12:00.126 --> 00:12:01.500
That's a huge
transition for him.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.320
And in three short weeks,
he saw average revenue

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.730
per daily, active
user more than double,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.760
and average revenue per paying
user grow by almost 70%.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.365
That's almost unheard-of
impact to happen

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:15.360
in such a short period of time.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.800
And we're continuing to invest
in more reports that drive

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.060
additional value for you guys.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.901
In particular Eric--
actually, I have a quote here,

00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:27.400
"Player Analytics
has helped me home

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.080
in on BombSquad's
shortcomings, right the ship,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.000
and get to a point where I
can financially justify making

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.540
the games I want to make."

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.330
And, again, we're pushing
the needle further

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.569
with new stuff for you guys.

00:12:40.569 --> 00:12:42.610
So recently we launched
something called the Time

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.130
Series Explorer.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.780
The Time Series
Explorer is a report

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.720
that helps you understand
what's happening in the most

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.660
critical moments of your game.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.280
What happens when people
first start playing.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.020
What happens just before
they leave the game.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.050
And you have the
ability to compare

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.480
different segments of players.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.630
So you can see what
your big spenders are

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:08.150
doing versus your small spenders
versus people who've never

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.660
spent at all in your game.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.810
And you can get a credible
level of detail here.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.650
So, for example,
on line three here,

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:21.217
player number three-- he spent,
or she spent $4.99 and then

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.800
before that you could
see that they've

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.549
earned a number of
different achievements.

00:13:24.549 --> 00:13:27.130
And if you hover your cursor
over each one of these shapes,

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.800
you get another level of
detail about what's going on.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.650
Just to give you some background
here, what you're seeing here,

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.250
each one of these rows
represents a different player,

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.980
and all of the unique events
that happen during the game.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.120
And every day, we take
all of these time series,

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.130
and we take a sample of those,
and we display them to you

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.450
so you can deepen your
understanding-- develop

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.270
an intuition about what's
going on in your game.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.210
What's working and not working.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.970
And we hopefully provide some
presets for this report-- so,

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.600
configurations that answer a
particular type of question.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.900
So, for example, you
can choose to ask

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.230
the question, what happens
at the start of game play?

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.600
Where am I losing my players?

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.670
Is the tutorial wrong?

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.380
You can ask the
question, what happens

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.040
before first spend, which you
can actually see right here.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.210
And what we do is we align
all of the first spend events

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:18.884
with each other.

00:14:18.884 --> 00:14:20.300
And you can just
scan to the left,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.010
see everything that
happened before they spent

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.070
for the first time,
and scan to the right

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.520
to see everything that
happened afterwards.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.501
And you can compare
different player segments,

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:30.500
like I mentioned before.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.830
So, you can develop again
an intuition about what's

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:34.780
working really well.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.630
What's getting your
big spenders to behave

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.690
in that way versus what's
happening to those people who

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.390
spend very little.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.340
And, of course, you
need to understand why

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.680
people are leaving your game.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.990
So, again, we have another
preconfigured report here

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.500
that allows you to line up all
of the churn events for all

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.200
the people that have selector
game in the last 28 days.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.370
And you can scan very
easily to the left

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.250
here to understand
what is driving this.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.500
Is it because people are losing
too often in the tournament

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.100
mode?

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.060
Do I need to
improve matchmaking?

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.020
You can discover
all of these things.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.924
And we offer a set of custom
events you can add as well.

00:15:11.924 --> 00:15:13.840
So, in addition to all
the default things that

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.280
get put in here--
spend and achievements

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.820
and so forth in sessions, you
can log your own custom event.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:22.170
So, any piece of
information you would

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.990
like to see visualized
in this report,

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.670
you can trivially do that by
adding an event into your game,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.295
and you'll absolutely,
in the next day,

00:15:28.295 --> 00:15:30.441
be able to see this data
flow through this report.

00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:31.940
And you can develop
an understanding

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.490
about that specific type of
data that you're looking for.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.030
And we also launched something
called the Event Viewer.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:44.160
This is a general-purpose
event visualizing tool.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.874
And to give you some background
here, going back to pre-GDC,

00:15:47.874 --> 00:15:49.540
earlier in the year
when we were working

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.670
with Eric, the
prototyping phase of that,

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.360
we worked with a
commercial BI product.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.490
Something that you
would have to purchase.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.160
And we took all the
raw events data.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.620
We dumped it in this
commercial BI tool.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.860
And we generated prototypes
of all the reports.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.730
But it was in that
process that we

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.902
learned what are the
key things-- what

00:16:08.902 --> 00:16:10.360
are the types of
reports-- what are

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.490
the key types of visualizations
that were important.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.640
And we took all of
the use cases that we

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.880
found during the prototyping
phase for Player Analytics-- we

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.380
took all those key use
cases, and we put them

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:23.670
into the product.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.070
And so the events
viewer here captures

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.530
all of the powerful things
in this very expensive

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.920
commercial BI product, and we
made them available, for free,

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.590
in the developer console.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.930
Just for integrating
play-game services.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.512
But insights are not enough.

00:16:39.512 --> 00:16:40.970
We're all very
happy with insights.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.761
We give you the best
insights in the world.

00:16:42.761 --> 00:16:46.280
But you actually have to be
able to take action in your game

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.010
in order for the core metrics
in your KPIs to improve.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.680
And that is why we have
launched a feature called Quest.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.000
What questions are are
time-based objectives

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.080
for your entire
community of players.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.020
So the canonical example of a
quest is from this game here,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.190
Tower Madness 2 from
our partner, Limbic.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.240
And they have a weekend quest.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.950
And every weekend, you can
see in the games app, which

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.189
is a companion app to
all these services,

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:16.480
that there's an upcoming quest.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.869
You can accept the
quest, join the game,

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:21.210
complete the quest
inside the game,

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.829
earn the reward in the form of
wool, I believe in this game.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:28.329
And it's a fabulous way
of re-engaging your player

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:30.730
after the launch of a
game without requiring

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:34.170
your players to actually
update and get a new APK.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.720
So, dynamic delivery of content.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.900
That's a big thing here.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.980
Taking your insights and
moving into the action phase.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.440
So I'll go through a short case
study on a partner of ours,

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.760
Concrete Software.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.470
So they've been
around for a while.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.670
These guys are 10, 15
people, and mostly engineers.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.060
And every single
minute that they're

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.830
spending on server
infrastructure,

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.945
in live operations
is taking away

00:18:00.945 --> 00:18:02.570
from what they would
really like to do,

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.850
which is work on the game.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.480
And so, with Quest, they see an
opportunity to get a big studio

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.170
capability that
would've required

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.940
lots of server infrastructure
and other types of support

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.240
and they get that for free.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.030
And frees up some time to work
on their passion, making games.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.740
And this their our flagship
title, PBA Bowling.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.214
So John, are you a bowler?

00:18:23.214 --> 00:18:25.130
JOHN MCGUIRE: [CHUCKLING]
I'm an awful bowler,

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.680
but it doesn't stop
me from trying.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.410
BEN FRENKEL: Everybody can be a
rockstar bowler in PBA bowling.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.380
It's quite fulfilling.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.570
And they have an amazing
implementation of Quest.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.420
They followed all of our
best practices to a T.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.250
And what was particularly
exciting about this use case is

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.330
that they've made it an
integral part of the way

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.840
they deliver new
content to players.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.150
And here's an example.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.370
So, this is a calendar of
promotions from January

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.240
this year.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.000
And you can see, multiple times
a week-- multiple times a week,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.230
they deliver new
content to players.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:03.120
Like, on January 7th, they
launched the Hammer Black Widow

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.090
Legend bowling ball, an
amazing bowling ball.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.040
Honestly, it's a little
scary how awesome it is.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.800
And along with a
new bowling ball,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.140
they had an advertisement
inside the game.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.910
They pushed notifications.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:20.160
They sent out Tweets and
so forth, social media.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.510
And along with every single one
of these pushes of new content,

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.410
they also had a Quest.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.750
And the reason why they make
press such an integral part

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.860
of their live
operation strategy is

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.850
because it had a
measurable, material impact

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.882
on user engagement.

00:19:36.882 --> 00:19:38.340
So what they found
when they looked

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.650
at the data was that, on the
day that a Quest was accepted,

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:47.620
sessions per user were 15%
higher than their benchmark,

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.690
and that that impact was sticky.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:54.720
After a request was completed,
sessions were 4% higher, still.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.480
So you could understand
why they have

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.830
made that such a core
component of the way they

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.860
deliver new content to players.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.300
And we're continuing to invest
in this theme of taking action

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.660
to insight with the
players stats API.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.480
So, the player stats API is
something we just very recently

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:16.100
launched, along with the latest
version of the Play Services

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.110
SDK.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.990
And what it does is it gives
you a way of finding out

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.470
information about what
segment your players are in.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.410
So I'll give you an example.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.110
So, let's say someone starts
a session in your game.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.370
They've signed in.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.800
You can call the player
stats API and find out

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.220
they're a 95th percentile
spender in your game.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.660
You can find out that they
haven't been in your game

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.660
for about 10 days, and you could
show them a glorious promotion,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.550
say, welcome back and
here are some coins,

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.930
things you could use
in the game to buy

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.940
something awesome for yourself.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:55.710
And, so, the key
player stats is being

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:59.170
able to deliver tailored
experiences for every segment

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.840
of your player base.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.870
And you can get things like
what session percentile

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.230
they're in, session length.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.300
And we're going to continue to
just pile stats into this API.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.120
And we think that will deliver
an enormous amount of value.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.540
Another good example
here is, let's say

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.690
you want to monetize
your players

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.840
through incentivized ads.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.710
It's a very common pattern now.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.850
Some of our partners make
up a 50% of their revenue

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.520
through incentivized
ads like this.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.480
But maybe you don't want
to show the incentivized ad

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.814
option to everybody.

00:21:28.814 --> 00:21:30.480
Maybe you want to
reserve that to people

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.740
that are unlikely to ever
spend any money in your game.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.570
So, again, somebody logs
in you call the API.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.680
You can find out they're
a lower percentile spender

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.810
who happens to be highly
engaged with the game.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.750
That is exactly
the type of person

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.350
you want to deliver this
particular option to.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.080
So, we talked about all
of the different ways

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.240
that Play can deliver
value throughout the life

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.640
cycle of a game.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.640
And it's still
incredibly hard to make

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.620
a good game, a successful game.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.870
But with the services that John
talked about and integrating

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.150
play-game services,
those types of things

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:21.120
are the first step to success.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.250
And we can open the
floor for some Q&amp;A?

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.420
Questions?

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.840
I see a hand, I think.

00:22:34.675 --> 00:22:36.050
AUDIENCE: And you
mentioned being

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.070
able to check a churn
point for users.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:42.820
Is that defined by the
developer or is that preset

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.290
by the Google Play analytics?

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:46.920
BEN FRENKEL: So,
how we define churn?

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.836
BEN FRENKEL: Okay,
so the question

00:22:48.836 --> 00:22:50.280
was how do we define churn.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.870
So, it is something that we
set on the behalf of everybody.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.745
But there is a standard
formula for this.

00:22:55.745 --> 00:22:57.620
If someone hasn't been
around for seven days,

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.350
they're classified,
retrospectively,

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.340
as having churned
on the last day

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.700
that they played, the
last event we have.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.200
AUDIENCE: And,
say, for my game I

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.870
want to flex that out-- to
find it is 10 days or 14 days,

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.510
could I do that?

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.379
BEN FRENKEL: Not
today, but this is

00:23:14.379 --> 00:23:15.670
why we're having you guys here.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.628
This is great feedback.

00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:19.937
So, come grab me over some
beers during the happy hour,

00:23:19.937 --> 00:23:21.770
and we can talk all
about the different ways

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.047
you would like to modify the
classification of a churn user.

00:23:25.047 --> 00:23:25.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.430
