00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.400
Sapiosexuals... and 8 other language facts

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.950
1.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.000
Sapiosexual is the scientific name for a person
who is sexually attracted to people’s intelligence

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.640
The first part of the word comes from the
Latin “sapiens”, meaning “wise”.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.670
(QF 640)

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.670
2.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.949
A contronym is a word that can be its own
opposite for example, “left” can mean

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.300
to “depart” and “remain”.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.300
(QF 430)

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.300
3.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.169
You may have heard that “swag” comes from
a 1960s acronym for “Secretly We Are Gay”.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.189
In fact, the noun, “swag”, dates back
at least to the 14th century meaning “bulky

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.189
bag”.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.910
It then morphed into meaning a “blustering
fellow” by the late 16th century and by

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.400
the late 18th century had come to mean “ornamental
festoon” (festoon meaning some sort of adornment

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.750
like flowers or ribbons and other decorations).

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.750
(QF 664)

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.750
4.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:45.750
“Are you as bored as I am?”

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.470
read backwards is the same sentiment, just
one is introspective.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.550
(QF 624)

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.550
5.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.400
You may have heard that the longest English
word in which all the letters are in alphabetical

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.160
order with no letter repeated is “almost.”

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.680
Well, almost.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.200
The actual winner is Aegilops, the name of
a genus of flowering plants in the grass family,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.200
Poaceae.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.479
Aegilops comes from the Greek aegilos and
in free translation means “an herb liked

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:08.479
by goats.”

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:09.479
(QF 716)

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.479
6.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.039
The name “taxi” is shortened from “taxicab”.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.950
So where did “taxicab” come from?

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.350
It is derived from the two words: “taximeter”
and “cabriolet”.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.830
The taximeter was invented in 1891 and is
used to record distances and calculate the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.830
fare.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.210
Cabriolet refers to a horse drawn carriage
where the driver stands in the back of the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.210
carriage.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.159
The name “taximeter” itself is derived
from the Mid-Latin “taxa”, meaning “tax

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.159
or charge”.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.969
The first documented use of the word “taxicab”
was in March of 1907 in London.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.999
Another phrase that derived from taximeter
was a “taxi dancer”, which was a woman

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.350
who sold her services at dance halls.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.350
7.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.990
“Hippopotamus” comes from the Greek “Hippo”
meaning “horse” and “potamos”, meaning

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.619
“river”, hence “river horse”.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.619
(QF 627)

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:51.619
8.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.149
Synesthesia (meaning literally “together
sensation”) is a condition where when one

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.420
sensory pathway is stimulated, a second pathway
will also be automatically stimulated.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.219
In one form of this, for instance, someone
might see the letter “a” and the brain

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.869
interprets that letter as being colored red,
even if it’s not.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.340
In another form, someone might see some particular
thing that in turn causes them to hear a sound

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.070
every time they see that thing.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.340
In yet another form, known as “mirror touch
synesthesia”, when the person sees someone

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.730
getting physically touched, they also feel
as if someone is touching them in the exact

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.730
same way.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.730
(QF 643)

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.730
9.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.510
The word “gorilla” comes from the Greek
word Γόριλλαι (Gorillai), which was

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.080
originally a word applied to an African tribe
noted for having very hairy women, as recorded

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.720
by Hanno during his travels along the coast
of Africa in 500 BCE.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.960
The name was applied to the animal in 1847
by missionary Thomas Savage.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:55.100
(QF 714)
