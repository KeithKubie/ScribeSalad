1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.020
How important
is purpose,

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.020
reason or cause in being successful?
Like the purpose,
your purpose,
right?

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.360
Well clearly purpose and reason and cause are extremely important.

4
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.040
This is,
this is the why of of your actions.

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.840
This is knowing why you're doing what you're doing.

6
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:28.620
This is the commander's intent.
And so you,

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.900
you absolutely,
absolutely,
these are important.

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.430
If you don't know why you're doing something,

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.610
well then let me ask you a question.
Why are you doing something?
It does.

10
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.040
It's very clear.
It's very simple to understand.
So yeah,

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.170
you got to know if,
if you don't know why you're doing something and then what,

12
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.350
what are you going to do when you hit an obstacle?
You're going to stop.

13
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.020
What do you,
what,
uh,

14
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.430
what adaptations are you gonna make when things go wrong to overcome them?

15
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.930
You're not going to make any cause you don't know why you're doing it.
Yeah.

16
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.740
So if you have no reason,
if you have no reason for doing something,

17
00:00:55.741 --> 00:01:00.450
you're not going to do it.
So you got to have a longterm goal.

18
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:04.560
We've got to understand the underlying purpose of what you're doing.
Now,

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.800
this doesn't necessarily mean that it mean that it has to be rigid because it

20
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.560
doesn't have to be rigid.
You know,

21
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:18.270
I'll tell you an interesting case as an example I'll give you is my own case,

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.670
right?
So of course,
you know,

23
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:25.590
I'm all about planning in and always having a longterm plan and all that stuff.

24
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:29.700
But to be honest with you,
the situation that I'm in right now as a human,

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.370
I didn't have a long term plan for this.
You know,
the,
the,
the,
I,

26
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.660
you know,
Leif and I wrote the book,

27
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:39.960
I had no intention of writing a book that kind of happened,
you know,

28
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:43.290
cause people were asking us and as we worked with businesses,

29
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.450
they said you have this stuff written down.
So we ended up writing the book.

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.981
Once we wrote it,

31
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.860
we thought maybe we'd be handing it out when we go and work with companies

32
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.400
literary agent saw today,
let me,
let me show this to some publishers.

33
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:56.370
Publishers on said,
let us publish this.
Okay,

34
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.850
so you figure you're going to publish it.
Well,
even when you publish a book,

35
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.130
you don't expect it.
A bunch of people are gonna read it.

36
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:04.440
You expect that you're going to have a book published and that's cool,

37
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.450
but it ended up doing really well.

38
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.810
So that kind of happened with that.

39
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.960
All of a sudden I was on a couple of podcasts.
Well,
I didn't,
you know,

40
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:15.720
I didn't have any intention when I went on and Tim Ferriss,
his podcast,

41
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.600
I didn't say to myself,
this is going to propel me into my own podcast,

42
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:19.620
or Joe Rogan's Patty and say,

43
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.630
now you know Joe Rogan's going to launch me into the podcast world.
No,

44
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.930
I didn't expect that,
but it happened and you know what?
It happened.

45
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.390
It made sense to me.
Okay,
these two guys are squared away.

46
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.570
They're squared away in this particular genre and they're recommending my mind

47
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.100
is open.
Okay,
let's try and make a podcast.

48
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.850
Did I know that the podcast was going to be super popular?
No,

49
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.190
I just thought we were making a podcast so that you know,

50
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:47.940
the few people want would want to listen to it.
Cool for.
I mean,

51
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:51.420
then look what happens.
Next thing you know,
we're,
we're making tea,
you know,

52
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.420
next thing I'm making tea.
I had no,

53
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.020
no idea that that t would be part of my world.

54
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.680
So
all this stuff happened,
right?
But,

55
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.870
but the goal,
really the underlying,

56
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.020
the reason for me doing all this is still the same through the whole thing.

57
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.330
And that is that I want to help people.

58
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.750
I want to help people with something that,
the lessons that I've learned,

59
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.590
I want to help them.
So how can I do that?
Well,
you write them down.
Okay,

60
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.440
you wrote it down so people can read it.
Great.
How else can you help them?
Oh,

61
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.190
you can make a podcast so people can access it easily and cheaply.
Cool.

62
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:32.140
Here you go.
So the underlying go,
oh,
you know,
I want people to be healthy.
Well,

63
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:36.010
what's a good way to be healthy?
Stop drinking monster energy drinks.

64
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.050
Stop Drinking Red Bull 12 a day and start drinking something that's healthier.

65
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.050
Oh,
okay,
cool.
Jocko white tea.
Next thing you know,
that's what we've got going on.

66
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.400
So it's,
it's,
that's been my,

67
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.890
that's been my goal and I haven't really,
even though I,

68
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.220
even though I strayed from what maybe the original path I thought I was going to

69
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:57.460
take and I still stayed,
my reason is the same.

70
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.510
And I think that that's what I'm saying.

71
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:04.300
When your reason is clear and your purpose is clear,

72
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.340
that's going to make your drive clear and that's gonna make you execute well

73
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:12.100
because you know where you're going,
you know you where you want to be,

74
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.040
you understand your purpose and why you're doing something and that's what's

75
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:18.820
going to help you be successful in my opinion.
Do you think

76
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.260
<v 1>that like,
oh,
um,
you know,
people,
they'll be like,</v>

77
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.180
this is my why and it'll be like their kids or something like that.

78
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:30.300
Do you think that falls within this like,
you know,
like reason,

79
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:31.530
purpose and all this stuff?

80
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.750
<v 0>Yeah,
I think,
I think that that's the same,
the same general,</v>

81
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:36.190
that guy could have said purpose,
reason,

82
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:40.000
cause of why I think that that the question could have said that.

83
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.880
I think that if your purpose is your kids really clear example,
right?

84
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.840
I have a lot of people might say that.
Well that's cool but that's,

85
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.390
you're going to have to clarify that a little bit more because if your purpose

86
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:56.080
is your kids then quit your job and just spend all day with your kids,

87
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:58.510
well then obviously you're not supporting your kids cause now you can't afford

88
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:01.670
to buy him food.
So your,

89
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.780
your goal should be taking good care of and providing for your children's now

90
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.500
and in the future.
Wow.
Okay.
Now that makes sense.
Now you're looking longterm,

91
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.021
short term,

92
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:13.420
you gotta you know that you have to work hard now you don't have to make

93
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:14.320
investments with them.
So that,

94
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.960
that's the kind of thing that's beyond just a simple,

95
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.420
I'm doing this for my kids cause why are you doing for your kids?

96
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:20.290
What are you trying to achieve for them?

97
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.660
<v 1>Yeah.
So like for using that example,</v>

98
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:28.230
like this is my why,
it's my daughter,
it's less.

99
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.520
This is why I'm,
you know,
I don't know,
writing a book,
it's more,

100
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:34.800
this is why I can endure the hard days,

101
00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:38.760
or this is why I'm gonna continue to work hard kind of thing.

102
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.420
Whatever it is I'm doing.
Yeah.

103
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.280
<v 0>And I just have an underlying yes and underlying reason.
That's,</v>

104
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.340
that's a question that I think that's the answer.
Yes.
Yeah,
it's pretty,

105
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.120
I actually,
I should've just answered that into words.
I should have said.

106
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.620
How important is purpose,
reason causing being successful?
Answer.
Very important.

107
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.880
There we go.
You can have a lot of different reasons to,
you know,

108
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.000
or like a few core read more than one instance.
Yeah.

109
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.400
You know what I'd say if there's anything to be taken away from this question,

110
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.330
ed is,
if you don't feel,
here's the,
here's the,
I would say the takeaway.

111
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.080
If you don't feel some kind of drive in your life,

112
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.660
if you don't feel passionate about something,

113
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.410
if you feel like you're wandering and meandering through the world,

114
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.090
then it's time to assess.
Then it's time to say,
okay,
what is my reason?

115
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.450
What am I trying to do?
What would I like to do in the world?

116
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.290
Now we get something valuable here.
Yeah,
hold on.

117
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.950
We all know that you've got to have a purpose.

118
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.910
Are y'all going to get out of reasons?

119
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:35.300
So if you feel yourself meandering down the path with no reason,
no purpose,

120
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.130
dig in and find one.
