00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.830
As far as we are
concerned, HTTP/2

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.740
works the exact same
way HTTP/1 does.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.130
What changes is the
performance and the precautions

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.450
you have to take.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:12.329
You could start building a
web app with HTTP/2 in mind

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.689
since the number of browsers
that don't support HTTP/2

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:16.725
is getting smaller and smaller.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.100
If you're running
your own server

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.970
or trying to figure out where
to host your web yourself,

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.660
make sure to enable
HTTP/2 there too.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.455
For more information
on how to do that,

00:00:25.455 --> 00:00:27.329
there's a link in the
notes with instructions

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.128
for the most common service
providers and servers.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.670
In the next lesson,
we'll take a look

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.870
at more security measures
like cross-origin resource

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:36.699
sharing, same-origin policy,
and cross-site scripting.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.690
You might even get the chance
to do some hacking yourself.
