00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.320
We have a function
right over here

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.070
defined as an infinite series.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.820
What I want to attempt
to do in this video

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.439
is to see if we can express
it in a more traditional form.

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.230
And so the thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.130
is, well, look, if this
is a geometric series,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.620
we know how to take the sum of
an infinite geometric series,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.940
at least over the x values
where the thing will actually

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.710
converge.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.080
And so let's first see if
this is a geometric series.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.252
Well, the telltale pattern
of a geometric series

00:00:29.252 --> 00:00:30.960
is when you go from
one term to the next,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.159
you're multiplying
by a common ratio.

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:33.700
So let's see.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.300
To go from 2 to
negative 8x squared,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.900
what do you have to multiply by?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.890
We have to multiply by
negative 4x squared.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.910
So we've multiplied by
negative 4x squared.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.890
Now, do we multiply
by that same amount

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.630
to get to 32x to the fourth?

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.580
Well sure.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.950
Negative 4x squared
times negative 8x squared

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.570
is going to be positive
32x to the fourth.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.670
Multiply by negative
4x squared again,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.650
you're going to get to
negative 128x to the sixth.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.350
So the common ratio
is negative 4x

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.720
squared, our first term is
2, so we can rewrite this.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.690
We can rewrite f of x as
being equal to the sum from n

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.650
equals 0 to infinity
of-- let's see,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.890
our first term here is
2-- 2 times negative 4x

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.620
squared to the n-th power.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.420
This is a geometric series
where our common ratio

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630
is negative 4x squared
to the n-th power.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.350
Now, when will this thing
right over here converge?

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.640
Well, we know that
a geometric series

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.020
will converge if the absolute
value of its common ratio

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.760
is less than 1.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.470
So let me write this down.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.730
So converge if the absolute
value of the common ratio,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.875
negative 4x squared,
is less than 1.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:02.750
Well, this-- the way
it's written right now--

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.940
is going to be a negative value.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.920
So the absolute value of this
is just going to be 4x squared.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.420
Right?

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.580
x squared is going
to be non-negative,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.890
so 4x squared is going
to be non-negative.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.570
Negative 4x squared is
going to be non-positive.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.960
So if you're taking the absolute
value of a non-positive thing,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.140
that's going to be the same
thing as the absolute value

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.210
of the negative of it.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.202
So this just has
to be less than 1.

00:02:38.202 --> 00:02:39.660
And the absolute
value of something

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.700
that is strictly
non-negative like this,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.550
well, that's just going
to be 4x squared--

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.350
these two statements
are equivalent--

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.290
and that has to be less than 1.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.060
Can divide both sides by 4, you
get x squared is less than 1/4.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.790
And so we can say that
the absolute value of x

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.720
has to be less than 1/4, or
we could say that negative 1/4

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.460
has to be less than x, which has
to be less than positive 1/4.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.050
So expressed this
way, we're giving

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.150
the interval of convergence.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.920
This thing will converge as
long as x is in this interval.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.770
Expressed this way,
we're really saying

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.110
the radius of convergence.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.510
This will converge
as long as x is

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.740
less than our radius
of convergence,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.650
as long as the
absolute value of x

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.480
is less than our
radius of convergence,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.621
as long as x stays less
than 1/4 away from 0.

00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:40.120
To make it a little
bit clearer, you

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.160
could rewrite this as the
distance between x and 0,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.910
as long as this- this,
you could view this

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.380
as the distance
between x and 0--

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.820
as long as this
stays less than 1/4,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.400
this thing is going to converge.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.510
So this is the interval
of convergence, this,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.110
you could view,
1/4, you could view

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.522
as the radius of convergence.

00:03:55.522 --> 00:03:56.980
Now with that out
of the way, we've

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.688
thought about where
this thing converges,

00:03:58.688 --> 00:04:00.740
let's think about
what it converges to.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.740
Well, we've done
this multiple times.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.250
This is going to be equal
to our first term, 2 over 1

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.560
minus our common ratio.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.810
Our common ratio is
negative 4x squared.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.950
So this is going
to give us-- and we

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.820
deserve a drum roll-- 2
over 1 plus 4x squared.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.430
So this expression is
going to be equal to this,

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.880
as long as x is within our
interval of convergence.
