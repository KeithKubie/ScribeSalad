00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.650
You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio,

2
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.190
[inaudible], c, n, n, p. R.

3
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.743
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.920
<v 2>If you want your animals Frisky, you start as early as possible.</v>

5
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.010
Today's show is about animals and at six o'clock there would be crowds of people

6
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.290
flowing, pushing each other all over the way. Jostling,

7
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.630
luffing streaming towards the venue about people getting close to animals.

8
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:41.670
You have hundreds of lions and panthers, Cheetahs. You have the baboon.

9
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.210
You had an Indian rhinoceros

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.640
<v 0>about what happens when we bring animals</v>

11
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.200
<v 2>into our world. The slaughter is unimaginable.</v>

12
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.370
<v 1>[inaudible] the crowd there is musical instruments rolling everybody. Huh?</v>

13
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.583
<v 0>That's Marina Belarus.</v>

14
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.950
Skyah she's a historian and what she's describing is Rome 88 if you are lucky

15
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:12.070
enough to be alive then and get a seat at the Roman Colosseum on a good day,

16
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.650
you could watch no joke.

17
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.110
Hundreds of animals slaughtered right in front of your eyes, one

18
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.083
<v 1>after the other.</v>

19
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.320
<v 0>All kinds of exotic creatures,</v>

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.830
<v 2>populous never knew what would take place. That was part of the agitation.</v>

21
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.440
They wanted the suspense. They wanted the tension.

22
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.480
<v 0>Alright, so now that you have that picture in your mind, consider this one.</v>

23
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.450
Here we are at the Bronx Zoo,

24
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:45.990
the gorilla exhibit and what you've got her and well, no blood,

25
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:47.850
no cheap thrills, just kids,

26
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.190
<v 1>a baby on the bed, like a piggyback ride.</v>

27
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.670
<v 0>Yeah, lots of kids smushing their faces to the glass,</v>

28
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:57.490
trying to get the attention of the gorillas on the other side.

29
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.040
Real is aren't really noticing. But then, and this is the big moment,

30
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:07.750
one of the dumped gorillas turns around, walks to it's side of the glass and

31
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.443
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

32
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.600
<v 0>today on radio lab. We wonder how did we get here? I mean throughout history,</v>

33
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.840
even before Rome, my relationship to animals is pretty simple.

34
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.400
We brutalized them. That's how it worked. Then in the 19th century,

35
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.130
someone created the zoological garden,

36
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:40.990
which wasn't much better and now we've got the zoo when we still lord over the

37
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:44.830
animals, but now we want to be their friends. We want to help them.

38
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.800
How did that happen and how exactly do you help an animal?

39
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.860
And this is an honest question when it has to spend its entire life in a cage

40
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.470
today on radio lab, zoos are our topic. I'm Jad Abumrad. Well you don't,

41
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.220
I think I take you to the very

42
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 3>moment in modern zoo history when the balance kind of shifted in. Who are you?</v>

43
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.760
Oh, I'm Robert Krulwich and I love the zoo, but do it.

44
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:14.080
You don't know about the zoo. Kind of ICKY.

45
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.100
Why? I just, I want the animals to not be there.

46
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:21.820
And then gave you some somebody who's prettier, safer, safer, prettier.

47
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.660
I'd rather watch them on TV frankly and let them [inaudible]

48
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.500
<v 4>let them run around the room. Well, the guy, this is interesting,</v>

49
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:31.390
the guy who made the big move in modern zoo history. No. Hello? Hello.

50
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.140
His name is David Hancocks. We got him into a studio and he sorta,

51
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.130
he sorted a little bit like you, he, he was very ambivalent about zoos.

52
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.400
I'd actually for a while toyed with the idea of do I want to go and work in zoos

53
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:49.681
and try to change them or do I want to stay outside zoos and work to close them

54
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:50.321
down?

55
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:54.040
And I came to conclusion that there's no way you're gonna close who's down.

56
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.830
The fascination of wanting to be close to wild animals cuts across every strata

57
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:06.190
of society. You know, this is my case, by the way. I love being close to them.

58
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.670
Anyway, David Hancock's decided if, if you can't beat him, you join them.

59
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:13.480
And it was in the mid 1970s and David was working actually as an architect.

60
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.580
He was between jobs when he got a call.

61
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:20.440
A friend recommended him for a job at the woodland park zoo in Seattle. Yes,

62
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.850
yes. And he gets hired.

63
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.910
I was in an unusually fortunate situation in that just after I was hired and got

64
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:31.810
there, the zoo director left and so there was nobody to run the place.

65
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.310
Well except for David.

66
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.370
So he decided to take a look at the entire philosophy of the zoo and change

67
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.380
everything, starting with the gorillas

68
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.040
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

69
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.570
<v 4>awful cages. The,</v>

70
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.860
the gorillas were living in a small concrete building.

71
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.390
It was a spare empty concrete box with a glass window. The gorillas,

72
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:59.740
of course, were bored and slowly going out of their mind.

73
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.630
Occasionally you'd find a gorilla who take his feces and smear it on the wall.

74
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.960
Yes, I'm going. I had nothing else to interact with.

75
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.940
The only natural components in his life that he ever came into contact with

76
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:17.200
would have been the food that he ate and the feces that he produced. So cages,

77
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.120
<v 3>where are the problem? The solution, he decided, well,</v>

78
00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:22.610
he wanted to rip up the cages, yanked them out completely,

79
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:27.320
and replace them with, with something in natural setting of some sort.

80
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.120
But when he looked around for a model,

81
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.890
no zoo in the world had gorillas in what you'd call a natural setting.

82
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:37.950
And he wasn't even sure what is natural for, say, a gorilla. There.

83
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.750
<v 4>There was very, very little known about gorillas, and they're wild behavior.</v>

84
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.600
In fact, all the books said that gorillas don't claim,

85
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.340
this was early in the 70s remember? So David invited a person who didn't know.

86
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.080
I heard about Diane Fossey.

87
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:56.940
Diane facies work was beginning to be carried in national geographic, you know,

88
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.360
Fossey and yeah. From then from that Sigourney weaver movie,

89
00:06:00.361 --> 00:06:02.240
she played the scrum you're playing player for,

90
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.120
she was played by Sigourney weaver. Diane Fossey was an actual person. Yeah,

91
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.500
she lived with a group of gorillas, wrote down everything.

92
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:12.080
She saw all their social interactions at all and was um,

93
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.090
the gorilla expert at that time.

94
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.150
And I heard that she was coming to the u s and she agreed to come to Seattle and

95
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.930
spend a couple of days with us.

96
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.070
We were trying to get images from her of the sort of environment we could

97
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.170
create. And the breakthrough came after the couple of days she'd spent with us.

98
00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.880
I was driving her back to the airport and I said,

99
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.940
is there anything you seen around here or anywhere in this part of the world

100
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.520
that in any way resembles the sort of places where you've seen gorillas in the

101
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:43.400
wild?

102
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.370
And she just pointed to this verge on the freeway and I don't know what a verge

103
00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:51.320
is. What's a verge avert? Oh, sorry. [inaudible] the, the,

104
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.520
the landscape on the side of the freeway, the sloping, what would you call it?

105
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.940
I would call it, if it were President Kennedy, I would call it a a not a,

106
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:01.130
what do they call it? A No. Yes and no,

107
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.110
but I wouldn't call it that because only president Kennedy gets out,

108
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.620
I would call it the green stuff on the side of the road. Okay. Yeah.

109
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.680
It was a banked area that had once been cleared.

110
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.880
And then this verdant growth that you get in Seattle was springing back and she

111
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:17.270
said, theft right there. That's where I would expect to see,

112
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.420
to be observing gorillas in the wild. I dropped her at the airport,

113
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:24.200
came back and on the way back illegally parked on the side of the freeway and

114
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:28.800
took photographs and then said, here, this is what day and fuss. He said,

115
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.670
so as you can tell, we have absolutely no idea what they were doing.

116
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:36.110
But they also didn't have a boss.

117
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.530
And within a few months with help from a landscape architect,

118
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.840
John's from Seattle, Washington, they drew up a plan and out came the balloons.

119
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.390
<v 6>Exactly.</v>

120
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.770
And we were creating huge mountains hills about 10 or 15 feet high,

121
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.630
some rocky cliffs, a long one, side creek cough, trees,

122
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.640
shrubs, about three or four feet high,

123
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.840
big herbs and vegetables and their angles of vines, undergrowth,

124
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.710
lots of Laurel Bushes, hawthorn trees. They,

125
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:10.310
comfrey leaves that we planted have long berries and pointed drip tips,

126
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.360
tropical like [inaudible] growing pioneer plants. Just let it grow wild.

127
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.770
<v 4>Now nobody was watching when nobody was watching us and that that was the</v>

128
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:22.300
critical factor, I think. Yes,

129
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:26.680
because if a traditional Zulu director had seen or heard what we were doing,

130
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.870
they would, he would have stopped it. And why?

131
00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:32.080
Why would a traditional zookeeper have have stopped all because they were

132
00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:33.390
worried about what would like,

133
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.330
suppose you had been a gorilla and you'd live your whole life living in a cage

134
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.770
in a concrete cage.

135
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.040
Right now I'm gonna to take you little jam my baby gorilla and stick him into a

136
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.920
completely new place with sky and jagged things.

137
00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:53.230
I mean, I would be worried that you'd hurt yourself. I in the zoo world,

138
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:56.250
generally, I think people were nervous about

139
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.850
<v 7>it. That's violent Sunday. She was the gorilla keeper at the Seattle's. Yes.</v>

140
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:04.851
I was their primary keeper at that time and the zoo was advised by a lot of zoo

141
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.070
experts that it wouldn't work.

142
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.240
<v 6>I had zoo directors tell me it was stupid, irresponsible,</v>

143
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:13.140
and it was unnecessary

144
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.970
<v 7>that, you know, the gorillas would follow the trees and hurt themselves,</v>

145
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.630
climbed. They would fall on and break their necks on, break their bones,

146
00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:23.480
or they'd get to putting their health at risk diseases.

147
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.650
They would get sick because it wasn't a sterile environment where you could,

148
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.260
you know, disinfect content

149
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.470
<v 6>and that they'd get psychologically. Do you ranged from all this space?</v>

150
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.580
Yes. Sometimes I'd go to David Hancock's things to say,

151
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.580
what are we going to do about these people? He'd say, ignore them.

152
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.350
A bold statement,

153
00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:48.210
but as the clock tick down to the day that these five animals would walk from

154
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:51.960
their iron cage through a door into this field.

155
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.830
It was a real open question at the time. Well, what will happen? I think,

156
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.840
<v 7>I think we were all somewhat nervous.</v>

157
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.570
<v 6>Oh, we were? We were nervous. Oh, sure. How will they react?</v>

158
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.200
What will they do? The truth is nobody knew

159
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:09.530
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

160
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:14.530
<v 3>and so after five years getting ready after 16,000 square feet of guerrilla</v>

161
00:10:15.861 --> 00:10:18.290
display area, we're prepared. Finally,

162
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.070
it was time on this sunny July, I think as I remember, it was a July born.

163
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.590
I remember the exact year, I think it's seventies actually. I just looked it up.

164
00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.730
July 31st, 1979 um, we let them out.

165
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.590
Kiki was the first to to come to that doorway and look out.

166
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.090
Kiki was the dominant gorilla of this group. There was six gorillas.

167
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.810
He was the star. Nikki was my favorite. I have to confess,

168
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.700
he was so smart and he was big. He was six feet tall,

169
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.570
460 pounds. He came into view first.

170
00:10:53.571 --> 00:10:57.860
And of course he's never seen anything remotely like this before. So here he is,

171
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:01.070
this huge creature standing at the doorway,

172
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.570
just looking at this unknown world.

173
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.260
<v 6>You stood in the doorway for many minutes</v>

174
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.330
and finally Kiki's starts to slowly step forward,

175
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.920
first to step in another any window as far as a creek and sat down.

176
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.520
And then he looked up, we noticed,

177
00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:30.850
he looked up for a long time and we looked up also,

178
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.190
and clouds were blowing by med,

179
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.690
fairly low altitude swallows flying over here. There were crows in the trees,

180
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.850
there was a wind blowing. The trees were rustling, the grass was moving.

181
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.310
You could see the hair on his face moving.

182
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.770
He looked up for a long time and took all this in and then he looked down into

183
00:11:50.771 --> 00:11:53.710
the end of the water in a little there. Any,

184
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.800
you could see that he was looking at his face in the water,

185
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.660
which she'd never seen.

186
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.260
And then he just starts looking all around and then all of a sudden he sees us

187
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.590
grand violet and David and a few others were standing behind some glass at an

188
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.790
observation point.

189
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.870
They were about a hundred yards away from the doorway.

190
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.910
He came right up to the glass where we were and they knew that Kiki had been a

191
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:26.470
pretty angry [inaudible] before. And then he did something that, um,

192
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.190
we in a million years, hoped he never would,

193
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.910
which was to reach down into the sands,

194
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.580
screwed his arm down deep into the sand,

195
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:40.450
and he pulls out this big chunk of broken concrete about six to eight inches

196
00:12:40.451 --> 00:12:45.040
wide. And then he held it up over his head. We thought, ah,

197
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.930
this is it. He's going to break the windows.

198
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:55.270
We'd spent weeks raking and telling the contractor to remove all debris and

199
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.140
begging them to check and recheck to look for such things as this piece of

200
00:12:59.141 --> 00:12:59.650
concrete.

201
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.650
And there was so Kiki held it over his head and sort of waved it around a little

202
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:09.040
bit and looked with an angry look at us

203
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.830
and he just held it there.

204
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:17.470
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

205
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.690
<v 6>then he just dropped it. He almost threw it down.</v>

206
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.140
He just sort of dropped it down. We all breathe a sigh of relief.

207
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.873
And, um,

208
00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:31.980
then he laid down on his back and his mate Nina came over and sat beside him and

209
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.581
the little baby,

210
00:13:32.581 --> 00:13:37.581
a little baby came over and laid on his chest and they just proceeded to,

211
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.160
uh, enjoy themselves. Like, like we weren't there.

212
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.380
It was magic.

213
00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.810
<v 4>It was just, it was magic.</v>

214
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:49.900
They looked like different animals, totally different animals.

215
00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:53.020
I felt like we were seeing a gorilla in the wild. Needless to say,

216
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:57.700
we all cried after he came over. I didn't cry. No. Um, but,

217
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.250
uh, I had a lump in my throat. I felt like finally, this is right.

218
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.440
This is really what's right for them.

219
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.280
I remember there was this strange feeling after it is almost like we'd been to a

220
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:14.281
wedding where there was this mixture of happiness and sadness and I think more

221
00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:17.650
than anything else, there was just a great sense of relief.

222
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.411
<v 6>We thought, well,</v>

223
00:14:18.411 --> 00:14:22.010
when will he produce this angry behavior and pound on the glass? And you know,

224
00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:26.030
he never ever did it. The Old Kiki never returned,

225
00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:30.680
never filled his body again. He was never angry anymore.

226
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.000
<v 0>Well, I think what he's saying is that the Kiki had really changed the change in</v>

227
00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:38.240
cages, truly changed the animal here. Well,

228
00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:41.400
this is an interesting science question to, to, to ask about that.

229
00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:42.360
It's like if you do that,

230
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:45.630
if you take an animal and put them into a radically different environment,

231
00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:51.140
how exactly does that change the animal clearly makes them feel better.

232
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.250
And can you measure

233
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.630
<v 9>that? I think,</v>

234
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.160
I think the closest we've come to an answer to that question is a little bit of

235
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.610
gold is actually done a test with primates where she's put them in different

236
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:03.560
types of enriched environments. That's Jonah Lehrer.

237
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:07.190
He's a science writer and regular radio lab contributor and what he's talking

238
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:10.790
about is a Princeton experiment. A group of scientists led by Elizabeth Ghoul,

239
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:15.791
took three groups of monkeys and put them into three different kinds of cages,

240
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:20.480
sort of like a classes and the social classes, like she divided them into a mid,

241
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.090
lower, a middle and an upper. Then we can go through each one.

242
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.190
Let's start at the top. One group of primates,

243
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:29.240
group a was in the Beverly hills of cages. Describe it.

244
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.810
Lots of different monkeys running around today. Lots of social interaction.

245
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.550
They had to forge for all their food, lots of toys. What kind of toys? You know,

246
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.870
squeezy toys or, or like balls I really had, it doesn't matter.

247
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:44.870
So they had lots of choices to make, lots of things to be engaged with.

248
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:48.710
Lots of conversations to have lots of stuff to occupy their mind.

249
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.070
And what about Group B? The middle-class Group B had, you know,

250
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:55.490
we'll call it like the uh, like the standard suburban setup.

251
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.600
Not too fancy that drove a Chevy. And what are we really talking about here?

252
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.660
They just had a bit less of everything that a few less toys,

253
00:16:02.661 --> 00:16:07.310
a few less monkeys in this grand enclosure. So we can say that they had less.

254
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.410
Yeah, they had less than the third group was,

255
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:13.580
was kind of the standard experiments on closure, you know,

256
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.260
wire cage. So they had a lot less. Yeah. All right,

257
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:20.540
so you've got these three classes, monkeys, upper, middle,

258
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:23.420
lower Gould and her team put a bunch of monkeys in each class,

259
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.830
let them do their thing for awhile.

260
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:30.170
And then they took a few of individuals from each of these groups and looked at

261
00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:31.970
their brain. So, so they looked at the,

262
00:16:31.971 --> 00:16:33.980
the amount of proteins you have in your synapses,

263
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:37.280
they looked at the density of your dendritic Arbors, which, which,

264
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:42.050
which is you just say dendritic arbors. Yeah, that's fine. That's a great name.

265
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.870
They, they, they look botanical. Especially when they're happy. There's little,

266
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.590
each brain cell branches out in all kinds of different directions when it's

267
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:52.220
happy. So you get a kind of a bushy kind of a feel. Yeah, exactly.

268
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:55.670
What does that mean? If I'm an animal that good? Yeah, they think it is. I mean,

269
00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:57.500
you can't exactly ask a monkey or gorilla,

270
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.840
are you happy you could doing okay in that cage,

271
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.620
but you can look at their brain cells and ask, are they branching,

272
00:17:03.621 --> 00:17:07.850
are they growing and making new connections and getting full in bushy.

273
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.710
That's what these scientists wanted to know.

274
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:12.350
Which of the class of monkeys had the bushes, brain cells,

275
00:17:12.351 --> 00:17:16.970
because those monkeys would be the ones that are most engaged with their world

276
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.450
most alive. Okay. Jonah. So jumping forward,

277
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.760
Elizabeth Gould looks into the brains of,

278
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:26.840
of individuals from each of the three classes. Yeah. And what did she find?

279
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.740
She found that there's a big difference between the impoverished in the middle

280
00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:35.360
class. Big Difference between the part, between the bottom and the middle. Yeah.

281
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:37.940
The bottom of the middle is a big difference. How big it's,

282
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.200
it's very significant.

283
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:44.350
It was generally between 20% and 40% 40% bushy or brain.

284
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:48.340
Yeah. Wow.

285
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.260
So about the difference between the upper and the middle, did,

286
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.580
what was the difference there? There's almost no difference.

287
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:58.590
No difference at all. That's the weird thing between the lower and the middle.

288
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.730
Huge difference. Huge. But between the middle and the upper Dave,

289
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.960
they really couldn't find much

290
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:05.770
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

291
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.540
<v 9>why will I buy?</v>

292
00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:11.350
I think the lesson is at a certain point it tipping point is reached and your

293
00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:15.100
brain says, okay, we're in a complex world here. We have enough toys,

294
00:18:15.101 --> 00:18:17.410
we have enough social interactions. We've hit the tipping point.

295
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.400
Let's go full throttle. It invest in new neurons and a nice complex brain.

296
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.230
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

297
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.881
<v 0>wait, let me ask you a question.</v>

298
00:18:25.881 --> 00:18:29.960
What if you're a zoo animal and you're living in a crappy wire cage and then

299
00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:34.130
they move you to a nicer one. What would happen to your brain then? Is She,

300
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.420
has she looked into that? Yeah,

301
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.750
<v 9>and a, she's found that within four weeks, four weeks, about a month,</v>

302
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.780
the brain itself has changed. It begins to flourish again.

303
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.590
And how long did it take you say four weeks. Just four weeks.

304
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.860
Imagine mentally like after a year? Yeah. After just four weeks,

305
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.850
they saw significant changes in the basic architecture of their brain.

306
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.560
<v 0>So Robert just imagined Kiki.</v>

307
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.800
Now a gorilla whose brain has been stunted by eight years of living in this

308
00:19:04.011 --> 00:19:05.240
little concrete box.

309
00:19:05.241 --> 00:19:09.050
Suddenly Kiki is thrust outside where the weather changes.

310
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.880
Birds Fly with the rain, falls from the sky or trees sway when he climbs.

311
00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:17.920
Suddenly Kiki has challenges. Choices, right?

312
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.600
And to think that after eight years of being stuck,

313
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.480
his brain could explode with new activity

314
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.630
<v 9>in just four weeks. I mean, but that makes sense. You know,</v>

315
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.180
nature and nature to respond quickly. They're not going.

316
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.330
Most animals don't have four years to sit around and develop a complex brain.

317
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.000
Um, our neurons have to act fast.

318
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.500
The message from this research is clear from the perspective of the brain.

319
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.910
You can easily create a cage which allows the brain to flourish. You see,

320
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:47.310
I told, I told you that if you make the zoo better,

321
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:50.780
you can make the beasts better. This is built in zoos are not horrible. Please.

322
00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.330
No, no. I know they are. Before we get ahead of ourselves, okay, let me just,

323
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.610
let me just throw one more time. Keep that in mind. Yeah.

324
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.280
Let me just throw one more category into our little class hierarchy here.

325
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:04.260
<v 0>Okay. The category of creatures who live in the wild,</v>

326
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.190
no cages. So in a sense, this is like your lab. Yep.

327
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.210
He's paid a visit to a guy named Fernando, not Bot.

328
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.710
I'm a biologist at Rockefeller University in New York, and that's where we are.

329
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.440
<v 9>No, we're in the woods outside his lab.</v>

330
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.940
We stretch for thousands of acres and he calls these woods his real life.

331
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:26.780
<v 0>Let it go. So that's a chicken. That right there. Which one? Oh,</v>

332
00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.590
they're little teeny guys. Huh? And in the trees this fall

333
00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.173
<v 9>are his subjects.</v>

334
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.990
<v 10>What these birds do is in the fall they start hiding seeds or nuts throughout</v>

335
00:20:36.991 --> 00:20:40.140
the forest and they have to remember where they put them.

336
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.580
Winter will come on at some point, everything will be under a blanket of snow.

337
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.160
So have you remember where you hit the seeds?

338
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.510
You'll be the survivor because I mean in the case of chickadees,

339
00:20:52.511 --> 00:20:53.590
whichever is small,

340
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.510
for them to be alive the next morning they'll have to go to sleep with a full

341
00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:02.740
belly. Is that because their metabolism is so fast? Right? I mean,

342
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.220
they're small birds. They lose heat like mad. It's a cold night.

343
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.280
It's long it last 10 hours. I mean,

344
00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.130
you got to sleep with an empty stomach the next morning you're dead.

345
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.350
<v 0>Knowing this not bombed, didn't experiment.</v>

346
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:19.580
He got a bunch of wild chickadees divided them into two groups. First group,

347
00:21:19.581 --> 00:21:22.910
he put in a cage, pretty big cage. And by five,

348
00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.150
by three years of like that second group set free,

349
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.650
they could roam the woods as they pleased over this home range of about 30

350
00:21:30.651 --> 00:21:31.220
acres.

351
00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.920
He did place bird feeders throughout the woods so they'd come back and visit.

352
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.320
Winter time rolls around.

353
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.880
The wild chickadees are out there snatching seeds from the bird feeder and

354
00:21:40.881 --> 00:21:45.881
hiding them everywhere like crux or bark or crackle stone nominee hiding places

355
00:21:46.281 --> 00:21:48.620
are we talking about here? I'm talking about thousands. Thousands.

356
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.810
That's a phenomenal memory tasks.

357
00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.410
The cage chickadees meanwhile didn't have to remember anything cause they can

358
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.230
eat as many seeds as they wanted from a little trough in the cage,

359
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:02.540
not bombed at a brand comparison and what he found was in certain brain regions,

360
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:07.490
the wild chickadees had twice as many new neurons,

361
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.700
<v 10>birth as the case ones. We're recruiting twice as many neurons as the old one,</v>

362
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.350
twice, twice as many.

363
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.280
You know that process of replacement was moving it up much brisker pace.

364
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.120
<v 0>His theory is that these new neurons are always showing up every day like day</v>

365
00:22:21.121 --> 00:22:26.030
laborers. The only question is, is there a job for them in the wild group?

366
00:22:26.031 --> 00:22:26.691
Absolutely.

367
00:22:26.691 --> 00:22:29.990
We need your help to remember where we put all those seeds in the cage group.

368
00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.760
There's nothing for those neurons to do, but here's the sad part.

369
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.940
They still show up, you know, every single day.

370
00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:38.520
<v 10>Right. Thank you.</v>

371
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.150
There's a period of a few days over which a neuron either gets a job or doesn't,

372
00:22:42.151 --> 00:22:46.440
doesn't get a job, and he does. So just offs himself. Yeah.

373
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.940
You don't get a job. You are gone or you don't have to kill yourself.

374
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.870
You're just not going to get what it takes to stay alive,

375
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.330
<v 0>which makes it all the more poignant to me. I mean, in the captives,</v>

376
00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:58.750
you've got all these new cells, they're ready to do some work. Give me a job.

377
00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.810
<v 10>Precisely. Yeah. Yeah. They'd love to do it. But it's a shrinking economy guy.</v>

378
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:03.843
So what can I do?

379
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.650
<v 11>Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm,</v>

380
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.630
mm, mm, mm

381
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.420
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

382
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.770
<v 0>Thanks to Fernando, not bum.</v>

383
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.380
He's a biologist at Rockefeller University in upstate New York

384
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:20.910
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

385
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:23.970
<v 0>and also before him to science writer, Jonah Lehrer,</v>

386
00:23:23.971 --> 00:23:28.080
who is the author of the upcoming book, Proust, was a neuroscientist

387
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.840
<v 3>and coming up, what does a ferocious mean?</v>

388
00:23:32.841 --> 00:23:36.880
Eating 500 pound funeral cat eat for dinner at the zoo. What,

389
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.440
uh, it's such a discipline. Well, no, I don't want to, I don't wanna tell you.

390
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.610
<v 0>This is Radiolab. I'm Jad you're Robert.</v>

391
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.130
And we will continue with our program on zoos.

392
00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.940
<v 3>Different Zoo. What an unusual you don't you wonder like where it comes from?</v>

393
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.830
We have to get away. It used to be [inaudible] one second.

394
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.610
It used to be called the zoological gardens and then it got this like short

395
00:23:56.611 --> 00:24:00.890
name. Yeah. Why is it a song? Let me introduce you. This is an,

396
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:03.860
I believe Mr Lou in the 1878 song called walking,

397
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.280
walking in the zoo.

398
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:10.090
<v 12>Well, keep walking in.</v>

399
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.910
<v 3>People heard the song, they just couldn't think of a place in any other way.</v>

400
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.593
<v 12>[inaudible]</v>

401
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:18.800
<v 3>okay.</v>
