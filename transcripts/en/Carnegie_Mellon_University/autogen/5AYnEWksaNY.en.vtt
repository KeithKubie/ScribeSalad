solutions so we went out there and
 

00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:31.830
solutions so we went out there and
visited restaurants and I guess how we

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:31.840

lab part of innovation works we set

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:45.669
lab part of innovation works we set
 

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:47.430
lab part of innovation works we set
goals with them that by the end of the

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440
goals with them that by the end of the
 

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.010
goals with them that by the end of the
Alpha option we wanted to be making some

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:50.020
Alpha option we wanted to be making some
 

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.080
Alpha option we wanted to be making some
revenue and have a certain number of

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.090
revenue and have a certain number of
 

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.409
revenue and have a certain number of

customers and then we devised a plan to
 

00:34:54.419 --> 00:34:57.150
customers and then we devised a plan to
go out there and do just that and for

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160
go out there and do just that and for
 

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.530
go out there and do just that and for
the longest time before that we were

00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:58.540
the longest time before that we were
 

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.780
the longest time before that we were
sort of stalling and wondering how we

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:00.790
sort of stalling and wondering how we
 

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:04.200
sort of stalling and wondering how we
could develop a product more before we

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.210
could develop a product more before we
 

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.000
could develop a product more before we
go out and get those customers but it

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.010
go out and get those customers but it
 

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.680
go out and get those customers but it
was pretty important for us to go out

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:07.690
was pretty important for us to go out
 

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:10.230
was pretty important for us to go out
there and get feedback so you're saying

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240
there and get feedback so you're saying
 

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.170

medical device clearly you have to have

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920
medical device clearly you have to have
 

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.350
medical device clearly you have to have
a really long vision and have the

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:52.360
a really long vision and have the
 

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:54.060
a really long vision and have the
patience that I don't have but that's

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:54.070
patience that I don't have but that's
 

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.470
patience that I don't have but that's
why sort of i'm attracted to my industry

why sort of i'm attracted to my industry
 

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:57.000
why sort of i'm attracted to my industry
because i can move very quickly fail

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:57.010
