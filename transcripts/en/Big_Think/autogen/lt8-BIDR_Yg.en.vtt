building when you have such a large
student body and you don't have you have

00:26:34.829 --> 00:26:34.839
student body and you don't have you have
 

00:26:34.839 --> 00:26:36.479
student body and you don't have you have
large class sizes there's not enough

00:26:36.479 --> 00:26:36.489
large class sizes there's not enough
 

00:26:36.489 --> 00:26:38.310

really strong authentic and genuine
 

00:26:40.629 --> 00:26:42.269
really strong authentic and genuine
relationships and students basically

00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279
relationships and students basically
 

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:44.009
relationships and students basically
what happens is they don't have any

00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:44.019
what happens is they don't have any
 

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:46.259
what happens is they don't have any
relationships with their fellow peers

00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:46.269
relationships with their fellow peers
 

00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:48.329
relationships with their fellow peers
and and students at a really rich an

00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:48.339
and and students at a really rich an
 

00:26:48.339 --> 00:26:50.700
and and students at a really rich an
authentic level and so when students

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:50.710
authentic level and so when students
 

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.009
authentic level and so when students
feel that they have no power or no

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:53.019
feel that they have no power or no
 

00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:54.839

agency and their school experiences what

00:26:54.839 --> 00:26:54.849
agency and their school experiences what
 

00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:56.609
agency and their school experiences what
often happens is something called clicks

00:26:56.609 --> 00:26:56.619
often happens is something called clicks
 

00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:58.229
often happens is something called clicks
arise so if students feel that they have

00:26:58.229 --> 00:26:58.239
arise so if students feel that they have
 

00:26:58.239 --> 00:27:01.289
arise so if students feel that they have
to real power and get control within

00:27:01.289 --> 00:27:01.299
to real power and get control within
 

00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:03.479
to real power and get control within
themselves and within their ranks and so

00:27:03.479 --> 00:27:03.489
themselves and within their ranks and so
 

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:05.729
themselves and within their ranks and so
clicks are one of the major phenomenons

00:27:05.729 --> 00:27:05.739
clicks are one of the major phenomenons
 

00:27:05.739 --> 00:27:07.529
clicks are one of the major phenomenons
in American schools where they create

00:27:07.529 --> 00:27:07.539
in American schools where they create
 

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:09.419
in American schools where they create
basically power structures within the
