[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.294 --> 00:00:11.710
GILL BENNETT: Thanks very much
and thanks for inviting me.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.400
I should say I'm no longer
the chief historian,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.340
although I still do some
work with the Foreign Office.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.949
But that is a bit
relevant so I'm just

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.490
going to say a little
bit about where

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.200
I'm coming from on
this before I talk

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.930
about the subject of the book.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.500
The Foreign Office these days
is the only major department

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.860
of state that employs a cadre
of professional historians

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.700
within it.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.200
Other departments
used to have them,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.158
but they don't have them
anymore, some of which

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:37.220
they're sorry about.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.150
And the historians
have two main roles.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.120
One is to publish a
series of books which

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.670
are the official history
of British foreign policy,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.700
but the other is something
called historical advice

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.530
to ministers and
senior officials.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.825
Now, that can be
absolutely anything.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:54.660
It can be a very small
thing, like a minister

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.550
wanting a joke for a speech--

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.190
not very often.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.030
They're not usually
very funny, or else they

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.290
think they can make their own
jokes, which is very dangerous.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.510
But it can be major
pieces of research.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.530
And really the principal
role of the historians

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.440
is that when there is a
current policy issue that

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.390
has some kind of historical
controversy behind it--

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.450
and there are an
awful lot of those,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.450
as you will appreciate-- that's
when the historians come in.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.640
Now, I joined the Foreign Office
a very, very, very long time

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.300
ago.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.970
And even when I joined,
the Zinoviev Letter

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.450
was already one of those
things that kept coming back

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.260
and kept coming back.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.640
And because it's one of those
things that a lot of people

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.880
have heard of but very few
people know what it is,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.260
I'm going to just say a little
bit about it in a moment.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.440
To just finish my own sort
of little biographical bit,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.390
while I was working
as chief historian,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.840
I got more and more drawn
into intelligence history.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.810
And that's now really
what I specialize in,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.250
various aspects of it.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.670
So obviously, Zinoviev
is an intelligence story,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.430
though these days
it's better known

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.340
as what they call a classic
case of disinformation, which

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.190
is something that I hope is
of interest to all of you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.210
here in the sort of
business you are in.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.230
So let me say a little bit
about the Letter itself.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.220
Now, this document was a
letter supposedly written

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.350
by a man called
Grigory Zinoviev, who

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.320
was the head of the
Bolshevik propaganda

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.450
organization in Soviet Russia
after the Revolution in 1917.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.800
And it was written to the
British Communist Party,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.370
basically telling them
to up their game a bit

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.310
in kind of agitation,
and to lobby

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.130
on behalf of a treaty
which had been negotiated,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.084
which would mean a
loan for Soviet Union.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:49.000
We don't need to go into
too much detail here.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.270
But the point about
this letter, Zinoviev

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.300
was always sending letters
to Communist parties

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.090
all over the world,
exhorting them

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.860
to greater revolutionary fervor.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.590
So there's nothing particularly
special about that.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.120
What makes this Zinoviev letter
special is when it arrived,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.890
which is in 1924.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.200
Now, 1924 saw the first ever
Labour government in London.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.650
It took office in January 1924.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.090
One of the first
things it did was

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.140
to recognize the Soviet Union de
jure, as supposed to de facto,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.870
so it was a big deal
for the Soviet Union

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.850
to have official recognition.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.610
And then the government,
among other things,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.370
was involved in negotiating
these treaties with Russia,

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.680
which by the summer of 1924
had been signed in draft

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.270
but had not yet gone
through Parliament.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.120
Now, the traditional ruling
parties of Britain at the time,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.480
the Conservatives and the
Liberals on the other side,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.590
they both thought it would be
a good idea to let Labour take

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.840
office for a while and
basically butter things up--

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.310
perhaps I shouldn't say that on
YouTube, but I'm sure I can--

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.220
so that they could show that
they were unfit to govern.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.460
Actually, they'd done far
better than anybody expected.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.385
And by the summer of 1924,
both the other parties

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:09.510
were getting a bit restive.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.843
They were thinking it was
about time to get rid of them.

00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:15.540
And there was a scandal
which involved a threat

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.540
to prosecute a certain writer,
and then they withdrew it.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.980
I mean, we won't
go into all that,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.479
but we can talk
about it afterwards.

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.710
But essentially, during
the summer of 1924,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.040
the evidence suggests that
the Russians were not sending

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.190
inflammatory letters because
they didn't want the Labour

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.600
government to fall.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.910
However, the Labour government
did resign in October,

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.790
the beginning of October,
1924, over a vote--

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.160
losing a vote of no confidence.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.190
So you're going to have
a general election.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.000
It's at this point that
the Letter arrives.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.410
Now, I should point out that
one of the disinformation

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.460
factors in this whole story
is that nobody has ever

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.340
seen what you might call an
original of this document.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.020
There's no letter
in any paper form.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.470
The only text we
really have is a text

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.760
that was sent in a telegram
from the Secret Intelligence

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.820
Services station
in Riga, in Latvia,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.750
to the Secret Intelligence
headquarters in London

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.900
at the beginning
of October 1924.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.280
And although a lot
of people afterwards

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.850
claimed to have
alternative text,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.670
the evidence all indicates that
they are all re-translations

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.670
of that original telegram.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.200
This is a complicated story.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.860
We don't need to
have all the details.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.840
But the point is, when it
arrived, the government

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.710
resigns and the--

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.460
Ramsay MacDonald,
the prime minister,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.920
asked the king to dissolve
Parliament and call

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.610
an election.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.390
So he called an election
on the 8th of October 1924.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.060
On the 9th of
October, this telegram

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.890
comes in to the
Secret Intelligence

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.610
Service, which is what you
now might think of as MI6.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.150
It was called at that time.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.455
MI6 is a Second World
War termination,

00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:06.370
but it's SIS is what it was.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.990
In the usual way of these
things, any kind of report

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.270
like that, it was topped.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.910
It was what entailed,
it was the things

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.565
that could identify it as
an intelligence report were

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:18.660
removed from it.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.270
And then it was circulated
to the Foreign Office

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.030
and to certain other
Whitehall departments.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.950
At the same time, rumors
began circulating in London

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.210
that there was some kind of
inflammatory document around.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.220
Nobody quite knew what it was.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.160
Certain people started claiming
they got it, even though they

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.270
didn't have it.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.520
But essentially,
one way or another,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.860
it was leaked to the press--

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.620
to the right-wing press in
particular and to Conservative

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.580
Central Office--

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.460
so that during the
general election campaign,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.160
the whole Letter became a big
Labour-bashing instrument.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.820
And the reason for that was
that the right-wing interests

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.270
claimed that the Letter
showed clearly that Labour was

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.260
enthralled to the Reds in Moscow
and that they could not be

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.180
trusted therefore.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.180
Now, so all through
the campaign there

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.000
are rumors about this
Letter, and it was eventually

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.800
published by "The Daily Mail"--

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.240
who else, one might say--

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.580
on the 25th of October.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.920
The election was taking
place on the 29th.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.240
Now, there are all sorts
of complicating factors

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.900
in this, one of which
is the official response

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.560
to the Letter.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.600
As I said, Zinoviev sent
lots of documents like this.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.470
And at first, nobody seemed to
pay too much attention to it.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.970
They didn't think it was
different to anything else.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.550
But then they started to worry
about it in the Foreign Office

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.460
because, partly, of there being
a general election campaign,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.100
and because they felt
it was so outrageous

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.070
there had to be some kind
of official response.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.300
Because if the letter were to
be leaked and spread around,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.940
and it looked as if they
hadn't done anything about it,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.930
that would reflect badly.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.490
So a response was drafted
in the Foreign Office.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.770
And the draft-- sorry.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.200
Follow me on this because
this bit of it is important,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.580
though it's slightly obscure.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.740
The draft note of protest
from Britain to Soviet Russia

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.100
was sent from the Foreign
Office to Ramsay MacDonald,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.660
who was both foreign
secretary and prime minister

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.760
at this point.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.090
He's in Wales campaigning
for the general election,

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.730
so he's not in London.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.230
He's actually by himself.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.770
It's not like it is today.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.620
He was on his own
with just a typist--

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.380
no advisors, no
secretaries, no nothing.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:38.640
He gets the draft.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.830
He amends it quite extensively.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.470
And he sends it back
to the Foreign Office.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.630
At this point, the
permanent undersecretary,

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.360
which is the top official
in the Foreign Office,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.830
decides that the amended version
must be what MacDonald really

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.060
wants to send.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.390
And he gives that
version to the press,

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.270
and he also gives the text
of the Zinoviev Letter

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.430
to the press so
that they are both

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.890
published on that
fateful 25th of October.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.670
Now, MacDonald claimed
that he had not at all

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.680
intended that his
amended draft should

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.960
be sent out and published.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.870
He wanted it to come back
again so that he could sign off

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.720
on the revision.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.070
This has never been
satisfactorily solved

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.520
because later on there
are some documents missing

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.615
from the file--

00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:26.730
a good old story,
a mystery story--

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.430
so that it's impossible
to be absolutely sure.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.430
But whatever happened,
it's not actually

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.680
the content of
this document, it's

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.030
what was done with it
which makes it important

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.260
and which qualifies it as
a disinformation document.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.050
Now, the difficulty
is, you could say OK,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.330
it's disinformation,
but by whom,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.810
against whom, and for
what purpose is much more

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.740
difficult to gauge because it
very soon began to be suspected

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.570
that this document
was not actually

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.650
from Zinoviev at all,
that it had been forged.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.050
Some people said that
the Labour Party,

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.570
having lost the election--
although this didn't lose

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:08.980
the election for them--
but they lost the election.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.670
They then accused the--

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.360
well, everybody, really--
the Conservative Party,

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.490
the Civil Service, the
Intelligence Services,

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.200
everybody they regarded
as the establishment--

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.950
they accused them of concocting
this document in order

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:29.235
to damage Labour's
prospects in the campaign.

00:10:29.235 --> 00:10:31.540
But the question is, who
did actually forge it?

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.450
And we still absolutely don't
have a definitive answer,

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.480
though there are lots
of possible candidates.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.820
Indeed, it could
conceivably have

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.070
been concocted in this country,
though that is less likely,

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.750
I think.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.360
But there are very many
different constituencies,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.780
all of whom had an
interest in causing trouble

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.210
in the British
political establishment,

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.940
or indeed causing
trouble in Moscow.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.690
Because it is possible that even
if Zinoviev didn't write it,

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.810
it might have been
forged as part

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:05.710
of an intra-Bolshevik power
struggle, because at this point

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.430
we know that Stalin was
trying to discredit Zinoviev,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.210
who was one of his rivals.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.710
And so there's a possibility
that it was actually done

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.300
to disrupt Bolshevik politics.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.640
It may have been forged by
what we call White Russian

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.180
interests.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.090
That is, the people who
weren't against the Bolsheviks,

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.950
but who were Russians,
a lot of whom

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:30.960
were in exile in
Germany or in France

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.360
and in the Baltic
states, busily intriguing

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.690
and trying to get rid of the
Bolshevik regime in Russia.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.190
And then, of course, you've
got the whole convoluted state

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.060
of British politics as well.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.990
So everybody was
accusing everybody else

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:50.450
without ever being able to
quite get to the bottom of it.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:56.320
But it became known as a
political dirty-tricks example

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.710
that was raised in
successive elections

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.870
time after time,
when, in fact, there

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.490
isn't a decade since the 1920s
when the Zinoviev Letter has

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:10.090
not been raised in the
media, or in politics,

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.710
or in the course of an election.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:17.020
In 2017, during the
election campaign 2017,

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.850
you may remember
there were also kinds

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.030
of things in the press
about how some remarks made

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:28.090
by European Commission officials
might have been deliberately

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.700
placed in order to interfere
with the electoral process.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.330
I mean, it was just
like the Zinoviev Letter

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.640
there, so it's one of those
things that people bring up.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.550
The real truth of
it is very difficult

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.270
to ascertain because, you know,
it is a very long time ago.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.147
Now, I came into this story--

00:12:48.147 --> 00:12:50.230
well, as I said, when I
joined the Foreign Office,

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.938
it was already one of
those controversies

00:12:51.938 --> 00:12:53.590
that never quite went to bed.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.340
But then in the 1990s, when the
Labour government came in, when

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.680
the Blair government came in, it
came up again with a vengeance.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.980
And in 1998 a book
was published.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.010
This book was written
by Nigel West, which

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.050
is the pen name of a former
Tory MP, Rupert Allason,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.840
and a former KGB colonel
called Oleg Tsaryov.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.570
This book was called
"The Crown Jewels."

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.860
And "the crown jewels" was the
codename for information given

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.070
to the Russians by the
so-called Cambridge spies,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.310
you know, Philby, Burgess, and
Maclean, and Blunt, and so on.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.760
And this book purported to
have all sorts of stories

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.150
about British history based
on that information that

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:43.360
was held in Russia, having
been transmitted by traitors.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.270
There was a chapter in this
book on the Zinoviev Letter

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.910
which said it had
definitely been written

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.970
by a man called Pokrovsky--

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.430
Ivan Pokrovsky-- who was
a former tsarist officer.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.060
The book caused quite
a stir in this country.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.270
There were questions in
Parliament on the lines of,

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.150
why do we have to
read about our history

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.910
on the basis of what traitors
have given to Russia?

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:14.320
And the foreign secretary,
who was then Robin Cook,

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.240
at first, he was
absolutely astonished

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.700
that anybody could get
exercised about something

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.710
that had happened in 1924.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.740
But then he soon realized
that in the Labour Party,

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.550
the Zinoviev Letter was
still very much a sore point

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.880
and a hot issue.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.990
And so he ordered
an investigation.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.130
Now, the complicating
factor, of course,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.400
is that the real
evidence on all this

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.420
lies in the archives of the
UK's intelligence agencies,

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.230
and in particularly
in SIS archives, which

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.100
are not open to the public.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.120
And this is how I came
into it because he stood up

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.410
in the House of Commons.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.140
Over my career, there have
been a number of occasions

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.720
when a minister has stood
up in Parliament and said,

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.330
I have ordered a
full investigation

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.350
for my historians.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.120
They never tell you
this beforehand.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.630
You just find out afterwards.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.990
However, he said precisely this.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:08.710
And so my role was-- because
I have privileged access

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.140
to these archives-- was to
go in and to try and find out

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.090
the truth.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.730
He still didn't really
believe that anybody

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.800
could be terribly
exercised about something

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.010
that happened so long ago.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.840
But he was soon
disabused of that.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.220
And when the official report
at the end of my investigation

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.700
was published in
1999, there were

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.460
a lot of messages that came
into the Foreign Office

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.150
saying that their relations,
or somebody had been involved

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.410
in it, or they always knew.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.790
There was one particular
guy who was a very--

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.550
if you do read
this book, there's

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.600
a very strange guy
called Donald im

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.750
Thurn, who, despite
his name, was actually

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.160
a British Conservative.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.850
His son got in touch with me
after the report was published

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.580
to say, my father
would never have been

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.440
involved in anything like this.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.830
His grandson, who was
living in Italy at the time,

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.275
sent me a fax, saying, I
always knew my grandfather

00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:05.150
was involved in this.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.649
So--

00:16:05.649 --> 00:16:07.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.880
So even Robin Cook was
convinced that you can't quite

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.720
put the Zinoviev Letter to bed.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.600
Now, we didn't manage to get
to the bottom of everything,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.666
but I did go to Moscow as part
of this investigation, which

00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:20.540
was very interesting.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.110
This was actually in a
fairly briefish period

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.330
between the end of
the Cold War, when

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.480
things didn't go quite so
well, when, actually, relations

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.310
with Russia were pretty good.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.260
They cooperated in
our investigations,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.160
and they were very
helpful to me.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.400
And so it was all
absolutely fine at the time.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.060
Because they have
an interest, too.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.940
And ever since I did
this, I keep an alert

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.380
on my name on Google--

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.150
I know you'll be glad to know--

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.280
not just to be
vainglorious, I assure you,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.320
because you get particularly
Russian websites saying,

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.710
Gill Bennett has
said X or Y. I mean,

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.620
I never have, and there's
nothing I can do about it.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.785
But I like to know
that somebody said it,

00:17:05.785 --> 00:17:07.910
if you see what I mean,
because you never know when

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.380
you're going to be ambushed.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.814
It's just kind of the fixer.

00:17:10.814 --> 00:17:13.970
And it's partly to do with
this particular story, which

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:20.569
remains inflammatory nearly
a hundred years later.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.390
There were definite accusations
that the British intelligence

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.660
community were involved
in this whole thing

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.540
and that indeed they
concocted the Letter.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.060
I think the idea of them
concocting the Letter

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.660
is unlikely.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.100
I think it entirely
possible that some members

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.730
of the SIS, including a man
called Desmond Morton, whom

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.310
I also wrote a book about,
who was a very, very

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.320
secret squirrel, that he
knew this letter was forged.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.800
And he and certain other people
in the intelligence community

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.550
who absolutely had no time for
the Labour Party smoothed it

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.720
on its way into the public
domain, shall we say,

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.260
and were not displeased
at the way it was used.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.580
But it is certainly a
case of disinformation.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.820
It was smearing the Labour
Party in a way that was unfair,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.250
because actually they were
absolutely not enthralled.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.350
They were very anti-Communist.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.010
They were not
enthralled to Moscow.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.670
But of course, even in
the 1920s-- and this

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.550
is actually one of the
contemporary lessons

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:22.100
of this episode today.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.851
Everybody talks now about
disinformation, fake news,

00:18:24.851 --> 00:18:26.600
whatever you want to
call it, going around

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.720
the world in seconds
because of the internet

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.090
and digital
communications generally.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.420
Of course, that's true.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.610
But even in the 1920s,
a story could get round

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.290
pretty damn quickly.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:46.130
And it only had to be mentioned
in the press, and it had legs.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.110
And those legs could
run an awful long way.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:53.660
So there's no kind
of enormous change.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.750
And how you might deal
with disinformation

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.680
is not that different.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.220
The kind of techniques that
were developed at the time

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.170
to try-- how do
you counter this?

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:07.880
How do you look at stories
which you think might be false?

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.000
And there are techniques that
are used in the Intelligence

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.660
Services.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.490
First of all, you
look at the source.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.470
What do you think
the source was?

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.440
But also you try
to look at intent.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:23.000
In a military parlance,
capability plus intent

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.160
equals threat.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.310
Look at where you think
the story is coming from

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.700
and what interest whoever
it is you think it might be

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.180
might have.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.530
And that does help, A, to try
and identify disinformation,

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.840
and B, to try and think how you
might be able to respond to it.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.980
And actually, they certainly
didn't use those terms

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.440
in the 1920s, but
there were people who

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.360
were trying to do that then.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:53.180
And I just want to mention one
particularly tricky character

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.710
in all this story
who illustrates

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.780
the kind of problems
that they were faced.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.150
There is a man called
Vladimir Orlov.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.730
Now, Orlov had the
distinction of having

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.660
worked in the tsarist
secret police,

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.760
in the Bolshevik
secret police, and then

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.540
for White Russian
organizations in exile.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.880
He set up a forgery bureau
in Berlin in the 1920s.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.790
He was given accommodation
and facilities

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.750
by German intelligence.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.980
He was paid money by
French intelligence,

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:29.270
by SIS, by Red Russians,
and by White Russians.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.020
And he and his colleagues
manufactured documents

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.550
to order.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.310
It doesn't mean they were
all absolutely false,

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.780
but they were expert.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.170
And so trying to find
out whether a document

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:47.480
like the Zinoviev Letter really
was true was almost impossible.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.630
Because after all, you
know, Bolshevik Russia

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.150
is shrouded in-- it's
a very secret state.

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:56.260
They're not going to
tell you much about it.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.040
And Zinoviev's
own reaction to it

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.320
was, well, I didn't
actually write that one,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.070
but if somebody had
put it in front of me,

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:03.620
I would have signed
it, which is not

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.910
terribly reassuring, really.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.245
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:06.245 --> 00:21:08.660
Now, Orlov, characters
like Orlov--

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.340
and he was not the only one--

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.460
make the whole
story pretty tricky

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:17.400
and make it difficult to really
get to the bottom of this.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.670
And all through the decades
it comes up, as I said,

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.040
in general elections.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.320
It came up during
Labour government,

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.200
Harold Wilson's two
governments, when, of course,

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.010
Harold Wilson already rather
paranoid about the activities

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.420
of the intelligence agencies.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.460
In the background of Labour,
the Zinoviev Letter is very much

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.020
something to conjure with.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.650
As I was just saying to one
of you beforehand, Jack Straw,

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.080
former foreign secretary with
whom I worked quite closely

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.560
when he was there, he
says Zinoviev Letter

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.300
is mother's milk to him.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.470
His father, who had been a
plumber and who was a Labour

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.820
activist and a trade unionist,
his father had taught him about

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:03.560
Zinoviev Letter when he was a
little boy as a classic example

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.680
of the kind of things that the
establishment does to do Labour

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.310
down.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.840
Well, he is not the only
one who takes that view.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.100
Another factor that had--

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.840
I'll stop for a
moment for questions.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.720
But another person I need
to bring into this story

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.290
is Kim Philby, whom I'm
sure you all know about.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.240
Of course, he's one of
the Cambridge spies.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.760
But there was a
major investigation

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.570
across Whitehall
investigation in the '60s

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:34.640
that was done as a direct result
of the defection of Philby.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.210
Now, Philby, of course, had
been suspected in the '50s,

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.510
and indeed left SIS, but
he'd been exonerated.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.040
He bluffed it out, essentially.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.170
They couldn't get the evidence.

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.830
And SIS kept on
defending him and saying

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.880
they were sure he
was not a traitor

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.240
so that when he did
actually defect in 1963,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.690
it was an enormous
shock, enormous shock

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.200
to the whole of the
intelligence establishment.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.640
And they got together,
the different agencies.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.160
And they said, look, if
this can have happened

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.640
and we didn't know, what
else might there be?

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.700
So they formed a committee
to try and go back

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.760
through the history of
operations of the Intelligence

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.450
Services to look at other
cases where there might

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:23.240
have been disinformation,
treachery that they had not

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:23.870
detected.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:27.530
And one of the cases they looked
at was the Zinoviev Letter.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.510
And they commissioned
a formidable lady

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:34.190
called Milicent Bagot, who
had just retired from MI5,

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:39.410
to run this
inter-departmental inquiry.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.959
And she did very much what
I was to do 30 years later.

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:44.750
She went and looked in
all the intelligence

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.860
agency archives and so on.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.760
But of course in the
1960s, you couldn't

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:57.480
admit that MI6 or MI5 or
GCHQ actually existed.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.870
They were not yet on
a legislative footing.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.220
They hadn't been avowed.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.680
You weren't allowed
to talk about.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.140
You weren't allowed
to release a document

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.260
that referred to any of
the agencies by name,

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.660
or that indeed referred
to their activities.

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.030
So everything that she
did was under wraps.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.330
And indeed, her report
has never been published,

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.360
although I was lucky enough
to be able to draw on it

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.010
extensively when I came round.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:26.180
Now, the [INAUDIBLE] I do
my investigation, of course,

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.890
the whole legislative
framework has changed.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.180
And all the agencies were
on a legislative footing.

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:35.180
You were allowed to
know that they existed.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.820
You were allowed even
to mention their heads.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.170
And so it was much easier to
then be able to, in our report,

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.710
to talk about what SIS or
MI5 or anybody had been

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.730
doing in the years beforehand.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.100
Now, it still hasn't gone away.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.530
I was asked if I would like
to write a book about this

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.750
because it kept coming back.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.060
I mean, we didn't put
it to bed in 1999.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.060
It comes up again and again.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.130
It came up in the
referendum campaign

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.170
when there was an article, for
example, criticizing the way

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.680
that "The Daily Mail" were
laying into David Cameron

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.160
during the EU
referendum campaign,

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.870
because of him obviously
campaigning, though perhaps not

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.690
very hard, for remaining.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.090
This is just like what they
did to Ramsay MacDonald

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.250
over the Zinoviev Letter.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.370
So it comes back.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.820
When I actually started
looking for mentions of it,

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.840
I found they were everywhere.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.750
And so it is literally the
conspiracy that never dies.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.770
And although I've moved, I
hope, the debate on a bit,

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.680
in the end I do
think that Pokrovsky,

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.500
who was fingered
in the 1998 book,

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.530
is certainly a very
credible candidate.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:55.340
But who asked him to
do it, I don't know.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.850
And there are still any
number of candidates,

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.590
which means that
although I've been

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.530
able to bring a lot more
stuff out into the open,

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:03.640
it's not dead yet.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.230
And the message
of the book really

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.220
is that good
conspiracies never die.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.720
I've got to stop there
and take questions.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.620
Is that OK?

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.670
[APPLAUSE]
