00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.380
&gt;&gt; The answer to the question is no.
China will be able to pull itself out of the

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.180
financial crisis, indeed
it has already done so, showing very strong

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.100
growth.
But nearly all, in fact 95 percent of all

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.820
the demand growth in China is
actually going into output in China.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.159
So it is effecting the Chinese economy dramatically
but the spill over

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.819
effect on the rest of the world is going to
be relatively modest.

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.760
It might add to the rest of the world's output
perhaps a tenth of a

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.970
percent of GDP, or two-tenths of percent of
GDP.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.390
Not enough to be a decisive engine in the
end, though.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.850
China has become the second largest economy
in the world or very close

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.250
to it, it's not big enough to pull the world
as a whole, that requires

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.360
big increases in demand from the developed
world which have economies

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.950
in aggregate about ten times as big as that
of China.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.300
So China will save itself but not the world.
