What's going to happen to milk

00:00:01.326 --> 00:00:02.820
when you take all
of the water out of it?

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.340
How about chocolate milk?

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.460
What's it going to turn into?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.640
[Music]

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.720
Not too long ago,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.300
we had a video where we
dehydrated two bottles of soda,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.240
and the result I thought
was really interesting.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.250
What we ended up

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.620
with was this super
thick concentrated syrup

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.060
that looked really cool.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.874
We have a Coke one,
and an Orange one,

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:29.350
and they both ended up like
a liquid gelatin sort of stuff.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.408
I really like that result,

00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:32.200
and I wanted to try it
with some other stuff.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200
So today, we're going
to see what happens

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.650
if we dehydrate milk.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.950
We've got the Dehydro-Tron 5000,
and we've got our trays.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.334
So we're going
to put some milk in.

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:41.193
But along with that,

00:00:41.193 --> 00:00:42.964
we're also going to try
some chocolate milk,

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:43.529
and I thought

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.540
that there would be
a few different ways to do that.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.640
Maybe we can get
some pre-made chocolate milk,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.052
but it's harder to tell

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:50.949
if that's really going
to turn into a powder,

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.800
and that's what
I'm hoping will get is

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.940
that both of these will
dehydrate down into something

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.240
that can then be turned
into a complete powder.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.777
And I figure

00:00:57.777 --> 00:00:59.750
if we use something
that starts as a powder,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.650
we know that it's not going
to turn into any sort of liquid

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.640
as it dehydrates.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.260
To start off,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.618
we're going to take
one of our trays,

00:01:05.618 --> 00:01:06.741
put in our dehydrator,

00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.391
and add about two
and a half cups,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.760
or 20 ounces of milk,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.900
and then we're going to mix up

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.200
the same amount of milk
with some chocolate powder,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020
and add that onto another tray.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:27.780
[Music]

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.752
Now, what we need to do is wait.

00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:32.702
Dehydrating is not
a super fast process,

00:01:32.702 --> 00:01:35.000
and milk has a lot
of liquid in it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.280
So this is gonna take
a little bit of time.

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:37.838
I would guess at least a couple

00:01:37.838 --> 00:01:40.450
of days before this is really
dehydrated all the way,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.900
and as usual,
I'll be monitoring it,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.600
and if the trays seem like
they're evaporating unevenly,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.360
I might switch
their places in there,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.876
turn the heat up and down
as is necessary.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:51.831
But we're going
to just let this run

00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:54.400
until that milk is
completely devoid of liquid.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400
So while we wait,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.500
I want to take a second
to talk about Audible,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.900
the sponsor for today's video.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.300
Audible has the largest
selection of audio books,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.900
and they're always
adding new content,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.200
so they keep things fresh.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.500
Something new that
they've just released

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.600
is called Audible Originals.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600
Audible Originals are
exclusive audio titles created

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600
by celebrated storytellers
from things like theater,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.439
literature, journalism,
and more.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.545
Since these audible

00:02:16.545 --> 00:02:19.735
original pieces are made
for and exclusive to Audible,

00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:21.025
you can't get them else.

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:24.260
Audible is offering new
listeners a free 30-day trial

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.529
that comes with one credit good
for an audiobook,

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.795
and two credits good
for Audible Originals.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:29.595
With Audible,

00:02:29.595 --> 00:02:31.545
all of your media is
yours to keep, even

00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:32.920
if you cancel your membership.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.149
You can go back at any time
and listen to pieces,

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:37.270
even if you aren't
currently a subscriber.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.640
Recently, I've been listening
to the audio book called

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.280
Legion: The Many Lives of Steven Leads

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.407
by Brandon Sanderson.

00:02:43.407 --> 00:02:45.229
It's great because
I love reading,

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.043
but I don't often like
to sit still long enough

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.580
to read a hardcopy.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.520
Get one free audiobook,

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:53.345
and two Audible Originals

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:54.662
for free for 30 days.

00:02:54.662 --> 00:02:57.260
Go to audible.com/thekingofrandom,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.491
or text "thekingofrandom" to 500500.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.480
That's audible.com/t-h-e-k-i-n-g-o-f-r-a-n-d-o-m.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.400
It's now been a couple of days,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.040
and our milk
is completely dehydrated.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.700
Remember, we had
normal milk and we had

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.934
some chocolate milk mixed in
with a chocolate powder.

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:16.337
So now we're going to reveal
what we've got inside,

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:17.250
what it looks like,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.117
how dry is it,
what texture is it,

00:03:19.117 --> 00:03:21.000
can we blend it up
into a powder,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.219
can we rehydrate it?

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.500
Let's check this out.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.800
[Music]

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.220
There is our standard milk.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.900
Here's our chocolate milk.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.840
So right off the bat,
a couple of observations.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.296
One, the standard milk seems
to be cracking a lot more,

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.780
and it didn't really break up
like that on its own.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.340
Most of that's from

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.769
when I would switch
the sheets back and forth,

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.819
so they had equal exposure time
directly above the light bulb,

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:55.760
and being on top

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.723
where it wasn't quite
so direct to heat.

00:03:57.723 --> 00:04:00.108
And I'm sure my fingers
just kind of popped it,

00:04:00.108 --> 00:04:02.608
because it's very thin aluminum,
very easy to bend.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:03.408
So I do think

00:04:03.408 --> 00:04:05.350
that probably broke
it up a little bit.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.650
But you can really see
like this is dry.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.052
This just flakes
apart immediately.

00:04:10.052 --> 00:04:12.282
Even the thicker
sections over here,

00:04:12.282 --> 00:04:14.260
just completely crumbly.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.000
Look at the chocolate.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.760
So we do have
some crumbliness, definitely.

00:04:19.912 --> 00:04:21.604
Bits her breaking off.

00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:24.728
It's not quite as weak
as the plain milk.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.800
Oh, and then parts,
it's even still fairly flexible.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.440
Something in the chocolate
powder seems to be preventing it

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.500
from getting quite as crinkly,
at least everywhere.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.640
Some of the chocolate seems
to have settled out of the milk,

00:04:41.922 --> 00:04:43.531
and one side is
this light color,

00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:44.589
and the other side,

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:47.150
that's just very much
a the color of chocolate.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.740
Kind of some fun popped bubble
textured all over this.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.320
Now, I know
you're expecting this,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.800
and yes, I am going to taste it,
and see what it's like.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.839
So, here goes.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.380
This is just a flake
of completely dehydrated milk.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.000
[Music]

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.020
It's kind of gross.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.040
I think it even does sort
of have a milk flavor,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.320
but a milk flavor
should only be in milk.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.940
On something else

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.800
that has that sort
of texture in your mouth,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800
really not pleasant.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.422
I don't recommend that.

00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:20.811
Dehydrated chocolate milk.

00:05:20.811 --> 00:05:22.200
Let's try a piece of this.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.020
[Music]

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.520
Hmm.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.100
Well, the chocolate flavor
does come through,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.560
but less than I thought.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.780
[Music]

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.950
That milky taste is
still very present.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.037
Yeah, the texture
on this definitely is

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:39.154
a little bit gummier.

00:05:39.154 --> 00:05:40.288
It's not like a gummy,

00:05:40.288 --> 00:05:42.267
but it has a little bit
more chew to it.

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:44.017
Whereas the plain
milk just crunched

00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:45.209
and crumbled apart in my mouth,

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:46.468
and when I was chewing on it,

00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:48.250
this stuff has a little
bit of resistance.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.760
It's not going to
catch on as a candy.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.740
[Music]

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.560
This does a great job
of not sticking to our tray.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.880
If you saw our
dehydrating slime video,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.160
that was a lot harder to get
off of our aluminum tray.

00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:03.497
The milk though is just kind
of popping right off.

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:04.356
It's really nice.

00:06:04.356 --> 00:06:06.238
We've got two and
a half cups of milk,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.980
that's about 20 ounces
of liquid in this right here.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.549
And in this one,

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:11.702
we have what's left
after we dehydrated it.

00:06:11.702 --> 00:06:13.650
So I want to see
the weight difference.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.040
How much have we lost?

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.700
Start with ounces.

00:06:18.353 --> 00:06:21.200
Now, including our
measuring cup here,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.940
we are at 43.63 ounces.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.420
[Music]

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.300
25.33.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.200
If my math is right,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.040
we have lost 18.3 ounces,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.740
or 718 grams by dehydrating our milk.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.360
So now of course,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.380
what we need to do is to see
if we can rehydrate this.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.640
I think it's going to work best

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.500
if we try and turn
this into a powder,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.892
and then mix it in with water.

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:51.737
We'll measure out
the same amount of water

00:06:51.737 --> 00:06:52.512
that we lost,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.600
then we'll try
mixing it back in.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.720
See if it works.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:13.220
[Music]

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.180
That is mostly turned into dust.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.752
Looks like I do still
have some bigger pieces.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.600
These pieces that were softer.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.480
I'm gonna try
and take those out,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.040
and run them through again.

00:07:26.052 --> 00:07:40.360
[Music]

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.912
We're just going
to stick with grams,

00:07:41.912 --> 00:07:44.867
all of our International friends
will thank us for using

00:07:44.867 --> 00:07:46.750
the metric system for once here.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.350
The weight of my cup

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.434
with the dehydrated milk in it
was zeroed out on the scale,

00:07:52.434 --> 00:07:56.450
and then I put the cup with
the non dehydrated milk in it,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.340
and I get 521 grams.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:07:59.940
So that should be

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.100
what I need to add in water to
get to the total weight again.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.780
[Music]

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.620
There we go.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.540
521.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.120
This is looking super gross.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.120
It's also not mixing well,
so you know what?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.020
I think we're going
back in the blender.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.120
We're going to try
and blend it all together.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:26.700
[Music]

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.800
That looks like milk.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:34.540
[Music]

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.500
It looks like milk

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.450
that's got something
kind of weird going on,

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.711
and there's clearly
some solids still down

00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:41.393
in that did not blend well.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.800
But I think the real test
here is obvious.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.640
[Music]

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.800
That is not good.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.820
So this isn't any good
in my personal opinion.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.100
But it does taste
like dehydrated milk,

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.780
just the product that you
can buy at the store.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.044
I have had times in my life

00:08:59.044 --> 00:09:01.123
where I drank dehydrated
milk for a while,

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.000
and while I definitely
didn't like it,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.340
it's better than no milk at all.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.800
And this tastes quite a bit
in the same to me.

00:09:08.002 --> 00:09:10.350
Think our next test
needs to be to see

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.692
if we can do this
with the chocolate milk.

00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:15.131
Well that restore back
to being chocolate milk?

00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:16.315
Will it be any good?

00:09:16.315 --> 00:09:17.993
And I'm also going to do a test

00:09:17.993 --> 00:09:20.137
where I try heating
up the water to see

00:09:20.137 --> 00:09:22.313
if that helps blend
it back in better,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.580
and to see if it
will make hot chocolate.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.700
We need another
521 grams of water,

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.380
and then we're going to mix

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:30.450
that in with our
chocolate dehydrated milk.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.140
We're gonna use hot water
to see it dissolves a little bit better.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:10:05.280
[Music]

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.200
Ow. My poor thumb.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:18.700
[Music]

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.240
Whoa! Foams up a fair bit,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.600
so it no longer fits
of that container.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.800
I'm afraid this is too hot,
so I'm using spoon.

00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:32.367
That is worse
than the regular milk.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:34.816
The chocolate taste is just

00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:37.816
really not there the same way
I thought it would be.

00:10:37.816 --> 00:10:38.282
I'd--

00:10:38.282 --> 00:10:40.052
It was pretty rich
when I made it.

00:10:40.052 --> 00:10:41.802
It doesn't taste
like hot chocolate.

00:10:41.802 --> 00:10:42.550
I mean, it's...

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.050
You can kind of say like,
oh that's hot,

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.243
and I guess
a little bit chocolatey?

00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:49.500
But I wouldn't call
it hot chocolate.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.880
I don't like that.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.080
And I suppose it's also possible

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.640
that it picked up
some of the taste

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.932
of the aluminum tray
that was sitting on,

00:10:57.932 --> 00:11:00.900
because it does almost have
metallicky sort of taste.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.722
Yeah, I'm gonna go
with not a fan.

00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:07.050
Just want to make sure I
actually got the liquid

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.012
and not just the foam.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.420
[Music]

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.080
Yeah, still not good.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.676
Like it's not like it
tastes like poison.

00:11:18.676 --> 00:11:20.160
You're just like, I-- 
Why would I--

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.700
I wouldn't drink that on purpose.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.982
It's not enjoyable.

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.885
Can you dehydrate milk entirely
in our dehydrator?

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:26.650
Yes, you can.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.450
It actually worked pretty well,
went decently fast,

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.755
and just turned
into this flaky crumbly mess.

00:11:31.755 --> 00:11:33.970
I was able to powderized
that in the blender.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.420
It powderized pretty well,
turned into this very fine dust,

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.920
and it even kind of rehydrated.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.200
It tastes pretty similar
to commercially available

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.880
dehydrated milk.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.260
I did some research,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.060
and I thought it was interesting
how they usually go

00:11:45.065 --> 00:11:45.950
about making that.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:47.550
They'll take the normal milk.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.432
They'll put it in an evaporator,

00:11:49.432 --> 00:11:53.760
something that's slightly heated
to get rid of some of the excess water.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.800
While they're heating up,

00:11:54.806 --> 00:11:57.266
they'll actually also put it
in a partial vacuum.

00:11:57.266 --> 00:11:58.660
The lower pressure makes it

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.450
so that the water will boil off
at a lower temperature,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.731
about a 135 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:08.700
After about 1/3 of the liquid
has been boiled off at low pressure,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.553
they'll then take
the concentrated milk,

00:12:10.553 --> 00:12:12.868
and they'll spray
it into a chamber

00:12:12.868 --> 00:12:13.896
that's heated up.

00:12:13.896 --> 00:12:15.650
Heated so high that the water

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.740
actually evaporates out
of it almost instantaneously,

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.729
so you have these tiny little
sprayed particles going in,

00:12:21.729 --> 00:12:23.375
and then drying out right away.

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.875
So just the act of spraying it

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.280
like that sort of turns it into
a powder already dehydrated.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.640
They don't need
to dehydrate it on a sheet,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.560
scrape it off,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.400
and then blend it
up the way I was doing here.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.350
They just spray concentrated
milk into a heated chamber,

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.380
and it turns into
dehydrated milk powder.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.900
