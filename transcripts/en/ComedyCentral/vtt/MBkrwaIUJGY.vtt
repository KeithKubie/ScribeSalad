Three. Oh, hey.
What's up, guys?

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:07.206 align:end position:100%
- Are you filming?
Is it cool if we're in here?

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:09.175 align:start position:0%
- It's actually very cool
that you're in here.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.743 align:start position:0%
I'm super-pumped.
This director,

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:13.613 align:start position:0%
he's, like, shooting
a documentary on me right now.

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:16.416 align:start position:0%
It's, like,
30 for 30 style, like--

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.317 align:end position:100%
- All this
for Comedy Central?

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.685 align:start position:0%
- [whispering]
I honestly don't know

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:22.188 align:start position:0%
what it's for.
I have no idea!

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.590 align:start position:0%
He says he, like,
knows me from my hometown.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.092 align:start position:0%
It's like a fluff piece,
I think.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.827 align:start position:0%
Just pretend like
they're not even here.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.195 align:end position:100%
- Perfect, man.
We weren't even here

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:30.730 align:end position:100%
to work out anyway,
you know.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.099 align:end position:100%
We're just hoping to see
some girls with some butts

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.668
that would drive us nuts.
- Oh, you dirty dogs.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.470
- Look, it's crazy.
Look at this!

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:39.205
Look, look, he's nuts.
- Oh, break it down!

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.674
- He's driven nuts.
- Oh-ho-ho. You nasty thing.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.776
- Okay, sorry to interrupt
whatever this is.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.344
We need to keep going.

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:46.712 align:start position:0%
- I'm sorry, guys.
Yeah, all right.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:48.381 align:start position:0%
I'll--I'll catch up
with you later.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.583
I hope you're driven nuts...
- My man.

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:52.218 align:start position:0%
- By big old butts.

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.553
- Yeah, what I want to do--

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.088
- I have, like, a little pimple
right there.

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.522
If we could Photoshop
that out.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.091
- It's not rolling.
- Okay, yeah.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.492 align:end position:100%
- So what we want
to do is sort of

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.727 align:end position:100%
get your comedic proc--
I want to film you

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.130 align:end position:100%
sort of doing
what you'd normally do

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.498 size:84% position:58%
when you're writing comedy.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.334 align:start position:0%
- My process
when I write comedy.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.170
[singsong]
I'm writing jokes! Comedy--

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:14.373

 - Genius or idiot?</i>

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:17.243 size:84% position:58%
- Okay, Adam, that's a cut.
That was really good, man.

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:20.346
- Did you get it?
Hey, did you get it?

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:23.149
It was funny 'cause I was
writing under a waterfall.

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:24.750
- This is gonna be easier
than I expected.

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:27.320
[chuckles]
- Yeah, I can't hear you

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.188
'cause
I'm under a waterfall.
