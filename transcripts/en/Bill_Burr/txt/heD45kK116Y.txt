Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 1:          00:00:08       ahhh

You're driving in your car there. You're stuck in traffic. Is this some dose in front of you? Huh? Not doing what you want them to do. Oh, you having a little dictated thoughts? Are you thinking about what you would do if you were in power? What you would do with this person? What rule you would implement? You know, it's gotta be awesome being a dictator. You know what I mean? How much fun is it on the 4th of July to shoot off fireworks? Can you imagine how much fun that fatty over in North Korea is having? Okay. You know how hard did they fucking laugh when they shot that one over Japan?

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       I mean, Jesus Christ, man. How the fuck did everybody had to go to bed after that? Then he's just laying in bed, so fucking amped up. Like I can't believe we just did dead man. It was crazy. We just freaked out a whole country calling each other up. Do the whole world's talking about us, man. What a fucking lunatic. What if there was a malfunction on that fucking thing in any, you just, it landed that guy. I'm telling you man, he's got to lay off the fucking sweet. All that sugar is just sees there's not fucking, it's not doing them good. He's not making sound decisions. Thank God we have such a level headed guy or an arson.

Speaker 2:          00:01:46       Oh my God. Yeah. You know, watching the dead zone was always scary. Watching the Martin Sheen character get into power, but I think to go back and watch it now is going to be just picture and Donald Trump go on. The birds are away gentlemen and doing that little thing. He does what? He puts his index finger and his thumb together and this other three fingers are in the air. The birds of the way, the greatest birds ever. Um, yeah. Jesus Christ. All this fucking ended day shit talking about these goddamn tornadoes one after another. You know, like some battle royal of fucking weather. I did Rogan's show last night. There's nothing worse than hanging out with somebody who's fucking informed. He starts [inaudible] was forming out over the Atlantic. They'd never seen anything like this. This is the size of fucking Florida.

Speaker 2:          00:02:35       Hey Bill, how much time do you want to do tonight? I was in a fucking panic. He was like laughing at me. Go look at Bill's face. Look at Bill's face. It's like, Yo, what look am I supposed to have on my face? When you basically said you know everything, you had everything but Jesus fucking crowd surfing in on that fucking thing. Not to mention I'm going to Mississippi and Alabama this weekend. Okay. Mesh the Yanno. Bam. The harder the FCC, I'm going to tell you something right now is a fucking northern white boy. Yanky. I fucking love Mississippi and Alabama. I love that whole fucking stretcher. The south, how they all shit on each other and then it's somehow lands in Louisiana's lap, right? You're in Georgia and all they do is make fun, Alabama, right? Alabama's like, Fuck Georgia. Hey, at least we're not Mississippi. And Mississippi is like, what the fuck do you want from us? Oh, why don't you go to Shreveport? Tell me how you fucking enjoy that. What you call over there, free fair. And I cook no catfish. Um, I love it down there. Granted I'm fucking white. You don't even have to claim started marching, you know, and I got all fucking nervous. I could fake my way through it, you know, give them a nod, you know, slip into a store real quick.

Speaker 2:          00:03:50       Um, anyways, I don't know if I mentioned this the other day. Um, I started playing catch again. You know, something I used to do as a kid. Good, clean, fun. You just need a glove of ball in a friend, maybe a baseball kid, baseball kid, baseball year. Um, and it's just been a good time. This is how old I am. I did 45 minutes a catio and I guess I didn't stretch. I thought I stretched and I went out there and a oh Billy fucking old face. Does not have the range of motion he used to have. And, um, my buddy through the ball and it bounced in front of me and just sort of was skidding along the ground and I bent down to get it. I anticipated it was going to hop. I don't know what I was doing or I just didn't get down far enough and went right by my glove and hit right in my left ghost white calf. And, um, it only hurt as much as it should or hurt like a baseball. However fast it was traveling and hit the ground, it's slowed down a little bit. May then Nice Pete sound against my Alabaster Shit. Right then I thought I was fine. And within like three throws, my calf just fucking tightened up. Like you couldn't believe. And for like the last three days, it's felt like it's on fire.

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       Right? Like if you thought of my, like if they were going to do a documentary on my calf, they would go to van Halen one, and they would take that clip from David Lee Roth singing, I'm on fire. Um, it's been fucking killing me. So, uh, I got to have a, I don't know, not going to have somebody fucking work it out, but, uh, my buddy gave me this shit. This is a free advertisement. This is how fucking good these guys are. It's called, uh, Arna Care Gel. They ever heard of this stuff? It's, it's homeopathic. What'd you call me? Homeopathic medicine aren't a care, it's for muscle pain and stiffness, swelling from injuries and bruising. I get pain relief. This shit, I'm telling you, it's fucking magic. I put this stuff on, I felt like I was bionic, you know, like, like in that you could fix me like a machine. One of those, one of those fucking Moonraker movies, blade runner, whatever the fuck it is. Like they would just open my calf and it looked like the inside of a fucking mix. Uh, I just felt like that they just, that think just cited a couple of wires, wires together. I mean, it didn't cure me. I mean, it definitely feel like now I just feel like I got hit with a golf ball rather than a baseball.

Speaker 3:          00:06:19       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       You know at the end of a drive, I'm not saying right off the tee, let's not get crazy hurricanes thinking crazy. So anyways, that's the free thing. I'll tell you right now, if you fucking ever do something before you go to them as suits and having fucking unglue your muscles and get all that, what's out of there as my a person says, ah, Arna cared gel a r. N I care Arnie care like Arnold Palmer except it's I a r n. I. O. N e. S. H. A. R. N. I. E. Right here. Why don't you confuse the people. See goes, I had to do with something free massage because I lost another advertiser. I can't believe it. I put my fucking heart and soul into these fucking reads. You know I could go monotone.

Speaker 3:          00:07:05       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:07:05       I can just read what they wrote.

Speaker 3:          00:07:08       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       I could just go with they've won.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:07:10       but you're not going to listen. And I know this show must go on even if I'm reading fucking advertising, but those fucking console over there.

Speaker 3:          00:07:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:22       The most suits people. That was a one and done. How dare you bring up hand jobs that at the end of the, uh, the massage rates, what the fuck are you talking about? That's a huge part of your industry.

Speaker 3:          00:07:37       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       Either you're doing it, oh, you're not doing it

Speaker 3:          00:07:42       the fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:07:44       It's like you're, you're in food. You're selling some sort of food. Now bring up trans fat. Like that's not a big fucking issue. That is a hot button issue. That debt is debt that needs to be brought up in front of Congress. When I, I stand by that.

Speaker 3:          00:08:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       If you can legalize weed at a state level, you should be able to legalize a hand job at the state level. Okay. Now, if the feds come in and she's got your Dick in her hand, you're on. You're wrong. All right. You're on your fucking own. You're Joe Pesci and good fellas out. No. Right. That's it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:08:20       That's it. All right ladies. It does it mean anything to us. Doesn't mean anything. If you ever saw the look on the woman's face when she's doing it. I mean, I swear to God, I swear to God, like it's just like she, she, I don't know what she did. Thinking fucking zillion other things.

Speaker 3:          00:08:35       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:36       Which is probably usually where you got this part of your safe place, you know, when you're fucking employed in the sex industry. Um, no. Well, I don't know what the fuck to tell you. I don't know what to tell you. So because I brought that up, which was funny enough to make people listen, they walked away from all the fucking massages that my listeners would have got.

Speaker 3:          00:08:53       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:54       No, I'm not. Galatia of them would have been expecting

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       some sort of a hand release at the end of it. So maybe, maybe that's okay. I'll take that. Okay. I will take that part of it. All right. When I'm getting tired of these deeds, deeds of the blue aprons, the nature boxes, you know, they're all good when the sun's out in the second they see a little bit of rough water. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09:15       What do they do? They fucking pull up stakes. Those fucking phony bastards. Okay. And they take their aprons and they fucking twats and they go to somebody else's podcast. And I'll tell you right now, I've had enough of it.

Speaker 3:          00:09:28       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:29       Do My, my gosh darn just over here to try and put a little bit of money in your pocket. You know, how many people do you think at that fucking massage place? I've actually gone to a massage parlor and gotten fucking jerked off. How many do you know what I mean? Fucking out. She's done. Don't get me fucking started. You know, I got in the, uh, all my dogs back in town. Oh Cleo, this is back in town. I just saw her, she fucking freaked out. We had a nice little battle. Royal took over this awesome fucking hike. Love that Goddamn dog. And I love that. She's got a great family now. Family babies. And uh, she put her on a little bit of weight. He's new people. They're, they're uh, they're treating her right. Um, but she looked awesome and, uh, same old dog dragged me down the street, all frigging excited and that type of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       So, uh, it's out. It all worked out nice, happy. And then she got a little more white whiskers around her muzzle, you know, becoming very distinguished and stately. These last couple of a bump in a less, I don't know, gave away almost a year ago. Fucking unbelievable. Nine months ago, 10 months ago, nine months ago, nine months ago. Um, so it was great to see her and everything. So, uh, she's in town for like 10 days. Uh, I'm leaving for a couple of days, but that's what I do when she comes to town and take for a hike every morning. It's kind of been working out. I get to see her every couple of months, you know, she's not around where she can eat my baby or attack somebody else, so she'll never get put down and I won't have to deal with an unbelievable amount of guilty. And she's got a great house and she's, you know, she's fattened up. It's fucking perfect. I love it. She's not fat people. I'm just saying she is living a good life, full of energy. Still a ball. A muscle though. Good Lord. That's a strong dog. Um, I still miss the hell out of her, but I definitely made the right decision. So anyways, um, what's going on tonight? All the Patriots yet that dad, Buddha, Buddha, [inaudible] and ignore your fucking wife.

Speaker 2:          00:11:34       Football season is back bay. Ignore the arcade. Sorry. Just blow out years. Ignore the hurricanes. Ignore all fatty up there. Fucking doesn't it fucking guy in North Korea. Did he look like he's the same shape is like curly from the fucking three stooges? You know, I'd love to see me. They just the old football sketch, you know, can somebody please do that just for a sort of photoshopping we'll do in that thing. Does that run in, in placing all Rah rob doing that whole thing. Just put his head on Curley's fucking body. It's what he's, he's Kim Jong Howard.

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       Uh, how many times would I be put to death in that fucking country? I can't even fucking imagine. I can't even imagine. You know, you gotta go up swinging. You got to go out like a fucking, you know, Gino, I'm not, I, you know, sit down was fucking brutal guy. But did you see how that guy went out? He was standing there. He's just stare at them all in the eye. They put the rope around his neck. He's still talking shit. Yeah. Go Fuck Yourself. Go Fuck Yourself. You know it's fucking any people always talk about do it. When you in Philly, how did you handle that? Fucked and wiggled a little sit down. Handled. He was talking shit. Right? Until they fucking Yank that rope. Oh, that lever or whatever. Oh Man. Crying like a little girl. Go on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sweep the streets. Anything you want.

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       Yeah, yeah. That's how I would've gone out. Gone into the next world and God, what did you spend looking at me shaking his head, you know, of all the awful fucking things you did. I think you're bitchy way. You left was the worst. Get out of my sight and then they just pushes the button and go down to health. I go down a hill and I burn forever. And that's a good fucking thing to bring up. When you got two gigs coming up, Mississippi and Alabama, I'm gonna tell you, go down. May Cbl, bamboulas mother fuckers ain't got computers yet. They ain't got computers. I'll tell you, they still eat. They'll still lead. And I don't tell you, give him some clothes line. They'll catch catfish and dry your overalls, mother fuckers, they can live off the land. You know, if, uh, what Rogan was telling me was even remotely true.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       Um, him and Jimmy Dore are the two most informed fucking comedians I know as far as they actually pay attention to shit. Somebody says some shit. And rather than just taking it as truth, they actually will fucking research it. They'll have guests on their show. I cannot recommend their podcasts. And G, uh, his by Joe's podcast in a, um, Jimmy doors, youtube show highly enough, and you don't always have to fucking agree with them, but I'll tell you right now, I want to tell you something right now if you fucking watch and see. And then if you're watching Fox News and Shit, I mean, that's, you know, those people. Okay, I'm going to, you know, no offense to other comedians, but they're definitely more well spoken than a lot of us. But, you know, I'm just saying there is a whole, uh, you know, just look at how they read the ads on those channels and then, you know, exactly, like they're, they're, they're, they're stuck between the lines.

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       I don't know what I'm talking about. Um, uh, fuck that reminded me of something. I just forgot it. What the hell was it? Something I wanted to talk about. Not News, not be in between the lines. Ah, fuck it. It's over. Um, so anyways, I am going to, uh, one of my favorite things and I don't have a lot of, I don't have any favorite things in Mississippi yet because I've only been there one time, two times. One time I was driving up to the airport after I watched the Patriots beat the rams and the Superbowl and I just couldn't get a flight into fucking New Orleans. So we drove, we flew in and out of fucking, uh, what does it, Baton Rouge, Mississippi. I'm kidding. Um, Jackson, Jackson, Mississippi. And um, and then I did a gig there a few years ago. Um, so, ah, I don't know a lot about it, but Alabama, Alabama, I'll taste him. What I love about Alabama, I love the, uh, first of all, the fucking, I'm going to the Alabama game, by the way, on Saturday.

Speaker 4:          00:15:39       Hello?

Speaker 2:          00:15:42       It's an afternoon game against mighty mighty Fresno state. They can surprise some people.

Speaker 5:          00:15:49       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:15:50       So I'm going to go there. I'm not going to be a con and root against Alabama. I really don't hate the crimson tide. It's just that they are the fucking, the Yankees or the Patriots, so f of fleeing on, they're the ones that always fucking, you know, uh, winning, right. So, uh, we'll Yankees, you know, they've won enough even though they haven't won since 2009, two. There's still the fucking Yankee sitting on 27. You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:16:12       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       I just couldn't become a college fan and jump on that bandwagon. Like if I was watching the NFL, I would fucking root against the Patriots to, that's what you do with you. If you just what you do, it's what you do. You don't just jump on the fucking big bandwagon. I'm like, Roger Clemens. When he joined the Yankees after they'd already one fucking three.

Speaker 5:          00:16:35       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:16:36       I would say, yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:16:39       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:39       yeah. That's, that's how, that's why I root against them. So when I go there, I'm not going to be a cop. I'm going to root for Alabama, but there's a major part of me that wants to bet Fresno state and just start the game up. Like, you know, it's 57 to nothing, but you know what it is. Nick Saban has an intensity slash anger. Slash inability. I'm telling you to drown a puppy that I, I just know that even as second string, it's just going to keep, you know, running up the points because they don't want to deal with it in practice. You know that they didn't score another fucking 30 points against Fresno's number one, I don't know anything about Fresno state. I'm not trying to disrespect Fresno. Okay. Now if you like me and you watch any sort of basic cable stuff about gangs or prisons or anything, they always, it's, you know, the second they start one of those shows, you can literally turn over an hour. Glass is sand and it's not getting maybe at halfway through before they ended up in Fresno. And then there's always that guy, you know, with the Bandana all the way up to under resides Bay Bandana on his head. And then the dark sunglasses, they have his voice altered named Burton or burden care. But you're aware of [inaudible] you can understand where they're saying right. I'll talk to him. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:18:05       not good. My Eric's would call. Um, so I'm not trying to fuck with Fresno. All right. Everybody knows that fucking stretch between La and San Francisco. You don't know what the fuck goes on out there. Charlie Manson lived somewhere up there. All right. There's a nice national park. There's a bunch of people growing food. But other than that, you know, I don't know what goes on other than it's really hot and a lot of people grew up career board mirror. So I don't have any fun, not trying to fucking shit on Fresno. Okay. I'm just a praise pasty freckled guy trying to go to a football game. So I'm, I'm working with del Rey and fucking Joe Botnick, the Rosebowl tailgate legend. And A, we're doing a Gig at some casino in a missed ship and then were in Alabama. And when I go down, Bam, I got placed.

Speaker 2:          00:18:55       I liked to eat every time I go there, first time I went there, a fan came. Remember how I found out by bond gold. EBAC, time saws. Barbecue started stands for smart ass Wilson's. I always go there. They have a Manet's based barbecue sauce. Swear to God. It's white. You like, there's no way that's going to taste good. You eat it. You like Jesus. Fucking delicious. Jesus Christ. Is that delicious? So, um, that's a good time. Um, I'm actually thinking of coming back again next year. I'm going to do quick kick here and then think I'm going to come back next year. Do a little bit of a bigger show and next GM and go to Talladega. I went to Daytona 500. I'm going to go Talladega next. I gotta go to that man. I used to always watch that with hair game in a scold main car.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       Cale Yarborough. I'm fucking, uh, what's his fate? Rusty Wallace. Daryl hawala trip. Who else was fucking running back then? Richard Petty was winded. Now I told you I used to buy all the fucking model cars. I'd build them and put the stickers on them and shit. I used to always skip the engine because they just wanted to get to the fucking car part and I wouldn't let it dry and I wouldn't let the paint dry. I was just too fucking, they always came out like shit. That was glue all over the place because I've just too impatient, you know? I wish I could buy one of those models again and actually just take the time to see if I could do it right. Like the people who really did it right. They would paint all the parts before they even took it off that plastic grid and they would let it dry for like a day and then they would just slowly put the whole fucking thing together and it was a fucking work of that.

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       I would never do that. I was all, you know, you know as the worst was when you'd remember the decals and he'd soak them in the warm water, then they'd all start coming off and you were like fuck. And they would roll up and all look like shit. They'd be put on lead like an angle, you know? Then you, then you had like the older guys, right? And they had a little thing like parent tweezers, all right, they'd have a pair of tweezers and that little fucking, you know, Julie or glasses on and they put it on and look unbelievable. And I always wish I had the patience to do that and I don't. And that's why stand up comedy has been the only thing that I was ever good at is because it is just going up there and just fucking letting you add go.

Speaker 2:          00:21:19       And I kind of learned something this week within in a frustrating way, trying to learn drums. And it's just like to do, you have to fucking sit down. And if you want to learn something, you have to take a big breath. You have to relax and you have to start really slow. And I've known this for fucking years. I've seen everybody talk about it. Some of the most monster players ever talk about how slow they start a new idea. But the whole thing is, you know, with all this information on the Internet, you can be like, well, what bpms is this song? It's 115 and then you just thinking, I can get it you, you 10 feet. And so you start playing it like 95 when you should be like 65. So that's my new shit. I got to fucking relax. I got to pick like one or two things and just stick with that for a while, just like you would with the model, right?

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       Just leave those pieces on there. Paint the fucking thing and walk away. Just let it dry. So, um, anyways, I know I'm a fucking mess here. I'm all over. I'm all over the Goddamn map. Uh, 22 minutes of fucking talking shit. All right, we've got six reads here. People, you know, these fucking reads like these, these advertisers, this is becoming like a special forces, you know, or, or a fucking some sort of military operation here.

They always have like a fucking wide shot and they show TJ hooker running like he runs for like six seconds every shot. It's like, why? I would, you know what it is, is they had it, they had to fucking do an hours 22 or I forget what a full season was back then. I'm only 22 episodes of an hour long show. That's 22 hours of television will actually with the, uh, what the commercials, eight minutes per half hour, 44 minutes they had right. 44 minutes of fucking Shit Times 22. I mean, it's, it's like where we came up short again. We'll just have William Shatner run a little longer. Can TJ hooker like run half the length of a football field before he catches up to somebody a third of his fucking age?

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       I saw the one, uh, I gotta get this actress name. Um, he was one, he was one of my, uh, one of my favorite actors when I was growing up. He was in colors. He was a Latino duty, got hit by a drunk driver, unfortunately was like 37 or 30, 38 years old. Hang on, I gotta get this guy's name. Ah, let's see. Colors. I am DB. I didn't know Don Cheadle was in that movie. I got to watch that again. That'd be one of his earliest ones. I am a nightmare walking. Um, it's something silver, I believe. Trinidad Silva. So he was in this episode of, um, this episode of, uh, Tj hooker and it was fucking hilarious because all of a sudden TJ hooker when he's talking to them would throw in some fucking Latino words and it was only like shit that like a let white people know, like cake pasta, fucking Agua. He said at one point, well maybe if you stop back to like a polo, like he, he threw in like chicken and it's just like, yeah, that's because the writing staff ordered El Polo local that day. But Trinidad silver, I believe he was in the jerk. Um, I think he was in the, Oh, you know what, when I look up this fucking, this guy was amazing. He was in Hill street blues. He was in the jerk. Yeah. He actually died during the filming of a underrated movie by Weird Al Yankovic called UHF. I was in colors. Uh, yeah. Hill street blues stir crazy. He had such shame. He died so young yet he was on Barney Miller. I mean that this Gulu grant, the white shadow, the jerk, this guys imdv page Beretta.

Speaker 2:          00:35:41       You know, granted you played, played a perp in all of those fucking things here. He's probably fixing games in the white shadow. That's the way it was back then. And this guy somehow got through it and open the doors for a bunch of other people. I hadn't seen him in a while. It was great to see him. Trinidad silver look 'em up. Uh, 1950 to 1988. Unfortunately he was, uh, he was only 38 years old. Jesus Christ. Um, phenomenal actor though. Alright. Legal Zoom. Last one here. Legal Zoom.

No, actually I'm not. I gotta go write an episode. Episode 309

Speaker 7:          00:37:52       of a

Speaker 2:          00:37:54       season three of f is for family were actually this week. We're working on a episode seven so you not in the business. The reason why it's called three Oh nine three means season three. I never knew what that meant. I finally figured it out after three seasons. I remember last year, it's like we're working on two oh four, and I'd be sitting in the back of the room, like we're not on the 204th episode. But I knew that sounded stupid. So I finally just, I finally just asked, you know, and I felt it. I felt all the rangers looking at me like, why is this hacky comedian in this fucking room? You know, when it hurts, I'm not kidding. My work with great people in case any of them are listening. And if you're the one person in the writers from listening to your, my favorite writer, the Bro, um, so I'm writing the episode three Oh nine.

Speaker 2:          00:38:40       That's why I have to do today. I just do like, I do two scenes a day and then I get through the script and then I do like three or four passes. I didn't do that last year, but this year I'm going to do it. And then, uh, I bring it in and then everybody just guts the thing. And maybe like three jokes make it, but you know, it's all about making that template. And that's the game that everybody fucking place. All right, so that's the podcast. Let's go pats Dr fucking year off. Right? Who's going to step into Edelman shoes before he comes back for the wonderful playoff run? Okay. I hope it doesn't come back too soon. You know? Do you know why Edelman got hurt? That was the curse of the nude ESPN magazine issue. You know what I mean? I, I can't remember the last time I laughed harder than watching him jump through the air, catch a ball and have it over his junk.

Speaker 2:          00:39:29       Is he through through the year? That was one of the funniest fucking things I've ever seen. I just don't understand how a woman, I don't know, maybe I guess what, I just don't understand how any level that is. Anything other than fucking hilarious naked men are for, they were just funny. I used to do a bit, my accident and naked man is one of two things. It's either funny or scary depending on what's happening. Like if you're at a game and a naked guy runs across the fucking field, I mean you're fucking on the ground laughing. However, if you're walking home late at night and a naked guy jumps out of Bush, like, ah, that's the scariest fucking thing you'll ever see, right. I'd rather see a fucking rattlesnake, you know, I would rather see that and I'm terrified of fucking snakes. Okay. Then to have some fucking naked jump out of a fucking Bush.

Speaker 2:          00:40:16       Um, I probably shouldn't just giving out that information. All right. Anyways, do let's troll them. Um, anyways. All right. That's the a the podcast for a this Thursday. I have a great weekend. You can't enjoy the football game tonight. That college football this weekend. Maybe tune into Alabama, Fresno state.

Speaker 8:          00:41:01       That's [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          00:41:22       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

I'm actually gonna try to do some, uh, something different this week because it's such a special fucking holiday cause it is Labor Day. Why do they go Lou [inaudible] I'm sorry. I always have to do a tribute to fucking eighties comedy.

Speaker 9:          00:43:06       I'm actually watching a fucking, I watch too much sports this weekend and I just, uh, I was watching the end of the Colorado Colorado state football game and right after it, um, I take best damn tough man, you know, cause it game always goes longer than its allotted, so you have to take the next show, listen to this fucking spares. He goes by the name of the coach. This is the classic example of a scared guy before a fight and he's trying to turn that fear into like some sort of fucking, uh, courage. But it works. This guy goes by the coach. This is hilarious. They're actually showing them right now, he's getting a, his gloves put on, listen to this maniac

Speaker 3:          00:43:50       popped up.

Speaker 9:          00:43:56       I don't know you, you're to hear that. But basically you standing there and he just goes like, it's show time and then he just snaps. It choked out and just, you got to, I'm sorry, I don't even know if this is even going to translate, but I got, I got to get the rest of this shit here. I got to get the other thing that he fucking says here. What the fuck is wrong with this stupid piece of shit? Fucking God damn cable. Anybody else have this fucking problem with your cable?

Speaker 3:          00:44:23       All right now for this, I'm going to make,

Speaker 9:          00:44:25       did I just delete it? You fucking cunt. Alright. Whatever. God Damn. I thought I was going to be such that, that was like my big fucking different beginning that I was just going to have there and I just ended up deleting it because my fucking cables sucks. Now what are you going to do? It's a holiday, right? I shouldn't even be doing this. So anyway, so the next time they, they, they come to him, he's screaming some more. So he goes out there and of course he doesn't know how to fight. He flailing or flailing around with this dude. And in the end, you know, he gets knocked on his ass and he, and he loses. So it's, it's every, basically, every time they show the guy, he, he would say one, the first little thing he would say quietly and then he would just completely flip out. I can't fucking believe I got, I deleted that. What an asshole. So whatever. The guy ends up losing in the end of the fight, he goes, uh, he goes, I'm ready for some more. I already bleeding yet. And then he just snapped. I buying yet.

Speaker 9:          00:45:28       Ah, fuck. I don't know what Co, what sport that guy, coaches. But if I was playing on his team, I would run through a fucking wall for that guy. You know, I don't know all the pens. Depends on your personality. You know, I like maniacs like that. God dammit. Why? I can't believe that. Fuck. I knew that was going to happen. I knew it was going to happen. You know, it's the worst. It was not on every bad enough. If I had to try and rewind it and get back to where the hell it was, but then I, I, it comes up with a delete thing and I accidentally deleted it. I'm sorry. Everybody. Ah, fuck. Where the hell do you go from here? Um, it's Labor Day. What exactly are you supposed to do on labor day? Am I supposed to observe something for all the people who died at work?

Speaker 9:          00:46:09       Do they have a little parade? Do you guys like parades? Those little pathetic things with the mediocrely talented people of your town marched down your fucking street. There's not the worst when you come from a small town. It's just a numbers game. I mean, how many truly fucking talented people can there be? But somehow they still have to put together a band. You know, some chick with braces playing a fucking flute marching down the street. And then they always end it with like a fire engine just trying to drown out your bad local band. We aim eh, or everybody's singing in monotone. A bunch of dentists and accountants sitting there with their fucking weird ass looking kids. God Ah, ah, ah, ah. Do they do that today? Is that what you're supposed to do? Am I supposed to be dressed up like it's the revolutionary war?

Speaker 9:          00:46:58       Reenacting something? I've gotta be honest with you. Uh, Labor Day feels like every other fucking day to me because I'm a comedian and I'm always sitting in my underwear at fucking 12 noon. All right? That's why I do this. Do you think I want to make you fucking people laugh? I don't, I don't. I just remember when I was 14 sitting in my underwear eating toast one day on a Saturday morning and I was thinking, I want to be fucking great if I could do this every day. You know, wake up, watch cartoons, wrestle with my fucking dog, you know, and just have absolutely no responsibility whatsoever. And I gotta tell you something. I made that dream come true.

Speaker 9:          00:47:39       We get worried when you die. God's just going to be looking at the video, your life, you know, just looking at it then kind of glancing over at you and just, just shaking his head. Haley, you get one shot at this and this is, this is what you did. Do you realize that you spend over 98,000 hours of your life in your underwear? And I'm not even counting when you were fucking sleeping. Oh, speaking of that, the other day I met him. Still on, I'm still sorry. Nia just walked by laughing at me like I'm an idiot. I, um, I'm still on European time. Um, today was the first day I actually got up at nine o'clock. I've basically, I have been when I was over in Sweden. How did you feel about that? When I was over in Sweden, uh, last week, um, Clia, what are you doing? You stop walking around like a creep. My dog is like most big dogs there. Uh, she's at, she doesn't realize how big she is and uh, so she's, but she's not afraid of a lot of things. Uh, you know, she's not afraid of other dogs, but hardwood floors scare the shit out of her, so she's so worried that she's going to be slipping. She walks like really slowly in daintily all around the apartment and it looks like she's going to like sneak up on you or something. That's right. Just laid out. All right.

Speaker 10:         00:48:59       Woo.

Speaker 9:          00:48:59       Ooh, I got to teach her how to howl. Oh, you guys want to see something fucking adorable. Do you want to see? You want to see something that we'll, we'll, we'll make you actually believe again in whatever the fuck you stopped believing in. Go on Youtube and search a boxer, B o, x, e r and baby and there's a little baby playing with a boxer and I'm telling you it's, it's, it's one of the most adorable things you'll ever see. You know, there would be less violence in the world if everybody watched this video. Actually that's not true. Everyone would watch the video and then the second, somebody next to you in, ah, yeah, the rage would come back and you'd want to just fucking blast him in the face. But whatever. I digress. Let me get back to what I was talking about. Um, so anyways, so I have been when I was over in speed and yeah, I was up all night and uh, and then I would sleep all day like that awful heavy metal song by that band slaughter and read that. That's when you knew it was over. Everybody said it was over when fucking nirvana came out. No, it wasn't. It was over when slaughter came out. Slaughter, slaughtered the rest of hair metal. That awful guys voice

Speaker 10:         00:50:11       sleep.

Speaker 9:          00:50:14       No, it isn't right. It isn't. It's fucking terrible. Um, anyways, I'm plowing ahead here. So, uh, I finally got used to the time over in Sweden and then I came back to the states and now I'm on Sweden time. So basically I have been up every fucking night watching old football clips and whatnot on uh, on the Internet and I call it like, you guys all, uh, sent me emails going, I swear to good. I don't work for the NFL man. Just tell me where I can see them. Where do you see all the videos? Where is the main site where everybody watches videos? That's where the fuck they are. Okay. It rhymes with Mu Lube. Um, anyways, so I, that's what I've been doing late at night. I've been watching, um, these fucking videos and uh, what am I trying to say here? I don't know what happened.

Speaker 9:          00:51:08       So yeah. So I fall asleep at la about six, six 30 in the morning. I sleep until one in the afternoon. That's what has been happening to me. I feel like a fucking drug addict. Right. So evidently yesterday, um, I was passed out and for some reason I was in the nude. All right, go ahead. Visualize that one face down in the fucking nude. And my girlfriend took a picture of me because she thought it was funny and um, I saw it and I, I don't know, I never really had a, Oh look, I never thought it was a good looking guy, but I thought it was all right. I saw myself lay in there, Butt ass naked and I got to met. Dude, I look like a fucking cadaver.

Speaker 9:          00:51:49       That was the worst part. It's not that I looked out of shape. I'm in decent shape. I just look like somebody just said fished me out of a river. That's the only way I could describe it. The only thing missing was bill Curtis, his voice, just narrating. I'm Bill Curtis, a pasty frankly, man was fished out of fuck head river the other day, this sleepy little town with their, with the fuck. I was gonna say Memorial Day. What the fuck is it? Labor, the Labor Day parade. Hey, stupid cunt with braces playing a flute. It looks perfect. And looking at me right now, go and you do not sound like Bill Curtis, whatever. I fucking looks. I was dead. So I deleted the picture and then my girlfriend felt bad.

Speaker 11:         00:52:32       She goes, I thought it was cute. I didn't want to make yourself coaches his on. It was cute. It wasn't cute.

Speaker 12:         00:52:40       Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:52:41       no one should see what they look like face down naked. I can't shake the image. I hope you guys aren't having your fucking, your traditional Labor Day breakfast while not while you're, you're visualizing then Jesus Christ. I look at that Rosetta stone. Remember I was going to learn how to speak Spanish. I just hate when you do that and you're like, I'm gonna learn how to do this shit. And you and you buy something and you stick it on your bookshelf and it's just sitting there marking your laziness for the next nine months. I got that for Christmas last year and I cannot fucking say anything in Spanish. You don't really want to do. I'm just gonna go down to home depot and I'm going to find one of those Mexican dudes who around always asking me if they can fucking rewire my entire apartment for fucking $3 because of the hardest, hardest work fucking people on the planet.

Speaker 9:          00:53:29       Um, and I'm just going to look at it. Why don't I just give you 20 bucks and teach you and you just teach me how to speak Spanish. Is that okay? And then of course it'd be like I had not died on. Now I don't know what. Well, I know I want, I want you to teach me, teach Amelia how to speak a Idi, done knowledge I'd done to leave saying I, we just sit there for fucking an hour. And then after while my forehead would be sunburned and I would just give up, that's probably what would happen. And who knows, maybe I would actually make a friend down there and maybe he was really good at an instrument and he was slightly retarded. And then I would draw that talent out. And then some day a Freddie Prinze jr would have a comeback play in that dude. And we can make a little Oscar winning movie. Maybe that could happen.

Speaker 9:          00:54:15       All right, let's plow ahead. Let's, let's, let's get, let's, let's actually be smart this week and rather than waiting till 50 minutes into this podcast to hype, what the fuck I have to hype. Why don't I hype what I have to hype right fucking now. Okay, well I'm going to do that. And of course the second I sat at my fucking computer shuts down. All right, hang on a second. Um, all right. This week I am going to be in Philadelphia, Penn, Pennsylvania at the a helium comedy club. Um, September 10th, 11th and 12th. Um, for the love of God, please come out to that show. Please show up. And a, I got a brand new hour at least since the last time I'd been there, cause I haven't been there in like a year and a half and that's plenty of time for me to come up with some new shit. So, uh, please come down there.

Speaker 9:          00:54:57       I'm actually gonna try to go to a Phillies game, check out that new stadium and uh, what else am I going to do there? I think that's it. I think that's it. You know what, somebody actually sent me an email, you know, cause last week I was telling you guys about how you can watch those Superbowls clean out. Would you just take a confidence step in the apartment? Jesus Christ, you would think there were land mines under the floor. The dog has never fallen down. That's the funny thing. I could see if she fell down the first day she was here and then she'd have this willingly. God, Oh my God, she's never fallen down and it was just pathetic to see a scared pit bull, isn't it? Um, anyway, so this guy actually told me about a, uh, if you're into hockey, hockey, I don't know, I just said it that way for your to hockey.

Speaker 9:          00:55:43       Um, there's actually a fucking website, if I can find it. Uh, where I was watching the 1974 Stanley Cup finals, like game six. I'd never seen it. Um, and I was watching the Bruins verse the flyers of course the flyers probably when that fucking game, cause I know they won the series and you have to go to, uh, this is it right here. This is for the sports fans out there. It's h f boards, B o a r d s.com/um, actually, you know what, just go to that age boards.com and just go to that and just start searching for some games and they have all the original games in their entirety. And if you are a big sports fan like I am, it's great to watch those because you can watch how the game has changed and all that type of stuff. I to be honest, man, I had like the greatest fucking weekend ever where, um, you know, just because college football started and I don't want to happen.

Speaker 9:          00:56:36       Like two, two years ago I became a college football fucking maniac and absolutely love it. And um, I was actually once again sleeping until noon, which is fucking like three o'clock east coast time. So I missed like most of the first games I think. I think it was like miss, like the first three quarters of the first game. So I wake up, my girl actually gives, she would have made some breakfast. She actually brings it into me. I have breakfast in bed and I walked into the living room after I eat it. She just made me breakfast in bed people. Okay. And I fucking, and she goes into watch one of her reality shows and I woke up and uh, after I ate the breakfast, I realized that I was missing all these college games. So I just stumbled in the living room because when you're my age, you stumble for the first hour when you wake up because for some reason your Achilles shrink up to your fucking the bottom of your ass and your legs don't work.

Speaker 9:          00:57:30       Right. Right. So I stumbled in here and uh, I just took the remote from our, usually I say, honey deemed, would you mind if I just kind of hung on? I didn't, I just fucking walked in and I put on the USC game and uh, she rightfully just looked down at the floor. Like, really? I just made you fucking steak and eggs and you fucking just come wandering in here. And then she just sort of walked out and then I had to do that pathetic. You know when you want to apologize for something you just did, but you want to continue doing the thing that you're, that you're apologizing for. So rather than hitting pause, I kept watching the game, like yelling out the side of my mouth as she was walking away.

Speaker 13:         00:58:09       Sorry honey ideas, learning in [inaudible] and

Speaker 9:          00:58:11       I just continue to watch the game and she gave me the silent treatment for the next four hours, which actually worked out good. I think I watched like 12 football games this weekend. I don't know why anybody gets the fucking NFL package. You don't need it. You can get all the, all the college games you want for free and a, and the kids are young. They haven't blown out their knees. They're fucking maniacs. Nobody's holding out. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck of saying, you know it's getting hot in here cause I have to close my goddamn windows cause I curse too much when I do this. You know what? I actually, I have some more audio here. Let me take a actually a sip of water. Like I'm Frank Sinatra in between fucking songs here. That ain't water. Alright. Um, you ever hear him say that he makes a joke back then when it was funny that you were drinking booze on stage? Um, I actually found another record if you guys are actually big fans of my podcast, you know what sucks about this shit is I have to literally move my mixer and everything else listened to it. Hit the floor, see that, hear that. And then we go, God damn these fucking wires. Um, I've been slowly but,

Speaker 14:         00:59:22       and that's how you can never say I've been slowly, you always have to say, but surely you always said that they take, they go together, you know, sick and tired. Slowly but surely suck my dick with my balls. You know, it all goes together. All right, here we go. I've been basically buying my dad's record collection one album at a time and this is one of the weirdest fucking albums my dad had as a kid. But because I was a kid and I didn't know any better, I love that. Listen to this shit. This is basically the original like you know when you watch Austin Powers and their kind of mocking the weird music of the 60s. This is basically why this is a called persuasive percussion 1966 and in defense of the orchestra, I think that they were trying to demonstrate um, as many instruments as they possibly could isolated how good they sound in the new found high fi stereo. So here we go. Listen to this shit any day now.

Speaker 6:          01:00:18       Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:00:38       Has that the shit or what?

Speaker 14:         01:00:45       Uh, you know, a lot of people, if they saved they'd go back in a time machine that they would go back and try and stop Hitler. I wouldn't, I go back to this fucking recording session because I just want to see the looks on people's faces when they play that kind of music. I always picture Barney Rubble's face, you know, when he was playing the drums in that one Fred Flintstone episode, we got Barney rubble Logan for trouble. And he had like, his eyes were all squinted. Like that's, I just picture all these guys and like fucking those turtle necks with, with the, uh, the peace sign. Remember how buddy rich was, was dressing and like the, uh, the early seventies when he was trying to act like he was still going to stay relevant with these new hip Kooky kids, but he was still playing big band music and he would come out with like these plaid Johnny Carson fucking Hagar slacks, a knitted turtleneck.

Speaker 14:         01:01:35       And then you on the outside of the Turtleneck, um, a little precursor to Eddie Murphy's, a pinky ring on the outside of his glove. He would have his, he'd have his necklace outside the turtleneck with a, with a peace sign and it was all in like silver, I dunno. And he let his hair grow a little long. Any of that awful fucking toupee pay out, but he still was fucking fantastic. All right. Was that worth the trip all the way over to my high fives stereo. Do you guys have a hi Fi? Huh? All right. Sorry about that. I'm a fucking nerd. So that's basically why I did all this weekend. I, uh, listened to bad records and I, I was listening to and watching all these football games and I gotta admit you got to watch these old football games because it is such bullshit nowadays the way they, they don't let these fucking wide receivers can, they can do whatever they want.

Speaker 14:         01:02:21       You can't even cover the fucking receivers. Huh? Any Georgia bulldog fans out there. How bad did you guys get fucked on that call? I'm not saying that you would've won the game, but that was definitely a pivotal fucking moment. This guy is going over the middle, the ball, his throne high and the defense, the defensive back lays them out. That's football and then like, and Nancy scamming Gaffney and Yankee. He where that roughness was unnecessary. It was fucking pathetic. I mean, unnecessary. I'm, I'm doing my fucking job. If you want to see how far football is changed co I fuck it. Who gives a shit. Go onto youtube and just fucking search. Um, search 1978 AFC championship game, uh, Steelers versus the Houston Oilers and watch part four go all the way to the end. You're going to see Mike. Barbara goes over the middle. Dan, pastor Rainey, the fucking douchebag throws it like nine feet over his head.

Speaker 14:         01:03:21       But my Mike Barber is a Gamer, right? So he goes up for the thing. Mike Wagner comes in, doesn't even look at the ball and just fucking goes as low as he possibly can. Hits Mike Barber right on his goddamn nice. You ever see a guy on youtube? You ever watch a guy like slam into offense doing 80 miles an hour on a fucking motorcycle. And that way, you know, you just launch. It's like you're standing up in the air, but you're doing flips, head over heels. That's what he did. He flipped it, flipped around like twice, landed on this astro turf and he's holding his fucking knee and flipping out and you know, he's on the ground for like five minutes. When he gets up, he's pointing and Mike, Mike Wagner, you motherfucker, you cheap motherfuckers screaming all this stuff. And the announcers in the booth of just sitting there going like, well you know, Mike wasn't looking at the ball.

Speaker 14:         01:04:08       So, uh, I mean I know I'm Mr Barbara is really, he's really annoyed. But I mean he was just doing his job. He's just doing his job. You know, there was no unnecessary roughness. Actually there was back then, but you actually had to do something that was unnecessary. Now you're doing the necessary shit. It is to cover a fucking receiver and they go, it's unnecessary. That's why one of the biggest bullshit records ever broken was Dan Marino's touchdown record by Peyton manning. Remember that year when he cried because the fucking patriots diff players actually covered his fucking receivers union with trying too hard. And the next thing you know you can't even touch these fucking guys and he breaks Dan Marino's record Dan Marino where to throw 90 touchdowns if you couldn't touch Clayton and duper. All right, that's it. I'm done. I'm done with this sports this week cause I know people are like, oh you don't watch boring and didn't want, and then when he telling him and they get bored, well you know something. Listen to another fucking podcast. All right, you're whiny cunt. Go enjoy your fucking Labor Day on somebody else's podcast. Ah, how do you like that? Look at me getting all tough. All right, you got, you guys want to, um oh wait real quick.

Speaker 9:          01:05:18       Um, my team is a Lsu. I think I'm going to go with Lsu this year is sound bought that les miles. I just liked the guide fourth and 12, two minutes into the game and he fucking goes for it. This is like a direct quote for him. They go less. Why do you always go for it on fourth down? And he says, well, you know what, when you have play makers on your team, you have an obligation to turn them loose. That might be one of the greatest quotes ever. And I love the southern fucking turn them loose. You got play makers on your team, buddy. Okay, you follow me? You have an obligation. Turn him loose. Just turn him dogs loose. Just see what to come up with. Go out there. Dig Up fucking first day on greatest fucking fake field goal of all time.

Speaker 9:          01:05:58       Lsu. Look that up. Lsu fake field goal. It's the smoothest shit you're ever going to see. Just flips it right over his goddamn shoulder. I was fucking them as a thing of beauty. All right, here's some youtube videos for you guys. If you're new to my podcast, this is what I do every week. I act like a fucking moron in my apartment and um, people send me in these youtube videos already gave you the boxer baby one. Um, and the Lsu fake field goal. And uh, this is just a creepy one. It's really quick, but it's really creepy. Look up, um, animal recording fail animal recording fail at somebody's filming and Anaconda or some big ass fucking snake. And evidently this snake was not ready for, it's a close up. Okay. We'll just leave it at that and it will make you jump. It'll fucking make you jump.

Speaker 9:          01:06:46       All right, this is going to be quick podcast. I'm already to the questions, you know, I'm only 24 minutes and you know what this feels like. This feels like when I'm fucking bombing on stage, and I know a lot of you guys out there and now comedians, sure, we all aren't. And uh, basically what happens is when you're having a great set, all right, say you're slated to do 50 minutes, okay? Somebody comes back and they say, Hey kid, can you give me 50 minutes? Can you go out there and give it the college track? Right? And you fucking go out there and you start killing. And if you're killing, and if you're totally on, what ends up happening is you do 50 minutes and you feel like you only did half your act, you know, but on nights when you're bombing, you're about to jokes away from your closing bit and you look down at your watch and you're about 12 minutes into your set.

Speaker 9:          01:07:35       And that's when the dry mouth sets in and you're like, okay, uh, so, uh, what do you do for a living? Oh yeah, here's my cute little jokes about fucking plumbers, you know? Oh, that's the worst I have to tell you about to sound. My first headline in gigs, this is basically how I became a headliner was firstly I had to write the material. All right. And I had gotten up to a, I knew I had 45 minutes, but I had never done 45 minutes. And when you headline or going last or whatever the fuck you want to call it, um, on a real show as a headliner, you have to do at least 45 minutes. That's how it works. Okay. I don't know where the fuck you guys are from where I'm from. That's how it fucking works. You got to do 45 minutes.

Speaker 9:          01:08:21       So I've been doing standup for about three and a half, four years. So I had written 45 minutes of material, but I had never done 45 minutes. You know what I mean? I was basically, at that point I was a, I was the feature act of the second guy. So I was doing like anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes at the most. Usually Feature Act does 20 to 25 30. If you work at working with like an old bitter headliner who's given into the fact that he's not gonna make it, or maybe he just doesn't feel like doing it. Um, you know, that's when you work with those guys and they just come up to you. And that I work with this guy one time and he looks at me and he goes, he goes, hey, kid, kid. Uh, he goes, how much time you got? I'm like, I don't know. Uh, 30, 35. And he just goes do all of it.

Speaker 9:          01:09:10       He's just like, do your whole fucking act, play with the crowd. I don't give a shit. I'll fucking do 11 minutes and close this show. I've had it. Right. So, um, anyways, yeah. So I'd written 45 minutes of material and I, uh, but I never done it all in a row, so I didn't know how to put it together. So when I moved down in New York, you know, the only way to start headlining is at some point you got to bite the bullet. Just tell somebody that you're a headliner. You don't tell that to a, to a good room. You tell it to like, you know, you have a rooms, you have be rooms, you got C and d room, so like to c and d rooms. I was like, I just told the guys, yeah, I'm a headliner. And they're looking at me, you know, I was just a kid.

Speaker 9:          01:09:48       They're like, you're a headliner. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, my headliner. You know, it's like when you try and get served, when you're under age, you just try to have that look at confidence. Don't flinch. Just give him the money. I would like a vodka. Collins. Yes, I would. Me and my one whisker on my chin would like to have some alcohol. Thank you very much. And um, the first time I headlined, I remember I went on after this, this, uh, this black dude was on in front of me and he was totally like high energy to begin with. And, um, that's one of the first things you learn how to do as a headline is how to follow somebody if they have high fucking energy. Right? So this guy's doing his act and you know, it's like, it's, you know, he's been doing it for a long time, so he just keeps building with the energy building and building and building. And he ended his act doing some jokes about like a prostate exam and by the end he's just screaming. Yeah.

Speaker 15:         01:10:42       And he's got his fucking, thank God my mother fucker. Now

Speaker 9:          01:10:46       it's screaming into this, my killing in this restaurant and I'm sitting there, I'm already sweating trying to think how the fuck am I going to follow that guy. And I made the biggest fucking mistake you can ever do is when somebody ends and they're on 11 with the energy, the worst fucking thing that you can do is to go on stage and start your act at the same energy that, that, that, that guy left off. First of all, you're not going to have enough energy. There's way you can't be on 10 for 45 fucking minutes. You're going to pass out. Okay. And not only that, it's bizarre to have someone just come out on stage, you know, please welcome bill burr screaming. I said, I like that guy in the tough man thing. You know, you gotta get psyched. You got to get pumped. I was coming out with like that kind of energy.

Speaker 9:          01:11:36       So I went up there and eight minutes in screaming my act, I am pouring sweat and I remember looking down at my watch feeling like I had done at least 25 minutes and I had only done like 11 minutes and I was out of breath, out of breath from telling fucking jokes. And I had no, I just remember there was a, for some reason there was a big fish tank in this place and I was trying to riff about the fish tank and it was a restaurant and like a, anybody oded, the flay of fish goes, I think I know where they got it. It was, it was awful. Ugh. Just fucking, ah, I, you know what, actually got a bad feeling, just even thinking about that fucking set. So if you are a comedian and you're listening to this and you just starting to headline, if you follow somebody with energy, what you actually want to do is go in the opposite direction.

Speaker 9:          01:12:26       That's what I learned as you go up there and you just start really fucking slow and actually kinda eat your balls for, you know, just let everybody just bring it down. Everybody fucking relax. And then once you get them relaxed, then you start to build them up again. You know what I mean? It's just like doing drugs. You start coming down, but you know, once you go through the floor and you start filling depression, you take another drug and you start coming back up again. That's, that's where right there, right as you go below the floor boards, that's when I grabbed you by the back of your fucking goddamn shirt and I pull you back up again, comedically. And then we, then we go back up again. But this is what, what ended up happening was I would do my jokes and I could kill for 37 minutes.

Speaker 9:          01:13:10       And for some reason when I said 37 minutes, I just wrote it on my Ottoman with my finger. I wrote 37, like the fucking rain man, fucking Weirdo. I really have a lot of rain man qualities. I don't know if you've noticed that, but uh, like I can actually name all everybody who's won the Superbowl the last 43 years and now I don't have it in front of me, but I can do it. So if you ever see me, I'll fucking rattle them off, rattle them off. I'll have my head to the side just like the fucking rain man. And then if you want me to go back and name all the losers, I can fucking do that. And uh, I was actually at 1.1 to memorize where all the Superbowls took place and that's when, uh, right after I had that thought, I kind of caught myself in a mirror and I was just like, what are you doing

Speaker 5:          01:13:56       bill? What, what do, what do you run it from? You know,

Speaker 9:          01:14:01       because I'm just sitting there in the mirror going green bay, Green Bay jets, chiefs, colts, cowboys, dolphins, dolphins, Steelers, Steelers. Yeah, Raiders, cowboys. See, can I still do it? Steelers, Steelers and then Jim Plunkett with the fucking Raiders. Joe Montana. That was in Pontiac, Michigan. They beat the Bengals and they stopped Pete Johnson right down on the goal line and then the fucking Redskins who I hated because I was a huge cowboy fan. They beat the dolphins. Does that Fulton Walker? Huh? Took the kickoff back. See, I remember all this shit. Then the Raiders kicked the shit out of the Redskins and next year and then a fucking 40 niners beat the dolphins. Remember that sports illustrated with Dan Marino was on the cover and he was pointing at him like, yeah, this is going to be the first one, right. With Joe Montana. Next year was the bears, which could have, should have been the greatest fucking super bowl ever.

Speaker 9:          01:15:00       You know, I'm just gone all sports this week. I don't give a fuck. I'm just going to give you guys a heads up. Do you remember that? The bears went 15 and one in the regular season. Okay. And the only team they lost to was the dolphins on a Monday night. It was fucking awesome cause the dolphins basically defended the 72 dolphins, you know, undefeated record by beating the fucking bears. So in the AFC championship game that year, it was the dolphins first, the Patriots, and we were playing them in the orange bowl. And we had this curse we had, we had never won in the orange bowl for like fucking, I don't like 20 goddamn years. Okay. Since like Lyndon Johnson was an office and the San Diego chargers played in Los Angeles. Okay. And then, um, the fucking dolphin should've beat us and then they should have gone to the Superbowl and then the bears should have been set up to fucking avenge their one loss of the year. And then the dolphins with Dan Marino. And that unbelievable fucking offense was the only ones that was able to beat the 46 defense. And what fucking happens. Stupid ass patriots. We come in there and we beat them. Right. And then, you know, with squish the fish, remember that squished the fish and everybody, Miami was just like, Ooh,

Speaker 16:         01:16:10       Dolphin join the foods. The removal. Hello

Speaker 9:          01:16:15       was some of the gay ass shit talking ever 10 during that time. And somebody had made a song in Boston. I remember that song by Pete Townsend, uh, face to face that face to face, get to face to face, something like that. Somebody wrote us a squished the fish to that song, squish the fish, get to squish the, if it was fucking horrific, but somehow I still actually watched the game and then the Patriots got, or they got raped, I believe is the best way to describe it. Um, by the bears, 46 to 10. Then the next year was the giants. Then the Redskins than 40 niners 40 niners and then was the bill's era where they lost to the giants, Redskins, cowboys, cowboys than the 40 niners then the cowboys, then the packers and then the pack. Ah, yeah. The packers beat the fucking patriots. I went to that game than the Broncos won the next two. Then the rams. Then the ravens, stupid a that coach there. They have no idea how fast we shut up your clown. They beat the giants then patriots than Tampa Patriots. Patriots, colts, stealers. Giants stealers. Huh? You like that Shit

Speaker 14:         01:17:20       fucking rain man.

Speaker 9:          01:17:22       What do you want to go to another sport? Name another sport. I'll fucking do it. I can go all the way back to like the early 70. [inaudible].

Speaker 14:         01:17:28       That's what I actually fucking sit there and I write that down on like Napkins, cocktail napkins. When I'm on planes, like that's how I make plane rides go by. Like right now, maybe you're on a plane listening to this ship. I actually sit there. Green Bay, Green Bay jets. Yeah, definitely the chiefs. I know. I'm a fucking loser. All right, let's get to some of the questions here for the week. Jesus Christ near.

Speaker 1:          01:17:52       Okay.

Speaker 14:         01:17:54       This is what happens when I'm doing my fucking podcast. Nia is always getting ready to go somewhere and she comes out and all sorts of fucking different dress.

Speaker 1:          01:18:02       Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:18:03       And I'm not ready for it. Um, you just don't say you're going to go do one of those sports illustrated covers and why those ones where they wore the mesh is bathing suit. Yeah, exactly. All right. Let's [inaudible] plow ahead here. Um, questions of the week. All right, question number one. Hey Bill, I'm sure you've by now you've seen the punch. Just wondering what your opinion was on it. Personally, I thought the Boise state player deserved it and the expression on his face was priceless. Go blue. All right. There's a Michigan Fan are, unless you're saying go blue because of the fucking turf. MMM.

Speaker 9:          01:18:41       Um, okay. How do I explain this shit? This is basically what happened. Boise state played a, played Oregon and I guess last year at Boise State, um, injured the quarterback on a fucking, I was just picturing that dude from England getting all pissed. Listen, this shit, cause I know he doesn't give a fuck about all this stuff, but I don't give a fuck. But you don't watch this stuff. I'll talk about the premier league next week. So anyways, somebody in Boise state injured the quarterback a on Oregon. So the running back on Oregon said, uh, we, we owe Boise state, uh, and ass whooping. So he's basically talking shit. So they play the game and they held that guy who talks shit to minus five yard. So at the end of the game they came up and they talked a little bit of Shit. The guy gets in his face,

Speaker 14:         01:19:25       it's probably like, oh, where are you going to say now man, what are you guys say now? And then the dude looks away and the dude who was getting yelled at just wound up any fucking dropped the guy and then it, then it just got ugly and ugly and ugly. What do I think about that? Um, it was definitely funny. There's definitely funny to see when you received a guy getting somebodies face talking to a bunch of Shit and then the other guy just, you know, just fucking winds up and drops him. It was definitely funny, but, uh, I thought that dude had a common, you know, if you're going to say, you know, you got an ass whooping common. If you're going to talk shit and then only get minus five yards, you got understand that people are going to give you some shit back. And a, I gotta be honest, man, I feel real good,

Speaker 9:          01:20:09       bad for that guy because uh, you know, he could've got drafted and now he got suspended and I'm just one of those heat of the moment things were, I dunno, it's at some point, you know, I mean, he might've just fucked his whole life up. Like now, now he won't get drafted. And then what do you do? You work at best buy, you could have, you know, you could have got at least, you know, even if you suck, you're going to get like six figure contract maybe for a couple of years. You run around and play for the fucking chiefs or some shit like that. I don't know. It was just really bad. It was fucking ugly and a, and then the fact that it was a black dude and he punches a white dude, then you go on the internet and everybody has to write some racist shit, which is one of the things I really can't stand about.

Speaker 9:          01:20:54       Youtube is all the, all the, uh, all the racist on there. I really can't fucking stand that. I don't mind when someone writes some shit just to be a dick to annoy somebody. But like a, yeah, the n word is used pretty liberally on youtube. And that's the one fucking thing, you know, somebody asked me that actually about my website was saying like, you know, why don't you have a page where people can, you know, leave comments and stuff like that. And that's why I don't, because people end up arguing and then invariably somebody writes something racist or something just really horrific, uh, something about Jews or something. And then it's on my website, it's just, I, you know, I don't condone that shit and I just, you know, I don't give a fuck what I do. The podcast. Do you want to, you want to write something or send it to me and I'll fucking read it on this? Um,

Speaker 14:         01:21:41       I don't know that I explained that I, I feel bad for that guy. I feel bad for that too because he just fucked his life up. And one moment by punching the guy in the face. But you're not saying I don't like, I don't like when people sucker punch somebody and then they had like that. Yeah. What, what fucking vibe? What do you mean what, uh, I wasn't looking at you when you punched me in the face. Yeah, I'm going to go down. That's really, there's really no skill level there, but in defense of that guy, if you do get in somebody's face and talk shit, yeah. You, what you do is that you do that little, you know that little gay backwards skip that fucking football players do. That's what you do. Why you look at the person, you don't say, ah, you don't talk shit and then just fucking turn the other cheek like you're Jesus, you know? Do you think Jesus ever got dropped with that whole fucking a wait, did he, did Jesus say that? Talk Shit and then turn the other cheek. He didn't say that. He said if somebody slaps you, turn the other cheek so they can slap that side. What kind of a fucking,

Speaker 9:          01:22:42       you know, woe is me and that's what, that's how I am not religious. I can't get behind that son of God. Not Son of God profit or whatever that is is just some dumb shit.

Speaker 14:         01:22:53       Son. If somebody kicks you in the left ball when your eyes stop watering and you can actually see your right ball, hold it out for him so he can kick it. That one. Yeah, go fuck yourself. You

Speaker 9:          01:23:05       fucking Hippie your stupid ass sandals. He really was the original fucking dirty ass hippie wasn't he wasn't Jesus that all right. That should get some people sending me some emails. God help me. If I ever get fucking famous and they start cutting up some of the Goddamn shit on this podcast, I'm really going to be in trouble. Um, all right, next question.

Speaker 14:         01:23:24       Bill. Did you ever, uh, at some point in your early career, think about performing on a cruise ship? This guy has no idea how funny this question is. Uh, I'm not sure if you've ever taken a cruise before, but let me tell you, it's pretty fucking sweet. Okay. He says, uh, it seems like you literally a would be getting paid to go on vacation, get shit faced daily and flirt with some finance trim in between all that. If you could find the time on Tuesday and Thursday night to do your act for an hour in the main show room, um, not to mention you're waking up in some of the sickest places in the Caribbean every other day. Let me know what you think.

Speaker 9:          01:24:05       All right? Um, okay. Amongst comedians, you are never further out of show business than when you do. When you do stand up on a cruise ship. Um, people who do standup on cruise ships, it's basically, uh, I dunno, it's, it's like there's two places where you go out to pasture as a performer. Um, Vegas and cruise ships. Vegas isn't bad because you'll get like $1 million, fuck me like that Danny Gans. Dot. Guy would just fucking passed away. Like that guy was making millions. He had like, he was making like five, 6 million a year. He doesn't have to be on the road. You let the crowd come to you. There's a lot to say about that shit. But, uh, when you're out on a cruise ship, I mean, first of all, let's just break this whole fucking thing down. It seems like you'd literally be getting paid to go on a vacation.

Speaker 9:          01:25:01       Yeah. Except you have to work. That's actually one of the classic things that club owners used to do when I was starting out to try and fuck you over. When they would try to book you down in Florida in the wintertime and they'd all feel like 80 bucks for the week or some awful shit. And they'd be like, yeah, but you know, it's Kinda like you're on vacation. It's kind of like a paid vacation. Yeah. Except I have to work except for that working part. You fucking assholes. Um, now, yeah, a cruise ship is an absolute fucking nightmare, believe it or not. One of the first things you want to do as a performer, the second the show is over, is you want to get the fuck away from the crowd. You want to get away from the crowd because the only way to describe it is you, you ever get stuck in an elevator with some douche bag and you have to make this small talk conversation that you don't want to have imagined being stuck on a boat with a fucking a thousand of those people. Cause that's basically what it is. And I'm not trying to be unappreciative of people who come out to see the fucking show, but you know, I dunno. What do you do for a living? Okay, let's use the plumber analogy. Does that guy, I want to talk fixing fucking toilets. How did you get into fixing toilet? Do you get nervous right before you have to fix the toilet?

Speaker 9:          01:26:12       You know, it's awful. I did one cruise ship, right?

Speaker 14:         01:26:16       And I actually, uh, I got, I didn't, I didn't get fired, but I was definitely not asked back. And, uh, the whole thing was alive. They told me, I told him, first of all, I said that my act is not conducive to a cruise ship. I just don't see myself doing well on a cruise ship. And they were like, no, you know, cause people are old on cruise ships

Speaker 9:          01:26:34       and they're like, Nah, this is a young hip cruise ship. I already told this fucking story. And I got on there, there was that old Vietnamese woman passed out, missing all their fucking teeth up front. And I ate my balls the entire weekend. The only people I made laugh was the band, you know, the captain wrote a letter saying how as offensive to all fucking people and cruise ships are a nightmare, sir. They're fucking nightmare. And I don't know what cruise ship that you're taking, but um, all I know is that when I took a cruise ship, they would stop and you had basically four hours to see whatever the fuck you could see before you had to run back to the ship or they would leave without you. So it was a very stressful situation. And then other than that, you were just out on the water and it all looked the fucking same to me. Maybe I didn't take a good one. I mean, if I went to the Mediterranean and did a European cruise, I imagine that would be cool. But, uh, you know, I don't want to go to Athens for fucking three hours,

Speaker 5:          01:27:29       you know,

Speaker 9:          01:27:30       and fucking sitting there running around trying to see all this shit, you know, in flip flops and a fucking Hawaiian shirt, you know, dress like

Speaker 14:         01:27:36       Robin Williams before he does a goddamn special. Um, it's, it's a nightmare Gig, sir. They definitely pay well, but it is, it's, it's a fucking nightmare. And you're out to sea. And I don't know, when I did them, they didn't even have Internet access. So there was no way for your fucking agent to even get in contact with you if you did have a big audition. But even if he did have a big auditions now you can fucking get off the boat, you know, call a fucking helicopter helicopter, you know, it's, it's horrific. Anyways, let's plow ahead here. Um, it's getting hot as fuck here in my apartment because I had to close the windows because I curse. Um, what is this section here? Something I wasn't aware of. I don't even know what this is. Let me read this. Um, the reason I'm writing you is I'm a huge college football fan, but I have to say that there is one trend that has emerged over the past decade that really bugs the shit out of me. Oh, this guy doesn't like the promos. I haven't had anybody on any other football fans, none of this. He said, why is it that every major football telecast kicks off with some redneck singing, a theme song? I guess it started with Hank Williams jr now that's the only one I know that I read it on

Speaker 5:          01:28:48       Football Asia.

Speaker 9:          01:28:48       John not part. Huh?

Speaker 14:         01:28:49       I fucking hate that. I don't like that one either, but I wasn't aware. He's saying they're doing it everywhere. He said it's gotten way out of hand. A few years ago, college game day employed it's own country music band to sing the show's theme. It's like the guy with the fiddle.

Speaker 9:          01:29:05       Um, and the guy wearing the big

Speaker 14:         01:29:07       top hat are supposed to be a little less white trash because they're joined by a black guy shouting out football audibles in the middle of the song.

Speaker 9:          01:29:16       Wow. Dude, that sounds fucking horrific. Um,

Speaker 14:         01:29:20       this year to top it all off, all the day apparently isn't complete unless some other Appalachian with a 10 gallon hat sings to the scene theme song for ABC's game of the week on Saturday night. Not to mention that during the actual game, the ACC has its own commercial with some other hicks singing a theme song. At least that is somewhat understandable since the ACC is predominantly, um, uh, southern. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:29:43       Con Con Conference. Such a moron.

Speaker 14:         01:29:46       All right. Ah, look, I get it. College football has a lot of fans in the southeast part of the country. Football in general attracts a large audience of white males between the ages of 25 to 40. I am one of those white males. And frankly, I'm a little tired of my football viewing experience becoming intruded on by an assorted cast of characters from Hazard County. Sorry for the ramp. But I had to get that off my chest and frankly my wife couldn't care less.

Speaker 9:          01:30:10       Oh Dude, I'm in that boat. I know that you start ranting to your girlfriend about some shit and they just start glazing over. Like, yeah, I really don't care about sports. So at any point, if you want to stop yelling at me, you're spitting on the side of my face, by the way. Um, yeah, dude, I gotta admit I haven't noticed that shit. But I'll tell you why. Cause I don't watch pregame or post game. I don't, I just watched it. The Games, I don't want to watch that part where people like, you know, I'll tell Ya, you know, if I'm Terry Bradshaw, I gotta be taken. What's John Stallworth doing? Fuck, I don't know. Give a shit, you know, and I don't listen to sports talk radio. All those people fucking freaking out, losing their minds. Give me an Oklahoma. We launched, just joined with the second stringer in relax.

Speaker 9:          01:30:56       That's why they have coaches. You don't have to worry about it, sir. The decisions will be made. Um, all right. Underrated. Overrated for the week. Uh, underrated. The a television series, brotherhood. Um, dude, the Brotherhood was my show and they actually cancelled it. Um, this is what this guy has to say about, he says a crime show on showtime was recently canceled, was much better than the similar. The soprano's it had superior writing and acting. It also had a better place and his characters were much more interesting. Um, it could be just be that the whole Italian mafia thing is getting tired genre, but, um, but I got to go with Brotherhood as overall being a better show, although they were both good. Uh, yeah, the Brotherhood is awesome, man. If you guys, uh, have a DVD store around you, what sucks is, is there's two awesome seasons and they're really the cliffhanger that they left you with. It's basically based on the, I think the Billy and Whitey Bulger thing where back in Massachusetts they had a really high ranking politician whose brother was a really high ranking

Speaker 14:         01:32:00       gangster. And uh, this is something else I think I already talked about on the podcast. Yeah. That was like the dynamic and everyone would always be asking the, uh, was I think was it was Billy Billy Baldwin or I think it was the politician and Whitey was the gangster. And they would always ask Billy be like, what is your affiliation be? I don't, I don't have any affiliation with my brother. You know, Massachusetts might

Speaker 9:          01:32:26       rather, uh, I'm just trying to do the best job I can do to the tax payers of Massachusetts, you know? And the last thing I remembered happening was the gangster actually won the state lottery. How fucking hilarious is that? So this basically the show was based on that took place in Providence, Rhode Island. I highly, highly fucking recommend that you watch it. It sucks that there's only two seasons, but um, starts off a little slow. There's a lot of fucking, uh, there's a lot of characters, but I'm actually at one point I'm actually going to give away something. This is just sort of a little vignette that they had on the show is a Yankee fan, comes into one of the provenance bars and starts talking shit to one of the hothead gangsters and who's a red sox fan. And I'm a fucking blows his brains out. And it was really, it was disturbing.

Speaker 14:         01:33:22       It was disturbing. Um, so definitely checked out and that fucking guy was a great actor and not to mention that I'm the guy who plays Freddy Cork, um, is actually, believe it or not because he's such a great fucking actor, is Kevin Chapman who was a comedian that I started out with and he was one of my faith that was one of my favorite characters on TV. Tony Vee was in it, another great comedian from Boston. I'm so fucking pissed that they canceled that show cause, uh, that was my show, man. I love that show. So I got to go with you. Yeah, a brotherhood. Definitely underrated. Alright. Overrated. Uh, this dude says the black eyed peas, the sheer amount of times I've heard the new album against my will is staggering. The only people you'll catch listening to them are the lame ass. Want to be cool white people who have never heard of anything unless it was on the radio. Yeah, I know. They definitely play them in elevators. And if you go to staples,

Speaker 7:          01:34:16       yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:34:16       Um, I can't even think of their fucking music, but I can't stand. Ah, did they do London Bridge always that, that check when she went solo. Oh, that was Fergie by herself. Oh, that's right. I'm sorry. Yeah. You know what I actually discovered the other day? Uh, I have a lot of shit in my iPod that my girlfriend downloaded on her fucking computer was on the blink. And uh, did I say on the blink? I didn't know what the fuck that means when it was on the Fritz. He, uh, so she downloaded all this shit that I never would have listened to. So the other day, what was that song? Act Crazy. Who sings that song?

Speaker 7:          01:34:49       Yeah.

Speaker 14:         01:34:52       GNARLS Barkley. I never, she used to listen to that song and I fucking hated it. Um, with that dude singing in that falsetto, you know. Uh, but I actually listened to the lyrics. It's, I actually like the song now. I was at the gym lifting weights, listening to that song and I've never felt gay or in my life. Uh, I gotta wrap this up cause that was embarrassing to even admit that. Um, all right, I'm 53 minutes in. That's going to be the podcast this week. I know it's a little fucking, it was a little off this week I think, but um, I'm coming down off a Tylenol pm. I had to do it to, I had to drag myself up like fucking Michael Jackson so I could actually fall asleep by two at night so I could wake up and actually try and do this thing at some point remotely near Monday morning.

Speaker 14:         01:35:33       I hope you enjoyed this podcast this week. I hope you guys had a great Labor Day weekend. I apologize. I can't believe I deleted that, that rant at that boxer was doing, it was fucking great. The coach look out for him. He's a tough man and evidently he's ready for more cause he only started bleeding. He, oh, started bleeding. All right, that's it. Please continue listening to podcasts. I'm going to be at the, um, helium comedy club this weekend in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Please come down to the show and also, uh, please join my mailing list. I never bring that up. I would like to get more people on my mailing list because my space is really dying. A slow pitiful death. I barely get any emails over there anymore and um, I don't know where. I don't know where to go next. Um, cause I imagine Facebook will take a nosedive.

Speaker 14:         01:36:21       Twitter, we'll take a nose dive and his whole jumping around is driving me fucking nuts. I figured out how to blog here on my website and I'm going to start blogging. I actually began one about Sweden that I will finish and um, hopefully I'll get some new videos up there, but it's a bill bird.com if you could go on and you sign up, you just sign up for my mailing list underneath the city that you're closest to. And basically I only send you emails if I'm coming to your town or if I'm going to be on TV. I'm not going to be one of these douchebags who every week gives you the bill burr update and then I become spam in your life. It's not going to be that way, but please sign up for it because my days on my space might be numbered because I don't, I don't, I don't know that there's anybody left. I'm really feeling like fucking Mad Max and I'm there looking for fuel. You know, it's just whores and uh, people sell in music. That's all that's left and me, you know, tumbleweeds over there, people. All right, that's it. That's the podcast for this week. Please tune in next week. Wait a second, wait a second. Did you want to chime in with something new? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:37:26       Well. I'm just surprised you didn't talk about Tila Tequila shocked by that football player.

Speaker 2:          01:37:33       Oh, that's right. Sean Merryman choked out. Tila Tequila, you know I,

Speaker 14:         01:37:38       well, she's a warrior anyway. She probably deserved it.

Speaker 2:          01:37:41       Exactly. Fucking apple. What do you mean it's a podcast? I got to make it funny. I don't like how you actually have my, you actually have my voice

Speaker 9:          01:37:56       down like you actually know what I'm going to say. No, that's not what I was going to say. I was going to say before I so rudely interrupted with your completely offensive, I don't like how you know you, have you noticed that with women, whenever they do an impression of their boyfriend, they always have to go

Speaker 17:         01:38:11       Ooh,

Speaker 9:          01:38:11       before they say anything. I wanted to go out to go to a restaurant and you know, my boyfriend said he was going to take me and I was like, so we're going to go to the restaurant and he's all,

Speaker 17:         01:38:21       where's your football game?

Speaker 9:          01:38:25       I know my impression of you is really bad. It is bad. Do you want to go to a party this weekend? My girlfriends,

Speaker 18:         01:38:33       Ben Roethlisberger wallet that a while ago though.

Speaker 9:          01:38:36       What Ben Roethlisberger Ah, that was, that was that, that was us. That was a cash grab. He raped me. Ben. Roethlisberger

Speaker 18:         01:38:45       well do you feel like, like the whole, my whole big thing with the dogs.

Speaker 9:          01:38:48       Why don't you come over here near the microphone if you're actually going to come in here and high jacket. All right, here's my lovely girlfriend, da everybody. Hey, let me just do this as like an interview, like a little Dick Cavett thing. But what was your question here? Uh, my question was in regards to the football player who, uh, allegedly choked out to what Tequila, um, and, and other, why are you being so official? The question that I had this afternoon and first of all, I want to say I love the show and I'm really like the listener first time caller. Uh, no, but do you think cause I feel like, and I guess we'll see. Please get to the point, man. Oh well we'll see how the story develops. But like, do you feel like the Michael Vick thing got more attention then when athletes have like sort of like these abuse charges, putting aside cost?

Speaker 9:          01:39:35       First of all, Sean Merryman didn't have like 40 my space whores hung from trees that he was electrocuted and drowning. Okay. He choked out one dumb whore with a fake tits, a bisexual hort that, and I have to say that I fucking hate the San Diego chargers, but my hatred went down a little bit knowing that he slapped her on Tila Tequila. That's just funny. If she was, if she was just, you know, a regular, you know, Girl from Hooters whose dad didn't stick around. So she felt the need to dress around scantily clad and try to get guys attention. You want to see my clam? If she was one of those people, that's a woman's Day. Huh? Do you think that's a woman's Day? Do you, I'll tell you this, I'll tell you this right now and I might get, I might get in trouble here as I weighed into these dangerous waters. Women don't say clam, they don't refer to it as a clam. So how would you know that? Because I'm a woman. You asshole. Well, well first of all, oh, you're storming out. You're going to take off your little lapel mic and just walk out.

Speaker 9:          01:40:38       All right. Obviously I know they don't do that. Get back here. You can't, you can't just leave like that. No, they don't say, I'm going to show you my clan, but I will tell you this. When women get fake tits, they will show you them like they got the nails done because obviously it was a very insecure part of their body.

Speaker 14:         01:40:54       So now they have it and they will eat. It's so easy to even be able to touch them. Then you just, all you gotta do is like what their big paranoia is. Now that they have them, they want you to tell them that they feel real. So all you gotta do is just be like, uh, you know other, they look really natural at the, do you feel like they feel oh yeah, here and they just grabbed your hand for some reason because their hand is on your hand. They don't feel like you're actually filling them up on Facebook before you felt a fake boot before. Okay.

Speaker 19:         01:41:27       The girl that I used to work with had fake boobs and she was just talking about it I guess like sometimes they do and I was like, Oh really? And she was like, yeah, feel them. They not read on. Yeah. See where there you go guys. Actually like Nice. I haven't really felt a lot of,

Speaker 14:         01:41:44       oops. Well what you say? Nice. What do they, what do they felt like a bag of sand?
