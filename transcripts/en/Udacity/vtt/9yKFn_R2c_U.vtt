00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.340
As we can see here, early on in the World Cup games,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.140
the games involving the home team were actually very well attended.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.700
But as time's gone on,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.470
depending on the year, sometimes the home team's not even in the tournament.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.230
Or there's other potentially more interesting games which have

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.670
a higher attendance rates than the ones involving the home team.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.420
One hypothesis for why this might be happening very early on is that many of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.790
the fans who show up to the games are from the home country,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.130
due to the fact it might be hard to get to a given World Cup

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.160
with the current state of transportation and technologies.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.640
As flying became more commonplace, as airlines have blown up, maybe over

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.180
the years it's just much easier for teams and fans to get around the world.
