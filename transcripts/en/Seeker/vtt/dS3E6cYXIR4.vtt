THE PORN JOURNAL IS COMING! THE PORN JOURNAL
IS COMING! Viva la revolucion!

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:13.769
Hey everyone, Laci Green here. We talk about
a lot of disciplines here on DNews and cover

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.860
a wide variety of scientific journals as well,
from the super mainstream like PLOS 1 to the

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.550
nichey and obscure like the Journal of Wine
Research. And this week, a new scholarly journal

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.730
birthed itself into the world -- and it's
all about porn. WHICH MAKES ME VERY EXCITED.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.580
Porn may seem more "extra curricular" than
academic, but there are definitely a lot of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.410
big scientific questions about pornography
that are unknown. Considering the fact that

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.679
(1) it's an industry larger than all the leading
tech companies COMBINED, (2) that porn sites

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.289
are more widely accessed than netflix, amazon,
and twitter COMBINED, (3) that it makes up

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:47.190
â…“ of all internet data -- I feel like heyyyyy!
Maybe we should try to put some data to our

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.190
questions.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.540
While the idea of a porn studies journal might
seem kind of silly, believe it or not, there

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.239
really hasn't been a whole lot of scholarly
study about porn. There are studies here aand

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.010
there, but for the most part they're not repeated
to test their validity and a lot of the conclusions

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.079
about porn come from peoples' anecdotes and
theories. Theories have their place too, but

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.170
we have to test them to draw conclusions!
And fortunately, rampant internet porn provides

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.000
us with an enormous pool of data to work with.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.110
From that data I hope to see things liiiiike:
HOW DOES PORN AFFECT US? OR DOES IT EVEN AT

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.090
ALL? Does the age that you first watch porn
matter? What does porn say about sexual norms

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.189
and attitudes, if anything? Is porn addiction
a real thing in the brain? What's going on

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.861
with some of the strange fantasies in porn?
What about the people who do porn - how are

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:37.130
they doin? Are there any links between porn
consumption and personality type? Occupation

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.600
type? Political ideology? Or does porn usage
transcend time and space in a universal vacuum

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.600
of nakedness?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.509
These are my questions peeps. AND I WANT ANSWERS.
I've been picking through the first issue

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.880
and there are several interesting pieces.
My favorites being "The Problem of Sexual

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.900
Fantasies", and "Porn and Sex Education, Porn
As Sex Education". I'll link those below since

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.110
the journal has allowed, for the moment, public
access.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.579
Stay tuned for more updates as the studies
get rollin. In the meantime, what question

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.229
about porn would you like to see scientists
address? .........I'm opening myself up to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.092
hell in the comments right now....and I don't
even care...... Thanks for joining me for

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:14.939
DNews everyone! I'll cya next time.
