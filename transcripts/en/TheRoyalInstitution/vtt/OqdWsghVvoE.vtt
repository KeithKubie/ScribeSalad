00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.210
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.240
We've seen how we can use
engineering to communicate

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.220
with athletes and coaches.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.330
And we've seen how we can take
measurements of sports without

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.430
disturbing it.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.810
But what we could model
a whole sport from the

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.730
equipment, to the elite athlete,
to the environment,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.740
and even to the rules?

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:53.670
Well, we've been working on a
grand unified theory, not of

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.430
gravity and quantum mechanics,
but of something

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.680
much closer to home.

00:01:05.035 --> 00:01:30.200
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.210
Constructing a grand unified
theory of a sport is about

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.230
painting the whole scientific
picture.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.830
In tennis, we look at the
friction between the surface

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.980
and the player's footwear.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.260
And there are many properties of
the racket that we measure

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.290
and model--

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.080
the strength and balance of the
frame, the string tension

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.370
and elasticity, the impact point
and swing speed, and how

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.780
the racket imparts
spin to the ball.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.040
For the ball itself, we look at
aerodynamic drag and lift,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.690
spin and movement vectors, how
it bounces, and how all of

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.900
that is affected by atmospheric
factors like

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.490
humidity, pressure,
and wind speed.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.050
We could even look at reaction
times in the biomechanics of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.139
the players using motion
tracking and 3-D modelling to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.210
analyse how they move and slide
on the surface, and how

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.770
their perceptions affect
their play.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.640
We combine these sorts of
factors to make one

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.660
overarching computer
simulation--

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.680
the grand unified theory
of tennis, Tennis GUT.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.070
Now we can change any
of these variables.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.110
We connected them all together
and they're all

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.440
here in this laptop.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.050
If I run one of my simulations,
here I'm solving

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.160
my models individually.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.490
And here we have 120

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.760
mile-an-hour serve at Wimbledon.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.880
You can see the ball reaching
the baseline there.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.090
Now what I can do now is, I can
make a change, and we can

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.850
look at verifying some
of the anecdotes that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.950
players come up with.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.510
So if I look at playing
the same tennis

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.350
shots at 3,000 metres--

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.110
at, say, Mexico City.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.430
Well, one of the things that
players say is that the ball

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.890
arrives much, much quicker
at the baseline.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.980
So we can use the model
to test that theory.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.340
And here we have
the two shots.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.570
The red one is Mexico
City, and the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.140
blue one is at Wimbledon.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.650
And you can see that the shot
at Mexico City arrives much

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.250
quicker at the baseline.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.440
And the reason for that is
because the density of the air

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.780
has decreased, allowing the
ball to fly faster.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.950
The consequence of that is,
there is actually a ball for

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.730
playing at altitude to readdress
that balance.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.240
Any mathematical model
needs to be validated

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.570
experimentally.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.960
And we're here in the
laboratories of the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.700
international tennis
federation.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.000
And here I am with Dr.
Stewart Miller.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.280
And we've helped you over the
years develop a few machines.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.860
And here's a racket power
machine which is there to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.355
mimic the serve of a player.

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:06.620
It's been a bit of a beast
to get working.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.970
And it hasn't always worked
how we wanted.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.560
Now, why would we even want
a machine like this?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.209
Because of the way in
which tennis racket

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.370
technology is changing.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.120
For many, many years all rackets
were the same size.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.000
They with 27 inches long
and 9 inches wide.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.770
But when Howard Head found that
you could make rackets

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.350
out of different materials
that were bigger, longer,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.340
wider than the old wooden
rackets, then the ITF decided

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.880
that it'd better write some
rules for tennis rackets.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.860
So we've got a rule for the
rackets, and then sometimes

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.160
other things come up, like
spin, for instance.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.460
So what expense have
we got for that?

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.540
Once you've found out how the
ball comes off the rackets in

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.880
terms of speed, you need to know
the amount of spin that's

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.020
generated as well.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.200
And this device here allows us
to quantify the amount of spin

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.440
that different rackets
and string

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.280
combinations can generate.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.180
So we've got spin, what next?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.795
Well, then we need to know how
that spin affects the flight

00:05:02.795 --> 00:05:03.960
of the ball through the air?

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.540
So that means we go to
the wind tunnel?

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.960
Indeed.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.210
Lead on.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.870
Wow, I've forgotten how
beautiful this thing is.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.450
It's like a space shuttle, or
a rocket, or something.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.290
So if we open up the working
section here, right, so we've

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.870
got our ball on a little
axle here.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.760
So, it's a while since I've
looked at this, can you remind

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.280
me of the specifications
of this wind tunnel?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.030
It simulates the aerodynamic
affects and measures those

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.411
aerodynamic characteristics for
balls travelling up to 160

00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:39.640
miles per hour, which is just
a little bit faster than the

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.080
fastest serve that's
ever been recorded.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.080
It also allows us to spin the
ball at speeds of up to 6 and

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.810
1/2 thousand revolutions per
minute, which is just a bit

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.350
faster than the fastest
spin rate

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.670
that's ever been recorded.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.490
So that means, with this device
we can simulate just

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.330
about any tennis shot that
can be generated.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.890
Now, the spin rate has gone up
since we first developed this.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.820
So that's changed.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.220
What other things might
change in tennis?

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.240
Well really, we're not sure
because that's in some ways up

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.560
to the manufacturers.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.620
But what we can do through these
experiments is assess

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.980
the effects of those changes.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.630
And when we put them together in
Tennis GUT, that allows us

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.330
to predict what might happen in
the future and to protect

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.580
the nature of the game.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.670
The grand unified theory is
just a model of reality.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:31.460
And we can use the physics to
understand what is going on.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.080
Equipment manufacturers would
love to get their hands on the

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.010
model, but the ITF is using
it to preserve the balance

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.720
between the tradition and
technology within the game.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.150
Now Tennis GUT has shown us the
way forward, and we can

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.620
use the same modelling
techniques and the way its

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.960
used for any sport.
