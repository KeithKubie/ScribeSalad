00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.240
Scientists are working hard to make cows,
sheep, and goat farts less harmful to the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.240
planet .

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.320
In 2015 agricultural researchers fed sheep
seaweed, and as a result, their farts and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.310
belches contained 70 percent less methane.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.890
In 2016, another group gave garlic to cows
and found a 50 percent reduction in methane.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.740
There are 1.5 billion cows in the world, chewin’,
belchin’, fartin’ and poopin’, and each

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.250
cow can produce up to 500 liters of methane
per day!

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.150
That’s comparable to the amount of methane
from an average car.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.289
Once in the atmosphere, methane helps keep
the planet warm, making it one of the major

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.629
culprits behind climate change.

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.699
Reducing methane can drastically affect climate
change.

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.610
In the wild, cows would eat grasses and a
bit of grain.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.730
They break down all that grass with the help
of microorganisms called archaea in their

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.519
four-chambered stomachs.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.969
Some of the archaea produce methane -- those
are called methanogens.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.979
This also applies to other animals that have
chambered stomachs, like sheep and goats -- more

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.670
methanogens, more methane!

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.640
To reduce the number of methanogens, agricultural
researchers have tried selective breeding

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.280
and feeding animals fats and starches to help
curb their farting.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.330
These methods did not work as well as feeding
cows garlic and onions.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.980
There’s a problem though… if you give
a cow an onion, it’s going to produce onion

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.370
flavored milk.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.110
And this is the case with other strong flavors
like garlic.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.670
And for most milk-drinkers, garlic milk or
onion milk probably don’t sound too appealing.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.790
So even though we know these stinky foods
reduce the methane… the flavor of the milk

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.590
stops us from putting it into practice.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.090
One study has proved promising.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.200
Scientists in Spain fed cows low levels of
propyl propane thiosulfonate, the compound

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.060
in onions which gives them their strong flavor.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.960
By giving them 25 grams per day of PTSO, they
could inhibit methanogens and keep the milk

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.000
mostly tasty.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.800
Only 12.5 percent of milk tasters sensed onion…

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.470
The researchers joked the garlic milk might
be good for the french cheese industry, but

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.070
for now, this is still a work in progress.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.280
And as global warming accelerates, be sure
scientists will keep working to cut back on

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.340
the amount of methane ballooning from the
bowels our bovine buddies.
