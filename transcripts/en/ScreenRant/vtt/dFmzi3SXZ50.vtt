00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.179
A great idea doesn't always guarantee great
movie.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.869
Over the years there have been dozens of projects
floating around Hollywood that have gotten

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.911
audiences excited but for one reason or another
never made it to the big screen.

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:21.380
Here are Screen Rant’s Greatest Movies That
Were Never Made.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.170
Return of the Jedi
Sure, fans got an end to the original trilogy

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.550
from director Richard Marquand but after Empire
Strikes Back, George Lucas approached several

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.180
filmmakers about the possibility of directing
the film.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.489
You have to give Lucas credit for thinking
outside the box by considering names like

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.330
David Lynch and David Cronenberg.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.510
Their edgy, experimental styles didn’t really
suit the established franchise, but the idea

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.070
of the minds behind The Fly or Twin Peaks
directing a Star Wars film is so out there,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.010
that fans still can't resist imagining the
possibilities.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.629
Napoleon
Perhaps the most famous unrealized project

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.560
of director Stanley Kubrick has to be "Napoleon."

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.180
Utterly obsessed with the military leader,
Kubrick had done so many years of research

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.200
into the French leader that he wound up with
a filing cabinet filled with index cards,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.970
each detailing where Napoleon was, and why,
on any given day of his documented life.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.220
But when 1970's Waterloo turned out to be
a flop, the studio got nervous.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.980
Even though the research was used for his
film Barry Lyndon, Kubrick's epic biopic would

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.720
have been something special.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840
Gladiator 2
In 2008 it was revealed that Russell Crowe

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.689
had approached musician/writer Nick Cave to
pen a sequel to the Oscar winning period drama

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.369
Gladiator.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.540
Since Maximus dies at the end of the first
film (spoiler), Cave wrote a script that begins

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.990
with Maximus in purgatory before being sent
back to earth by the gods to fight a new Christ

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.450
figure gaining popularity.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.229
Cave wanted it to be called ‘Christ Killer’
and planned a climax with Maximus fighting

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.049
in famous battles through the ages up to present
day.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.650
By all accounts it was an incredible script,
but one that could never be made by a major

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.729
studio.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.760
Double V Vega
By now it’s common knowledge that the characters

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.180
of Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction and Vic Vega
(aka Mr. Blonde) in Reservoir Dogs are brothers

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.149
in the Tarantino Cinematic Universe.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.010
Since both characters died in their respective
films, Tarantino had kicked around ideas for

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.850
a prequel called Double V Vega that would
feature Vic visiting Vincent in Amsterdam.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.829
There were even talks of a sequel where John
Travolta and Michael Madsen would play the

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:26.790
older brothers of Vincent and Vic out for
revenge, but with Tarantino claiming he’s

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.320
nearing the end of his directing career, and
the actors not getting any younger, it’s

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.420
highly doubtful that one will be the Vega
Brothers movie.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.109
A Confederacy of Dunces
Over the years, the adaptation of this Pulitzer

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:44.329
Prize winning novel has had massive stars
attached, including John Belushi, John Candy,

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.699
Chris Farley, Will Ferrell and Zach Galifinakis.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.669
There's no question it's a hit in the making,
but progress has been stalled by everything

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.549
from deaths to natural disasters like Hurricane
Katrina.

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.940
In 2013, director Steven Soderberg claimed
the project was cursed, making it hard to

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.920
believe it will be picked up any time soon.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.260
Bioshock
In 2008, Gore Verbinski, hot off hits like

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.380
The Ring and Pirates of the Caribbean, signed
on to direct an adaptation of the surprise

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.010
hit video game BioShock.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.480
Verbinski fought to make the story of a ruined
underwater utopia R rated, with a budget upwards

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.780
of $200 million.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.250
When the R-rated Watchmen underperformed at
the box office, the studio saw it as proof

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.540
that the idea wouldn't work, and pulled the
plug on BioShock.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.970
Some of the film’s concept art has since
been released online confirming that this

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.730
would have stayed true to the game’s popular
aesthetic while also representing Verbinsksi’s

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.650
unique vision.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.970
Forty Lashes Less One
The only film Tarantino ever adapted from

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.900
someone else’s story is 1997’s Jackie
Brown, based on Elmore Leonard’s novel Rum

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.900
Punch.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.250
Tarantino has mentioned several other Leonard
books he owns the rights to and would be interested

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.190
in adapting, with none more promising than
Forty Lashes Less One: the story of two condemned

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.350
men given the chance to earn their freedom
by hunting down the five most dangerous criminals

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.350
in America.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.910
Tarantino had even begun writing the screenplay
at one point, but considering it’s another

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.199
western that deals with race and bounty hunters,
we probably won’t see Tarantino bring this

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.870
one to the big screen any time soon.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.370
Halo
With names like Peter Jackson and Guillermo

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.120
del Toro attached, plus an incredible short
film by the then unknown director Neill Blomkamp,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.479
it seems crazy that fans never got the Halo
film they were promised.

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.140
With a script by Alex Garland, who went on
to write Dredd and direct Ex Machina, the

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.640
film entered pre-production in 2004 before
getting completely bogged down by development

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.560
issues and studio politics.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.160
All the initial players have moved on to various
projects, but the video game franchise is

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.960
still going strong, begging the question:
when is this going to happen?

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.770
Those are just some of the movies that could
have turned into Hollywood hits if they'd

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.710
actually been made, or tarnished the originals,
if they were a disappointment to fans.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.210
Which movies do YOU wish had been made?
