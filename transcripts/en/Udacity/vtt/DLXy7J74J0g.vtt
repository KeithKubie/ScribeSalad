00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.246
Thinking about the conclusions we drew about these graphs in terms of which ones

00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:08.404
are functions and which one isn't, let's make a generalization about how we can

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:12.461
tell graphically what is a function. So in other words, how can we test

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:17.014
graphically that a given curve only has 1 y value for every x value? I'd like

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:21.460
you to complete this sentence to create this guideline for us. So if we draw

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.540
what kind of line on the same coordinate plane as any given function, the

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.005
functions curve should intersect that line some number or fewer times. Now this

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.888
is definitely a really tricky question, seriously. So if you have trouble with

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:37.571
this that is 100% fine. This is going to give us a really useful tool. So take a

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.353
second to consider the question.
