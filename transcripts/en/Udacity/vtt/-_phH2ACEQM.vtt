00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.450
&gt;&gt; Alright Sam, I'm ready let's build this app. What do we do?

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.580
&gt;&gt; So the first thing we need to do is

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.750
think about what do we care about most at a festival.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.420
&gt;&gt; Okay I mean we're paying attention, mostly I guess, to the bands.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.991
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:13.640
&gt;&gt; the stages they're playing on and the people who are going.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.370
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.850
&gt;&gt; That sound about right?

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are the main things we want to track. Let's write it

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.850
down on this tablet and kind of map out what our schema is going to be.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.220
&gt;&gt; First, we start off with our festival.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.870
One of the other things you said we wanted to track, were

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.650
bands. Also, we wanted to track stages, and we wanted to track attendees.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.972
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, you've written these words.

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:37.477
is there any particular reason why you did

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:41.480
it the way you did? Like in these boxes, or any reason for the structure?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.700
&gt;&gt; So I think the boxes will become

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.890
a little more apparent when we go into the

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.880
app to start building. But for now, I mean,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.870
it's pretty simple. We'll build up more later but

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.570
really, it'll become a little more interesting

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.210
when we actually start connecting the boxes and

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.000
talking about how do festivals relate to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.260
bands, or how do attendees relate to festivals.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.840
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. so I, I, should we start building it? What do we have to do?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.943
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go in the browser.

00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:05.209
&gt;&gt; Okay.
