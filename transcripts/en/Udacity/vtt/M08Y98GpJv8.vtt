00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.144
Mental disorders are much more common than many of us think. Almost half of us

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:08.671
will experience a mental disorder at some time in our lifetime. According to

00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:13.073
the main guide for clinical psychologists, the DSM-5, diagnosing mental

00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:17.404
disorders involves all four of the four D's: Disturbance, Dysfunction,

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:23.410
Distress, and Deviance. There are many different categories of disorders but

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.450
some of the major ones are those experienced in childhood. Like autism spectrum

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.590
or ADHD. Mood disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depression, and bipolar

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.343
disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorders. Post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:00:38.343 --> 00:00:44.152
Dissociative disorders. Bodily-somatic disorders. Personality disorders. And,

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:49.170
finally, the major thought disorder known as schizophrenia. Now, remember, a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.265
very important point about disorders is that there is a range from normal to

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:58.755
dysfunctional. And everyone experiences everyday forms of these, but they're

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.850
not necessarily actually disorders unless they have all four of those D's:

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.400
Disturbance, Dysfunction, Distress, and Deviance.
