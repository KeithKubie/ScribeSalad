00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
&gt;&gt; Hello, this is Greg Dees from the Fuqua
School of Business at Duke

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.451
University reporting from Davos 2010.
I think the most exciting development over

00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:14.600
the next decade is going to
be the inclusion of social entrepreneurs in

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.650
solving many of the world's
social problems.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.270
Up to this point, I think there's been a heavy
reliance on top-down

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.610
solutions -- the belief that large-scale institutions
and governments

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.210
can solve these problems with large plans.
We realize now that there's a lot of uncertainty

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.999
about what's going to
work, and about what will solve the problems,

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:42.229
and about the kinds of
business models and approaches we need.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:45.879
Social entrepreneurs have been out there working
at the grassroots

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.729
levels developing innovative approaches to
do this.

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:54.199
Many of them have had tremendous success.
And I think we need to learn from what they've

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.799
accomplished and
continue to learn from what they've accomplished.

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.730
And we have many of them at Davos here this
year and we will are all

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.500
learning from them and I think we'll continue
to learn from them.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.830
I think the exciting things are going to be
a regular part of the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.110
conversation.
To me, that's going a take us a leap forward

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.720
and I'm excited to see
that.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.120
Thank you.
