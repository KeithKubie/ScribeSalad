00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.260
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.740
something a little
unconventional.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.950
Because I tried this problem
before I started this video,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.070
and I kept getting
an answer that

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.100
isn't one of these
answers over here.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.680
So assuming that the exam
writers did this properly--

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.020
and this is a serious exam.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.529
It's to get into a very
prestigious set of universities

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.070
in India, so I'm
assuming they didn't

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.910
make any major mistakes here.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.000
I want you to tell me where
I'm making the mistake.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.870
So let's just try
to do the problem.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.049
Let p and q be real numbers
such that p does not equal 0,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.250
p to the third does not
equal q, and p to the third

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.180
also does not equal negative q.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.120
If alpha and beta are
nonzero complex numbers

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.740
satisfying alpha plus beta
is equal to negative p

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.510
and alpha cubed plus
beta cubed is equal to q,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.510
then a quadratic equation
having alpha/beta and beta/alpha

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.538
as its roots is.

00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:56.746
Did I just call it b up here?

00:00:56.746 --> 00:00:57.850
It's beta.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.834
So what could that quadratic be?

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:01.500
Well, these are the
two roots, so that's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.530
pretty straightforward.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.670
We could say that the quadratic,
a possible quadratic here,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.460
would be x minus alpha/beta
times x minus beta/alpha

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.450
is equal to 0.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.730
Clearly, the roots of
this equation right

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.730
here are alpha/beta
and beta/alpha.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.110
Either one of those would
satisfy this equation.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.310
Now let's multiply this
out. x times x is x squared.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.960
x times negative beta/alpha
is negative beta/alpha x.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.230
Then you have
negative alpha/beta

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.110
x, so negative alpha/beta x.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.130
And then you have
negative alpha/beta

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.880
times negative beta/alpha.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.090
The alpha's cancel out.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.010
The beta's cancel out.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.390
The negatives cancel out.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.801
And you get plus
1 is equal to 0.

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:03.800
And then let's see, we
might be able to simplify

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.670
this a little bit.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.139
If we multiplied everything
times alpha beta,

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.310
what will happen?

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.000
So I'm just going to
multiply both sides

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.150
of this equation
times alpha beta.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.344
I don't like having
things in denominators.

00:02:21.344 --> 00:02:23.510
Clearly, the right-hand
side is still going to be 0.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.380
The left-hand side now
becomes alpha beta x squared.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.590
Alpha beta times beta/alpha,
the alphas cancel out.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.080
You have a beta times a beta.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:45.020
So it's negative beta squared
x minus-- the betas cancel out.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.330
And now you have an alpha times
an alpha minus alpha squared x.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.540
And now you have plus
alpha beta is equal to 0.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.620
And then we can combine
these terms over here.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.180
So we have alpha beta
x squared minus-- you

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.740
have an alpha squared plus a
beta squared x-- all right,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.780
I just took the
negatives out of it--

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.730
plus alpha beta is equal to 0.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.250
All right.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.711
So everything I did is
just kind of-- I just said,

00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:24.710
OK, these are the roots.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.710
Let me just multiply it
out, and I got something

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.040
in terms of alpha and beta.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.664
Now when you look at
it, their choices,

00:03:29.664 --> 00:03:32.190
clearly they want answers
in terms of p's and q's.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.050
So let's see if we can
convert this into p's and q's.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.050
So a good place to start, they
tell us that alpha plus beta is

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.240
equal to negative p, or negative
p is equal to alpha plus beta.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.920
And so if we squared that,
what I want to do is somehow

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.816
relate it to q as well.

00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:53.190
And so maybe if we eventually
take it to the third power,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.340
we can get some of these terms
over here and relate it to q.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.932
And also, when we
square it, I think

00:03:57.932 --> 00:04:00.390
we'll be able to relate some
of these things to it as well.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.790
So let's square both
sides of this equation.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.060
So you have negative
p squared, which,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.000
because the negative
canceled out,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.520
this is the same thing
as negative 1 times p

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.760
squared, which is negative
1 squared times p squared,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.779
which is just p squared,
is equal to this expression

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.890
over here squared,
which is just alpha

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.740
squared plus 2 alpha
beta plus beta squared.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.340
Fair enough.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.690
And already we have
something interesting

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.030
showing up over here.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.710
We can express alpha
squared plus beta

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.982
squared in terms of p
squared and alpha beta.

00:04:39.982 --> 00:04:41.690
And then we simplify
things a little bit.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:42.856
Well, we'll just keep going.

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:44.890
Let's just take this
to the third power.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.470
So if we have negative p
to the third power, which

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.340
is the same thing as the
negative of p to the third,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.830
if you multiply this
thing times negative p,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.240
you're going to get the
negative sign p to the third.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.150
And this is equal to-- we
could just multiply again,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.410
do the distributive property.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.710
Or if you kind of remember
Pascal's triangles,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.350
you remember the coefficients
on it, or the binomial theorem,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.520
this would be a
faster way to do it.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.070
I'll do a Pascal's
triangle really quick here.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.222
So you have 1.

00:05:14.222 --> 00:05:15.350
1, 1 for binomial.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.990
1, 2, 1, when you take the
square of a binomial, 1, 2, 1.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.180
And then when you take
that to the third, when

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.762
you go to the third
power, it's 1, 3, 3, 1.

00:05:24.762 --> 00:05:26.220
Bunch of videos on
this, especially

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.570
in the videos on the
binomial theorem.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.566
So this to the third
power, this thing

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:31.940
right here to the
third power, is

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.110
going to be alpha
to the third plus

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:46.750
3 alpha squared beta
plus 3 alpha beta squared

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.920
plus beta to the third.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.964
I just decreased the exponent
on the alpha each time

00:05:50.964 --> 00:05:53.380
and started increasing the
exponent on the beta each time.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.460
Or you could just
multiply this times this,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.130
and you should also get this.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.300
And now this is
interesting because this

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.575
is expressing everything
in terms of-- let's see

00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:05.460
if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.620
This is equal to--
so let me write

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.830
this-- we have negative
p to the third, which

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.900
is equal to negative
p to the third,

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.730
just a difference
of the parentheses,

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.300
is equal to-- we have this
alpha cubed plus the beta cubed.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.470
That's those two terms
right over there.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.570
And I separate those out
because those are our q.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.910
Those are our q.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.730
And then I have--
let's see, over here I

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:35.380
can factor out a 3 alpha
beta, so plus 3 alpha beta.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.160
And what do I get?

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.150
If I factor out a
3 alpha beta here,

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.080
I'm just left with an
alpha on this term.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.750
And if I factor out
a 3 alpha beta here,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.870
I'm just left with a beta.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.780
I am just left with a beta.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.910
So what does this simplify to?

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.370
So this is going to simplify
to-- this right here

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.550
is equal to our q.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.670
So this is equal to
q plus 3 alpha beta.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.330
And what's alpha plus beta?

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.540
Well, they already told us
what alpha plus beta is.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.490
Alpha plus beta is negative p.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.500
It is negative p.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.220
So let's see what
we can do over here.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.960
And this right here
is the same thing

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.540
as negative p to the third.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.340
So here we can solve
for alpha beta,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.349
and so we'll have alpha beta
in terms of p's and q's.

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:29.140
So that'll be good.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.760
So we can substitute the alpha
beta's with whatever we get

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.570
in terms of p's and q's.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.875
And then this thing we can
express in terms of a p

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.250
and an alpha beta, which means
we can express it in terms

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.020
of p's and q's.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.279
So let me do what
I'm talking about.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.570
Let me do it I'm talking about.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.230
So let's just solve, first
of all, for alpha beta.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.360
So if we solve for
alpha beta, first we

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.360
want to subtract q from
both sides of this equation.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.680
So you have negative
p to the third minus

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.470
q is equal to-- we have this
negative sign over here,

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:06.690
so it's equal to
negative 3 alpha beta p.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.510
And I want to solve
for alpha beta, so let

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.080
me divide both
sides by negative 3.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.800
And so we get, on
the right-hand side,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.734
we get alpha beta is equal
to, if you divide-- so

00:08:18.734 --> 00:08:20.400
let me just write it
out because I don't

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.780
want to make a careless mistake.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:30.210
So you have negative p to the
third minus q over negative 3p.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.210
Now if we multiply the
numerator and denominator

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:38.710
by a negative sign, we get p
to the third plus q over 3p

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:45.520
is equal to alpha beta.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.980
So we can now express this
and this term in terms

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.860
of p's and q's.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.820
Now what about this
one right here?

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.800
So what is alpha squared
plus beta squared?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.630
And we see right up
here, alpha squared,

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.570
that's alpha squared
plus beta squared.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.740
So if we subtract 2 alpha
beta from both sides

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.650
of this equation,
we get alpha squared

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:12.550
plus beta-- let me do this
in a different color-- we get

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.360
alpha squared plus
beta squared is going

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:24.710
to be equal to p squared
minus 2 alpha beta.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.710
All right?

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.720
I just subtracted 2 alpha
beta from both sides.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.640
And so this is going to be
equal to p squared minus 2 times

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:49.927
this thing, minus 2 times p
to the third plus q over 3p.

00:09:49.927 --> 00:09:51.010
And what is this equal to?

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.620
This is equal to-- let's put
on a common denominator--

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.480
p squared over-- this is the
same thing as 3-- my cell

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.000
phone rang.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.041
I had to pause it, sorry.

00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:04.890
So this is equal to
3p to the squared--

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.380
if I want to put it
over 3p-- is equal to 3p

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.625
to the third over 3p.

00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:11.500
Let me make it clear.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.995
This term right here
is this term over here

00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:15.120
if you were to simplify it.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.985
The 3's cancel out.

00:10:15.985 --> 00:10:17.970
You just have p squared.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.370
And then you have
minus-- I'm just

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.040
going to distribute the negative
2-- minus 2p to the third minus

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.400
2q, all of that over 3p.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.540
So it is equal to 3p
cubed minus 2p cubed

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:43.190
is equal to p cubed minus
2q, all of that over 3p.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.250
So now we can write this
entire expression in terms

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.140
of p's and q's.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.490
This first term over
here, alpha beta, this

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.810
is p cubed plus
q over 3p, and we

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.995
want to multiply
that times x squared.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.680
And then you have minus alpha
squared plus beta squared.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.680
We just figured out that
alpha squared plus beta

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.050
squared is this thing over here.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.200
So minus-- I'll do it
in a different color,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.190
I'll do it in green--
minus this thing,

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.270
p to the third minus 2q over 3p.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.980
And that's going to be
multiplied by an x, and then

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.820
plus alpha beta again.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:34.450
So alpha beta is p to
the third plus q over 3p.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.770
Now, when we look at any
of the choices up here,

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:37.790
it looks simplified.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.930
We don't see any 3p's
in the denominator.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.680
So let's see if we
can simplify that.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.345
Oh, and we don't want to
lose-- we had an equals 0 here

00:11:46.345 --> 00:11:46.970
the whole time.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.260
So this is equals 0.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.030
So when you multiply both
sides of this equation by 3p,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.190
what do you get?

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:59.070
This first term becomes p to the
third plus q times x squared.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:05.310
The second term becomes minus
p to the third minus 2q x.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:12.540
And then this last term becomes
plus p to the third plus q,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.370
and this is going
to be equal to 0.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.620
Now, let's see how this
compares to the choices.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.090
And I think I actually did
not make my careless mistake

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.900
in this video.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.220
I actually got the right answer.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.700
Let me see.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.700
It shows you, when
you do it carefully,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.360
you're less likely
to make errors.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:32.860
OK.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.580
So let's see.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.390
How does this match up
to what I have over here?

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.880
Well, this looks exactly.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.670
I'm very excited because
I tried this twice

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.400
before actually
making the video,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.990
and I kept making
a careless mistake.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.390
But this time I didn't
make the careless mistake,

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.350
and I got B, p to the third
plus q x squared minus p

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:56.206
to the third minus 2q x
plus p to the third plus q.

00:12:56.206 --> 00:13:01.312
So that right there, that
right there is our answer.

00:13:01.312 --> 00:13:03.520
So I take back what I said
at the beginning of video.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.760
I didn't need your help.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.510
But I guess just the
process of explaining

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.070
it was the help that I needed.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.060
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
