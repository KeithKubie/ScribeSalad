00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Oh

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.520
We've all dealt with narcissism at one point or another in our lives whether from a co-worker

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.779
Family member friend or lover it's a draining experience

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.170
Leaving you emotionally fatigued and sapped of your energy

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.720
Sometimes it's easy to notice the signs and leave before getting hurt but sometimes

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.869
There is a cost to leaving that we cannot or do not want to pay this is most common with parents and job opportunities

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.250
It takes a whole lot of courage to make these different relationships work

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.059
Despite urgent feelings of needing to run so you don't get hurt

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.950
However there are steps

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.469
You can take to help you cope with the narcissists in your life and keep your relationships in as much ease as possible

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340
Identify the type of narcissist you're dealing with

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.939
Researchers have categorized narcissists into two different categories

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.700
grandiose and vulnerable

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.489
Grandiose narcissists have incredibly high self esteem believing themselves to be superior to everyone else

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.529
They are the stereotypical narcissists that people think of when they hear the word narcissist

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.389
Vulnerable narcissists have low levels of self-esteem high levels of insecurity and tend to compensate by focusing only on themselves

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.260
This means they have self-absorption and self-centered tendencies

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.290
Once you know what kind of narcissist they are you can change your interactions with them to keep your relationships healthy?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.469
Grandiose narcissists are wonderful helpers with your goals if you give them an important job and praise their work often

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.819
Vulnerable narcissists need constant reassuring that they're doing a good job

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.869
And you'll need to be sure not to accidentally offend them in the heat of a moment

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840
While it can be difficult or frustrating

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.720
To think about where people are coming from or why they are the way they are it is key to helping you feel for them

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.459
There are always more events in a person's history that has affected them more than they let on

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.619
figuring out someone's backstory

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.078
And why they lash out the way they do can also help you handle their angry outbursts and regain patience and tolerance

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.389
While it is important to find out what the person is coming from it's equally as important to listen to your own feelings and thoughts

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.280
What actions and behaviors of theirs bothers triggers or hurts you what goals do you have pertaining your relationship?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.550
And how are you willing to push your past feelings to maintain it?

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.990
after you take a look inside yourself and

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.369
Evaluate how you feel you can figure out where to draw the line and form boundaries and where to push forward and cope with your

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.370
Feelings in the end this experience will teach you a lesson about yourself and how to handle yourself in times of distress

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.600
Not like any other person narcissus require a gentle touch when communicating with them

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.949
It won't be as honest and open as with others nor will it be as straightforward

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.470
They may get defensive quickly

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.179
But this is because of insecurities sensitivities or lack of empathy they might have

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.860
Be careful not to let things backfire on you as you'll end up in a direct conflict

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.199
Which is never fun and was never your intention

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.959
Communicate as gently as possible without

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.679
Compromising your own values and recognize if and when you should gently step back or put your foot down as long as it is done

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.400
respectfully

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.120
If and when you put your foot down to draw some boundaries between you two be prepared to face the consequences

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.749
No matter, how gentle you were in laying down the law they will take it as a direct attack and treat it as such

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.370
depending on the person and situation

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.630
they may or may not end up resenting you it is important to remember in this time that this is part of the process and

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.029
You may not be being treated well enough by them

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.580
You are not someone who obeys them all the time

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.190
But it is better to recognize your own needs values and limits than to compromise them for someone else

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.860
While humor isn't called for in some situations it might just be your saving grace

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.239
Finding humor and a narcissists behavior may help you cope you can also call out their behaviors with a smile or a light joke

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.820
Remember to choose your time and carefully so as to not accidentally offend them and make the situation worse

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.220
Choose to keep humor to a minimum in moments of high stress anger or distress

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:14.880
however when a

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.869
Narcissist does something naturally and without thinking if you point it out in a light-hearted manner it is more likely to be well received

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.659
listened to and potentially corrected

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.459
Depending on how close you are to the narcissist you may have to decide if they need more help than you can provide in order

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.210
To maintain or regain a healthy relationship with people who are close to you your best friend lover or family member

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.880
Keeping a distance doesn't always feel like an option

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.509
Many psychotherapists are trained to help with this disorder and can help them and you remain healthy and happy

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.790
Remember that loving them sometimes is not enough and needing professional. Help is okay

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.639
Remember to see the positives this person obviously has positive qualities, or else you wouldn't be trying to maintain your relationship

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.040
Focus on the good qualities and the reasons why you want to make things work when you feel overwhelmed or stressed?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.120
Integrate this into your plan so you can enjoy the most out of your relationship

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.989
For instance if you know a certain place or situation that may trigger them avoid them to the best of your ability

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.800
The same goes for conversation topics if you know of a subject that gets them going steer clear of them and talk about something else

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.869
Go out to places you can both. Enjoy yourselves and talk about things you both like talking about

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.719
Always remind yourself of why this person holds great value to you and that no one is just their disorder

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.919
Lastly it is most important to accept them while it may feel like you're walking on eggshells at times

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.270
It is important to remember that nothing they are doing that hurts. You is intentional

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.210
It is not that they do not want to see things from your point of view

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.210
But it is that they are unable to

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.530
you must accept that you will never have an equal relationship with this person if you choose to maintain your

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.500
relationship with them

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.549
This is all up to you as no one can tell you what to do

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.120
But you cannot expect them to change just for you and instead you must change your outlook and strategies to keep them in your life

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.569
If you choose remember that they are more than their disorder

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.760
That's all from us. That's like to go

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.090
