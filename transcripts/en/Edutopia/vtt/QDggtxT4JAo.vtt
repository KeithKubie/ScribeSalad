00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:10.246
&gt;&gt;Scott: The project is too
big for you to do by yourself.

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:13.056
And so you're going to
be working with people

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:16.146
in your group from now through March.

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:19.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Science teacher, Scott
McComb is rolling out a new project

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:23.156
for his freshman class at
Seattle's Aviation High School.

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:25.000
&gt;&gt;Scott: You might be saying to
yourself at this point, "Oh, great.

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:27.000
We're going to build a wing,
we're going to break it,

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:29.350
we're going to build another
wing, we're going to break it,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we're going to build another
wing, we're going to break it.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.000
Whoa, gee, that sounds like
so much fun," but in fact,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.500
it is fun and let me tell you why.

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:40.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The goal is to introduce
students to the joys and challenges

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:41.936
of real-world engineering.

00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:43.446
&gt;&gt;Scott: 'Oh, a bending
moment diagram!

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:46.486
Oh, okay. I'm a reasonably
smart person.

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:47.256
I can figure that out.

00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:54.176
Sure, all right, a little first
derivative, a little calculus.

00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:56.516
Okay, that's pretty good,
all right, ooh, okay!

00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:01.026
Oh, my! Oh, my, uh-oh.

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:01.336
Whoa, friends!'

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:05.636
Okay, engineering is fun
and engineering is hard--

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:09.866
or hard from the outside looking
in, but once we get the hang

00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:13.556
of this [snaps], it's going to
go like this [snaps in rhythm].

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To get the hang of
engineering, students will work

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.336
in teams of three for
the next six months,

00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:23.596
competing to design a highly
efficient lightweight wing structure

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:24.556
made of paper mache.

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:31.116
Located in the heart of Seattle's
sprawling aircraft design

00:01:31.116 --> 00:01:35.216
and construction industry, Aviation
High School is a small science

00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:39.666
and math magnet that is open to any
student with a passion for aviation.

00:01:40.106 --> 00:01:43.686
And it is dedicated to the
practice of project-based learning.

00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:47.586
&gt;&gt;Ha-ha! Residents of the
Duwamish, prepare to suffer!

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:48.126
&gt;&gt;Oh, no! It's the blue attack!

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:50.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In Environmental
Science Class, students write

00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:53.336
and perform plays to
promote conservation.

00:01:53.526 --> 00:01:56.646
&gt;&gt;So our transit line, it's going
to start over here at SeaTac,

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:59.886
and it's going to go all the
way down to White Center.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:03.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In math, they redesign
Seattle's Public Transport System.

00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:05.826
&gt;&gt;It's going to break--
it's going to bend.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:08.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And in McComb's
science classroom, they learn how

00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:09.976
to build and break things.

00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:10.396
&gt;&gt;Light ones.

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:12.486
Ah, dude!

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:14.786
&gt;&gt;Hayley: I like doing
hands-on projects more,

00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:19.486
just because I feel I learn better
by learning from my own experiences.

00:02:19.836 --> 00:02:23.246
When we were doing the wing project,
I learned from our experiences.

00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:24.546
Like our first wing was really bad.

00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:26.996
And then our third wing,
we did really well.

00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:27.216
&gt;&gt;Hayley: Oh!

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:28.176
I'm so proud of us!

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:28.836
&gt;&gt;Scott: You should be!

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:31.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The wing
project grew out of a series

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:32.876
of summer meetings facilitated

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:35.356
by Project-Based Learning
Coach, Eava Reeder.

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:39.026
&gt;&gt;Eeva: We need to go backwards
from those big ideas and identify,

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.836
"What's the breakdown, the skills?"

00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:44.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Reeder recruited
structural engineer, Doug Gross,

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:47.656
who volunteered his time as subject
matter expert on the project.

00:02:47.826 --> 00:02:49.546
&gt;&gt;Doug: You can't just
put pressure on a wing,

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:51.576
'cause it's just about impossible.

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.566
So what we do is we put loads
on it in enough locations

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:58.706
to give the same force distribution
as you have in the flying vehicle.

00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:01.176
&gt;&gt;Doug: You know, I started
thinking about it, and my mind kind

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:04.276
of just goes into all the things
that people ought to know.

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:07.496
Of course, I'm looking at
it from the perspective

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:09.636
of somebody who's been
doing it for 15 years.

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:12.476
&gt;&gt;Eeva: You're talking about
something that presupposes calculus

00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:14.056
and a lot of years
of physics, etcetera.

00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:17.936
Now, we're talking about how do
you take this project and break it

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:19.536
down so freshmen can do that.

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:24.286
&gt;&gt;Doug: So I just take a step back,
and Eeva helps me to say, "Well,

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:25.726
you know, we can't do the universe,"

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.906
so we just grab the
fundamental things

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:29.616
that the students can understand.

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:32.006
&gt;&gt;Scott: And so what I'm passing out
now, this is a tentative timeline.

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:34.606
"Tentative" meaning, of
course, it's subject to change.

00:03:34.606 --> 00:03:38.196
&gt;&gt;Scott: If there's not buy-in
from the students from the start,

00:03:38.196 --> 00:03:43.066
what you've suddenly committed to
is three months or six months of,

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:44.926
"Now I'm going to torture
you with this project,

00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:46.026
which you're not interested in."

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:47.746
So that's challenge number one.

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:49.956
&gt;&gt;Scott: November 17th,
we will design the wing.

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:52.206
December 1st, we will build the wing.

00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:55.586
&gt;&gt;Scott: Challenge number two is
finding a way to make it authentic.

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:57.736
Whose working on this in real life?

00:03:57.736 --> 00:04:00.136
Why are we spending
our time with this?

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:02.186
&gt;&gt;Doug: Now our project
that we're going to work

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:05.456
on here is not the
aerodynamics of a wing,

00:04:05.456 --> 00:04:07.336
it's the structural
performance of a wing.

00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:09.036
We do this is the real world, too.

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:13.366
And it's very cool, and I'm
hoping to show you how cool it is.

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:16.986
&gt;&gt;Scott: Third, is to introduce
an element of challenge.

00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:19.336
To make students say, "Wait a minute.

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:22.446
There is a reason for me to
get better at what I'm doing.

00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:25.956
&gt;&gt;Scott: On March 24th, you're going
to stand in front of your peers,

00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:27.896
you're going to stand in front of
your parents, you're going to stand

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:30.606
in front of a panel of
engineers, and you're going

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:32.266
to say, "Here's our wing design.

00:04:32.936 --> 00:04:34.076
This is the one we recommend.

00:04:34.286 --> 00:04:34.936
And here's why."

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:36.296
You will have data.

00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:37.566
You will have graphs.

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:40.506
You will have a clear
presentation with clear roles.

00:04:40.886 --> 00:04:42.436
And you're going to knock
the socks off people.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:46.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As a first step,
students had to select two classmates

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:47.456
to work with on the project.

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:51.376
&gt;&gt;Scott: I want to remind you,
here's your chance to not work

00:04:51.376 --> 00:04:53.596
with your friend, and
not hurt their feelings.

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:56.956
If you have a special someone, a
little heartthrob in this classroom,

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:58.476
don't work with them either.

00:04:59.226 --> 00:05:00.526
It's a disaster.

00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:03.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After selecting
teammates,

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.816
each student signed an agreement,

00:05:04.996 --> 00:05:07.906
detailing their individual
responsibilities to the group.

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:12.036
&gt;&gt;How will we share our work,
and track our progress as a team?

00:05:12.616 --> 00:05:14.926
&gt;&gt;Maybe like a check-off
sheet or something like that.

00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:17.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As the project
progressed, teams designed,

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:20.416
built and tested various
wing structures.

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:22.156
&gt;&gt;It's quite an improvement for us.

00:05:22.436 --> 00:05:25.266
Remember our first wing
didn't even hold water.

00:05:25.316 --> 00:05:27.596
&gt;&gt;Scott: Many people have an
idea of engineering and science

00:05:27.596 --> 00:05:29.926
as being inaccessible,
and it's like, "Oh, no!

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:31.256
I can't do that!

00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:31.946
I don't know how!

00:05:32.396 --> 00:05:33.216
It's too big.

00:05:33.216 --> 00:05:34.216
It requires too much math."

00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:36.916
When, in fact, it's about diligence.

00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:39.436
It's about good observations,
it's about good teamwork.

00:05:39.696 --> 00:05:41.826
And these are skills
which anybody can do.

00:05:42.616 --> 00:05:44.676
&gt;&gt;No serious signs of stress.

00:05:44.796 --> 00:05:47.196
&gt;&gt;Try the book instead.

00:05:47.196 --> 00:05:47.946
[crackling sound]

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:50.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each round of testing
provided useful information

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:51.796
for students...

00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:54.526
&gt;&gt;We think our last one would
have done better, but this one,

00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:57.216
it was lighter, so the efficiency's
probably going to be higher.

00:05:57.216 --> 00:05:58.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and teachers.

00:05:58.336 --> 00:06:00.416
&gt;&gt;Scott: I remember after the first
round of testing, we said, "Well,

00:06:00.636 --> 00:06:03.256
it looks like we need to
improve on quality control."

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:05.976
And so we cut back
the number of wings

00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:07.976
to be tested per group every round.

00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:10.416
We made a long list of variables
we were going to control.

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:13.166
We made a long list of data we
need to make sure we collect.

00:06:13.396 --> 00:06:16.446
And we figured out the importance
of it, including a screen

00:06:16.446 --> 00:06:19.196
in the background so we could
measure deflection more accurately.

00:06:19.196 --> 00:06:21.826
We learned the importance of going
from videotape to still shots,

00:06:21.826 --> 00:06:24.766
so we could quickly analyze
the data, and so forth.

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:25.876
&gt;&gt;Hayley: Well, that's doing good.

00:06:25.876 --> 00:06:27.906
Better than our last one.

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:30.036
&gt;&gt;Scott: So the second round
was a much smoother test,

00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:31.636
and the third round even more so.

00:06:32.436 --> 00:06:34.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During the
final round of testing,

00:06:34.086 --> 00:06:37.616
several local aeronautical
engineers came to school to assist

00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:38.956
in analyzing the results.

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:41.706
&gt;&gt;Engineer: It kind of looks like you
fill this main section right here,

00:06:41.706 --> 00:06:42.516
and this will...

00:06:42.516 --> 00:06:45.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The data an observations
from these tests would be included

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:49.606
in a final presentation each team
would give to these same engineers.

00:06:49.956 --> 00:06:50.166
&gt;&gt;Engineer: Right.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:52.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: On Presentation
Day, McComb,

00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:56.146
assisted with Wardrobe
adjustments and coached his class

00:06:56.146 --> 00:06:57.806
on public speaking techniques.

00:06:57.806 --> 00:06:59.646
&gt;&gt;Scott: Brian, you said
that you had a suggestion?

00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:01.726
&gt;&gt;Brian: Be positive about
your other teammates.

00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:03.776
Don't try and bring somebody
down, because it just looks bad.

00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:07.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Armed with their
test results and design files,

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:09.396
the students set off to
impress the engineers.

00:07:09.796 --> 00:07:13.996
&gt;&gt;Our task for this project was
to create a high-efficiency,

00:07:13.996 --> 00:07:16.976
low-weight wing that when tested,

00:07:16.976 --> 00:07:20.836
it would show the values
you'd want for a real wing.

00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:23.816
&gt;&gt;You can see that
the design started off

00:07:23.906 --> 00:07:26.136
as basically a pretty simple design.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.876
&gt;&gt;And here's two of our wings,
this one is just a shell.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:33.356
&gt;&gt;Mike: These kids, the way
they present themselves,

00:07:33.466 --> 00:07:35.496
they're articulate, they
know what they're about.

00:07:35.556 --> 00:07:36.706
They know what they've learned.

00:07:36.886 --> 00:07:39.436
They've obviously been
able to work together.

00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:42.036
In a situation like this for ninth
graders to pull off something

00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:43.336
like that is absolutely remarkable.

00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:45.556
&gt;&gt;And here's our data for our wings.

00:07:46.556 --> 00:07:49.266
This would be the first round
would be one, two and three.

00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:50.356
Then four, five and six.

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:53.646
&gt;&gt;Thom: Anytime students
get in front of adults,

00:07:53.926 --> 00:07:57.376
their performance usually gets a lot
better, because like anyone else,

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.376
they want to look good
in front of an audience.

00:07:59.806 --> 00:08:01.816
&gt;&gt;This is our final wing
design that we made.

00:08:01.816 --> 00:08:03.296
It's already been tested.

00:08:03.826 --> 00:08:06.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The engineer's score
on final presentations was just one

00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:09.846
of many factors that went into
a student's grade for the class.

00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:12.386
&gt;&gt;Scott: You remember the
survey that you filled out.

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:15.046
I had a chance to tabulate
those results.

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:16.026
And...

00:08:16.026 --> 00:08:19.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They were also graded
on their efforts by their teammates.

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:21.896
And on the last day of the
semester, they had a chance

00:08:21.896 --> 00:08:25.296
to express their opinions
about the value of the project.

00:08:25.296 --> 00:08:27.066
And they were overwhelmingly
positive.

00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:30.816
&gt;&gt;I'm going to say that it's a lot
better to learn something on your own

00:08:31.236 --> 00:08:32.566
than it is to have a
teacher tell you it.

00:08:32.796 --> 00:08:34.056
Because if a teacher tells you it,

00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:36.716
you might remember it two weeks
later; but if you learn it yourself,

00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:39.726
you're going to remember it for
pretty much the rest of your life.

00:08:39.726 --> 00:08:40.656
&gt;&gt;Scott: You'll remember
how you learned it.

00:08:40.656 --> 00:08:40.826
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:42.106
&gt;&gt;Thom: One of the best findings

00:08:42.106 --> 00:08:46.066
in educational research is
reflection is equated with retention.

00:08:46.496 --> 00:08:48.516
That is, when you think
about what you've done,

00:08:48.766 --> 00:08:50.196
and you think about what you learned,

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.486
it's much more likely
to stay with you.

00:08:52.486 --> 00:08:57.186
&gt;&gt;I'm glad that you didn't give us
a lot of information, 'cause it kind

00:08:57.186 --> 00:09:00.386
of us led us to having to
think of stuff on our own.

00:09:00.526 --> 00:09:03.106
And you know, when someone
teaches you something,

00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:05.166
there's this little part
of you that's like, "Well,

00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:07.166
but maybe this could work better."

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.686
So if you do it yourself,
it's like you can prove

00:09:09.686 --> 00:09:11.836
to yourself what works
and what doesn't.

00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:14.156
&gt;&gt;Scott: As I look back on the
project, in terms of teamwork,

00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:19.066
in terms of data collection, in terms
of excitement about learning, gosh,

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:20.606
they exceeded all expectations.

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:24.206
To have a student say,
"I want to do another,"

00:09:24.736 --> 00:09:26.826
is a rare and wonderful thing.

00:09:27.116 --> 00:09:31.256
&gt;&gt;All: [crashing sound] Oh, no!

00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:33.946
Oh, boy! [laughter] Nice wing.

00:09:36.046 --> 00:09:38.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more
information on what works

00:09:38.106 --> 00:09:39.966

00:09:40.096 --> 00:09:42.416
&gt;&gt;Scott: Nicely done!

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:42.926
Yeah! [applause]
