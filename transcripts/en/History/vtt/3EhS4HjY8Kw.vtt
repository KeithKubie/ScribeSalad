00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.880
- What do we got?

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.120
I have this
beautiful, handmade,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.000
leather jacket with me today.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.380
OK.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.460
What do you know about it?

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.830
Not too much.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.210
I just saw this little
label on the inside

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.460
when I was wearing
it, and I thought

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.330
it might be something special.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.960
East West Musical
Instruments, San Francisco,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.920
That's um, that's weird, It's
not a musical instrument.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.670
[music playing]

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.750
I'm coming into
the shop, today,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.330
to try to sell my
handmade, leather jacket.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.750
This jacket is in
great condition.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.250
It has all the fringes, and it
has a cute design on the back.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.710
I'm hoping to sell the
jacket for $500 today,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.750
but the lowest I'll
go is maybe like $100.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.500
It's definitely cool.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.880
Where did you get it?

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.540
I got it when I was
shopping in California,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.750
at a thrift store.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.040
Do you know how old it is?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.580
I don't know how
old it is, but it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.170
seems like it's been around.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.580
It looks like
it's from the 60s.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.710
I--

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.920
It's in great shape.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.880
It's definitely
weird that it's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.790
East West Musical Instruments.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.620
I don't know much about that.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.380
Normally I don't even really
mess with this kind of stuff.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.380
What are you looking
to get out of it?

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.540
Maybe like $500.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.250
OK.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.580
This is kind of interesting
to me, this label right here.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.080
Do you mind if I have a
friend of mine come in

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.790
and check it out?
- Yeah, of course.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.120
All right, let
me give him a call.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.210
Feel free to hang out.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.210
I'll be back in a little bit.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.290
Thank you.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.750
To be perfectly
honest, I don't

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.250
know anything about this
East West label, inside

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.750
of this jacket.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.420
And I would normally pass
on something like this,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.710
but there's something
in my gut that's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.420
telling me to find out more.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.210
So I called in Jesse to see
if he knows anything about it.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.170
I know it's not a
guitar or a instrument,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.500
but I'm just kind
of curious if you

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000
know anything about
this East West

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.830
Musical Instruments company.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.000
Dude, this kind of cool.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.330
They're actually
kind of famous, you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.000
know, for making leather stuff
for rock stars back in the day.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.750
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.960
These jackets were made for,
like, the top rung rock star.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.790
You know, it was a
$1,500, $1,600 jacket.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.330
It was people like
Elvis Presley, Bruce

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.670
Springsteen, Janis Joplin.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.920
It was people that
had a lot of money

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.000
to afford a job like this.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.500
So, I mean, it
definitely sounds

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.460
like it's got a cool
history, but what's it worth?

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.540
You know, stuff like
this, because it's so rare,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.380
and it's hard to find, you know,
a 46-year-old, 50-year-old,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.040
piece of leather
that's in any kind

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.380
of condition to actually wear.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.380
Anywhere from probably two to
three grand, believe it or not.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.380
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.830
Oh.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.210
Yeah, it's not something
you see every day.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.670
- Appreciate it, dude.
- No problem.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.830
- Thanks for coming down, dude.
- No problem.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.880
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880
- Cool jacket.
- Thank you.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.880
So you still want $500 for it?

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.710
Um, no.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.620
Would you take $1,500 for it?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.380
[music playing]

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.120
I don't know.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.620
I'd rather keep it and, like,
pretend to be a rock star.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.380
Will you do any more, maybe?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.250
[music playing]

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.080
I'll do two grand.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.580
That's the most I've ever
paid for a jacket, and it's--

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.880
[music playing]

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.170
Well I'll do two grand.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.540
All right, cool.
Meet me over there.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.420
We gotta do some paperwork.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.250
All right, sweet.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.040
I settled on $2,000, which is
a lot more than I had planned,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.040
so I'm very, very
happy about it.
