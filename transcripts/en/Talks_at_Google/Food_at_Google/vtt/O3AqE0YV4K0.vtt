00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.140
Cynthia: Good afternoon, we are thrilled today
to welcome Chef de Cuisine of the French Laundry.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.030
He's been hard at work the last few months
putting the finishing touches on his new restaurant

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.219
Benu which is set to open later this summer.
Corey started his career at the age of 17

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.880
at Blue Ribbon Sushi in New York in the dining
room actually.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.000
But he soon discovered that his passion and
skills were better suited for the kitchen.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.760
Since then, he has worked for some of the
greatest restaurants in the world.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.170
And eventually landed in the French Laundry
in 2001.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.681
He spent a year opening Per Se, Thomas Keller's
restaurant in New York as well.

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:44.711
And while he was at the French Laundry, the
restaurants were the only one to receive three

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:49.360
Michelin stars when the guide first launched
in California in 2006.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.700
That same year, he also won the rising chef
award from the James Beard foundation.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.110
He also co-authored "Under Pressure" which
I believe is actually on sale on that little

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.000
table, and you can sort of purchase a copy
after the talk.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.190
Which documented many of the techniques and
recipes that he developed during his time

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.260
at the French Laundry and Per Se.
I also took the liberty of Googling a few

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:22.140
fun facts about Corey.
He is the sort of ambassador, the cultural

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.330
ambassador of cuisine for Seoul I believe.
His guilty pleasure is American Chinese food.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.810
And one night, and you'll have to tell me
if this story is correct, or if Google is

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.050
incorrect here.
But one night after work, he was searching

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.010
his fridge for food.
Found bacon, spinach and eggs, and the next

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.701
day, he developed a new dish for the French
Laundry.

00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:47.701
[Laughter]

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:54.340
Cynthia: So without further ado, you know,
I'm sure you have heard enough of my speaking,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.799
and let's hear Corey give his talk.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:57.799
Corey: Thank You

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:58.799
[Applause]

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:07.780
Corey: You know, I started working in restaurants
right after I graduated High School.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.769
And that was in 1995, I was 17 years old.
So I've been working in restaurants for 15

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.920
years.
Now when you work as a chef in a professional

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.689
kitchen, you work a lot of hours.
14, 15, 16 hours a day.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.719
So it's very easy to kind of lose touch with
the world outside of the restaurant.

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.270
And certainly for me, it was always a challenge
keeping up with current events.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.150
Especially when it comes to technology, the
advancement is so quick, and the world is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.819
changing at such a rapid pace that it's hard
to keep up.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.999
And I think for me, Google is a really good
example of that where I didn't see the development

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.379
and then just kind of woke up one day, and
it was everywhere.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.170
I mean, it was this world phenomenon.
It just kind of happened overnight for me.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.030
And so when Cynthia asked me to come down
here and talk about my experience at the French

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.019
Laundry and plans for opening a new restaurant,
I'd never heard of this event that you guys

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.689
do.
This talks at Google, Authors at Google.

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:07.480
And you know I wasn't really sure if you guys
would find any of that interesting, you know.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.060
Cynthia assured me that a lot of chef's had
been here in the past, like Alice Waters,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.919
[Inaudible], Thomas Keller and that was really
daunting for me because these are like culinary

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.480
icons and internationally recognized chefs.
So I decided to go online and research a little

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.019
bit about this event that you guys do, hoping
to find something that would give me a little

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.489
more confidence to come down here.
So I Googled Authors at Google, Talks at Google,

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.069
and I saw like Salman Rushdie, Condoleezza
Rice and President Obama, and I.

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.640
Not exactly the kind of reassurance I was
looking for but.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.239
[Laughter]
Corey: Anyway I mustered up enough bravado

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.219
to come down here and I'm really glad I did,
because seeing the campus is really amazing.

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.779
And being able to see it firsthand I think
is a pretty unique opportunity.

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:59.219
And it certainly confirmed my suspicion that
you guys are gonna take over the world.

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.542
And probably the biggest mistakes I ever made
was selling my Google stock a couple of years

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:05.249
ago.
So anyway, I'm really happy to be here, so

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.959
thanks for having me.
I'm just gonna talk a little bit about what

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.180
I'm working on now, which is opening a new
restaurant in San Francisco.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.959
And opening a restaurant is something that
happens all the time and you go to new restaurants

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.759
all the time.
But I don't think there's a lot of information

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.340
out there about what the process is about
or what's involved in opening a new place.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.840
And, so I'm just gonna talk a little bit about
that.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.610
I think I should qualify that by saying each
restaurant is different.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.690
And the deal and the structure of that business
is unique.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.830
For me, when I talk about the process I went
through, the first I had to do is really acknowledge

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.289
how many people in our industry came out and
offered their guidance and their support.

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.710
People like Michael Mina who I think he has
16 restaurants now.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.400
And I've never worked with him. I've met him
a few times, but he reached out to me and

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.630
said, "Hey, anything you need."
Introduced me to his real-estate broker to

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.539
help me find a space.
Offered his kitchen when I was prepping for

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:08.550
events.
Helped me staff when I was no longer at the

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.900
French Laundry.
So, it's pretty amazing.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.569
I mean he did that just to be collegial.
Or people like Grant Atkins and Nick Kokonas

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:21.599
of Alinea who really shared with me the process
they went through in opening that restaurant.

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.320
And I learned an enormous amount from them.
And then there were just so many people out

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.150
there.
People like David Chang, Dan Barbara, Daniel

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.949
Prelude, who whenever we needed something,
you know right away, sure, whatever you need.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.979
And I think that kind of camaraderie is really
special.

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:41.410
And then of course there's Thomas Keller who
was there for me and supported me long before

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.379
I ever decided to open a restaurant of my
own.

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.750
I started working for Thomas as Cynthia said
in 2001.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.979
I spent some time in New York opening Per
Se.

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.620
And I came back to the French Laundry and
I've been the Chef de Cuisine there until

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:06.310
last summer, July of last summer.
That restaurant is a very special place.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.020
Especially for me.
I mean I kind of grew up there.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.120
I started there when I was very young.
I spent basically my entire 20's working at

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.300
the French Laundry.
So it was certainly a difficult decision to

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.509
leave and try to do something on my own.
But once I made that decision, I think there

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:25.060
was really no looking back.
And I started to think about it very seriously

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.569
in 2008.
That's when I told Thomas I wanted to do something.

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.610
And at that time, I really had nothing.
I didn't have investors, I didn't have partners,

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.960
I didn't have a prospectus.
I didn't even know how you go about doing

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.539
that.
And actually the first place I looked at.

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:46.199
The first commercial space I looked at to
rent was on September 15th, 2008.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.020
And that was the day that Lehman Brothers
filed for bankruptcy.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.570
And so here I am this young chef wanting to
open a new fine dining restaurant and we are

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.909
in the middle of one of the worst economic
climates ever.

00:06:56.909 --> 00:07:02.270
It's not really the best time to go out on
your own and try to raise money to open a

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.720
restaurant.
But in hindsight, and I'm not really sure

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.180
why, you know I never really lost confidence.
And certainly a lot of that had to do with

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.659
the support I had from Thomas and my colleagues.
And sure enough, we got an offering together.

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:19.370
And I met a group of people who will become
my core partners.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.990
And together we formed an entity that would
own and operate the restaurant.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.860
And then what we did was we took a small portion
of that entity, and divided that into really

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.801
small shares and offered it to various people
in the Bay area.

00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:40.319
People in a variety of fields like law, finance,
tech, hospitality.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:45.880
And what that did was that allowed us to have
a network of partners who would bring clients

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.939
and promote the restaurant and talk about
it from their perspective industries.

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:54.670
Now we have a really great group of partners
in the restaurant.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.790
The name of the restaurant is Benu
And I'm not sure how many of you have tried

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.389
naming something; whether it's a child or
a new business.

00:08:03.389 --> 00:08:05.499
But it's a really, really difficult thing
to do.

00:08:05.499 --> 00:08:10.909
And I certainly agonized over it.
I flipped through encyclopedias, read through

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:15.759
dictionaries and I don't know different languages.
Looked for a name in songs and poems.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:21.689
But it was a really difficult process.
But once I found Benu, there was really no

00:08:21.689 --> 00:08:25.449
looking back.
For me, Benu has kind of a playful sound to

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:30.210
it, like a cartoon character.
But it also, you can't identify where it's

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.210
from.
It's hard to know where the origin of that

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.700
name is.
Some people think it sounds French, some people

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.760
think it sounds Japanese.
It's actually an Egyptian word.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.710
It's the Egyptian equivalent of the Phoenix
bird that stands for rebirth and renewal and

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.840
longevity.
And certainly those things are things you

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.140
identify with when you start something like
a new business.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.910
And longevity is certainly something that
you hope to achieve in a new business.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.160
So it can really relate to it on many different
levels.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.650
Once we got the name, it was coming up with
the design or the logo for the name.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.830
Because I think that's a really important
thing.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.231
Often that's your first impression of the
restaurant.

00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:13.150
For guests, it kind of sets the tone for their
experience long before they get there.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:18.450
And for a lot of the staff, it sets the tone
for the work environment before they start

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.300
working there.
So that was an important thing.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:27.160
And to do that, we collaborated with a designer
in L.A. named Andrea Leonardo Madden.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.160
And she's a very creative and thoughtful designer.
She has a small studio in West Hollywood called

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.190
the Am Project.
And we e-mailed back and forth for months.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:41.760
We sent each other pictures, ideas.
And through all that communication she extracted

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.720
a common thread which was an importance placed
on a process.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.660
So it wasn't just about the end result of
something, or the end logo, it was the process

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.830
we went through to get there.
And so this is the Logo.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:59.460
And it's actually six different fonts.
And you can see that coming together.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.130
And what that does it that generates a 7th
font which is the grey.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.480
And that's the common area that they share.
And so in that, it's alluding to a process

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.850
like cooking where you take many different
ingredients, you combine them,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:12.760
and you're creating a new flavor or something
new.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:19.480
But you're still maintaining the integrity
and the identity of each individual ingredient.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.960
And this process of going through that really
helped me find the concept of the restaurant.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.610
And it even helped me pick the location and
what kind of building it should be in.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:34.870
Cuz its one thing to have it conceptualized
in your mind, but when you start talking about

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:39.020
it aloud and answering questions, it helps
you realize in a really different way.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:45.190
The building is actually located in the SoMa
area of San Francisco.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:50.250
And it's a very interesting area because there's
so much modern development.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.240
The building itself is a historic building
built in the early 1900's.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:00.510
But it's surrounded by the Four Seasons, the
SFMOMA, the Yerba Buena Center, George Hart

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:06.170
Museum, all this residential development.
So it's this historical little place that's

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.930
surrounded by a lot of modernity which is
very interesting.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:15.550
To design the place we worked with an architect
in New York who specializes in restaurants.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.700
His name is Richard Bloch.
Richard and I first met in New York when I

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:26.390
was there opening Per Se and he was designing
Masatake Yama's restaurant next door in the

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.960
Time Warner Center.
Have you guys heard of Masatake Yama?

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.530
He's a pretty renowned sushi chef.
And when you go to his restaurant in New York,

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.630
the second you walk in, you're in another
world.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.830
You're not in New York anymore; you're not
in the Time Warner anymore.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.820
You're in this experience
that's been crafted for you, and it's really

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.910
special.
And a big part of that is the interior design.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:56.010
And so I was an admirer of Richard's work
long before we ever worked together.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:02.150
Together we designed the restaurant.
And it's a, I think a comfortable warm restaurant

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.180
that's modern.
There's some accents of luxury.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.200
But it's not about opulence; it's really about
kind of an understated elegance, a little

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.480
more subtle.
Now when you decide to open a restaurant or

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.880
you do any kind of remodel, you definitely
need an architect.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:23.470
I mean that's essential.
But what I was really surprised at was that

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.890
we needed to work with a lot of other designers
as well.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.920
And part of that is because we did so many
things that were custom.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.050
And that was really important for me because
I wanted to offer an experience that was unique.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:41.540
And that was tied into the food, the porcelain,
the tabletops, the materials used in the dining

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.320
room.
And in order to do that and offer a whole

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.800
experience, you have to do a lot of custom
things.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.820
Another designer that we worked with is a
man named [Inaudible Name] and he has a studio

00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:01.450
in San Diego called Blue Oculus.
And he's a designer who really understands

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:10.200
how to balance aesthetics and function.
And together we designed a few tabletop pieces.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.180
Now when you're dealing with table top pieces,
it can't just be about the aesthetic value

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.070
of it because you're interacting with these
things.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.080
These pieces have specific functions, so it's
really important to balance them.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.830
And he's someone who really understands that.
One of the things we worked on was a utensil

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.440
rest.
And a utensil rest seems like a pretty easy

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.620
thing right?
It's just a piece that flatware sits on top

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.240
of.
But when we started to develop it, we explored

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.700
so many different concepts.
And you can see a few of them here.

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.320
We worked with different shapes and different
materials.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.420
Some were actually really, really elaborate,
but we kept coming back to something a little

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.860
more simple.
And this is kind of the shape we started to

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:55.300
work on.
And this is something that's very natural.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.880
It's not geometric.
It's something you'd find in nature.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.770
You'd find something beautiful just by itself
in nature.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.910
Maybe it's like a river stone,
that's very smooth from years of water running

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.340
through it.
So once we decided on the shape, we started

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.490
just playing around and looking at different
materials, different colors.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.860
And this is a mockup of that piece.
And then we worked on the scale of it.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.880
How it would look with the different pieces
of flatware.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.160
And then we finally decided on the material
which was wood.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:33.910
And then we tried different kinds of wood.
And then finally we settled on African black

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.170
wood which is a very, very dense wood that's
often used for musical instruments.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.950
And you can see that there.
But the grain of the wood is really beautiful

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.770
and the feel is really smooth.
It's like satin.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.720
And our tabletops are this charcoal ash earthy
color.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:57.420
And that with the dark wooden utensil rest;
it makes for a very natural backdrop to the

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:02.680
food and for the flatware.
And you can see that big mark in the silver

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:11.300
just kind of pops up at you.
Another huge collaboration regarding design

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:17.980
that we did was for porcelain.
And I feel really fortunate to have had this

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:23.140
opportunity because I think it's rare for
chefs to design their own porcelain.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.350
And what you can do is come up with specific
shapes and pieces that are really tailored

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.420
for the kind of food you are serving.
For this we collaborated with a designer.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.100
A Korean [Inaudible Name, porcelain maker
name].

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.130
And they're kind of an iconic manufacturer
in Korea.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:45.310
Being Korean myself, I knew about their company
and their pieces from when I was very young.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:48.420
And always associated with something very
fine.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:53.690
Fine food, fine cuisine.
So I visited the factory a few years ago.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:59.610
And I saw some of the most beautiful pieces.
And it was really on par with my Zen from

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.920
Germany or some of the great houses in France.
And I knew that when I opened a restaurant,

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.060
I'd want some of those pieces included.
And then when we started working on Benu,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.500
I contacted them and asked if there was an
opportunity to collaborate on a design.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.090
And basically we just started working on it
right away.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:21.220
So you can see some of these pictures.
These are some of the prototypes and samples

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.920
we worked on.
And then in this picture you can see some

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.860
of the final pieces that we're going to manufacture.
There's basically four concepts.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.430
There's the white transparent glaze, there's
the white mat, there the black mat and then

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.480
there's the celadon.
So those are some of the pieces there in the

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.840
different shapes.
And then we also worked on technical patterns.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.750
So this is a cloche with turtle shells and
lily pads.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:55.440
And the one on top is sea urchin shells.
And that could be something that's used to

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.070
close ce viche that's based on sea urchin.
So it completes the dish.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.690
It's not just about the food, but the porcelain
in the serving piece as well.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:08.971
This one here is a hen etching of a lobster.
I don't know if you can see that, if you can

00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:12.280
make that out.
But there's basically an etching of a lobster.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:20.720
And that could be used in conjunction with
a dish that's centered around lobster.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.990
This one is black truffle monis borum.
And this is actually one that I'm particularly

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.690
fond of because my mother did the design for
that.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.610
The artists in Korea had never seen a black
truffle.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.930
We don't have black truffles in Korea.
So when they were asked to paint one, I mean

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.990
they had no idea what they were painting.
So my mother helped and we worked on that

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.360
piece.
But again this is a cloche that can be used

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:49.601
for a dish that's centered around black truffles.
And this dish is actually a black truffle

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:52.930
custard that's made with a puree of black
truffles.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.140
And it fills a cavity in the bottom of a bowl
that's meant to hold that custard.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.270
So it holds about 60 grams of custard.
And on top is a broth.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:07.170
And for me the combination of bullion with
the custard is one of the great texture combinations

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.650
that are out there.
And so this dish was specifically designed

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.380
for that.
The other thing you see on that dish up top,

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:22.150
is well, for lack of a better word; it's kind
of a sustainable shark's fin.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.650
Does everyone know what shark's fin is?
And how that's harvested?

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:31.800
Being a chef, and being Asian, I can certainly
appreciate the culinary and cultural value

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.000
of shark's fin.
But it definitely presents some moral and

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.960
ecological concerns.
So what I wanted to do was develop a dish

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.971
or technique that was an homage to shark's
fin.

00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:49.150
And with that tradition in mind, but not actually
use the fin itself.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:53.200
The interesting thing about shark's fin,
even though it's something that's very revered,

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.100
I mean it's something that was cooked since
I think the Ming dynasty.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.090
It's a very luxurious ingredient.
It's often served at celebratory events, like

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.920
a wedding.
The interesting thing is its all about texture.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:14.170
That's really what makes it unique.
And the texture is simultaneously brittle

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:19.350
and elastic and gelatinous all at the same
time, and that's something that's very rare.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.030
But the actual flavor comes from whatever
stock it's cooked in or bullion that it's

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.350
served with or the sauce that it's prepared
with.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:31.970
So the flavor I knew I could get because it's
not coming from the shark fin.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:38.910
For this particular dish, I based it on a
very traditional Cantonese preparation, like

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:48.240
a soup supreme that's made with chicken of
jing wa ham or kind of Chinese ham, aromatics

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.220
and then it's stewed together and usually
the shark fin is brazed in that.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.230
For this dish, we actually added some truffle
peelings so that we can tie in the truffle

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.440
flavor to that dish as well.
And also it's an interpretation of that classic

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.570
dish.
So we had the stock, now it's finding the

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.420
texture.
Have you guys heard of hydro-colloids?

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.870
Hydro-colloids.
It's something that's used pretty commonly.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:15.050
Lately it's been used in kind of the fine
dining realm.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.980
If you haven't heard of hydro-colloids, you
might have heard of some of the dishes that

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.240
are made possible using that.
These days, you see it like sphere's everywhere,

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.570
like liquid ravioli's whether they're gel
or in a shape of a sphere.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.220
Or if they're something that's liquid in the
center and they explode when you bite into

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.020
them.
And if you haven't had that or heard of that,

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.230
I'm sure you've had salad dressing from a
supermarket.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:42.210
You know it's kept emulsified and the herbs
are kept evenly dispersed using various hydro-colloids.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:48.930
Or it's used in ice cream to prevent crystallization
so you get a better mouth feel.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:56.310
Or gummy bears. They're kind of everywhere.
And the manufacturer of one of the hydro-colloids

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:00.160
or many of these hydro-colloids actually is
a company called CP Calco.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.220
And they're based in San Diego.
And there's three people there that I've been

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:10.680
working with for a few years now.
There's a team that's comprised of Henry Monty,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.960
Ted Russen and Amy Wong.
And they've come up to the restaurant, given

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.320
lectures and we've worked together on learning
how to use all these various things.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.860
And so on one of our research trips down to
San Diego when I was working with them in

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.940
the lab, we worked on replicating the texture
of shark's fin.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:37.980
And we went through many tests, and it was
a series of trial and error, but we finally

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:45.340
got a texture that is really similar.
I mean almost, it's hard to separate shark

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:50.360
fin from this.
So I'll take you through this dish.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:57.320
It starts with that broth I was telling you
about which is chicken, the ham, truffle and

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:03.640
it's all stewed together.
And then to that broth we add a combination

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:09.010
of hydro-colloids and we put it into a squeeze
bottle and squeeze it into a water bath with

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.090
calcium and it's the reaction between the
two that's causing it to gel.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:19.170
And we do it in a squeeze bottle because the
round shape resembles the shape of the shark

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:24.059
fin.
Or the individual strands of the shark fin.

00:22:24.059 --> 00:22:28.970
And then you can see in here that we've achieved
kind of that elasticity and gelatinous quality

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.500
of shark fin.
And then you can see in this picture that

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.720
we also achieve kind of the brittleness of
shark fin.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.380
And for those of you who have had this in
the past, if you look at it with the transparency

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:47.470
and the color, I mean it's really identical
to shark fin.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:53.090
So let's see, this is the bowl with the cavity
that holds the custard, the truffle custard.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.760
And then that gets baked and then set and
then once it's set we plate the rest of the

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.050
dish on it.
And that's dungeness crab and then the shark

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:09.690
fin with some of the braising aromatics and
ham.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:17.270
And then we serve this with some of broth,
some of that chicken and ham broth that was

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.050
the base for the shark fin itself.
So that's pretty much it.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:26.470
Well thank you very much for having me.
It was really a pleasure to come down here.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.920
I think Cynthia is gonna have some Q &amp; A,
is that right?

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:34.910
Cynthia: So the floor is open to questions.
Because we only have one mike, I'll just have

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:39.530
to repeat the question for the benefit of
YouTube audiences as well our VC offices.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.370
So if there's a question just raise your hand.

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.480
&gt;&gt; When are you opening your restaurant?

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.020
Cynthia: When are you opening your new restaurant?

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.380
Corey: Well we're in construction right now.
And I'm not sure if anyone has ever remodeled

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:55.590
a house or been involved in any kind of construction.
It's one of those things that, sure we have

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.320
a target date.
We're supposed to get the space back in the

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.940
end of June.
But you know we fully understand that there

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.290
could be some, some construction delays and
that's perfectly normal.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.100
But we're shooting for mid-summer.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.850
&gt;&gt; What are the cross streets again?

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.590
Corey: It's on the corner of Howard and Hawthorne.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.910
&gt;&gt; Google Maps.
[Laughter]

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:18.000
Cynthia: Any other questions?

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.640
&gt;&gt; Are you taking reservations now?
[Laughter]

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.910
Cynthia: The question was, are you taking
reservations now?

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.990
Corey: No actually, the last thing you want
to do, the worst thing is to accept reservations

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.390
and not be able to honor them.
So we'll actually open the book up a month

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.044
before we open.
Once we get the space back.

00:24:34.044 --> 00:24:48.130
Cynthia: I think I saw a question there. yes?

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.130
&gt;&gt; Those were really like nicely done videos
and photography.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.130
Is this general publicity that you prepared,
or were you playing with it for other reasons

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.130
and you thought about posting them online
for free publicity?

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.130
Cynthia: The question was about the very nicely
prepared videos and whether that was going

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.530
to be available free for publicity.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:25:02.230
Corey: Well we actually took those videos
in my apartment last week for this presentation.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.780
[Laughter]
So we're not that organized yet.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.930
&gt;&gt; YouTube

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.890
Corey: Right.
No but it's, you know I think that these days,

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.450
a website is a huge part of a restaurant.
And it's a preview of the restaurant, you

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.430
know.
Before you go and invest time and money into

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.440
the restaurant, usually you check out the
website and see what it's about.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.640
Certainly it was part of that development.
I'm sure maybe some of these images might

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:31.120
show up on the website.
But really we just did it for you guys. [Chuckles]

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.880
Cynthia: Next question.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.480
&gt;&gt; Are you able to talk about the menu yet?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480
Cynthia: Are you able to talk about the menu
yet?

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.880
Corey: Sure.
Absolutely.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:45.160
The concept is -- there'll be two menus.
A tasting menu and a la carte menu.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:50.660
And the tasting menu will change whenever
it needs to whether it's based on availability

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:57.520
or just being inspired to change it.
It's not gonna change on a schedule.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.331
And it'll be a full experience.
Kind of an elaborate tasting menu.

00:26:01.331 --> 00:26:06.520
Anywhere from 9 to 14 courses.
And the number of courses are gonna change

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.130
as well.
Because it's not really about the number of

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.220
courses that's important, it's about the experience
as a whole.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.960
Sometimes it takes 14 courses for me to deliver
a certain experience.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.180
Sometimes it's 8, sometimes it's 9.
It's not really about that, but it's a long

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.370
experience.
The other one is an a la carte menu.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.510
And there'll be different sections where you
can choose how you want to dine.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:32.520
So there'll be fish and shellfish, meat, poultry,
salads, soups, appetizers.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.510
And you can decide how you want to eat, how
much you want to eat and how long you want

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.059
to eat for.
And I think having both of those are important.

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:45.520
I think certainly in the fine dining realm,
we've gotten away from the a la carte menu

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.110
and we've kind of been doing the tasting menu.
But I think an a la carte menu, especially

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:55.300
for a new restaurant and a young chef, it's
important to you know make that restaurant

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.240
accessible and approachable and let people
come in and try it out.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:02.420
And it also makes the restaurant not just
a special occasion restaurant.

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.610
Whether they can come back for a dish they've
had already or they can come back and have

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:11.470
a couple of courses and go out.
It just makes the restaurant a little more

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.470
relevant.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.470
Cynthia: I think I saw a wrist at the back
there.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:14.470
&gt;&gt; I jumped in sort of midstream, so I apologize
if I missed this earlier.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.130
First of all, thanks for coming, it's great
to see you here.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:35.970
Favorite restaurants either in the San Francisco
Bay area, or sort of in the country more broadly.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.930
I hear inspiration a little bit from Grand
Alinea, from [Inaudible Name].

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.930
But are there other favorites of yours?

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:42.280
Cynthia: The question was favorite restaurants.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.381
Corey: Well that's kind of a loaded question
cuz I have a lot of friends out there.

00:27:45.381 --> 00:27:46.381
[Laughter]

00:27:46.381 --> 00:27:51.690
Corey: Surely in the Napa Valley, living up
there, there's a restaurant called Redd.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.870
It's owned by Richard Reddington who is a
close friend of mine and for me, sitting at

00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.960
the bar and having some bar food there is
something I used to do very regularly and

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.640
something I look forward to.
There are just so many great restaurants in

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.309
America.
And the pace at which restaurants are improving

00:28:08.309 --> 00:28:12.140
is really astonishing.
And there's great restaurants all over the

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.510
country.
There's certainly the ones that I think are

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:21.150
leaders.
Restaurants like Alinea that are actually

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:25.231
breaking new ground and redefining what the
eating experience is about.

00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:29.580
But there's also restaurants that are very
traditional and kind of the [inaudible] for

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.541
a certain style of cuisine.
And that's very important as well.

00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:34.800
But I mean truly to answer your question,
I mean there's just so many out there.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800
&gt;&gt; That's fair.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:43.311
Cynthia: Yes, question in the front.

00:28:43.311 --> 00:28:44.311
&gt;&gt; Do you consider wine pairing when you design
your menu?

00:28:44.311 --> 00:28:46.640
Cynthia: The question was whether Corey considered
wine pairing when designing the menu.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.380
Corey: Well actually there's a sommelier you
know who'll work on that.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:57.130
And our restaurant is definitely a food driven
restaurant.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:05.230
There are wine driven restaurants.
And wine is certainly a huge part of the experience.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.070
And I think more than specific dishes, I think
it's important to make sure that your wine,

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:13.140
your cuisine is a style of cuisine that's
compatible with wine.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.350
And I mean sometimes it's not even wine, it
could be other beverages too.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:24.049
But being able to offer something that's compatible
with wine is an important consideration.

00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:28.059
Many people come to a restaurant and they
want again you know the full experience.

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:31.580
And it's not just about the food that's prepared
in the kitchen, but it's the wine, it's the

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.940
interior, it's the service and all those things
have to work in harmony.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:38.510
Cynthia: Yes, question at the front.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.740
&gt;&gt; Are you planning on having cocktail offerings
as well?

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.610
Cynthia: The question was whether there's
a plan to offer cocktail offerings.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.880
Corey: We're gonna be a wine focused restaurant.
And there's many reasons for that.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.940
I think that for the style of food that we
do, wine just works better than high alcohol

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:03.470
spirits or distilled spirits.
And the other thing is we don't have a traditional

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.380
bar.
It's not a place where you can have you know

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.090
once course at the bar.
You can do that at the table, but it's not

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.070
really at the bar.
But it's really about you know what kinds

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:14.330
of beverages work best with the food that
we serve.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.650
And it comes out to the lower alcohol beverages
like wine, sake.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:25.940
Cynthia: I think I saw a question in the white
coat there.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.600
&gt;&gt; What are your favorite go to's for comfort
food?

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.060
Cynthia: Favorite go to's for comfort food.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:35.740
Corey: Comfort food.
Certainly Asian food is a big part for me.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:41.060
And comfort food is I think just what you
grew up eating in your house, I think that's

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.220
the ultimate comfort food.
For me, I haven't lived with my parents in

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.840
such a long time that you know those are kind
of rare opportunities.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.090
So sometimes I'm forced to eat the American
Chinese food that Cynthia was referring to.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:57.059
But comfort food, my favorite comfort food,
I like fried chicken.

00:30:57.059 --> 00:31:02.310
I mean I think that's a winner every time.
But there's again, there's just so much good

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:06.140
food out there.
But it's really simple one pot dishes.

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:12.830
And whether it's a stew or Ragu, something
that doesn't take a lot of time to prepare.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.360
That chicken soup that you saw stewing, I
mean that's a meal in itself.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.720
You know, some good vegetables and a nice
chicken and some ham.

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:25.440
I mean, that could be a meal.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:31.220
Cynthia: I think I saw another question there.

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.970
&gt;&gt; Did you consider other locations like Napa,
New York?

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:35.740
And why did you choose San Francisco?

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.750
Corey: I actually did consider one of those
locations you mentioned which was New York.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:46.320
I lived in New York for many years.
My family is, the family that I have in the

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.020
states live in New York.
And at first it was something I went back

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.070
and forth on.
But ultimately I chose San Francisco because

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:56.929
I've been working in the Bay area for many
years now.

00:31:56.929 --> 00:31:59.580
And I've developed relationships with great
purveyors.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.760
And it was hard to justify losing those relationships
to go to New York.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.250
And then also working at the French Laundry,
I developed a rapport with a lot of our guests

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:12.110
who are in the Bay area.
So again it was hard to justify losing that

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.490
client base just to go to New York.
But ultimately I think that San Francisco

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:20.070
is a smaller community of Restaurants.
And New York, they have so many wonderful

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:24.299
restaurants.
And restaurants open and close throughout

00:32:24.299 --> 00:32:29.410
the year and you don't even hear about it.
But in San Francisco, I think there's more

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.431
of an opportunity to make an impact in the
landscape of restaurants, and be part of the

00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:36.240
community. So that was the main reason.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.330
Cynthia: I think I saw another question somewhere
there, yes.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:44.920
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible question]

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:51.440
Cynthia: The question was whether the cuisine
served will be influenced by Korean cuisine.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.100
Corey: Well you know that's kind of a question
that I get asked pretty often.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:59.940
Maybe not necessarily specific to Korean cuisine,
but it's, you know, what kind of food are

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.799
you gonna serve?
And it's a really difficult question to answer.

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:06.230
And there's not really -- it's not a quick
answer.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.700
And it's something that I guess when you decide
to open a restaurant, everyone asks you that

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.190
what kind of food are you going to server?
And when you're talking to potential investors

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:15.710
and they say, " What kind of food are you
gonna serve?"

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.610
And you give this long winded answer, it's
kind of a tough one too.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:24.581
But I think at a certain level.
A certain level of dining, or certain level

00:33:24.581 --> 00:33:30.260
of cooking, it's about personality cuisine.
And it's about offering that and reflecting

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.520
that in your food.
Your personal experiences, the experiences

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.450
of the people who work with you, the other
people in the kitchen, things that you're

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.940
inspired by.
And unless you're doing very classical food,

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:46.650
like classical Chinese cooking or classical
French cooking, it's modern cooking.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.750
And modern cooking is about being influenced
by everything that's going on around you.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:55.360
And these days, chefs are traveling, chefs
are writing books, chefs are interacting in

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.480
a way that they didn't do even 10 years ago.
So the world is becoming smaller, certainly

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.230
in the culinary world.
And how can you not be influenced by all these

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.950
amazing things that are going around you.
So whether that inspiration comes from Korea,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:12.169
to answer your question,
or that comes from France or Europe or America,

00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:14.790
it's not really about identifying the country
that you're associated with.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:20.629
It's about being open to inspiration and then
interpreting that for something that's unique.

00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:24.779
Cynthia: I actually have a question of my
own.

00:34:24.779 --> 00:34:29.180
So I notice a lot of your presentation was
devoted towards you know the porcelain and

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.700
the place setting.
What surprised you most when you were going

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:37.129
through this process of you know opening your
new restaurant that you never expected?

00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:43.839
Corey: There's so man -- well there's a lot
of things actually.

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:47.889
I mean it seems like every time you climb
a mountain, you know you get to the top and

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:50.691
there's a whole range behind it going through
this process.

00:34:50.691 --> 00:34:53.679
There's a lot of things that I was surprised
at.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:35:00.849
Certainly working with all the city agencies
is something that I had no experience with

00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:04.539
and that's certainly a challenge.
And San Francisco is notorious for being you

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:09.579
know more challenging.
But you know there's -- it was amazing not

00:35:09.579 --> 00:35:13.059
only how many designers we worked with as
I talked about, but how many different professionals

00:35:13.059 --> 00:35:16.489
are involved.
Whether it's structural engineers, engineers,

00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:20.230
architects, mechanical engineers.
And they're such an important part of the

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.279
process.
And you really can't do it without them.

00:35:23.279 --> 00:35:27.849
That even a small restaurant, like a 66 seat
restaurant that we're opening requires all

00:35:27.849 --> 00:35:31.319
the same kind of professionals that a 500
seat restaurant would require.

00:35:31.319 --> 00:35:36.059
So it's not really about the size.
And to open this little project, there's just

00:35:36.059 --> 00:35:37.099
so many people involved.

00:35:37.099 --> 00:35:40.200
Cynthia: I think I saw a question there.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:52.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my question is about in general owning
restaurants.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:36:13.339
So obviously you spend tons of time you know
deciding and planning for all of this.

00:36:13.339 --> 00:36:17.250
And then the fine details of the restaurant.
But with the days that you're not there.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.250
Like for example like you can't work seven
days a week all the time.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.250
[Inaudible]
How do you make sure that the restaurant maintains

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:20.250
like your like personal goals for it when
you can't actually be there in person.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.250
Cynthia: The question was how to maintain
a restaurants personality, when the chef isn't

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:22.250
around.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:26.799
Corey: Well, for our case, it's a little bit
different than someone like Michael Mina.

00:36:26.799 --> 00:36:32.210
A restaurateur of that caliber.
For us, we're only gonna be open 5 dinners

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.700
a week when we first open.
And it was really because of that concern.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:43.960
We're a small restaurant, and it's hard for
a new group of people

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.730
to work and maintain that standard and that
consistency when you're not there.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:51.340
So that was kind of the reason why we did
that.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:57.279
In a case like Michael Mina or Thomas Keller
or Daniel Boulud that kind of restaurant chefs.

00:36:57.279 --> 00:37:02.359
There's a huge network of support.
And you know at some point in Thomas's career,

00:37:02.359 --> 00:37:08.029
he was working all the time in the kitchen.
And he had you know 15 or 20 cooks that worked

00:37:08.029 --> 00:37:11.390
with him.
And over the years, those cooks began to not

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:19.539
only understand his standard, they really
started to embrace it and also a part of enforcing

00:37:19.539 --> 00:37:22.609
it.
So it's really empowering the staff to take

00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:27.120
on more responsibility.
And then eventually, they can lead the rest

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.900
of the staff for you.
And acclimate the new people that are coming

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.681
in with your own standards.
So for every restaurant that Thomas has and

00:37:33.681 --> 00:37:37.750
I'm sure Michael Mina has, there's a chef
there who's probably worked with them for

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:42.059
a long time,
understands the expectations and can reinforce

00:37:42.059 --> 00:37:43.849
them.

00:37:43.849 --> 00:38:00.010
Cynthia: I think I saw another question behind
there.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:03.599
Yes?
No.

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:12.579
Any other questions?
Yes here.

00:38:12.579 --> 00:38:16.170
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible question]

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:21.560
Cynthia: The question was trends in the culinary
world?

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.809
Corey: Well you mentioned kind of these impromptu
dinners that are coming up.

00:38:25.809 --> 00:38:28.150
I think that's just, you know I've never been
to one of those.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.450
But I think as a chef, I'd find that really
challenging.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:36.829
Because it's hard to cook out of your restaurant.
I mean you spend so much time, energy and

00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:41.890
resources to custom that restaurant so that
you can deliver a very particular kind of

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.700
experience.
And when you're out of that environment and

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.700
you no longer have the kitchen that was designed
to do your food.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.880
Or you no longer have the pieces that you're
used to serving on.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.079
It's very difficult.
What I find really interesting however is

00:38:55.079 --> 00:39:02.079
those impromptu dinners that are done by amateurs.
I think that people have an interest in food.

00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:04.170
Not only from an eating standpoint, from a
cooking standpoint.

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.099
That's kind of growing.
You really see that, and that's something

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:11.010
that you notice.
Whether it's people who are buying professional

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:16.079
equipment for their home
or people who are taking cooking classes just

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:22.180
for fun and not for any kind of -- not to
pursue any kind of professional job.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:29.819
But it's amazing how high the level of home
cooking has become.

00:39:29.819 --> 00:39:38.809
And when we did -- we actually did a dinner
with Alinea and the French Laundry to celebrate

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:41.579
the release of Alinea's book and the Under
Pressure book.

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:47.250
And there was a group of amateur cooks in
New York who replicated this fourteen course

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.460
dinner.
I mean they bought all the equipment, all

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.089
the serving pieces.
And they just did it for fun out of their

00:39:52.089 --> 00:39:55.690
 -- in their house.
And it's that kind of thing that I find really

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.431
amazing.
Is that people are understanding food in a

00:39:57.431 --> 00:40:01.420
whole different way,
and they actually wanna participate and be

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.450
interactive in the process?

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.290
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:13.279
Corey: You know, that's a, that's something
that's pretty relative.

00:40:13.279 --> 00:40:18.249
Avant-garde food I think.
For me again, it's about being open and aware

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:22.630
of what's going on around you.
Certainly a big movement is the science behind

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:27.440
cooking, and understanding why things happen,
and understanding how you can achieve new

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.940
things by understanding the basics.
And I think that's a really important thing.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.570
And it's amazing you know how long cuisine
has been around.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:38.009
It's been around forever.
Well certainly as long as we've been around.

00:40:38.009 --> 00:40:43.430
And there's so many misconceptions about food,
and the science behind it.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:49.450
And I think that's certainly becoming kind
of a prerequisite these days for chefs, to

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:53.380
really understand the science behind what
they're doing.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:41:32.230
Cynthia: I think that there was a question
there.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:33.529
&gt;&gt; I know like Thomas Keller, his attitude
is that when a customer goes to French Laundry,

00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:34.529
whatever they want, he's willing to do.
And then there are other people, other chefs

00:41:34.529 --> 00:41:35.529
who are like this is my menu, and I'm not
gonna deviate from that.

00:41:35.529 --> 00:41:36.529
And so you were talking about having an experience
when you cook cuisine for the restaurant.

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:37.529
So how do you fit in that system?
I mean do you feel like the customer can get

00:41:37.529 --> 00:41:38.529
what they want, or do you have an experience
that you want them to have and they cannot

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:39.529
change that?

00:41:39.529 --> 00:41:42.240
Cynthia: The question was whether -- what's
the best way to phrase this?

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.039
Whether there's a sort of set fixed experience
that Corey would like to deliver, or whether

00:41:45.039 --> 00:41:47.230
it's more of a customer oriented experience.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.310
Corey: You know, well first of all you're
absolutely right about Thomas's philosophy

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:52.549
on that,
where if you come into one of his restaurants,

00:41:52.549 --> 00:41:58.559
whatever they can do, they'll do for you.
And he's certainly someone who taught me the

00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:03.859
value of that.
But there's actually a server at the French

00:42:03.859 --> 00:42:07.250
Laundry who kind of has a catch phrase.
And it's "Don't let the guests get in the

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.729
way of their own experience."
And I think there's some merit to that.

00:42:10.729 --> 00:42:13.780
Because sure you want to be accommodating
and provide good customer service.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.890
But there are points when you know you need
to steer guests in a direction that whether

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.160
they don't know it at the time, you have to
believe that they'll enjoy it more.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:26.270
So as long as you're thinking about the guests,
and wanting to do something special for them

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:29.539
and please them,
I think that's what's really important, is

00:42:29.539 --> 00:42:30.880
kind of the motive behind that.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.789
Cynthia: I have another question.
So you're obviously, you're sort of relatively

00:42:35.789 --> 00:42:39.920
early in your career.
But you have had a lot of experience in the

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.460
culinary world now.
What has been the greatest obstacle you've

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.650
had to face to date?

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:50.220
Corey: Ooh.
I think it might have been the San Francisco

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:51.529
building department actually.
[Laughter]

00:42:51.529 --> 00:42:58.430
Corey: No, I mean there's a lot of challenges.
I think working in a restaurant is challenging

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:03.289
because of the time that's involved.
It's a tough job, and it's not only tough

00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:07.190
on you, but it's tough on your family.
And it's tough on people that love you and

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.200
the relationships that you're in.
When you're never gonna have that Friday,

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:13.819
Saturday off.
You're not gonna have you know 5 days to go

00:43:13.819 --> 00:43:17.880
on vacation in the summer.
You can't get Friday afternoon off to see

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.539
your niece go to Kindergarten for the first
day.

00:43:20.539 --> 00:43:23.529
Things like that.
That's generally been the biggest challenge.

00:43:23.529 --> 00:43:26.920
It's balancing your professional life and
your private life.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:30.900
And it's a commitment to a lifestyle in many
ways.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:36.440
Cynthia: Are there any other questions?
No?

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.441
Oh, yes, one question from the front.

00:43:40.441 --> 00:43:41.441
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible question]

00:43:41.441 --> 00:43:43.479
Cynthia: The question was what are the lessons
you've learned from Thomas Keller, and what

00:43:43.479 --> 00:43:45.819
will you bring from the French Laundry?

00:43:45.819 --> 00:43:48.321
Corey: Thomas has actually taught me a lot
of lessons.

00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:56.550
And a big one is the importance of your staff.
And he's the one that completely empowers

00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:00.269
his staff.
And I think that a big part of his success

00:44:00.269 --> 00:44:03.990
is that it's not about one person leading
a team, it's about you know 30 people having

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:09.529
the same standards that you do and reinforcing
those standards to the new people that come

00:44:09.529 --> 00:44:13.069
in.
Another thing is certainly a work ethic.

00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:19.420
I think he's someone who has just a tremendous
work ethic, and he leads by that.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.799
And those two things are really kind of obvious
character traits of Thomas when you work with

00:44:23.799 --> 00:44:27.749
him and you know him.
But there have been a lot of lessons, and

00:44:27.749 --> 00:44:29.269
those two certainly being big ones.

00:44:29.269 --> 00:44:31.880
Cynthia: Any last questions?
Ah yes, one more question here.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.924
&gt;&gt; This is actually a typical Google interview
question.

00:44:32.924 --> 00:44:36.249
What was the biggest mistake you ever made?

00:44:36.249 --> 00:44:43.099
Cynthia: What was the biggest mistake you
ever made?

00:44:43.099 --> 00:44:45.329
Apparently it's a typical Google interview
question.

00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:48.309
Corey: I think it was not being a chef here
at Google.

00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:49.309
[Laughter]

00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:53.839
Corey: There's been a lot of mistakes, and
you learn from those mistakes.

00:44:53.839 --> 00:45:00.619
And one thing I tell all the cooks that I
work with is you know, no matter how good

00:45:00.619 --> 00:45:03.520
of a chef you are,
no matter how good of a cook you are, you're

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:08.430
gonna make a lot of mistakes.
But what distinguishes a good cook from a

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:12.339
bad cook is that a good cook can recognize
those mistakes, and then have the discipline

00:45:12.339 --> 00:45:16.869
to go back and fix them.
So all those mistakes were very valuable.

00:45:16.869 --> 00:45:19.900
And as long as you're aware of them and you
learn from them, I think that's the important

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:20.900
thing.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:27.069
Cynthia: Are there any more questions?
Ok.

00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:29.550
Thank you so much Corey for coming here to
Google, we really appreciate it.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:29.650
[Applause]
