00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:16.116 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:19.952 line:0%
All right,
so I'm going to take you

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:23.889 line:0%
on a journey back in time
to the Cretaceous Period.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:25.658 line:0%
Now, you might say, "Well,
I know what life was like

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.926 line:0%
in the Cretaceous.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:30.029
That's when T. rex was
roaming North America."

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.698
Well, I'll take you to a
very different kind of place.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:35.534
I'll take you to a lost world,

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:38.137
an African river of giants,

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.572
a place that did not just have

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:43.676
one T. rex size predator,
but three.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:47.112
A place that was home
to a bizarre creature

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:49.148
that is going to
force paleontologists

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.484
to rethink many
things they thought

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.853
they knew about dinosaurs.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.656
Now, before we travel
back to the Cretaceous,

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.624
we'll just travel
back to my childhood.

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.426
( audience laughing )

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.760
This is how it all started.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.097
I always loved animals,
living and extinct.

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:07.233
So I was equally happy
handling live snakes

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.737
on summer holidays, and
practicing my dinosaur talks

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.740
in my grandmother's
garden in Germany.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.573
(audience laughing)

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.576
I should add that my grandmother
had no problem whatsoever

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:18.077
with the dinosaur part,

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:21.647
but she has a deep-seated
fear of snakes and crocodiles.

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:25.117
So, needless to say that at
least from her point of view,

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:27.954
things did not really get
any better as I got older.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.423
( audience laughing )

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:33.058
But, I wasn't just
interested in animals.

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:34.627
I also really liked traveling,

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:36.562
and one place I
really wanted to visit

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.898
was the Sahara Desert,
not just because

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.602
it's a beautiful place, but
also because I was inspired

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.138 line:0%
by the discoveries of
a German paleontologist

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.774 line:0%
who over a hundred
years ago made some

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:50.610 line:0%
incredible discoveries
in the sands of Egypt.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.545 line:0%
He found Egypt's
first dinosaurs,

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:55.114
and he did not just
describe dinosaur fossils.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:59.118
He described crocodiles and
an entire ecosystem really,

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.855
a predator's paradise,
a very strange place.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:04.791
Probably his most
important discovery

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.960
was that of a large
predatory dinosaur

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.129
he called Spinosaurus.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.932
It's an animal that was
probably larger than T. rex

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.501
with a big sail on its back.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.804
Some of these spines
are as tall as a person.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.738
It was an incredible find.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:20.673
It was incomplete.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.174
The dark bones on this
image are the ones

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:23.609
that Stromer had found,

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.145
but it became the centerpiece
of the dinosaur exhibit

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.380
in the Munich Museum
where Stromer worked.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.550
So his career was going well,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.653
but things changed
in World War II.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.922
Stromer who was
an outspoken critic

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:40.059
of the Nazi
dictatorship lost a lot.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.161
He lost most of his
scientific finds

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:45.464
when an Allied air raid
destroyed the Munich Museum.

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:47.466
Spinosaurus was also destroyed,

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:49.702
and seemingly lost forever.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.437
All we have are
just a few drawings.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.541
Stromer also lost two of
his three sons in the war

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.143
after they were
drafted into the army

00:02:57.143 --> 00:02:59.578
including the youngest one in
the middle, Gerhard, who died

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:02.047
just two weeks before the
end of the war in Germany.

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:05.017
So I was fascinated by
this dramatic story,

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:07.286
and by his discovery
of Spinosaurus.

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:10.456
So, in my early 20s,
I decided to start

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.691
a series of expeditions
to the Sahara

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.495
to explore the Cretaceous rocks

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.062
in this part of the world.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.898
They're about 100
million years old.

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:21.333
About the same age as
the rocks that Stromer

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.202
was working in in Egypt.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:26.439
My field work did
not take me to Egypt.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.041
It took me to the
border region between

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:32.311
Morocco and Algeria,
a place called the Kem Kem.

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:33.646
It's a beautiful place,

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.516
and I decided to collect
everything I could find

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.618
in that environment,
crocodiles, flying reptiles,

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:40.886
turtles, you name it.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:43.922
This here's a skull
piece from a crocodile.

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:46.893
I really wanted to understand
the entire ecosystem,

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.894
and it's hard work.

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:51.964
Most of the fossils are
found along this escarpment

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:54.366
so there's a lot of
climbing involved,

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:56.769
and it's really hard
to find good fossils.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.705
But we found thousands of
really interesting specimens

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.373
including this one here.

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:02.775
It's the largest dinosaur bone

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:05.044
that had ever been found
in this part of the Sahara.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:08.047
I found that on my
second expedition.

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:10.149
It's a remarkable
piece not so much

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.684
because it's so big.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:14.020
It's the upper arm bone of a
large plant-eating dinosaur,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.790
but because it belongs
to a plant-eating animal.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.626
Because the vast majority of
the fossils we are finding

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:24.364
belong to predators,
T. rex sized predators,

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:27.667
medium-sized
predatory dinosaurs,

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:31.937
and crocodile-like hunters
in all shapes and sizes.

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:33.706
So Stromer was right.

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:36.642
North Africa in the Cretaceous
was a predators paradise.

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:38.377
One thing we noticed
was that the skulls

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:42.014
of all these predatory
animals were really different.

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:43.549
So it appears that they
were eating different things

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:45.551
and that may have
helped them to coexist

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.887
in the same place.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.655
The rivers were not
just home to these

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.256
giant crocodile-like creatures.

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:55.395
We also have a
car-sized coelacanth,

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:57.697
a giant sawfish,

00:04:57.697 --> 00:05:00.499
and even the skies were
filled with predators.

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:01.767
This is the largest
flying creature

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:03.035
ever described from Africa.

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:07.206
We described it in 2010,
has an 18-foot wingspan.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.310
So we had found this
incredible ecosystem,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.280
but really only bits and
pieces of Spinosaurus,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.749
and that was the one that
I really, really, really

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.684
wanted to find.

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:22.321
But things changed
in early 2008.

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:24.624
We were just coming
back from the field,

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:27.360
and we stopped in
a city called Erfoud

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.195
on the edge of
the Sahara Desert.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.230
It's a fairly large place,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.133
and a man approached
me and my colleagues

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:37.603
and he had a cardboard
box with fossils.

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.471
They were covered in sediment.
It was kind of difficult

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:41.374
to tell what exactly
we were looking at,

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:44.876
and he asked me, "What
do you think these are?"

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.378
It was really difficult to tell,

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:48.614
but one piece really
caught my attention.

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.250
It was a blade-shaped section
of bone not very long,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.018
but it had a really
strange cross section.

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:54.386 line:0%
You can see the cross section is

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:56.222 line:0%
the white, creamy
part of the bone,

00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:59.325 line:0%
and it's divided in two
with this big red line

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.326 line:0%
in the middle.

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:01.626 line:0%
I had never seen
anything like this.

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:03.129 line:0%
I thought maybe this is a rib,

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.365 line:0%
but maybe this is a part
of a spine of Spinosaurus.

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:07.600 line:0%
Who knows?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.502
I thought these are
important specimens

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:11.470
so I made sure that
they were brought

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.739
to the University of
Casa Blanca in Morocco,

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:15.874
and I thought maybe
one day I'll be able

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:17.943
to figure out what this is.

00:06:17.943 --> 00:06:20.979
Well, that day came
sooner than I expected.

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.682
Two Italian colleagues
of mine told me

00:06:23.682 --> 00:06:27.085
that a partial
skeleton of a dinosaur

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:29.088
that had been spirited
out of North Africa

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:33.292
apparently Morocco, had
gone through several hands

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.694
and, you know, had
somehow ended up in Italy,

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:38.664
and, you know, they said I
should have a look at it.

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:41.300
So when I came to Italy,
I looked at the bones

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.335
and my jaw dropped.

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:45.004
Tall spines.

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:48.340
No other dinosaur
has spines like this.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.543
A foot that was almost complete.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.512
We are looking at the
first Spinosaurus skeleton

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:56.681
that had been found
in over a hundred years.

00:06:56.681 --> 00:06:59.118
But there was one big problem.

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:00.619
My Italian colleagues
didn't know where

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.221
this skeleton came from,

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.690
and that's a huge
problem in paleontology.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.926
It means you have
no geological context.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:08.594
You don't know anything
about the environment

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.962
the animal lived in,

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.964
but worst of all
you can't even prove

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.066
that all these bones were
found in the same place

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.601
and belonged to the same animal.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:18.904
Maybe they were found
hundreds of kilometers apart.

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:21.740
So that was a big problem.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.976
But then I looked at the
cross section of the spines

00:07:24.976 --> 00:07:27.379
and saw something very familiar.

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.082
See the line that's dividing
the spines in cross section?

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.784
I thought that looks
a lot like this bone

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:35.688
I had seen in Erfoud and my
mind just started racing.

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:38.490
I thought so those bones
belong to Spinosaurus,

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.293
but the size, shape,
and color of these bones

00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:43.795
and the ones I'd seen in
Morocco were so similar

00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:46.565
I started wondering
maybe this is actually

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:47.867
the same skeleton.

00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:49.768
It was a long shot,

00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:51.971
but I thought if this
is the same skeleton

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.873
then all I need to do
( audience laughing )

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:57.843
is to find this one man
in the Sahara Desert

00:07:57.843 --> 00:07:59.445
( audience laughing )

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:01.614
ask him to share confidential
information with me,

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:04.683
and show me where he found
the skeleton, and voila.

00:08:04.683 --> 00:08:05.784
( audience laughing )

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:08.820
It was a crazy idea and I
knew it was a crazy idea,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.190
but I traveled back to Morocco

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.293
and I talked to my
Moroccan colleague, Samir,

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:17.263
and he said, "Okay, how are
we going to find this guy?"

00:08:17.263 --> 00:08:19.331
I mean he knows I'm crazy,
but I mean he was like

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.767
"How are we going
to find this guy?"

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:25.971
"Do you have a name, or an
address, or phone number?

00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:27.272
Anything?"

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:29.175
But all I had was
just this mental image

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.376
of this man I had seen
several years earlier

00:08:31.376 --> 00:08:33.879
for a few minutes in Erfoud.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:37.349
So I told him, "Well,
he had a mustache."

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:40.018
( audience laughing )

00:08:40.018 --> 00:08:42.855
And I'm paraphrasing
what Samir said next.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.224
But basically he
was saying something

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.559
along the lines of
that's not an adequate

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:49.161
starting point for our search.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:51.464
( audience laughing )

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.299
But we tried anyway.

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:55.401
We traveled to many
different places.

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:58.503
We went to places where
people were digging tunnels

00:08:58.503 --> 00:09:00.706
into the rock looking
for dinosaur bones.

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:04.377
We were looking at places
where local fossil hunters

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.944
were selling things.

00:09:05.944 --> 00:09:07.446
But we couldn't find the guy.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.915
We couldn't find out
anything about this skeleton,

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:12.318
and so, you know,
we went back to Erfoud.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:14.253
It was the last
day of our search,

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:16.255
and I was just getting
ready to give up,

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.456
throw in the towel.

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:22.160
So we were sitting in this cafe
in Erfoud sipping mint tea,

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.896
and I'm just thinking,
you know, that's it.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:26.632
You know, I'll probably
have to give up.

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:27.733
It was a crazy idea.

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:30.302
It was like looking for a
needle, not in a haystack.

00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:31.571
That would be easy.

00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.707
I was looking for a needle
in the Sahara, one man.

00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:37.576
So, and just at that
moment when I was

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:41.580
at my lowest point
and ready to give up,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.149
this person walks
past our table.

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:46.986
( audience laughing )

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.754
I'm not kidding you.

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:52.358
At that very moment, and I
looked at the man's face,

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:55.127
and I look at Samir, and
I look back at the man,

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:56.562
and he's walking fast,

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:59.364
and we run down the street
and catch up with him,

00:09:59.364 --> 00:10:02.167
and it was the man
I was looking for.

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:04.369
( audience laughing )

00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:06.271
So, I couldn't really
believe my luck.

00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.373
The next part,
convincing him to share

00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:10.642
his field site with
us was the easy part.

00:10:10.642 --> 00:10:12.344
Had never been done
before, but I was like,

00:10:12.344 --> 00:10:14.313
I'm not letting you
go before you tell me

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:16.748
where you found this.
( audience laughing )

00:10:16.748 --> 00:10:20.219
So he agreed, and here's
what happened next.

00:10:20.219 --> 00:10:22.954 line:0%
( Voice-over ): The man
agrees finally to take Nizar

00:10:22.954 --> 00:10:26.892 line:0%
to the site where the fossils
were pulled from the ground.

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:33.465 line:0%
After nearly an hour
drive, most of it off-road,

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:36.968 line:0%
and a 30 minute trek up
the side of a mountain,

00:10:36.968 --> 00:10:41.640 line:0%
the dealer leads Nizar
to a nondescript looking hole

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.042 line:0%
in a hillside.

00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:49.048 line:0%
( mystical music )

00:10:57.623 --> 00:11:01.226 line:0%
Within minutes, in the fill
surrounding the dig site,

00:11:01.226 --> 00:11:05.063 line:0%
they discover fragments
of bones and teeth,

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:08.200 line:0%
all but certainly Spinosaurus.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.368 line:0%
( Nizar ): This is amazing.

00:11:09.368 --> 00:11:10.602 line:0%
I mean this will take
some time to sink in,

00:11:10.602 --> 00:11:12.238 line:0%
but this is amazing.
It feels really surreal.

00:11:14.707 --> 00:11:17.409
Calm down, Nizar, but
it still feels surreal.

00:11:17.409 --> 00:11:19.678
( audience laughing )

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:21.514
It still feels
surreal to this day,

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.981
and it was amazing.

00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:24.983
We found our needle
in the Sahara.

00:11:24.983 --> 00:11:26.785
I'm glad I'm not a statistician

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:29.555
and thinking about the odds
that were stacked against us.

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:30.889
You know, I just
thought we'll try.

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:32.658
So we found the site.

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:35.260
We found more bones
of the same animal,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.397
and we had beautiful
geology all around us

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:40.366
so we had all the
information we wanted.

00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:43.235
So now we knew all the
bones came from one place,

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:45.571
and we can put the
skeleton together.

00:11:45.571 --> 00:11:46.971
We did it the modern way.

00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:48.607
We CT scanned all of the bones,

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:50.242
and built a digital dinosaur

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:52.578
filling in missing parts
with information we had

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:56.548
from other Spinosaurus
bones, isolated pieces

00:11:56.548 --> 00:11:58.750
I had seen in
museum collections.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.619
This is work that was
largely carried out

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:02.154
by Tyler Keillor.

00:12:02.154 --> 00:12:04.055
When we put the entire
skeleton together,

00:12:04.055 --> 00:12:05.791
we realized that we were
looking at something

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:08.961
that looked unlike any
other dinosaur ever found

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:10.295
Look at those proportions.

00:12:10.295 --> 00:12:13.999
It's a truly bizarre animal.

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:16.735
And we also realized
that it was very big.

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:19.838
We actually mounted
it at life size,

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:23.475
and because that's more
impressive than a CGI model,

00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:26.044
I'll show you our skeleton.

00:12:26.044 --> 00:12:27.379 line:0%
It's an incredible creature.

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:29.915 line:0%
Look at that skull, a long neck,

00:12:29.915 --> 00:12:32.418 line:0%
and you'll see the big
spines that Stromer had found

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:35.253 line:0%
over a hundred years ago.

00:12:35.253 --> 00:12:37.088 line:0%
Looks like a whale or something.

00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:39.024 line:0%
It's a truly bizarre creature.

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:41.093
I'm going to touch
on this very briefly

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:43.095
because this is
still ongoing work,

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:45.664
but the biology of this dinosaur
is very, very interesting.

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:48.000
We have a lot of really
bizarre adaptations

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.769
in this creature,
not just the big sail.

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:54.139
We have a nose opening
that's pushed back on the skull,

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:56.475
further back than in
any other dinosaur.

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:58.577
We have paddle-like feet,

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:00.812
hind limbs that
are really short.

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:03.882
Those are all things that
we see in aquatic animals.

00:13:03.882 --> 00:13:06.285
Even the bone structure
of this dinosaur

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:09.488
looks more like that
of marine mammals

00:13:09.488 --> 00:13:11.023
than typical dinosaurs.

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:12.991
and then we have these
big powerful arms

00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:15.560
that may have been used
to tackle large prey

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.763
like the big Coelacanth
you saw earlier on.

00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:19.464
The teeth are conical.

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:21.633
The snout is just like
that of a crocodile,

00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:24.937
perfect for snaring
slippery prey.

00:13:26.038 --> 00:13:28.307
So it turns out that,
you know, we had not only

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:30.576
rediscovered
Stromer's lost giant,

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:33.211
we were looking at the
first aquatic dinosaur.

00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:35.581
It's a truly amazing creature.

00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:38.350
This piece of artwork,
and all the other artwork

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.653
you saw in this talk, is
the work of Davide Bonadonna

00:13:41.653 --> 00:13:43.955
my Italian dinosaur illustrator,

00:13:43.955 --> 00:13:46.091
the Michelangelo of
dinosaur illustrations.

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:47.492
( audience laughing )

00:13:47.492 --> 00:13:49.194
And this really shows
you what this river

00:13:49.194 --> 00:13:50.428
of giants looked like,

00:13:50.428 --> 00:13:53.465
a place dominated by
predators, giant fish,

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:56.068
flying reptiles,
and Spinosaurus,

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:59.238
the ruler of this
strange lost world.

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:02.474
So, I will leave you with
this beautiful image.

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:05.410
You know, for me this
encapsulates everything

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.678
that Spinosaurus was about.

00:14:06.678 --> 00:14:08.113
It's the first aquatic dinosaur.

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:09.615
It's bigger than T. rex.

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:12.083
You know, the story
is just so rich.

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:14.419
It was an amazing
experience for me,

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:16.355
and I'm German Moroccan.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:19.024
I mean this is a German
Moroccan science story.

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.492
You know, what are the odds?

00:14:20.492 --> 00:14:22.294
But then, I don't need to
tell you anything about that.

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:24.663
( audience laughing )

00:14:24.663 --> 00:14:27.333
So it was a truly
amazing adventure,

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:30.836
and I feel really privileged
to have been a part of it.

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:33.605
So I will leave you with
this beautiful image,

00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:37.242
and a promise that I will take
you on many other journeys

00:14:37.242 --> 00:14:40.545
back in time to
lost worlds that are

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:43.549
more awe-inspiring,
more thought-provoking,

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.485
and more bizarre than
we could possibly imagine.

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:47.485
Thank you.

00:14:47.485 --> 00:14:49.154
( applause )

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:53.392
( outro music )
