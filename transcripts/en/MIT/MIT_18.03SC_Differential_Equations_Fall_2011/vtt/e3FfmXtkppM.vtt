00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.826
As a matter of fact,
it plots them very accurately.

00:00:03.826 --> 00:00:08.188
But it is something you also
need to learn to do yourself,

00:00:08.188 --> 00:00:11.938
as you will see when we study
nonlinear equations.

00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:15.382
It is a skill.
And since a couple of important

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:20.204
mathematical ideas are involved
in it, I think it is a very good

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:24.566
thing to spend just a little
time on, one lecture in fact,

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:28.622
plus a little more on the
problem set that I will give

00:00:28.622 --> 00:00:32.307
out.
The last problem set that I

00:00:32.307 --> 00:00:36.923
will give out on Friday.
I thought it might be a little

00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:40.854
more fun to, again,
have a simple-minded model.

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:45.128
No romance this time.
We are going to have a little

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.461
model of war,
but I have made it sort of

00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:51.880
sublimated war.
Let's take as the system,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.641
I am going to let two of those
be parameters,

00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:00.000
you know, be variable,
in other words.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.016
And the other two I will keep
fixed, so that you can

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:10.131
concentrate on them better.
I will take a and d to be

00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:15.245
negative 1 and negative 3.
And the other ones we will

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:19.573
leave open, so let's call this
one b times y,

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:24.000
and this other one will be c
times x.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.714
I am going to model this as a
fight between two states,

00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:50.000
both of which are trying to
attract tourists.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.857
Let's say this is Massachusetts
and this will be New Hampshire,

00:01:58.857 --> 00:02:05.214
its enemy to the North.
Both are busy advertising these

00:02:05.214 --> 00:02:08.714
days on television.
People are making their summer

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:10.714
plans.
Come to New Hampshire,

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:14.857
you know, New Hampshire has
mountains and Massachusetts has

00:02:14.857 --> 00:02:19.000
quaint little fishing villages
and stuff like that.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.436
So what are these numbers?
Well, first of all,

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:33.464
what do x and y represent?
x and y basically are the

00:02:33.464 --> 00:02:39.676
advertising budgets for tourism,
you know, the amount each state

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:45.394
plans to spend during the year.
However, I do not want zero

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:49.732
value to mean they are not
spending anything.

00:02:49.732 --> 00:02:54.760
It represents departure from
the normal equilibrium.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.000
x and y represent departures --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.454
-- from the normal amount of
money they spend advertising for

00:03:09.454 --> 00:03:13.000
tourists.
The normal tourist advertising

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
budget.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.358
If they are both zero,
it means that both states are

00:03:23.358 --> 00:03:26.386
spending what they normally
spend in that year.

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:29.547
If x is positive,
it means that Massachusetts has

00:03:29.547 --> 00:03:33.497
decided to spend more in the
hope of attracting more tourists

00:03:33.497 --> 00:03:37.887
and if negative spending less.
What is the significance of

00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:41.381
these two coefficients?
Those are the normal things

00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.666
which return you to equilibrium.
In other words,

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:48.650
if x gets bigger than normal,
if Massachusetts spends more

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.053
there is a certain poll to spend
less because we are wasting all

00:03:53.053 --> 00:03:57.247
this money on the tourists that
are not going to come when we

00:03:57.247 --> 00:04:00.741
could be spending it on
education or something like

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:03.562
that.
If x gets to be negative,

00:04:03.562 --> 00:04:05.562
the governor tries to spend
less.

00:04:05.562 --> 00:04:09.312
Then all the local city Chamber
of Commerce rise up and start

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:13.062
screaming that our economy is
going to go bankrupt because we

00:04:13.062 --> 00:04:16.562
won't get enough tourists and
that is because you are not

00:04:16.562 --> 00:04:19.500
spending enough money.
There is a push to always

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.875
return it to the normal,
and that is what this negative

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:24.937
sign means.
The same thing for New

00:04:24.937 --> 00:04:27.437
Hampshire.
What does it mean that this is

00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:31.000
negative three and that is
negative one?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.516
It just means that the Chamber
of Commerce yells three times as

00:04:36.516 --> 00:04:40.519
loudly in New Hampshire.
It is more sensitive,

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:44.078
in other words,
to changes in the budget.

00:04:44.078 --> 00:04:48.526
Now, how about the other?
Well, these represent the

00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:51.551
war-like features of the
situation.

00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:56.000
Normally these will be positive
numbers.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.995
Because when Massachusetts sees
that New Hampshire has budgeted

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:05.909
this year more than its normal
amount, the natural instinct is

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.165
we are fighting.
This is war.

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:12.113
This is a positive number.
We have to budget more,

00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:14.530
too.
And the same thing for New

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.753
Hampshire.
The size of these coefficients

00:05:17.753 --> 00:05:20.895
gives you the magnitude of the
reaction.

00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:25.649
If they are small Massachusetts
say, well, they are spending

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:30.000
more but we don't have to follow
them.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.616
We will bucket a little bit.
If it is a big number then oh,

00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:38.915
my God, heads will roll.
We have to triple them and put

00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:41.860
them out of business.
This is a model,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.805
in fact, for all sorts of
competition.

00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:49.582
It was used for many years to
model in simper times armaments

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:53.960
races between countries.
It is certainly a simple-minded

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.736
model for any two companies in
competition with each other if

00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:05.426
certain conditions are met.
Well, what I would like to do

00:06:05.426 --> 00:06:10.624
now is try different values of
those numbers.

00:06:10.624 --> 00:06:15.822
And, in each case,
show you how to sketch the

00:06:15.822 --> 00:06:22.556
solutions at different cases.
And then, for each different

00:06:22.556 --> 00:06:30.000
case, we will try to interpret
if it makes sense or not.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
My first set of numbers is,
the first case is --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.171
-- x prime equals negative x
plus 2y.

00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:54.294
And y prime equals,
this is going to be zero,

00:06:54.294 --> 00:07:00.000
so it is simply minus 
3 times y.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.011
Now, what does this mean?
Well, this means that

00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:08.982
Massachusetts is behaving
normally, but New Hampshire is a

00:07:08.982 --> 00:07:13.168
very placid state,
and the governor is busy doing

00:07:13.168 --> 00:07:17.005
other things.
And people say Massachusetts is

00:07:17.005 --> 00:07:21.017
spending more this year,
and the Governor says,

00:07:21.017 --> 00:07:24.418
so what.
The zero is the so what factor.

00:07:24.418 --> 00:07:28.343
In other words,
we are not going to respond to

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:31.654
them.
We will do our own thing.

00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:35.360
What is the result of this?
Is Massachusetts going to win

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.147
out?
What is going to be the

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:40.985
ultimate effect on the budget?
Well, what we have to do is,

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:44.691
so the program is first let's
quickly solve the equations

00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:48.397
using a standard technique.
I am just going to make marks

00:07:48.397 --> 00:07:52.301
on the board and trust to the
fact that you have done enough

00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:57.000
of this yourself by now that you
know what the marks mean.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.536
I am not going to label what
everything is.

00:08:00.536 --> 00:08:03.231
I am just going to trust to
luck.

00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:07.778
The matrix A is negative 1,
2, 0, negative 3.

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:11.063
The characteristic equation,

00:08:11.063 --> 00:08:15.526
the second coefficient is the
trace, which is minus 4,

00:08:15.526 --> 00:08:20.242
but you have to change its
sign, so that makes it plus 4.

00:08:20.242 --> 00:08:25.294
And the constant term is the
determinant, which is 3 minus 0,

00:08:25.294 --> 00:08:31.597
so that is plus 3 equals zero.
This factors into lambda plus 3

00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:35.283
times lambda plus one.
And it means the roots

00:08:35.283 --> 00:08:38.551
therefore are,
one root is lambda equals

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:43.327
negative 3 and the other root is
lambda equals negative 1.

00:08:43.327 --> 00:08:47.851
These are the eigenvalues.
With each eigenvalue goes an

00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:51.118
eigenvector.
The eigenvector is found by

00:08:51.118 --> 00:08:56.062
solving an equation for the
coefficients of the eigenvector,

00:08:56.062 --> 00:09:00.000
the components of the
eigenvector.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.861
Here I used negative 1 minus
negative 3, which makes 2.

00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:09.453
The first equation is 2a1 plus
2a2 is equal to zero.

00:09:09.453 --> 00:09:14.045
The second one will be,
in fact, in this case simply

00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:18.996
0a1 plus 0a2 so it won't give me
any information at all.

00:09:18.996 --> 00:09:23.948
That is not what usually
happens, but it is what happens

00:09:23.948 --> 00:09:28.000
in this case.
What is the solution?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.051
The solution is the vector
alpha equals,

00:09:32.051 --> 00:09:37.766
well, 1, negative 1
would be a good thing to

00:09:37.766 --> 00:09:40.675
use.
That is the eigenvector,

00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:45.558
so this is the e-vector.
How about lambda equals

00:09:45.558 --> 00:09:49.506
negative 1?
Let's give it a little more

00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:52.935
room.
If lambda is negative 1 then

00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:56.883
here I put negative 1 minus
negative 1.

00:09:56.883 --> 00:10:01.663
That makes zero.
I will write in the zero

00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:04.851
because this is confusing.
It is zero times a1.

00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:07.693
And the next coefficient is 2
a2, is zero.

00:10:07.693 --> 00:10:11.712
People sometimes go bananas
over this, in spite of the fact

00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:15.178
that this is the easiest
possible case you can get.

00:10:15.178 --> 00:10:19.544
I guess if they go bananas over
it, it proves it is not all that

00:10:19.544 --> 00:10:22.871
easy, but it is easy.
What now is the eigenvector

00:10:22.871 --> 00:10:26.198
that goes with this?
Well, this term isn't there.

00:10:26.198 --> 00:10:30.050
It is zero.
The equation says that a2 has

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.737
to be zero.
And it doesn't say anything

00:10:32.737 --> 00:10:35.000
about a1, so let's make it 1.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.880
Now, out of this data,
the final step is to make the

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.559
general solution.
What is it?

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:51.387
(x, y) equals,
well, a constant times the

00:10:51.387 --> 00:10:55.885
first normal mode.
The solution constructed from

00:10:55.885 --> 00:11:00.000
the eigenvalue and the
eigenvector.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.020
That is going to be 1,
negative 1 e to the minus 3t.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.040
And then the other normal mode

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.542
times an arbitrary constant will
be (1, 0) times e to the

00:11:12.542 --> 00:11:14.793
negative t.

00:11:14.793 --> 00:11:18.412
The lambda is this factor which
produces that,

00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:21.547
of course.
Now, one way of looking at it

00:11:21.547 --> 00:11:25.246
is, first of all,
get clearly in your head this

00:11:25.246 --> 00:11:29.346
is a pair of parametric
equations just like what you

00:11:29.346 --> 00:11:34.924
studied in 18.02.
Let's write them out explicitly

00:11:34.924 --> 00:11:38.792
just this once.
x equals c1 times e to the

00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:44.547
negative 3t plus c2 times e to
the negative t.

00:11:44.547 --> 00:11:47.188
And what is y?

00:11:47.188 --> 00:11:52.754
y is equal to minus c1 e to the
minus 3t plus zero.

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.301
I can stop there.

00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:59.264
In some sense,
all I am asking you to do is

00:11:59.264 --> 00:12:03.245
plot that curve.
In the x,y-plane,

00:12:03.245 --> 00:12:07.419
plot the curve given by this
pair of parametric equations.

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:10.349
And you can choose your own
values of c1,

00:12:10.349 --> 00:12:12.766
c2.
For different values of c1 and

00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:15.183
c2 there will be different
curves.

00:12:15.183 --> 00:12:18.478
Give me a feeling for what they
all look like.

00:12:18.478 --> 00:12:22.946
Well, I think most of you will
recognize you didn't have stuff

00:12:22.946 --> 00:12:25.509
like this.
These weren't the kind of

00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:29.507
curves you plotted.
When you did parametric

00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:32.522
equations in 18.02,
you did stuff like x equals

00:12:32.522 --> 00:12:36.127
cosine t, y equals sine t.

00:12:36.127 --> 00:12:40.059
Everybody knows how to do that.
A few other curves which made

00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:43.271
lines or nice things,
but nothing that ever looked

00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:45.827
like that.
And so the computer will plot

00:12:45.827 --> 00:12:48.973
it by actually calculating
values but, of course,

00:12:48.973 --> 00:12:51.792
we will not.
That is the significance of the

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:54.348
word sketch.
I am not asking you to plot

00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:58.149
carefully, but to give me some
general geometric picture of

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:03.000
what all these curves look like
without doing any work.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.989
Without doing any work.
Well, that sounds promising.

00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:16.431
Okay, let's try to do it
without doing any work.

00:13:16.431 --> 00:13:23.421
Where shall I begin?
Hidden in this formula are four

00:13:23.421 --> 00:13:30.000
solutions that are extremely
easy to plot.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.582
So begin with the four easy
solutions, and then fill in the

00:13:38.582 --> 00:13:42.726
rest.
Now, which are the easy

00:13:42.726 --> 00:13:47.905
solutions?
The easy solutions are c1

00:13:47.905 --> 00:13:53.529
equals plus or minus 1,
c2 equals zero,

00:13:53.529 --> 00:14:00.336
or c1 equals zero,
or c1 = 0, c2 equals plus or

00:14:00.336 --> 00:14:05.187
minus 1.
By choosing those four values

00:14:05.187 --> 00:14:07.826
of c1 and c2,
I get simple solutions

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:10.240
corresponding to the normal
mode.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.011
If c1 is one and c2 is zero,
I am talking about (1,

00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:17.706
negative 1) e to the minus 3t,

00:14:17.706 --> 00:14:21.703
and that is very easy plot.
Let's start plotting them.

00:14:21.703 --> 00:14:25.776
What I am going to do is
color-code them so you will be

00:14:25.776 --> 00:14:30.000
able to recognize what it is I
am plotting.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.661
Let's see.
What colors should we use?

00:14:33.661 --> 00:14:39.559
We will use pink and orange.
This will be our pink solution

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:43.627
and our orange solution will be
this one.

00:14:43.627 --> 00:14:47.084
Let's plot the pink solution
first.

00:14:47.084 --> 00:14:53.288
The pink solution corresponds
to c1 equals 1 and c2

00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:58.576
equals zero.
Now, that solution looks like--

00:14:58.576 --> 00:15:01.938
Let's write it in pink.

00:15:01.938 --> 00:15:06.320
No, let's not write it in pink.
What is the solution?

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.292
It looks like x equals e to the
negative 3t,

00:15:11.292 --> 00:15:15.421
y equals minus e to the minus
3t.

00:15:15.421 --> 00:15:19.719
Well, that's not a good way to
look at it, actually.

00:15:19.719 --> 00:15:24.185
The best way to look at it is
to say at t equals zero,

00:15:24.185 --> 00:15:26.966
where is it?
It is at the point 1,

00:15:26.966 --> 00:15:30.000
negative 1.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.711
And what is it doing as t
increases?

00:15:32.711 --> 00:15:35.888
Well, it keeps the direction,
but travels.

00:15:35.888 --> 00:15:39.142
The amplitude,
the distance from the origin

00:15:39.142 --> 00:15:41.544
keeps shrinking.
As t increases,

00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:44.334
this factor,
so it is the tip of this

00:15:44.334 --> 00:15:47.278
vector, except the vector is
shrinking.

00:15:47.278 --> 00:15:51.152
It is still in the direction of
1, negative 1,

00:15:51.152 --> 00:15:55.801
but it is shrinking in
length because its amplitude is

00:15:55.801 --> 00:16:02.000
shrinking according to the law e
to the negative 3t.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.360
In other words,
this curve looks like this.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.759
At t equals zero it is over
here, and it goes along this

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:14.639
diagonal line until as t equals
infinity, it gets to infinity,

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:18.879
it reaches the origin.
Of course, it never gets there.

00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:23.360
It goes slower and slower and
slower in order that it may

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.679
never reach the origin.
What was it doing for values of

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:31.053
t less than zero?
The same thing,

00:16:31.053 --> 00:16:35.128
except it was further away.
It comes in from infinity along

00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:37.517
that straight line.
In other words,

00:16:37.517 --> 00:16:41.873
the eigenvector determines the
line on which it travels and the

00:16:41.873 --> 00:16:44.613
eigenvalue determines which way
it goes.

00:16:44.613 --> 00:16:48.899
If the eigenvalue is negative,
it is approaching the origin as

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:51.428
t increases.
How about the other one?

00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:55.644
Well, if c1 is negative 1,
then everything is the

00:16:55.644 --> 00:17:00.000
same except it is the mirror
image of this one.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.685
If c1 is negative 1,
then at t equals zero it is at

00:17:03.685 --> 00:17:05.675
this point.
And, once again,

00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:10.098
the same reasoning shows that
it is coming into the origin as

00:17:10.098 --> 00:17:12.825
t increases.
I have now two solutions,

00:17:12.825 --> 00:17:16.363
this one corresponding to c1
equals 1,

00:17:16.363 --> 00:17:19.533
and the other one c2 equals
zero.

00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:22.776
This one corresponds to c1
equals negative 1.

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:25.651
How about the other guy,
the orange guy?

00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:30.000
Well, now c1 is zero,
c2 is one, let's say.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.794
It is the vector (1,
0), but otherwise everything is

00:17:33.794 --> 00:17:36.547
the same.
I start now at the point (1,

00:17:36.547 --> 00:17:39.226
0) at time zero.
And, as t increases,

00:17:39.226 --> 00:17:42.946
I come into the origin always
along that direction.

00:17:42.946 --> 00:17:45.848
And before that I came in from
infinity.

00:17:45.848 --> 00:17:50.386
And, again, if c2 is 1
and if c2 is negative 1,

00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:55.000
I do the same thing but
on the other side.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.668
That wasn't very hard.
I plotted four solutions.

00:18:04.668 --> 00:18:10.629
And now I roll up my sleeves
and waive my hands to try to get

00:18:10.629 --> 00:18:14.205
others.
The general philosophy is the

00:18:14.205 --> 00:18:18.079
following.
The general philosophy is the

00:18:18.079 --> 00:18:21.754
differential equation looks like
this.

00:18:21.754 --> 00:18:25.728
It is a system of differential
equations.

00:18:25.728 --> 00:18:31.905
These are continuous functions.
That means when I draw the

00:18:31.905 --> 00:18:36.157
velocity field corresponding to
that system of differential

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:39.748
equations, because their
functions are continuous,

00:18:39.748 --> 00:18:43.047
as I move from one (x,
y) point to another the

00:18:43.047 --> 00:18:46.931
direction of the velocity
vectors change continuously.

00:18:46.931 --> 00:18:50.890
It never suddenly reverses
without something like that.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.895
Now, if that changes
continuously then the

00:18:53.895 --> 00:18:56.607
trajectories must change
continuously,

00:18:56.607 --> 00:18:59.090
too.
In other words,

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.236
nearby trajectories should be
doing approximately the same

00:19:03.236 --> 00:19:05.854
thing.
Well, that means all the other

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:10.218
trajectories are ones which come
like that must be going also

00:19:10.218 --> 00:19:12.690
toward the origin.
If I start here,

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.163
probably I have to follow this
one.

00:19:15.163 --> 00:19:19.381
They are all coming to the
origin, but that is a little too

00:19:19.381 --> 00:19:22.072
vague.
How do they come to the origin?

00:19:22.072 --> 00:19:25.127
In other words,
are they coming in straight

00:19:25.127 --> 00:19:26.799
like that?
Probably not.

00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:32.097
Then what are they doing?
Now we are coming to the only

00:19:32.097 --> 00:19:36.438
point in the lecture which you
might find a little difficult.

00:19:36.438 --> 00:19:38.825
Try to follow what I am doing
now.

00:19:38.825 --> 00:19:42.153
If you don't follow,
it is not well done in the

00:19:42.153 --> 00:19:46.204
textbook, but it is very well
done in the notes because I

00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:49.170
wrote them myself.
Please, it is done very

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.859
carefully in the notes,
patiently follow through the

00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.970
explanation.
It takes about that much space.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.804
It is one of the important
ideas that your engineering

00:19:59.804 --> 00:20:04.000
professors will expect you to
understand.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.683
Anyway, I know this only from
the negative one because they

00:20:08.683 --> 00:20:12.639
say to me at lunch,
ruin my lunch by saying I said

00:20:12.639 --> 00:20:16.596
it to my students and got
nothing but blank looks.

00:20:16.596 --> 00:20:19.664
What do you guys teach them
over there?

00:20:19.664 --> 00:20:22.894
Blah, blah, blah.
Maybe we ought to start

00:20:22.894 --> 00:20:25.074
teaching it ourselves.
Sure.

00:20:25.074 --> 00:20:28.546
Why don't they start cutting
their own hair,

00:20:28.546 --> 00:20:30.000
too?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.163
Here is the idea.
Let me recopy that solution.

00:20:40.163 --> 00:20:46.590
The solution looks like (1,
negative 1) e to the minus 3t

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:51.524
plus c2, (1, 0) e to the
negative t.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.084
What I ask is as t goes to
infinity, I feel sure that the

00:21:00.084 --> 00:21:04.534
trajectories must be coming into
the origin because these guys

00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:06.576
are doing that.
And, in fact,

00:21:06.576 --> 00:21:09.494
that is confirmed.
As t goes to infinity,

00:21:09.494 --> 00:21:13.943
this goes to zero and that goes
to zero regardless of what the

00:21:13.943 --> 00:21:17.079
c1 and c2 are.
That makes it clear that this

00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:21.237
goes to zero no matter what the
c1 and c2 are as t goes to

00:21:21.237 --> 00:21:25.103
infinity, but I would like to
analyze it a little more

00:21:25.103 --> 00:21:28.907
carefully.
As t goes to infinity,

00:21:28.907 --> 00:21:32.897
I have the sum of two terms.
And what I ask is,

00:21:32.897 --> 00:21:36.539
which term is dominant?
Of these two terms,

00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:41.569
are they of equal importance,
or is one more important than

00:21:41.569 --> 00:21:43.563
the other?
When t is 10,

00:21:43.563 --> 00:21:47.292
for example,
that is not very far on the way

00:21:47.292 --> 00:21:52.235
to infinity, but it is certainly
far enough to illustrate.

00:21:52.235 --> 00:21:56.571
Well, e to the minus 10
is an extremely

00:21:56.571 --> 00:22:01.334
small number.
The only thing smaller is e to

00:22:01.334 --> 00:22:05.146
the minus 30.
The term that dominates,

00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:08.881
they are both small,
but relatively-speaking this

00:22:08.881 --> 00:22:13.783
one is much larger because this
one only has the factor e to the

00:22:13.783 --> 00:22:17.752
minus 10,
whereas, this has the factor e

00:22:17.752 --> 00:22:22.031
to the minus 30,
which is vanishingly small.

00:22:22.031 --> 00:22:26.000
In other words,
as t goes to infinity --

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.400
Well, let's write it the other
way.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.000
This is the dominant term,
as t goes to infinity.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.242
Now, just the opposite is true
as t goes to minus infinity.

00:22:43.242 --> 00:22:48.485
t going to minus infinity means
I am backing up along these

00:22:48.485 --> 00:22:51.649
curves.
As t goes to minus infinity,

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:56.711
let's say t gets to be negative
100, this is e to the 100,

00:22:56.711 --> 00:23:01.141
but this is e to the 300,

00:23:01.141 --> 00:23:03.491
which is much,
much bigger.

00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:10.000
So this is the dominant term as
t goes to negative infinity.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.827
Now what I have is the sum of
two vectors.

00:23:20.827 --> 00:23:24.551
Let's first look at what
happens as t goes to infinity.

00:23:24.551 --> 00:23:28.137
As t goes to infinity,
I have the sum of two vectors.

00:23:28.137 --> 00:23:31.862
This one is completely
negligible compared with the one

00:23:31.862 --> 00:23:35.083
on the right-hand side.
In other words,

00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:38.911
for a all intents and purposes,
as t goes to infinity,

00:23:38.911 --> 00:23:41.222
it is this thing that takes
over.

00:23:41.222 --> 00:23:45.194
Therefore, what does the
solution look like as t goes to

00:23:45.194 --> 00:23:47.866
infinity?
The answer is it follows the

00:23:47.866 --> 00:23:50.900
yellow line.
Now, what does it look like as

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.716
it backs up?
As it came in from negative

00:23:53.716 --> 00:23:56.027
infinity, what does it look
like?

00:23:56.027 --> 00:24:00.000
Now, this one is a little
harder to see.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.786
This is big,
but this is infinity bigger.

00:24:03.786 --> 00:24:06.532
I mean very,
very much bigger,

00:24:06.532 --> 00:24:09.656
when t is a large negative
number.

00:24:09.656 --> 00:24:14.769
Therefore, what I have is the
sum of a very big vector.

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:19.786
You're standing on the moon
looking at the blackboard,

00:24:19.786 --> 00:24:24.331
so this is really big.
This is a very big vector.

00:24:24.331 --> 00:24:29.538
This is one million meters
long, and this is only 20,000

00:24:29.538 --> 00:24:33.286
meters long.
That is this guy,

00:24:33.286 --> 00:24:36.994
and that is this guy.
I want the sum of those two.

00:24:36.994 --> 00:24:40.778
What does the sum look like?
The answer is a sum is

00:24:40.778 --> 00:24:44.789
approximately parallel to the
long guy because this is

00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:47.664
negligible.
This does not mean they are

00:24:47.664 --> 00:24:51.372
next to each other.
They are slightly tilted over,

00:24:51.372 --> 00:24:53.870
but not very much.
In other words,

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:58.335
as t goes to negative infinity
it doesn't coincide with this

00:24:58.335 --> 00:25:01.539
vector.
The solution doesn't,

00:25:01.539 --> 00:25:05.279
but it is parallel to it.
It has the same direction.

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:07.920
I am done.
It means far away from the

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.293
origin, it should be parallel to
the pink line.

00:25:11.293 --> 00:25:15.180
Near the origin it should turn
and become more or less

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.653
coincident with the orange line.
And those were the solutions.

00:25:19.653 --> 00:25:22.000
That's how they look.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.563
How about down here?
The same thing,

00:25:30.563 --> 00:25:35.858
like that, but then after a
while they turn and join.

00:25:35.858 --> 00:25:41.559
Here, they have to turn around
to join up, but they join.

00:25:41.559 --> 00:25:44.410
And that is,
in a simple way,

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.567
the sketches of those
functions.

00:25:47.567 --> 00:25:53.167
That is how they must look.
What does this say about our

00:25:53.167 --> 00:25:57.262
state?
Well, it says that the fact

00:25:57.262 --> 00:26:01.955
that the governor of New
Hampshire is indifferent to what

00:26:01.955 --> 00:26:06.145
Massachusetts is doing produces
ultimately harmony.

00:26:06.145 --> 00:26:11.256
Both states revert ultimately
their normal advertising budgets

00:26:11.256 --> 00:26:15.949
in spite of the fact that
Massachusetts is keeping an eye

00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:20.810
peeled out for the slightest
misbehavior on the part of New

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.653
Hampshire.
Peace reins,

00:26:22.653 --> 00:26:27.577
in other words.
Now you should know some names.

00:26:27.577 --> 00:26:30.819
Let's see.
I will write names in purple.

00:26:30.819 --> 00:26:35.807
There are two words that are
used to describe this situation.

00:26:35.807 --> 00:26:40.296
First is the word that
describes the general pattern of

00:26:40.296 --> 00:26:44.703
the way these lines look.
The word for that is a node.

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:48.942
And the fact that all the
trajectories end up at the

00:26:48.942 --> 00:26:52.102
origin for that one uses the
word sink.

00:26:52.102 --> 00:26:55.095
This could be modified to nodal
sink.

00:26:55.095 --> 00:27:00.000
That would be better.
Nodal sink, let's say.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.725
Nodal sink or,
if you like to write them in

00:27:03.725 --> 00:27:06.298
the opposite order,
sink node.

00:27:06.298 --> 00:27:11.620
In the same way there would be
something called a source node

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:16.854
if I reversed all the arrows.
I am not going to calculate an

00:27:16.854 --> 00:27:19.959
example.
Why don't I simply do it by

00:27:19.959 --> 00:27:23.098
giving you --
For example,

00:27:23.098 --> 00:27:28.135
if the matrix A produced a
solution instead of that one.

00:27:28.135 --> 00:27:32.989
Suppose it looked like 1,
negative 1 e to the 3t.

00:27:32.989 --> 00:27:36.926
The eigenvalues were reversed,

00:27:36.926 --> 00:27:41.230
were now positive.
And I will make the other one

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:44.985
positive, too.
c2 1, 0 e to the t.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.794
What would that change in the
picture?

00:27:59.794 --> 00:28:04.098
The answer is essentially
nothing, except the direction of

00:28:04.098 --> 00:28:06.061
the arrows.
In other words,

00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:09.762
the first thing would still be
1, negative 1.

00:28:09.762 --> 00:28:12.556
The only difference is that now

00:28:12.556 --> 00:28:15.123
as t increases we go the other
way.

00:28:15.123 --> 00:28:19.050
And here the same thing,
we have still the same basic

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.750
vector, the same basic orange
vector, orange line,

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:25.544
but it has now traversed the
solution.

00:28:25.544 --> 00:28:30.000
We traverse it in the opposite
direction.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.019
Now, let's do the same thing
about dominance,

00:28:35.019 --> 00:28:40.380
as we did before.
Which term dominates as t goes

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:44.714
to infinity?
This is the dominant term.

00:28:44.714 --> 00:28:51.102
Because, as t goes to infinity,
3t is much bigger than t.

00:28:51.102 --> 00:28:57.832
This one, on the other hand,
dominates as t goes to negative

00:28:57.832 --> 00:29:00.000
infinity.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.705
How now will the solutions look
like?

00:29:07.705 --> 00:29:11.838
Well, as t goes to infinity,
they follow the pink curve.

00:29:11.838 --> 00:29:15.369
Whereas, as t starts out from
negative infinity,

00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:18.000
they follow the orange curve.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.518
As t goes to infinity,
they become parallel to the

00:29:33.518 --> 00:29:38.698
pink curve, and as t goes to
negative infinity,

00:29:38.698 --> 00:29:44.779
they are very close to the
origin and are following the

00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:48.945
yellow curve.
This is pink and this is

00:29:48.945 --> 00:29:53.000
yellow.
They look like this.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.440
Notice the picture basically is
the same.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.258
It is the picture of a node.
All that has happened is the

00:30:11.258 --> 00:30:14.268
arrows are reversed.
And, therefore,

00:30:14.268 --> 00:30:17.279
this would be called a nodal
source.

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:21.924
The word source and sink
correspond to what you learned

00:30:21.924 --> 00:30:24.591
in 18.02 and 8.02,
I hope, also,

00:30:24.591 --> 00:30:27.516
or you could call it a source
node.

00:30:27.516 --> 00:30:31.817
Both phrases are used,
depending on how you want to

00:30:31.817 --> 00:30:37.000
use it in a sentence.
And another word for this,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.384
this would be called unstable
because all of the solutions

00:30:41.384 --> 00:30:45.230
starting out from near the
origin ultimately end up

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:47.923
infinitely far away from the
origin.

00:30:47.923 --> 00:30:52.153
This would be called stable.
In fact, it would be called

00:30:52.153 --> 00:30:55.461
asymptotically stable.
I don't like the word

00:30:55.461 --> 00:30:58.846
asymptotically,
but it has become standard in

00:30:58.846 --> 00:31:02.619
the literature.
And, more important,

00:31:02.619 --> 00:31:05.128
it is standard in your
textbook.

00:31:05.128 --> 00:31:08.447
And I don't like to fight with
a textbook.

00:31:08.447 --> 00:31:12.414
It just ends up confusing
everybody, including me.

00:31:12.414 --> 00:31:16.866
That is enough for nodes.
I would like to talk now about

00:31:16.866 --> 00:31:21.561
some of the other cases that can
occur because they lead to

00:31:21.561 --> 00:31:26.095
completely different pictures
that you should understand.

00:31:26.095 --> 00:31:30.709
Let's look at the case where
our governors behave a little

00:31:30.709 --> 00:31:35.000
more badly, a little more
combatively.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.091
It is x prime equals negative x
as before,

00:31:46.091 --> 00:31:52.988
but this time a firm response
by Massachusetts to any sign of

00:31:52.988 --> 00:31:58.390
increased activity by
stockpiling of advertising

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:03.218
budgets.
Here let's say New Hampshire

00:32:03.218 --> 00:32:08.045
now is even worse.
Five times, quintuple or

00:32:08.045 --> 00:32:15.287
whatever increase Massachusetts
makes, of course they don't have

00:32:15.287 --> 00:32:19.310
an income tax,
but they will manage.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:24.827
Minus 3y as before.
Let's again calculate quickly

00:32:24.827 --> 00:32:30.000
what the characteristic equation
is.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.413
Our matrix is now negative 1,
3, 5 and negative 3.

00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:37.927
The characteristic equation now

00:32:37.927 --> 00:32:40.461
is lambda squared.
What is that?

00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:44.466
Again, plus 4 lambda.
But now the determinant is 3

00:32:44.466 --> 00:32:48.716
minus 15 is negative 12.

00:32:48.716 --> 00:32:52.230
And this, because I prepared
very carefully,

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:57.134
all eigenvalues are integers.
And so this factors into lambda

00:32:57.134 --> 00:33:01.711
plus 6 times lambda minus 2,

00:33:01.711 --> 00:33:04.429
does it not?
Yes.

00:33:04.429 --> 00:33:07.760
6 lambda minus 2 is four
lambda.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.016
Good.
What do we have?

00:33:10.016 --> 00:33:15.173
Well, first of all we have our
eigenvalue lambda,

00:33:15.173 --> 00:33:19.471
negative 6.
And the eigenvector that goes

00:33:19.471 --> 00:33:24.305
with that is minus 1.
This is negative 1 minus

00:33:24.305 --> 00:33:28.388
negative 6 which makes,
shut your eyes,

00:33:28.388 --> 00:33:32.245
5.
We have 5a1 plus 3a2 is zero.

00:33:32.245 --> 00:33:35.534
And the other equation,

00:33:35.534 --> 00:33:38.983
I hope it comes out to be
something similar.

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:42.272
I didn't check.
I am hoping this is right.

00:33:42.272 --> 00:33:46.122
The eigenvector is,
okay, you have been taught to

00:33:46.122 --> 00:33:49.572
always make one of the 1,
forget about that.

00:33:49.572 --> 00:33:53.181
Just pick numbers that make it
come out right.

00:33:53.181 --> 00:33:57.914
I am going to make this one 3,
and then I will make this one

00:33:57.914 --> 00:34:02.616
negative 5.
As I say, I have a policy of

00:34:02.616 --> 00:34:06.261
integers only.
I am a number theorist at

00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:09.626
heart.
That is how I started out life

00:34:09.626 --> 00:34:12.990
anyway.
There we have data from which

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:17.570
we can make one solution.
How about the other one?

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:23.177
The other one will correspond
to the eigenvalue lambda equals

00:34:23.177 --> 00:34:25.700
2.
This time the equation is

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:30.000
negative 1 minus 2 is negative
3.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.588
It is minus 3a1 plus 3a2 is
zero.

00:34:34.588 --> 00:34:37.557
And now the eigenvector is (1,
1).

00:34:37.557 --> 00:34:40.526
Now we are ready to draw
pictures.

00:34:40.526 --> 00:34:44.305
We are going to make this
similar analysis,

00:34:44.305 --> 00:34:49.434
but it will go faster now
because you have already had the

00:34:49.434 --> 00:34:52.313
experience of that.
First of all,

00:34:52.313 --> 00:34:57.532
what is our general solution?
It is going to be c1 times 3,

00:34:57.532 --> 00:35:02.570
negative 5 e to the minus 6t.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:06.944
And then the other normal mode

00:35:06.944 --> 00:35:11.027
times an arbitrary constant will
be 1, 1 times e to the 2t.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.663
I am going to use the same
strategy.

00:35:20.663 --> 00:35:24.086
We have our two normal modes
here, eigenvalue,

00:35:24.086 --> 00:35:27.967
eigenvector solutions from
which, by adjusting these

00:35:27.967 --> 00:35:32.000
constants, we can get our four
basic solutions.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.427
Those are going to look like,
let's draw a picture here.

00:35:37.427 --> 00:35:42.460
Again, I will color-code them.
Let's use pink again.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.394
The pink solution now starts at
3, negative 5.

00:35:47.394 --> 00:35:50.848
That is where it is when t is

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:54.401
zero.
And, because of the coefficient

00:35:54.401 --> 00:35:58.842
minus 6 up there,
it is coming into the origin

00:35:58.842 --> 00:36:03.615
and looks like that.
And its mirror image,

00:36:03.615 --> 00:36:08.076
of course, does the same thing.
That is when c1 is negative

00:36:08.076 --> 00:36:10.307
one.
How about the orange guy?

00:36:10.307 --> 00:36:14.076
Well, when t is equal to zero,
it is at 1, 1.

00:36:14.076 --> 00:36:16.461
But what is it doing after

00:36:16.461 --> 00:36:18.000
that?
As t increases,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.846
it is getting further away from
the origin because the sign here

00:36:22.846 --> 00:36:25.692
is positive.
e to the 2t is

00:36:25.692 --> 00:36:30.384
increasing, it is not decreasing
anymore, so this guy is going

00:36:30.384 --> 00:36:35.705
out.
And its mirror image on the

00:36:35.705 --> 00:36:40.372
other side is doing the same
thing.

00:36:40.372 --> 00:36:46.411
Now all we have to do is fill
in the picture.

00:36:46.411 --> 00:36:51.078
Well, you fill it in by
continuity.

00:36:51.078 --> 00:37:00.000
Your nearby trajectories must
be doing what similar thing?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.328
If I start out very near the
pink guy, I should stay near the

00:37:04.328 --> 00:37:07.069
pink guy.
But as I get near the origin,

00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:09.666
I am also approaching the
orange guy.

00:37:09.666 --> 00:37:13.345
Well, there is no other
possibility other than that.

00:37:13.345 --> 00:37:17.457
If you are further away you
start turning a little sooner.

00:37:17.457 --> 00:37:21.281
I am just using an argument
from continuity to say the

00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:24.383
picture must be roughly filled
out this way.

00:37:24.383 --> 00:37:29.000
Maybe not exactly.
In fact, there are fine points.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.896
And I am going to ask you to do
one of them on Friday for the

00:37:32.896 --> 00:37:35.298
new problem set,
even before the exam,

00:37:35.298 --> 00:37:37.961
God forbid.
But I want you to get a little

00:37:37.961 --> 00:37:41.467
more experience working with
that linear phase portrait

00:37:41.467 --> 00:37:44.714
visual because it is,
I think, one of the best ones

00:37:44.714 --> 00:37:47.441
this semester.
You can learn a lot from it.

00:37:47.441 --> 00:37:51.402
Anyway, you are not done with
it, but I hope you have at least

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:54.649
looked at it by now.
That is what the picture looks

00:37:54.649 --> 00:37:55.818
like.
First of all,

00:37:55.818 --> 00:38:00.302
what are we going to name this?
In other words,

00:38:00.302 --> 00:38:05.078
forget about the arrows.
If you just look at the general

00:38:05.078 --> 00:38:08.813
way those lines go,
where have you seen this

00:38:08.813 --> 00:38:11.331
before?
You saw this in 18.02.

00:38:11.331 --> 00:38:15.152
What was the topic?
You were plotting contour

00:38:15.152 --> 00:38:18.018
curves of functions,
were you not?

00:38:18.018 --> 00:38:23.055
What did you call contours
curves that formed that pattern?

00:38:23.055 --> 00:38:26.963
A saddle point.
You called this a saddle point

00:38:26.963 --> 00:38:32.000
because it was like the center
of a saddle.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.294
It is like a mountain pass.
Here you are going up the

00:38:35.294 --> 00:38:37.954
mountain, say,
and here you are going down,

00:38:37.954 --> 00:38:40.361
the way the contour line is
going down.

00:38:40.361 --> 00:38:42.832
And this is sort of a min and
max point.

00:38:42.832 --> 00:38:46.443
A maximum if you go in that
direction and a minimum if you

00:38:46.443 --> 00:38:48.027
go in that direction,
say.

00:38:48.027 --> 00:38:51.257
Without the arrows on it,
it is like a saddle point.

00:38:51.257 --> 00:38:53.348
And so the same word is used
here.

00:38:53.348 --> 00:38:56.832
It is called the saddle.
You don't say point in the same

00:38:56.832 --> 00:39:01.901
way you don't say a nodal point.
It is the whole picture,

00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:05.546
as it were, that is the saddle.
It is a saddle.

00:39:05.546 --> 00:39:08.874
There is the saddle.
This is where you sit.

00:39:08.874 --> 00:39:12.043
Now, should I call it a source
or a sink?

00:39:12.043 --> 00:39:16.956
I cannot call it either because
it is a sink along these lines,

00:39:16.956 --> 00:39:21.155
it is a source along those
lines and along the others,

00:39:21.155 --> 00:39:25.751
it starts out looking like a
sink and then turns around and

00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:31.132
starts acting like a source.
The word source and sink are

00:39:31.132 --> 00:39:34.864
not used for saddle.
The only word that is used is

00:39:34.864 --> 00:39:38.063
unstable because definitely it
is unstable.

00:39:38.063 --> 00:39:42.786
If you start off exactly on the
pink lines you do end up at the

00:39:42.786 --> 00:39:47.051
origin, but if you start
anywhere else ever so close to a

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:50.631
pink line you think you are
going to the origin,

00:39:50.631 --> 00:39:55.353
but then at the last minute you
are zooming off out to infinity

00:39:55.353 --> 00:39:57.943
again.
This is a typical example of

00:39:57.943 --> 00:40:01.573
instability.
Only if you do the

00:40:01.573 --> 00:40:06.381
mathematically possible,
but physically impossible thing

00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:11.539
of starting out exactly on the
pink line, only then will you

00:40:11.539 --> 00:40:15.823
get to the origin.
If you start out anywhere else,

00:40:15.823 --> 00:40:20.631
make the slightest error in
measure and get off the pink

00:40:20.631 --> 00:40:25.614
line, you end off at infinity.
What is the effect with our

00:40:25.614 --> 00:40:30.771
war-like governors fighting for
the tourist trade willing to

00:40:30.771 --> 00:40:35.929
spend any amounts of money to
match and overmatch what their

00:40:35.929 --> 00:40:41.000
competitor in the nearby state
is spending?

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.361
The answer is,
they all lose.

00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:48.674
Since it is mostly this section
of the diagram that makes sense,

00:40:48.674 --> 00:40:53.903
what happens is they end up all
spending an infinity of dollars

00:40:53.903 --> 00:40:58.204
and nobody gets any more
tourists than anybody else.

00:40:58.204 --> 00:41:02.000
So this is a model of what not
to do.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.931
I have one more model to show
you.

00:41:05.931 --> 00:41:11.293
Maybe we better start over at
this board here.

00:41:11.293 --> 00:41:17.131
Massachusetts on top.
New Hampshire on the bottom.

00:41:17.131 --> 00:41:23.327
x prime is going to be,
that is Massachusetts,

00:41:23.327 --> 00:41:30.000
I guess as before.
Let me get the numbers right.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.245
Leave that out for a moment.
y prime is 2x minus 3y.

00:41:50.245 --> 00:41:54.018
New Hampshire behaves normally.

00:41:54.018 --> 00:41:59.079
It is ready to respond to
anything Massachusetts can put

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:01.250
out.
But by itself,

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:05.267
it really wants to bring its
budget to normal.

00:42:05.267 --> 00:42:09.642
Now, Massachusetts,
we have a Mormon governor now,

00:42:09.642 --> 00:42:12.589
I guess.
Imagine instead we have a

00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:16.785
Buddhist governor.
A Buddhist governor reacts as

00:42:16.785 --> 00:42:20.089
follows, minus y.
What does that mean?

00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:25.625
It means that when he sees New
Hampshire increasing the budget,

00:42:25.625 --> 00:42:30.000
his reaction is,
we will lower ours.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.099
We will show them love.
It looks suicidal,

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:39.400
but what actually happens?
Well, our little program is

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.599
over.
Our matrix a is negative 1,

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:46.099
negative 1, 2,
negative 3.

00:42:46.099 --> 00:42:50.500
The characteristic equations is

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.699
lambda squared plus 4 lambda.

00:42:55.699 --> 00:43:02.597
And now what is the other term?
3 minus negative 2 makes 5.

00:43:02.597 --> 00:43:07.888
This is not going to factor
because I tried it out and I

00:43:07.888 --> 00:43:13.372
know it is not going to factor.
We are going to get lambda

00:43:13.372 --> 00:43:17.797
equals, we will just use the
quadratic formula,

00:43:17.797 --> 00:43:23.473
negative 4 plus or minus the
square root of 16 minus 4 times

00:43:23.473 --> 00:43:28.572
5, that is 16 minus 20 or
negative 4 all divided by 2,

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:31.939
which makes minus 2,
pull out the 4,

00:43:31.939 --> 00:43:35.113
that makes it a 2,
cancels this 2,

00:43:35.113 --> 00:43:40.923
minus 1 inside.
It is minus 2 plus or minus i.

00:43:40.923 --> 00:43:44.049
Complex solutions.

00:43:44.049 --> 00:43:47.476
What are we doing to do about
that?

00:43:47.476 --> 00:43:53.525
Well, you should rejoice when
you get this case and are asked

00:43:53.525 --> 00:43:58.163
to sketch it because,
even if you calculate the

00:43:58.163 --> 00:44:04.212
complex eigenvector and from
that take its real and imaginary

00:44:04.212 --> 00:44:10.160
parts of the complex solution,
in fact, you will not be able

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:15.000
easily to sketch the answer
anyway.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.406
But let me show you what sort
of thing you can get and then I

00:44:18.406 --> 00:44:21.641
am going to wave my hands and
argue a little bit to try to

00:44:21.641 --> 00:44:24.877
indicate what it is that the
solution actually looks like.

00:44:24.877 --> 00:44:28.000
You are going to get something
that looks like --

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.874
A typical real solution is
going to look like this.

00:44:31.874 --> 00:44:36.523
This is going to produce e to
the minus 2t times e 

00:44:36.523 --> 00:44:40.087
to the i t.
e to the minus 2 plus i all

00:44:40.087 --> 00:44:44.271
times t.
This will be our exponential

00:44:44.271 --> 00:44:47.215
factor which is shrinking in
amplitude.

00:44:47.215 --> 00:44:50.469
This is going to give me sines
and cosines.

00:44:50.469 --> 00:44:54.498
When I separate out the
eigenvector into its real and

00:44:54.498 --> 00:44:57.985
imaginary parts,
it is going to look something

00:44:57.985 --> 00:45:02.045
like this.
a1, a2 times cosine t,

00:45:02.045 --> 00:45:05.041
that is from the e to the it

00:45:05.041 --> 00:45:08.474
part.
Then there will be a sine term.

00:45:08.474 --> 00:45:12.566
And all that is going to be
multiplied by the exponential

00:45:12.566 --> 00:45:16.000
factor e to the negative 2t.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.382
That is just one normal mode.
It is going to be c1 times this

00:45:28.382 --> 00:45:34.096
plus c2 times something similar.
It doesn't matter exactly what

00:45:34.096 --> 00:45:37.520
it is because they are all going
to look the same.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.106
Namely, this is a shrinking
amplitude.

00:45:40.106 --> 00:45:42.481
I am not going to worry about
that.

00:45:42.481 --> 00:45:45.626
My real question is,
what does this look like?

00:45:45.626 --> 00:45:48.281
In other words,
as a pair of parametric

00:45:48.281 --> 00:45:52.614
equations, if x is equal to a1
cosine t plus b1 sine t 

00:45:52.614 --> 00:45:56.807
and y is a2
cosine plus b2 sine,

00:45:56.807 --> 00:46:01.000
what does it look like?

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.943
Well, what are its
characteristics?

00:46:03.943 --> 00:46:08.098
In the first place,
as a curve this part of it is

00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:11.388
bounded.
It stays within some large box

00:46:11.388 --> 00:46:16.408
because cosine and sine never
get bigger than one and never

00:46:16.408 --> 00:46:20.044
get smaller than minus one.
It is periodic.

00:46:20.044 --> 00:46:24.026
As t increases to t plus 2pi,

00:46:24.026 --> 00:46:30.000
it comes back to exactly the
same point it was at before.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.571
We have a curve that is
repeating itself periodically,

00:46:38.571 --> 00:46:42.614
it does not go off to infinity.
And here is where I am waving

00:46:42.614 --> 00:46:44.905
my hands.
It satisfies an equation.

00:46:44.905 --> 00:46:49.016
Those of you who like to fool
around with mathematics a little

00:46:49.016 --> 00:46:52.857
bit, it is not difficult to show
this, but it satisfies an

00:46:52.857 --> 00:46:56.765
equation of the form A x squared
plus B y squared plus C xy

00:46:56.765 --> 00:47:00.000
equals D.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.767
All you have to do is figure
out what the coefficients A,

00:47:03.767 --> 00:47:06.795
B, C and D should be.
And the way to do it is,

00:47:06.795 --> 00:47:10.765
if you calculate the square of
x you are going to get cosine

00:47:10.765 --> 00:47:13.726
squared, sine squared and a
cosine sine term.

00:47:13.726 --> 00:47:17.763
You are going to get those same
three terms here and the same

00:47:17.763 --> 00:47:20.589
three terms here.
You just use undetermined

00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:23.549
coefficients,
set up a system of simultaneous

00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:26.510
equations and you will be able
to find the A,

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:31.155
B, C and D that work.
I am looking for a curve that

00:47:31.155 --> 00:47:35.467
is bounded, keeps repeating its
values and that satisfies a

00:47:35.467 --> 00:47:38.441
quadratic equation which looks
like this.

00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:42.529
Well, an earlier generation
would know from high school,

00:47:42.529 --> 00:47:45.131
these curves are all conic
sections.

00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:48.923
The only curves that satisfy
equations like that are

00:47:48.923 --> 00:47:52.491
hyperbola, parabolas,
the conic sections in other

00:47:52.491 --> 00:47:56.134
words, and ellipses.
Circles are a special kind of

00:47:56.134 --> 00:48:00.000
ellipses.
There is a degenerate case.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.045
A pair of lines which can be
considered a degenerate

00:48:04.045 --> 00:48:08.249
hyperbola, if you want.
It is as much a hyperbola as a

00:48:08.249 --> 00:48:11.977
circle, as an ellipse say.
Which of these is it?

00:48:11.977 --> 00:48:16.419
Well, it must be those guys.
Those are the only guys that

00:48:16.419 --> 00:48:20.147
stay bounded and repeat
themselves periodically.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:23.954
The other guys don't do that.
These are ellipses.

00:48:23.954 --> 00:48:28.000
And, therefore,
what do they look like?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.724
Well, they must look like an
ellipse that is trying to be an

00:48:32.724 --> 00:48:37.369
ellipse, but each time it goes
around the point is pulled a

00:48:37.369 --> 00:48:41.373
little closer to the origin.
It must be doing this,

00:48:41.373 --> 00:48:44.817
in other words.
And such a point is called a

00:48:44.817 --> 00:48:47.299
spiral sink.
Again sink because,

00:48:47.299 --> 00:48:51.383
no matter where you start,
you will get a curve that

00:48:51.383 --> 00:48:55.468
spirals into the origin.
Spiral is self-explanatory.

00:48:55.468 --> 00:49:00.032
And the one thing I haven't
told you that you must read is

00:49:00.032 --> 00:49:04.757
how do you know that it goes
around counterclockwise and not

00:49:04.757 --> 00:49:08.612
clockwise?
Read clockwise or

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:12.976
counterclockwise.
I will give you the answer in

00:49:12.976 --> 00:49:16.865
30 seconds, not for this
particular curve.

00:49:16.865 --> 00:49:19.806
That you will have to
calculate.

00:49:19.806 --> 00:49:23.411
All you have to do is put in
somewhere.

00:49:23.411 --> 00:49:28.533
Let's say at the point (1,
0), a single vector from the

00:49:28.533 --> 00:49:32.611
velocity field.
In other words,

00:49:32.611 --> 00:49:37.551
at the point (1,
0), when x is 1 and y is 0 our

00:49:37.551 --> 00:49:40.988
vector is minus 1, 2,

00:49:40.988 --> 00:49:46.251
which is the vector minus 1,
2, it goes like this.

00:49:46.251 --> 00:49:51.192
Therefore, the motion must be
counterclockwise.

00:49:51.192 --> 00:49:56.133
And, by the way,
what is the effect of having a

00:49:56.133 --> 00:50:00.000
Buddhist governor?
Peace.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.871
Everything spirals into the
origin and everybody is left

00:50:05.871 --> 00:50:10.996
with the same advertising budget
they always had.

00:50:10.996 --> 00:50:11.996
Thanks.
