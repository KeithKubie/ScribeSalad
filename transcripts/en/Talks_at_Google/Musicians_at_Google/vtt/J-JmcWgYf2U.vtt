[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:12.550
TOM MORELLO: Hello.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.050
What's up?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.460
Thanks for having me.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.169
Is this thing on?

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:16.043
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes.

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:16.820
Thanks for coming.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.980
TOM MORELLO: My pleasure.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.810
DORINA ARELLANO: So
I wanted to start

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.700
by talking about you
being a guitarist,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.396
because you are one of the best.

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:24.520
You can be humble about it.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.930
It's OK.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.930
TOM MORELLO: Kind of you.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.520
DORINA ARELLANO: And you've
said that the electric guitar is

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.470
a relatively new
instrument on the planet--

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.010
TOM MORELLO: Yeah.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.820
DORINA ARELLANO: --and
that we should not

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.830
assume that the way
it's being played so far

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.290
is the only way that
is acceptable to play.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.010
And as someone who grew up
studying classical music,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.360
when I hear you play, it makes
my brain crazy, in a good way.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.120
All that non-conventional
picking, tapping,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.290
all the guitar effects.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.770
So how have you come up with
such interesting noises?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.390
And how the heck do
you make a guitar

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.305
sound so cool with a pencil?

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.555
TOM MORELLO: Well, I started
playing guitar very late.

00:00:57.555 --> 00:00:58.840
I started playing
at 17 years old

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.430
and I had never heard of
another guitar player that

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.990
made an album that started
that late, with one exception.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.205
That was Robert Johnson.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:06.580
And he had to sell his soul
at the crossroads to do that.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.330
So I didn't want to
have to go that route,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.710
so I thought practice might
be the other alternative.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.530
And the best advice I ever
got as a guitar player was

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.110
from a kid in high school
who was more advanced than I.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.440
And he said, if you want to
improve practice an hour a day

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.790
every day without fail.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.120
And I took that as gospel.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.801
And I found that the
rising tide of my playing

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:29.050
was so noticeable when I did
that, then I bumped it up

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.000
to two hours a day, and
then four hours a day.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.875
And while I was attending
Harvard University,

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.344
I was practicing four hours
a day, 365 days a year.

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:36.760
And over the course
of four years,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.750
maybe missed a day or two, due
to like traveling or something

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.270
like that.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.480
So if I had studied till 1:00 AM
with an exam the next morning,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.790
I would practice till
5:00, not till 4:58.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.002
Now, this is indicative of an
obsessive compulsive disorder,

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:52.960
you might be gathering.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.550
And you'd be correct about that.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.210
But all that did was amass a
certain amount of technique

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.231
and ability that caught me up to
some other guitar players who,

00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:03.480
at the time, were my heroes,
like the Eddie Van Halens

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.756
and Randy Rhoadses who had
a great deal of technique.

00:02:05.756 --> 00:02:07.630
I didn't have my own
voice on the instrument.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.713
It was around the time of
Rage Against the Machine

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:12.460
where I self-identified
as the DJ in the band

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.720
and began looking at the
guitar in a deconstructed way.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.290
And that it is just
a piece of wood

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.250
with six wires and
a few electronics

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.520
that can be manipulated
in any number of ways,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.994
and that could create sounds.

00:02:23.994 --> 00:02:26.410
And then those sounds, even
though they're unconventional,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.826
can be used as the
building blocks

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:29.530
for writing songs
and guitar solos.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.905
So then that's when I began
practicing eight hours a day.

00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:35.830
It was the eccentricities in my
playing and the unusual stuff.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.710
And rather than trying to
cop Chuck Berry or Keith

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.560
Richards or Eddie Van
Halen, I would just

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.120
try to play different sounds.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.110
And whether it was the
background music of a Public

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.260
Enemy song, or the
scratching of a DJ,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.800
or a lawnmower outside,
or a helicopter overhead.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.315
And just by trying it-- when you
practice that stuff, it just--

00:02:58.315 --> 00:03:00.320
you may not be able to
sound like a lawnmower

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.540
or a helicopter,
but you're not going

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.748
to sound like Chuck Berry
or Eddie Van Halen anymore.

00:03:03.748 --> 00:03:08.162
And so once the blinders came
off, then I had my own lane.

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:10.120
And I really felt like
I had found my own voice

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.467
on the instrument and the
horizons were pretty endless.

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.050
DORINA ARELLANO: So
what you're saying

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.370
is you have to work really hard.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.960
TOM MORELLO: Well, I mean,
there was the work part

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.100
and there was the
inspiration part.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.440
Like the work part sort of
made my fingers be able to go

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.940
where I wanted them to go.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.349
But it was the
revelation that I did--

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.140
there was a specific
moment-- my crossroads

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.180
was at a gig in the
San Fernando Valley.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.695
And Rage, in the
earliest days, we

00:03:32.695 --> 00:03:34.540
were opening up for
two cover bands.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.140
And in these cover bands--

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.960
in each of the cover
bands there was

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.501
like a really
shredding guitar player

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.862
who had tremendous
facility on the instrument.

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:42.945
And I thought-- I was
watching them at sound check

00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:45.970
and I thought, if there's
two shredding guitar

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.639
players at this lousy gig in
the valley, like on a Wednesday,

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.930
there doesn't need to be three.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.880
And so I need--

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.680
Like I need to figure out
something that's my own to do.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.086
And that's when I started
practicing other stuff.

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:58.960
DORINA ARELLANO: So you
mentioned your guitar

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.035
influences.

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:02.160
Randy Rhoads, I guess you
named your son after him.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.576
TOM MORELLO: Yeah,
Rhoads Morello.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.270
The reason why--

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.020
Randy Rhoads was the guitar
player for Ozzie Osbourne,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.960
for those of you who don't know.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.770
But you sort of think it's
like a heavy metal thing.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.540
But he's a classically
trained player

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.640
who-- he self-identified as a
musician first and as a rock

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.400
star second.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.450
That very much appealed to me.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.600
I grew up on like
suburban heavy metal where

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.330
the themes of the music
were often either groupies

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.832
or the devil, none of which was
present in my mom's basement

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:26.790
where I was practicing.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.450
[LAUGHS] And so the
poster that was on my wall

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.580
was Randy Rhoads.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.510
On days off from the
Ozzie Osbourne tour--

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.880
they'd be playing
arenas and stadiums,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.320
but on days off, he'd take
classical guitar lessons

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.570
in whatever city they were in.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.310
And I really liked that kind of
dedication to the instrument.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.290
And that was my
aspiration as well.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.790
DORINA ARELLANO: I
actually was just

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.150
seeing a video on YouTube,
obviously, of Ozzie

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.920
listening to the isolated
guitar solo from Crazy Train.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.347
And unless you're
not human, you have

00:04:58.347 --> 00:04:59.680
to get chills listening to that.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.184
It's insane.

00:05:00.184 --> 00:05:01.850
TOM MORELLO: It's
like it's a very emo--

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.266
the person had a
lot of technique,

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:06.010
but also with a classical
tangent and then a deeply sort

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.384
of emotional and kick-ass way.

00:05:07.384 --> 00:05:09.550
DORINA ARELLANO: So powerful,
so precise, like fast.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.930
It's crazy.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.380
So you mentioned that Randy
actually identified himself

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.910
as a musician first.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.180
And as much as I appreciate
good musicianship,

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.420
I grew up as a
cellist and I am sad

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.100
that I never got to jump on
stage, like AC/DC or Kiss

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.860
or whatever.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.042
So what do you think
makes a good musician?

00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:32.750
And what makes you
want to jump on stage?

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.000
TOM MORELLO: I can tell you
about my first stage jump.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.475
Well, first gig I ever had, I
went to a small Illinois town.

00:05:38.475 --> 00:05:40.350
And there were three
bands at my high school.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.720
One of them was Destiny.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.190
And they were beautiful men
who played beautiful music

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.940
and they were adored
by the entire school.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.330
They were kind of like
the Beatles of the school.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.140
Their dating lives were insane.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.080
Then there was Epitaph.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.740
And they were much too mean to
play at a high school dance.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.560
And they like covered
Sabbath and AC/DC.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.160
And you avoided them
in the hallways,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.800
but admired them greatly.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.925
[LAUGHS]

00:06:01.925 --> 00:06:03.050
And then there was my band.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.210
My band was the drama
club oriented band.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.010
And it was called
The Electric Sheep.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.157
And we didn't have the ability
to play other people's songs,

00:06:10.157 --> 00:06:11.240
so we wrote our own music.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.907
Now bizarrely, one of
the members of that band

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:15.740
is a fellow by name of
Adam Jones, who later

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.120
surfaced in a band called Tool.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.120
We were in the same high
school band together.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.304
But so our first gig, we
had auditioned for a show.

00:06:22.304 --> 00:06:23.720
And we had to learn
the song "Born

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.130
to be Wild," which took us
four months to learn it very,

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.260
very poorly.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.570
But we were in competition
with Destiny this night.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.760
And they had succeeded in
their earlier performance.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.840
So they rolled us out.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.690
And they played like a Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.010
song, of course.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.840
So we were on a riser.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.630
And the keyboard player
came in with the wrong chord

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.380
to begin the song.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.707
Then the bass player, Adam--

00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:45.290
who is a tremendous
musician now-- but

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.970
he came in with the
wrong note on the bass.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.303
And things were not going great.

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:50.540
So I had like one
trick up my sleeve

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.250
and I could jump super high.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.620
So I like leapt off
the riser and the roof

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.830
came off the place.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.406
And it made me realize
that perhaps there's

00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:00.530
more to rock and roll than
playing the right notes.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.430
Perhaps you have to be inhabited
by the Holy Spirit of Rock

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.250
and Roll, which I felt that
maybe I had some of that in me.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.060
And maybe that would be
my course moving forward.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.630
DORINA ARELLANO: That's great.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.800
So your new album, "The Atlas
Underground," just came out.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.060
Congratulations.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.660
TOM MORELLO: Thank
you very much.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.159
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.300
DORINA ARELLANO: Yay.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.660
So I was actually watching
one of your new music videos

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.620
on YouTube.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.590
And the first comment was
a very excited, all caps,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.270
EXPLICIT, which is basically
how I felt when I first

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.950
heard some of the new album.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.330
Because there's so much--

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.130
there's all this genre
mixing going around.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.430
You've got like EDM and hip
hop and guitar rock, obviously.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.400
And so was that one of
your goals with the album,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.140
to get people to listen
to kinds of music

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.000
that they don't
normally listen to?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.791
TOM MORELLO: The goal
was a very lofty one.

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.240
And it was to forge a sonic
conspiracy of diverse artists

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.570
to shape a new genre
of rock and roll.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.450
One that combines my
Marshall Stack riff rock

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.390
fury with big EDM drops and some
of the electronic components

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.890
of today.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.020
In a way, a record
that serves as maybe

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:09.620
like a Trojan horse in 2018,
where a lot of young people

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.430
gravitate more towards
Ableton and computer

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.430
composition for music and
less practicing four, six,

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.750
eight hours a day.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.290
And so part of my hope was to
inflict electric guitar playing

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.980
on a new generation, but working
with a really incredible cast

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.010
from Marcus Mumford to
Wu-Tang Clan, from Rise

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.450
Against to Steve Aoki,
Bassnectar, K.Flay, Vic

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.299
Mensa, Knife Party.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.209
There's more-- Pretty Lights.

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:38.500
DORINA ARELLANO: Gary Clark Jr.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.280
TOM MORELLO: Yeah,
a very eclectic mix,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.909
but with the overall
vision of the North Star

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.239
guiding it, being to make a
new kind of rock and roll,

00:08:47.239 --> 00:08:49.280
without compromising at
all on the guitar playing

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.770
or on the political
content, to make music that

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.789
would serve a new generation.

00:08:53.789 --> 00:08:54.830
DORINA ARELLANO: Awesome.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.440
And you mentioned all these
people, amazing artists

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.960
that you collaborated with.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.575
What was the most challenging
collaboration and why?

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:03.950
TOM MORELLO: Well,
there's a song

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.540
called "Every Step
That I Take," which is

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.789
a collaboration with Portugal.

00:09:06.789 --> 00:09:09.680
The Man, and Whethan,
who's a teenage wunderkind

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.727
EDM producer.

00:09:10.727 --> 00:09:13.310
And that song I wrote with Matt
Shultz from Cage the Elephant.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.250
And Matt got very busy,
so it took quite a while

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.060
for that to get a
final mix of that one.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.929
But it's actually the song that
has maybe done the best out

00:09:20.929 --> 00:09:21.470
in the world.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.330
And we're partnering with
a great organization called

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.371
Save, which is a suicide
prevention organization,

00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:26.300
on the song.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.940
And my good friend Chris Cornell
passed about a year and a half

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.440
ago.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.460
So it was very important
to get this song right

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.530
and to make this song
one that would sort of be

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.827
a fitting eulogy for him and
to provide material support

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.160
for people who are suffering
from depression or suicidal

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.120
thoughts.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.036
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:44.540
And a lot of us have or
are currently suffering

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.940
from mental illness issues.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.380
And it's nice to
see people trying

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.450
to work to demystify that and
encourage people to get help.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.250
So you're working with Save.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.140
What exactly are you
hoping to do with them?

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.390
TOM MORELLO: Yeah, I mean,
part of it is the demystify

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.250
and taking the stigma
away from mental--

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.720
like if you break
your arm, you go

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.694
to the doctor to set the arm.

00:10:04.694 --> 00:10:06.360
But if there's something
wrong in your--

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.230
something doesn't feel
right in your mind,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.610
often even bringing it up--

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.270
the people of my parents'
generation were so--

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.595
there was a lot of depression
and things like that.

00:10:16.595 --> 00:10:18.470
They would never touch
it with a 10-foot pole

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.449
to try to seek help.

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:21.740
But now hopefully, if there's
any silver lining to some

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.994
of the passings that have
happened both in people's lives

00:10:25.994 --> 00:10:27.410
and in the
entertainment industry,

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.910
it can be to sort
of demystify that.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.020
There is help.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.840
And whether it's friends, loved
ones, or professional help,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.220
or this great
organization, Save,

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.370
you can reach out to
for help at any time.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.870
DORINA ARELLANO: And so this
song became a tribute to Chris.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.119
TOM MORELLO: It was not
written as a tribute to Chris,

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:43.030
but it's been--

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.320
it's kind of pushing
it forward as a way

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.680
to make suicide
awareness something that

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.380
is at the forefront
of this record.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.980
DORINA ARELLANO:
Just him as a talent,

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.290
can you tell us what you
learned from working with him?

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.040
TOM MORELLO: Sure.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.360
I mean, Chris Cornell was a--

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.050
well, the thing that I learned,
in retrospect now that he's

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.340
passed, is that he was--

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.815
as a singer of Soundgarden,
and Audioslave, and then

00:11:03.815 --> 00:11:08.960
his solo career, he had
deep, dark, personal demons,

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.080
but he managed to
harness them for 52 years

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.830
to make some of the
greatest rock and roll

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.910
that ever was made.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.940
And so just kind of watching
that process was one to-- it

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.580
was awesome to stand next
to his rock godly self

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.180
with his incredible voice
and his incredible hair.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.460
It's like his all vibe,
which is so perfect.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.187
And like, you're blessed, son.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:29.270
But just to be in a band--

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.320
and also, his effortless
composition of melody.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.110
Like you give him anything, give
him a complicated heavy riff

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.077
or a simple two-chord
chord progression,

00:11:38.077 --> 00:11:39.660
he could make it
flower into something

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.200
that was really beautiful.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.240
DORINA ARELLANO: Are
there any other artists

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.740
that you haven't worked
with that you would

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:46.850
hope to work in the future?

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:47.600
TOM MORELLO: Yeah,
I'm actually sort

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.530
have already started on part
two of this "Atlas Underground."

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:50.660
There's about half
a record done.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.010
I don't want to give
any of the names

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.301
away because it's not done yet.

00:11:53.301 --> 00:11:57.290
But yeah, I love the idea
of challenging myself

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.250
as a guitarist and as an artist
to get outside of my safety

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:00.750
zone.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.990
And the thing about
this record that--

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.910
there's two ways to
make great music.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:08.660
One is a collaborative
effort with a band, where

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.640
chemistry is what's important.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.652
And together, you're able to,
through your combined efforts,

00:12:13.652 --> 00:12:15.860
create something that none
of you could create alone.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.560
That's one way.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.821
The other way is purity
of like a solo record,

00:12:19.821 --> 00:12:20.820
where you have a vision.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.444
Imagine sort of the
early Dylan records

00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:24.440
or Bruce Springsteen,
where there's a unified--

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.760
like it's one person's
vision that is fulfilled,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.040
and it's undiluted
from the outside.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.760
What I tried is to get the best
of both worlds on this record,

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.867
where it's a--

00:12:32.867 --> 00:12:34.950
on this record, I'm a
guitarist, I'm a songwriter,

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.530
I'm the curator,
first and foremost--

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:41.390
is to following both a
thematic and musical vision.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.380
But getting the benefit
of the crossover

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:47.300
collaboration on
each of the tracks.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.800
Every one of the 12 tracks
has at least one collaborator

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.300
on it.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.580
And allowing that
chemistry to flower in ways

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.839
that were very unexpected to me.

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:56.880
DORINA ARELLANO: So no
spoilers yet for part two?

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.463
TOM MORELLO: No
spoilers for part two,

00:12:58.463 --> 00:13:01.020
but there's some good metal
and some very surprising stuff

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.160
on it.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.510
DORINA ARELLANO: So I
wanted to ask about how

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.110
music may be changing.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.980
It's always evolving.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.330
And when I see companies
like Gibson Guitars,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.130
for example, going
bankrupt, do you

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:19.230
think that that means that
composers are moving away

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.660
from guitar and other
classic instruments

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.107
and kind of moving towards
computers, in a sense, or so?

00:13:25.107 --> 00:13:26.190
TOM MORELLO: I would say--

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:26.740
DORINA ARELLANO: Because
that's what's happening.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.260
TOM MORELLO: Yeah, almost
obviously, that's the case.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:28.650
DORINA ARELLANO: So
that's why you're trying

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.340
to bring back the guitar?

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:29.700
TOM MORELLO: All
you have to look

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.980
is like the Spotify
charts and all that.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.950
And you have to look really
hard to find anything that has

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.384
any guitar in it whatsoever.

00:13:36.384 --> 00:13:38.550
I think that my theory is
that it may have something

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.500
to do with the way people
listen to music now.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.390
And a lot of music is
listened to on a laptop

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.110
or on a phone, where two musical
elements don't sound great.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.500
One is like distorted
guitar, and the other

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.830
is like open high hat.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.480
So there's sort of
a tinny quality.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.660
A fella in one of my
bands has teenage sons

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.330
who despise the rich
catalog of music

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.460
of Rage Against the
Machine and Audioslave.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:08.700
And they have a
scathing review of it

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.860
that has caused me
endless sleepless nights.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.250
They describe the music--

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.360
compared to the
music they listen to,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.485
they describe the music of
Rage Against the Machine

00:14:17.485 --> 00:14:18.895
and Audioslave as small music.

00:14:18.895 --> 00:14:20.230
[OOHS FROM AUDIENCE]

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.880
Yeah.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.320
And if you don't
understand that,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.210
it means you're
of a certain age.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.550
And if you do, you're like,
I see what they're saying.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.470
But it is very interesting.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.170
The way that music is delivered
to them, like on their phone,

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.850
Cardi B sounds huge.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.430
But perhaps, the
"Evil Empire" record,

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.839
which was recorded
in a room 1/10

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:39.630
the size of the one
we're in now with a lot

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.041
of shimmery overhead,
maybe sounds different.

00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:44.790
But anyway, like I
said, with this record,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.290
I'm trying to take
elements of 2018,

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.120
but infuse them with a direct
injection of rock and roll

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.319
guitar playing to take back--

00:14:53.319 --> 00:14:54.610
take the power back, literally.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.220
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.420
Yes.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.486
Thank you.

00:14:58.486 --> 00:15:01.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.090
And I mean, how
does that translate

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.080
to live performance, right?

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.400
Because I know you kind of had a
sort of art installation type--

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.330
TOM MORELLO: Yeah.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.330
Right now, I'm doing sort
of a promo tour, which

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.204
is kind of a glorified
listening party where

00:15:16.204 --> 00:15:17.620
we listen to the
record and then I

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.050
do some guitar demonstrations.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.980
But in 2019, we're
putting together a tour

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.450
for the "Atlas
Underground," which

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.940
on a record that has
Wu-Tang Clan and Rise

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.100
Against and Marcus
Mumford, it's unlikely

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.560
that all 20 collaborators
will be at every show.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.950
So the glass half full way
of looking at it is let's

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.890
make a show where you
will not miss any of them

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.590
by having the show be so
different and challenging

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.400
and immersive.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.770
And so Sean Evans, who's
the artistic director

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.800
for Roger Waters, "The Wall,"
and the Us and Them Tours,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.650
we're putting together a show--

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:52.010
it's part art installation,
part presentation of music

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.090
that will have both a
lot of guitar shredding,

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.476
but a lot of ideas in it
that will make it a really

00:15:56.476 --> 00:15:58.850
fulfilling evening, even if
all the collaborators are not

00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.350
present.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.410
DORINA ARELLANO: Cool.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:01.080
TOM MORELLO: Something
to look forward to.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.330
DORINA ARELLANO:
Sounds exciting.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.100
So you posted a photo on your
Instagram of your hand surgery,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.180
which looked gross and
awesome at the same time.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.200
TOM MORELLO: [LAUGHS]

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.610
DORINA ARELLANO: Did you
injure yourself playing,

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.160
and is there anything
inside your hand now?

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.451
TOM MORELLO: We'll just say
it was a vacation accident.

00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.576
That's as much as I'm
willing to divulge.

00:16:19.576 --> 00:16:21.200
But no, but modern
medicine is no joke.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.980
Like I fractured the fourth
metacarpal on this hand,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.520
which is of all the guitar
playing fingers, probably

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.070
the third most
important one, right?

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:33.290
And I broke in on a Thursday.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.890
I had surgery on a
Saturday and played a show

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.280
in Stockholm, a 90-minute
set, on Tuesday.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.090
So they just put a big old
titanium plate in there,

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.120
nailed it together.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.230
And the doctor-- I literally
have a fist full of steel.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.630
Like Wolverine or
something like--

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.350
It's really-- it's
like a Wolverine claw.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.900
DORINA ARELLANO:
Adamantium, yeah.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.000
TOM MORELLO: Yeah, adamantium,
thank you very much.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.208
DORINA ARELLANO: Sorry, nerd.

00:16:57.208 --> 00:16:59.110
TOM MORELLO: No, I
respect nerd-dom.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.650
Boom, there we go.

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:06.780
Yeah, I'm of the Trek
village myself, so don't--

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.460
but no, it was pretty amazing.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.187
And the doctor just
said, if you can--

00:17:11.187 --> 00:17:12.770
you're not going to
hurt it any worse.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.603
I'm going to nail that
thing together tight.

00:17:14.603 --> 00:17:16.183
If you can withstand
the discomfort,

00:17:16.183 --> 00:17:17.099
it's going to be fine.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:19.490
And one thing I do have
is a good deal of will,

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:20.869
so the shows went pretty well.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.550
The one thing I had to keep
reminding my bandmates,

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.008
because the shows
went so smoothly,

00:17:24.008 --> 00:17:27.020
was what a hero I was that we
all didn't cancel the tour.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.540
I have a broken hand and we're
playing today, all right?

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.512
[LAUGHS] I know it
looks effortless.

00:17:31.512 --> 00:17:33.470
DORINA ARELLANO: So your
hand's more metal now.

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.261
TOM MORELLO: It is.

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:36.000
I am more-- I was
metal to begin with,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.050
but I am much more metal
now than ever before.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.860
DORINA ARELLANO: So if
you had to pick one--

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.259
Eddie Van Halen, Randy
Rhoads, or someone else?

00:17:45.259 --> 00:17:46.550
TOM MORELLO: --or someone else.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.970
I mean, my guy is, like for the
reason stated, is Randy Rhoads.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.382
Like he just had that--

00:17:51.382 --> 00:17:53.840
there was like an intelligence
to his playing and a passion

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.140
to his playing that's
kind of my number one.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.740
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.210
So with "Atlas
Underground," you seem

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.770
to be kind of pushing the
boundaries of what music can be

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.410
and what we're used
to listening to.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.360
Are you hoping to
make a larger point

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.205
about how we maybe change
the status quo in society,

00:18:17.205 --> 00:18:18.080
as how we see people?

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.430
It's like then it's
OK to be different.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.870
TOM MORELLO: Sure.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:20.370
Sure.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:23.090
I mean, this record has
artists of diverse genres,

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.119
diverse ethnicities, diverse
ages, and diverse genders.

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.785
And that in and of
itself is a statement

00:18:27.785 --> 00:18:29.720
in these very divisive times.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.200
Also, the thematic thread
that runs through the record

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.300
is social justice ghost stories.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.320
And the idea that the heroes and
martyrs and fallen of the past

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.960
can inform the
struggles of the present

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.510
and hopefully light a
beacon towards a more

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:49.964
just and humane future by
giving voice to the voiceless.

00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:52.380
DORINA ARELLANO: I actually
have a question from a Googler

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.820
that couldn't be here.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.790
He wants to know, what was a
bigger moment for you, the Cubs

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.354
World Series victory or
playing with Springsteen?

00:18:59.354 --> 00:19:01.770
TOM MORELLO: Those are two
pretty hot moments right there.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.190
I was equally nervous
for both, frankly.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.500
I'd have to say, I
love my man The Boss,

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.560
but the Cubs thing is one
that I never thought I'd get.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.640
That was sweet.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.140
[LAUGHS] Though I was super--

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.140
like Bruce Springsteen
and I, we played together

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.370
over the course of six years.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.230
And we'd been friends
for years before that.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:25.380
But he's unique among my
friends in that I subscribe

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.450
to two fanzines about him.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:29.490
And once chased him
down Sunset Boulevard

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:30.690
trying to kiss his head.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.810
So that's like a
different lane of peer.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.946
But playing with Bruce for
the first time in 2008,

00:19:36.946 --> 00:19:39.570
I don't get nervous for much in
music anymore, but I was just--

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.280
I'm a huge Bruce
Springsteen fan.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.040
And the idea of being on
stage with the E Street Band

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.856
in front of people,
and playing the song,

00:19:45.856 --> 00:19:48.480
like with me singing with Bruce
Springsteen and playing guitar,

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.390
it was pretty crazy.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.800
And there was a bit of a drama
on that particular night,

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.965
much like game 7 of
the 2016 World Series.

00:19:55.965 --> 00:20:00.072
[LAUGHS] The end result was
in doubt in both of those.

00:20:00.072 --> 00:20:02.280
Bruce had said we're going
to do "Ghost of Tom Joad."

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.590
So I learned-- he said, learn
it acoustic and electric.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.580
So I learned the version
from his acoustic record

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.810
and was ready to play it,
felt pretty good about it.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.490
And I heard the band rehearsing
upstairs at the Anaheim Pond

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.790
as it was called then.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:15.767
And they had changed--

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:17.350
Bruce had changed
the key of the song.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.000
He raised the key
about eight steps.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.820
So now it was out of my rich,
milk chocolate, baritone frame.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.639
And also, I couldn't
transpose the chords.

00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:28.680
And I had to play with
the band in three minutes.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.470
And I had to now transpose it.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.220
And that's not my forte.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.460
And so I was really nervous.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.220
So I walked up there and
we're going through the song,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.090
and I am fumbling.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.960
I am fumbling.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.210
I can't play the chords right.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.126
I'm not hitting notes.

00:20:40.126 --> 00:20:43.050
And little Steven, who's
his consigliere in the band,

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.850
and a very nice fellow, he
recognizes that I'm distraught.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.390
He's like baby, baby, it's
going to be fine, baby.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.550
I'm like, baby, it's not fine.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.310
There's nothing fine
about baby right now.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.675
Baby is super anxious.

00:20:54.675 --> 00:20:57.300
So Bruce Springsteen, they don't
call him the boss for nothing.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.802
He recognizes what's
going on, my anxiety.

00:20:59.802 --> 00:21:02.010
He puts his hand on my
shoulder, looks me in the eyes

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.944
and says, Tommy--

00:21:03.944 --> 00:21:05.610
first of all, Bruce
Springsteen calls me

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.650
Tommy, which is so dope.

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.650
Tommy, we're going
to do it in this key

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.160
and it's going to be great.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.952
I said, well, that's easy
for you to say Obi-Wan, but--

00:21:16.952 --> 00:21:18.549
[LAUGHS]

00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:20.340
But at the end of the
day, I thought, well,

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.800
can I sing a song
of social justice?

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.574
Yes, I can.

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:24.990
Can I play a
kick-ass guitar solo?

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.489
Yes, I can.

00:21:25.489 --> 00:21:27.000
Are there 14 people
in the E Street

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.080
Band who already
know the chords?

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.770
Yes, there are.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.519
So I'm not going to
worry about that part.

00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:32.550
So I went downstairs,
made my way through half

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.640
a bottle of Jameson, came up and
we blew the roof off the place.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.322
[LAUGHS] And Obi-Wan was right.

00:21:37.322 --> 00:21:39.030
We played in that key
and it did turn out

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.356
great the end of the day.

00:21:40.356 --> 00:21:42.870
DORINA ARELLANO: Obi-Bruce.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.972
So Rage is nominated for the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.180
TOM MORELLO: So they tell me.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.346
DORINA ARELLANO: And I
worked in the music industry,

00:21:50.346 --> 00:21:52.870
and I still don't
know how it works.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.780
And you're on the
committee, so can you

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.100
explain to us how it works?

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.420
And did you nominate yourself?

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.700
TOM MORELLO: [LAUGHS]
First of all,

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.370
much like when they
choose the Pope,

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.160
there's no divulging how it
actually works in the room.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.730
But there's a
committee that fights

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.352
passionately for the artists
that they put forward.

00:22:12.352 --> 00:22:14.310
I did not put forward
Rage Against the Machine,

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.610
but I was pleased
that someone else did.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:18.900
And then you fight for--

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.954
you advocate for yours.

00:22:19.954 --> 00:22:21.120
And there's a lot of voting.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.480
And it's like a sort of
Byzantine voting scheme,

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.327
that eventually we wind up with
a ballot of 15 names, which

00:22:27.327 --> 00:22:29.160
is the one that was
announced the other day.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.780
And then it goes to a wider
votership of about 800 or 900.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.940
And then five or six get in.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.900
The thing that's great about
the Rock-- first of all,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.670
I was an opponent of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.500
As a kid, I grew up
playing baseball.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.440
And when you're in your
first year of t-ball,

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.780
you dream of one day
having a career that

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.270
would be great enough that
you could enter the Baseball

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.020
Hall of Fame.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.484
And as a guitar player,
as a rock guitar player,

00:22:55.484 --> 00:22:57.150
I thought the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.241
didn't have any of my
favorite bands in it.

00:22:59.241 --> 00:23:00.740
Like why would I
want to be in that?

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.640
It doesn't have
anybody I like in it.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.259
So Jon Landau, who's Bruce
Springsteen's manager,

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:07.050
and I spent a lot of
time on tour with him,

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.900
I relentlessly pounded him
about how the Rock and Roll

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.050
Hall of Fame stunk.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.670
And I'm like, it
doesn't represent

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.780
an entire genre of music.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.450
And to his credit,
he heard my pleas

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.609
and he let me in the room.

00:23:19.609 --> 00:23:21.900
And since then, a number of
bands, including Stevie Ray

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.310
Vaughan and Rush
and Kiss that were

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.900
very deserving of being in
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:25.410
have gotten in.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.850
And others have been nominated,
like Judas Priest and whatever.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:29.700
But anyway, it's taken a
step in the right direction.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.590
And now I think that
anybody who does pick up

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.560
a guitar with aspirations
of being a rock guitarist

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.909
can be proud to be
nominated for the Rock Hall.

00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:38.950
DORINA ARELLANO: And I
mean, it's similar to the,

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.980
I guess, any sort of music
award show, like the Grammys.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.700
Like they don't seem to
nominate a lot of metal bands.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.380
And I'm a metal fan.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.910
So thank you for doing that.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.670
TOM MORELLO: I'm doing my best.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.650
DORINA ARELLANO: Can you think
about your best and worst

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.100
performances?

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.570
TOM MORELLO: Sure.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.910
The worst performance is
pretty-- there's been a few--

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.480
but the worse performance
comes to mind immediately.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.384
Rage Against the Machine was
ascendant in 1993 or '94.

00:24:09.384 --> 00:24:11.550
And we were playing the
Reading Festival in England.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.224
It was our first time
jumping from club shows to--

00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:15.140
we weren't headlining.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.350
We were playing later in the
day in front of 60,000 people.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.450
And our music in England at
the time was like on fire.

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.390
And so there was a great
deal of expectation.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:29.420
And I'd worked out a new
guitar redefining trick

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.420
on the guitar, where I take
out the jack of the guitar

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.577
and then I tap it to
the metal on the guitar

00:24:34.577 --> 00:24:35.660
and it makes like a noise.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.410
And then I manipulate it.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.270
And it's like minds
are going to be blown.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:39.850
And our Reading
performance is going

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.410
to be broadcast, not just
all over England, but all

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:42.950
over Europe.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.569
It's like the Rage Against
the Machine hour, right?

00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:47.360
And I'm ready for my
moment during the solo

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.470
in "Bullet in the Head."

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.900
And the TV camera zooms
in and I unplug the jack.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.990
Now, what I don't realize
is that the power--

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.660
what makes an amp--
it's some grounding

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.570
that makes the steel jack
go [BUZZ NOISE] like this.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.590
But the power in England
is different than the power

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.540
in the United States.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.692
So while I've been blowing minds
all over the United States--

00:25:08.692 --> 00:25:10.400
there was no sound
check for these shows.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.570
You just show up and play.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:14.510
So with cocky confidence, I
walk to the front of the stage

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.860
as the camera zooms in for
my heroic guitar redefining

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.430
moment.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.738
I unplug the jack, I touch
it to the thing, it goes ptt.

00:25:22.738 --> 00:25:25.233
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:26.842
Ptt.

00:25:26.842 --> 00:25:29.300
The camera is getting closer,
like maybe it's still coming.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:29.927
I'm like ptt.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.100
And then I just sheepishly
plug the guitar back in, take

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.615
a few steps back, and play a
couple of Chuck Berry licks.

00:25:40.615 --> 00:25:44.510
[LAUGHS] That wasn't my best--
that wasn't the best one.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.640
That wasn't the best one.

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.487
I've had a lot of really,
really great moments on stage.

00:25:49.487 --> 00:25:51.570
One of them was like when
Rage Against the Machine

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.290
played in Finsbury Park in 2010.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.320
Somehow there had been
this Facebook campaign

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.110
to make a 17-year-old Rage
Against the Machine song number

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.857
one on the pop charts.

00:26:01.857 --> 00:26:03.690
It was up against Simon
Cowell's "X Factor."

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.648
I won't go into detail.

00:26:04.648 --> 00:26:06.290
But it's like every
year at Christmas,

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:09.290
the "X Factor" in England,
Simon Cowell's show,

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:10.340
has the number one song.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.580
And in England it matters.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.130
They gamble on the
number one song

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.588
like they do on
the Kentucky Derby.

00:26:14.588 --> 00:26:15.470
It's a huge deal.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.270
And everyone on
Christmas morning

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.280
sits down and listens
to the top 10.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.290
And the number one
is celebrated wildly.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.270
And every year for the
last five or six years,

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.970
it had been the
winner of the TV show

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.820
"The X Factor" sang some
syrupy, horrible song.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.590
And that was guaranteed
to be the number

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.006
one because it was
promoted widely

00:26:32.006 --> 00:26:33.190
by Sony and everything else.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.860
So a couple in suburban
London was sick of it

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.789
and they started a
Facebook campaign

00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:40.580
to make Rage Against
the Machine's "Killing

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:42.710
in the Name," to
put that forward,

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:48.890
a 17-year-old song with 16 FU's
and one mother flipper in it.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:53.090
And without the band's
involvement in any way,

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:57.080
soon the Facebook campaign
had 500,000 people on it.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:57.747
And it was huge.

00:26:57.747 --> 00:27:00.080
And we were just going about
our lives, kind of not even

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:00.870
being a band.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.720
And we heard about
it and we decided

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.470
to get involved at
the last minute.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.910
And we played-- we
were on whatever

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.620
the "Good Morning
America" of Britain was.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.380
And they said, whatever you
do, when you perform the song,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.910
don't do the cussing part.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:17.720
And we thought, the cussing
part of the song is fuck you,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.887
I won't do what you tell me.

00:27:20.887 --> 00:27:23.869
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:31.960
So sure, we won't do it.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.506
So like the "Good
Morning America,"

00:27:33.506 --> 00:27:35.380
it's the big special
for the Christmas thing.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.797
And we go on and
we play the song.

00:27:36.797 --> 00:27:38.921
And there's like-- I don't
know if you're familiar.

00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:40.505
It was sort of like
the quiet fuck you

00:27:40.505 --> 00:27:42.087
part, which is like
kind of whispered,

00:27:42.087 --> 00:27:43.420
and then the big fuck you part.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.160
And so the quiet part,
Zach doesn't do it at all.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.110
And the sensors
are like relaxing.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:51.494
And then it comes, he just
tells England, fuck you,

00:27:51.494 --> 00:27:52.660
I won't do what you tell me.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.454
And of course, that
helped spike sales.

00:27:56.454 --> 00:28:01.740
[LAUGHS] And we had the
number one pop single.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:05.140
It was the most downloads in a
week in the history of the UK.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.210
And we defeated the--

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:08.710
one of things we promised to
the fans there was if we did

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.920
have the number one song,
we would play a free concert

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.240
for all of England.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.320
So they wouldn't let
us in the nicer parks

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:21.850
around London, [LAUGHS] because
it was a bit of a reputation.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.480
And so Finsbury Park
is where we had it.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.870
It was cordoned off for 45,000.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.276
Another 45,000 jumped the fence.

00:28:28.276 --> 00:28:29.650
There were almost
100,000 people.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:30.567
We played a free show.

00:28:30.567 --> 00:28:32.900
And we finished the night
playing "Killing in the Name."

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.840
And it was just like
a beautiful night of--

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.480
it really was like the
manifestation of the band's

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.387
ideals came to fruition.

00:28:39.387 --> 00:28:40.720
It was not the band that did it.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.140
It was fans that really
took the power back in a way

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.600
that-- in some ways, it's
just a number one single.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.267
But it demonstrated that by
standing up in your place

00:28:50.267 --> 00:28:51.850
and time for something
you believe in,

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.189
you can overcome great odds.

00:28:54.189 --> 00:28:55.480
DORINA ARELLANO: That is great.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.420
Thank you so much
for sharing that.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:58.150
So good.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.350
So I'm going to ask
you one more question,

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.560
but then we're going to
open up audience questions.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.880
So please think
of some good ones.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.570
Don't embarrass us.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:15.880
So you mentioned you're
doing a sort of part two.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.760
Is this-- are you doing another
album that you're collaborating

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:18.910
or what's in the future for you?

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.285
TOM MORELLO: Yeah,
another record

00:29:20.285 --> 00:29:23.410
of diverse collaborations
that continues

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:28.870
to try to push my guitar playing
and musical artistry further.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.540
In the same genre
of taking artists

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:35.050
that I admire in unusual
combinations and making music

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.780
that's very challenging and
exciting, but is guitar-based.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:38.890
DORINA ARELLANO: Cool.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.330
Looking forward to it.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.930
So who wants to go first?

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.410
So we have this--

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.370
hello.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:47.382
Is this is working?

00:29:47.382 --> 00:29:48.822
I'm going to throw this at you.

00:29:48.822 --> 00:29:49.530
What was it, you?

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.905
TOM MORELLO: That is such a
Google invention right there.

00:29:51.905 --> 00:29:55.989
[LAUGHS] That is full Google.

00:29:55.989 --> 00:29:58.530
AUDIENCE: I was wondering what
music you're listening to now.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.920
What's on your playlist?

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.810
TOM MORELLO: Oh,
that's a good question.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:05.190
I love The Interrupters
now, which is a great ska

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.070
band on Tim Armstrong's label.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.270
I listen to a lot of music
in the car with my kids,

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:14.310
and so it jerks wildly between
Metallica's "Master of Puppets"

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.750
and the "Hamilton" soundtrack.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.440
With a good deal of clean
version Cardi B thrown in.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.126
That's what I'm-- [LAUGHS].

00:30:22.126 --> 00:30:22.974
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:22.974 --> 00:30:24.140
DORINA ARELLANO: Who's next?

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.050
Oh, right there.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.814
AUDIENCE: So I'm
a huge fan of Rage

00:30:30.814 --> 00:30:31.980
Against the Machine's music.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.790
I love metal music.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.180
I also love electronic music.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.290
And I tune in to watch the
Ultra Music Festival that's

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.000
live streamed every year.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.220
So one of my favorite
groups, Knife Party,

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.370
when they close out their
set and bring you out

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:49.140
to this gigantic crowd to wow
them with this explosive guitar

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.487
playing overlay with
dubstep and this crazy kind

00:30:51.487 --> 00:30:53.820
of electronic music, how'd
that feel for the first time?

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.270
TOM MORELLO: Yeah, that was--

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.728
I mean, that was
really the first--

00:30:55.728 --> 00:30:58.380
I was an enemy of EDM music.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.000
I thought it was--

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.400
I knew it only as
Italian taxicab music,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.890
or like Ibiza yacht awfulness.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.860
Until a metal friend turned
me on to Knife Party,

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.270
who is in the EDM genre.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.220
But I felt the same aggression
and tension and release

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.770
as in my favorite rock and roll.

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.850
They were the first people
that I reached out to and said,

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:21.520
I have an idea.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.910
What if you do
what you do and we

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:25.455
replace some of
your synthesizers

00:31:25.455 --> 00:31:26.790
with my electric guitar?

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.290
The idea being if
my electric guitar

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:32.580
is the Ansel Adams clear
black and white photo,

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.040
I want to hear the smashed
Picasso version, something

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.032
that's recognizable,
but you hear it

00:31:38.032 --> 00:31:39.240
in an entirely different way.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.740
So standing at Ultra
Festival, which

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:45.000
is like 135,000
16-year-olds who are wasted,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.100
right, [LAUGHS] wearing
nothing but glowsticks.

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:48.850
That's what it is.

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.130
It's in Miami.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.680
It's insane.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:56.090
Which is my usual
audience, right?

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.389
So I go out on
stage to play this--

00:31:58.389 --> 00:32:00.180
it's the collaborated
song "Battle Sirens,"

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.679
which is on this new record,
but we wrote it some years ago.

00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:04.720
That was like maybe
two or three years ago.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.960
And so I go out on stage
and I'm ready to rock,

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.790
and then I would notice that
their crew, as an EDM crew,

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.860
they've never mic'd
an amplifier before.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.420
So there's no mic on my amp.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.400
So there's like a PA system
ready to not hear me.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.000
And I'm headed towards like
another ptt moment, right?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.100
So fortunately, at
the last minute,

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.420
they did put a mic on it.

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.795
And if you check
that on YouTube,

00:32:25.795 --> 00:32:29.192
it's a really awesome
moment in collaboration.

00:32:29.192 --> 00:32:31.650
That really made me think that
there was something in this.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.009
So thanks for being there.

00:32:33.009 --> 00:32:34.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for the answer.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:34.960
TOM MORELLO: Sure.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.440
Sure.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:35.940
Sure.

00:32:38.414 --> 00:32:40.830
AUDIENCE: I've been a big fan
of Rage Against the Machine,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.020
I would say, for a
long time as well.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.780
Seeing as you're so interested
in unusual sounds and things

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.640
like that, and a lot
of rock musicians

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.590
have moved in this
direction, have you ever

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:53.079
been interested in doing film
music or television music?

00:32:53.079 --> 00:32:55.120
TOM MORELLO: I've done a
lot of film in the past.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.560
I did the rock score for
two of the "Iron Man" movies

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.454
and have appeared on a number
of soundtracks and scores.

00:33:01.454 --> 00:33:02.370
One of things that I--

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:04.810
I did a couple of Michael
Mann movies as well.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:08.627
And while it's a--

00:33:08.627 --> 00:33:10.460
I like it in theory
better than in practice.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.584
Because one thing when
you do music scoring,

00:33:12.584 --> 00:33:15.000
you have something that you
don't have when you're a band.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.440
And that is, you have a boss.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.100
Then you have someone who
wants to hear it sadder.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.870
And like, what do
you mean sadder?

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:24.450
[LAUGHS] You have these
sort of directorial geniuses

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:27.600
who do not have the
musical vocabulary

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.365
to help to guide you.

00:33:29.365 --> 00:33:30.240
I forget what it was.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.880
I did a score for a movie
that I don't know if I ever

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.088
saw it at the end of the day.

00:33:34.088 --> 00:33:35.240
But it was for "A Team."

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.670
It was like the Mr. T reboot.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.170
Anyway.

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.620
And so we spent so
much time on that.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.170
It needed to be cut-- it
was this 12-minute sequence

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.540
and it needed to be
everything completely spot on.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.910
And they'd send me the
vaguest directions back.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:52.620
It needs to sound
more like it's played

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.860
on an oasis in the
middle of an atoll.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.070
And I'm like, OK, we'll
get right on that, yeah.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.720
So just like turn
the bass up a little?

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.678
Is that-- I don't know.

00:34:01.678 --> 00:34:03.450
[LAUGHS]

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:06.430
So finally, we made it sound
like the atoll [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:10.409
And so the movie comes out,
and when I see the movie,

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.739
they've taken this 12 and
1/2 minute musical piece that

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.466
was meticulously
tailored to the film,

00:34:15.466 --> 00:34:17.632
and they just put it in an
entirely different scene.

00:34:17.632 --> 00:34:20.920
[LAUGHS] Just like intact,
just in a different scene.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.080
I'm like, I guess the
atoll music goes there.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.000
Anyway.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.540
I'm open to it, but
I'm not seeking it out.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.750
Any other questions?

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:35.670
There's a couple up from
here, one back there.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.860
AUDIENCE: So in high
school, I remember

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.850
there was this year or two where
these really pivotal albums

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.179
came out--

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:46.500
"Nevermind," "Ten,"
Rage's self-titled,

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.337
"Badmotorfinger," all of these.

00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:51.170
Can you talk a little
bit about how much you

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.239
were trying to change music
in that era versus like--

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:54.989
TOM MORELLO: Sure.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:57.990
I think that it had less to
do with trying to change music

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.990
and that the music
industry had a revelation

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.480
with the "Nevermind" record,
and maybe the Pearl Jam "Ten"

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.740
record, that they
didn't know best what

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.540
was connecting with audiences.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:15.280
And they stepped back from the
over A&amp;R-ing and trying to mold

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.580
artists into stars and going,
we don't understand Tool

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.262
or Nirvana, or Rage
or Nine Inch Nails.

00:35:20.262 --> 00:35:21.970
But whatever they're
doing is connecting,

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.860
so step back from it.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.500
I was in a band before
Rage Against the Machine

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:29.920
called Lock Up, which was kind
of like a Living Color style

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.180
funk rock band.

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.770
And we got a record
deal, which was--

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.061
I had never met a person that
had a record deal before.

00:35:35.061 --> 00:35:37.090
And so we were
very, very excited.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.250
And we did everything that
everyone asked us to do.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.770
Like the A&amp;R person
made these suggestion.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.020
The producer dampened
down some of the weirder

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.020
parts of my guitar play.

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.960
I'm like, well, I
guess they know best.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.327
This band Lockup also had
probably the worst album title

00:35:51.327 --> 00:35:52.660
in the history of Western music.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.784
I'll share it with you now.

00:35:53.784 --> 00:35:58.390
The record was called "Something
Bitchin' This Way Comes."

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.460
And yes, that's bitchin'
with an apostrophe.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:04.430
[LAUGHTER] So we weren't
off to a strong start.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.010
But that band was
summarily dropped,

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:09.169
and all the cliches that
happen, the dickings that happen

00:36:09.169 --> 00:36:10.460
to bands happened to that band.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.430
And at 27 years old, I was done.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.370
I had my grab at
the brass ring and I

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:19.000
had failed to be an album
maker or a rock star.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.760
So I made a vow to myself
that I'm never going to play--

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.050
that's not going to happen.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.970
I'm never going to play
another note of music

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:25.970
that I don't believe in.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:26.710
And that's when
I started writing

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.043
the riffs for the first Rage
Against the Machine Record.

00:36:29.043 --> 00:36:32.510
And was very surprised--
like that was a band--

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:39.700
there no radio station or record
store or club in Hollywood

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:45.801
that was booking a neo-Marxist,
multi-ethnic, punk, rap, metal

00:36:45.801 --> 00:36:46.300
band.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:52.330
And we made those songs in a
complete vacuum of ambition.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.180
And we just made songs that
we loved and believed in.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.670
And then, much to
our surprise, that

00:36:57.670 --> 00:37:00.010
was what connected
with a global audience.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:03.956
But there's a lesson in there
that's very thinly veiled.

00:37:03.956 --> 00:37:06.580
DORINA ARELLANO: Can you please
call your next album "Something

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.720
Bitchin' This Way Comes?"

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.680
TOM MORELLO: Oh, geez.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.795
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:09.795 --> 00:37:10.770
It's already there.

00:37:13.284 --> 00:37:14.450
AUDIENCE: A first shout out.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:15.825
I'm from Chicago
suburbs as well.

00:37:15.825 --> 00:37:17.957
I saw rage at
Lollapalooza three.

00:37:17.957 --> 00:37:19.040
TOM MORELLO: Which suburb?

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.980
AUDIENCE: Darien.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.250
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.050
So my question is, what
is with the hippo pegasus?

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.470
TOM MORELLO: Well,
the image is one

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:33.010
that feels to me like it's
as a gravitas and a weight

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.220
and a power to it.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.470
It also has a beauty to it.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.540
And it's a combination
of unexpected elements.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:40.000
And all those three things
I see as representing

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.410
the music on the record.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.210
I also have loved
hippos since I was a kid

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:44.501
and went to the Brookfield Zoo.

00:37:44.501 --> 00:37:45.490
You know what that is.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:46.365
AUDIENCE: Damn right.

00:37:46.365 --> 00:37:48.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.600
AUDIENCE: Hey, Tom.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.950
Thanks for finding the
time to be here today.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:52.900
TOM MORELLO: Sure.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.220
AUDIENCE: So I'm a
singer from Ukraine.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.511
I've been doing rock and metal.

00:37:55.511 --> 00:37:58.495
And I had a cover band when
we did "Killing in the Name

00:37:58.495 --> 00:38:02.980
Of," but Ukrainian audience know
English enough to ask us not

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.347
to do that anymore in the pubs.

00:38:04.347 --> 00:38:07.029
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:11.880
So I have two questions.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.870
Basically, we just
moved a year ago.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.850
I'm just learning
the business here.

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:17.980
And I have a full
time job, obviously.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.727
So I have a budget
of five hours a week

00:38:20.727 --> 00:38:22.810
and I'm trying to choose
between basically getting

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:26.935
better, the songwriting, and
building a brand on YouTube.

00:38:26.935 --> 00:38:28.420
So how would you balance that?

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.130
TOM MORELLO: Well, I would
say, first of all, welcome.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.810
And one thing
that's sort of crazy

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.900
is how many metal dudes
there are at Google,

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.430
and women are at Google.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.900
That's pretty interest.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.010
That's was a little bit
surprising, in an awesome way.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.428
No wonder it's such
a successful company.

00:38:44.428 --> 00:38:45.874
[LAUGHS]

00:38:45.874 --> 00:38:47.290
And the first thing
I would say is

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:52.675
that the rules of how music
is made and distributed

00:38:52.675 --> 00:38:55.240
in the world are so
radically different from when

00:38:55.240 --> 00:39:01.090
I moved to Hollywood in 1986,
that my kids' babysitter's

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.257
boyfriend is a YouTube star.

00:39:02.257 --> 00:39:04.215
And I just don't have
any understanding of even

00:39:04.215 --> 00:39:04.820
what he does.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.200
I don't know-- [LAUGHS] I have
no idea what that dude does.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.410
So maybe that's the best route.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:13.450
But I would say, my
recommendation to you

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.130
is in order to be
a-- it's very, very

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.760
easy to be a success
by a certain criteria.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.930
And that is, if you play and
write music that you love

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.730
and that you enjoy, whether
or not there's an audience,

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.275
you will have an artistic
satisfaction that is--

00:39:28.275 --> 00:39:29.650
let me tell you,
there are people

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.360
who are playing stadiums
that don't have that.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.990
And they do not
sleep well at night.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.720
I know them, and that's true.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.619
But then there are people
who jam in their basements

00:39:37.619 --> 00:39:39.160
on the weekend with
friends that have

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.280
a fulfillment via music that is
what music is really all about.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.320
So the path to success in
2018 I can't counsel you

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.710
on because I really don't know.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:53.860
But the path to having fun and
a very meaningful experience

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.040
with music is one I would say,
write songs that you believe in

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.240
and play guitar--

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.980
or play songs that
you really love

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.410
and enjoy it to its fullest.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.440
AUDIENCE: Quick question-- what
was the first effects pedal

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.740
or processor that got you
going with experimenting?

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.960
TOM MORELLO: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.150
I remember walking to
the Highland Park music

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.940
store when I could
afford an effects pedal.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.010
And I turned on the delay
pedal and had like--

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.780
I just turned every
knob all the way up.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.684
And it sounded so super freaky.

00:40:21.684 --> 00:40:23.350
I'm like, that's the
most awesome thing.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.610
That's what most
guitar players do

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.040
is when you get a guitar pedal,
you think that's awesome.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.890
And then you dampen it, like
you make it more subtle.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:32.827
And you go for like, oh,
I want to just nuance

00:40:32.827 --> 00:40:33.910
this, that, and the other.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:38.110
And I never lost that feeling
of let's do the crazy thing

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.510
and try to experience
that same--

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.300
to make people's ears freak
out like I did when I first

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.680
turned that effects pedal on.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.890
In my setup, it's a
very limited number--

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.580
I've embraced limitations
with regards to the equipment.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.250
I have the same four or five
effects pedals, some of which

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.340
I bought at that-- that effects
pedal may be in the running

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.350
there as an alternate.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:05.060
But my idea was to take a very
limited amount of gear and--

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.570
because I never
liked the sound--

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.960
when I first got
my first check--

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.320
I was working for a
United States senator.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.360
I got my first check.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.610
And I went to a guitar
shop in Hollywood.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.170
And they custom made
a guitar for me.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:16.360
And I didn't know anything
about which fretboards--

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.560
so it was a stinker.

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.670
It was like an expensive,
horrible guitar.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.086
And over the course
of some years,

00:41:21.086 --> 00:41:23.320
I replaced every bit of the
electronics and the neck.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.470
And I never got it to sound
like the sound I had in my head.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:29.980
And so one Lockup rehearsal,
I was fed up with it

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.370
and I took this amp
that I had and I--

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.086
this is as good as
I can make it sound.

00:41:35.086 --> 00:41:36.460
I am unfulfilled
with this sound.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.717
I marked the settings on it.

00:41:37.717 --> 00:41:39.550
But I'm never going to
think about it again.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:41.300
Because I felt so much
of my creative time

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.750
was being expended
chasing a tone.

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.820
And I thought, this is
just going to be my sound.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.200
And now I'm going
to write song--

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.950
I'm going to create with this.

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.730
The markings on that amp-- it's
the amp that I used at the show

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.450
last night--

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:54.250
they haven't changed since 1988.

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.650
Every song I've ever
recorded, every song I've ever

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.300
played live, is with--

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.630
many of those songs-- with
that guitar that I didn't feel

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:03.830
fulfilled with and with
those amp settings.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.320
And one more sort of lesson to
draw, Rage Against the Machine,

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.510
we were practicing for
a South American tour.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:09.740
And we had to do
it on rental gear.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.650
And we were playing
our normal Rage songs,

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.330
but on not our own gear.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.690
And it sounded bad.

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:18.110
And so Brad, the
drummer, said to me,

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.220
are we really so dependent
on our gear to sound good?

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.950
And I thought, that's possible,
but it's also possible

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:25.870
that if we had started
with this gear,

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:27.850
we would have written
songs that sounded great

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:29.260
with these sounds.

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.492
And so I think that just
not worrying so much

00:42:31.492 --> 00:42:32.950
about what the tone
is and worrying

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.320
about what your
creativity can be

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.827
is what would be
my recommendation.

00:42:36.827 --> 00:42:37.910
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.076
TOM MORELLO: You're welcome.

00:42:39.076 --> 00:42:40.296
DORINA ARELLANO: One more.

00:42:40.296 --> 00:42:42.566
AUDIENCE: I think
it's back to Ukraine.

00:42:42.566 --> 00:42:46.070
DORINA ARELLANO: Oh, you may
get to ask your last question.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:48.080
There you go.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.025
TOM MORELLO: The
Ukrainian delegation.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.455
AUDIENCE: So I'm doing a
lot of open mics right now.

00:42:55.455 --> 00:42:56.330
So what is the next--

00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.430
I know it's hard for
you to remember maybe,

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.294
but what is the next
level after open mics

00:43:01.294 --> 00:43:02.460
but before actual thousand--

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.390
TOM MORELLO: Sure.

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:06.140
First of all, I think
open mics are great.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.690
In the height of
Audioslave's fame,

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.820
I was doing open mic nights.

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.180
I made four records under the
name The Nightwatchman, which

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:16.610
is like an acoustic folk
troubadour, political kind

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.160
of Woody Guthrie,
Phil Ochs thing.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.400
And on days off, I would
go and do open mic nights.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.870
And again, in those
experiences, I

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:27.590
found playing three songs
with a latte blender

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.850
whirring in the background
was really fulfilling.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:31.350
It was like I was communicating.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.370
And it was playing stuff
that I felt was true.

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.424
And I was fighting
for my artistic soul

00:43:36.424 --> 00:43:37.340
in these coffeehouses.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.780
So there's nothing
wrong with just

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.370
playing the open mic nights.

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.770
I would say, if you want to
go beyond that, a key way

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.020
to get better--

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.940
two ways to get better are to
play live, which you're doing,

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.330
and to play with other people.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.000
That's a crucial
component is to--

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.920
whether they're better than you,
whether they're worse than you,

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.705
just the chemistry
that you get and

00:43:53.705 --> 00:43:57.920
the collaborative experience is
one that will probably be fun

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.360
and you will
certainly learn from,

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.880
and will improve
your own playing.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:03.720
DORINA ARELLANO:
Well, everyone, check

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.170
out "The Atlas Underground."

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:05.910
It is out now.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.590
