00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.620
Where I grew up, the words Millennium Force,
Raptor, Mean Streak, Mantis, Magnum, Demon

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.379
Drop and Power Tower were thrown around every
spring and summer.

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.000
All of them give you the thrilling sensation
of plummeting to your death!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.810
So why did we ride all those rides?

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.679
Roller coasters are the crown jewel of amusement
parks.

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:30.570
There are whole industries vying for the title
of tallest, fastest, steepest, loopest, largest

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.510
or bad-assest coaster around.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.970
Its history can be traced back to 1750, an
ice-slide was constructed in St. Petersburg

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.870
Russia to provide thrills for sledders.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.190
In 1804, a visiting Frenchman copied the idea
in Paris using rails and wheels instead of

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.900
sleds; and boom the roller coaster slid into
the world consciousness.Today, there are over

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.780
3600 coasters on the planet according to the
Roller Coaster Database, and the 418-foot

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.180
Kingda Ka at Six Flags in Jackson, New Jersey
is arguably (please, argue in the comments)

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.980
the best roller coaster on Earth, though Julia
swears by the Millennium Force at Cedar Point.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.600
There's a lot of physics involved with designing
a coaster: potential energy on the hills,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.940
kinetic energy on the drops and acceleration,
g-forces, apparent weight, and so on on the

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.940
loops and turns.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.331
In the end though, you don't need to grasp
physics to build a good coaster -- you just

00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.040
need to understand physiology.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.690
Coasters are basically trains that use those
forces to manipulate your inner ear, internal

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.830
organs, and other senses to mess with your
brain chemistry.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.770
These drops, jerks and free-floating gravity
trips are meant to give you a whiff of fear,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.870
without making you feel in any real danger.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.220
Its the same kind of fear that you get from
haunted houses, and extreme-sports activities

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.280
like skydiving.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.190
Some people are thrill seekers, they get a
natural high from the brain chemicals released

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.060
when they encounter the fight-or-flight response.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.500
When our ancient brains believe there's a
danger to our body -- even if there isn't

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.189
REAL danger -- our amygdala triggers releasing
a host of chemicals to prep our bodies to

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.930
literally fight for our lives or escape (i.e.
fight-or-fight).

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.030
As the brain is constantly sucking in information,
it can assess risk and flip this response

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.030
in an instant.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.840
That causes a release of dopamine, serotonin,
adrenaline and oxytocin to help hone the mind,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.200
focus the senses and prepare the body for
action.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.810
Of course… then… no action comes.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.870
The roller coaster ends and you're left with
the aftermath of all those chemicals surging

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.870
through your body.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.280
Your hands are shaking, you're sweating, and
you probably have a feeling of euphoria.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.340
Some of you might have noticed oxytocin slipped
in there with the fairly predictable cocktail

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.900
of chemicals.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.160
When the body is scared we release oxytocin.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.890
It's commonly called the "love hormone" but
it's more accurately a bonding hormone.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.110
It helps specific memories stick in our memories
-- like which things are dangerous, or which

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.530
people help in times of high-stress.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.770
When we come down from that fear; like after
a roller coaster ride; we perceive all these

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.410
things and end up laughing from the euphoria,
and feeling closer to those who experienced

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:30.750
it with us.
