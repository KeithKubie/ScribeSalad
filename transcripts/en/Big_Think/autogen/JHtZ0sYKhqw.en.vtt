married people with children there's a
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.349
married people with children there's a
sort of expectation often that people

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359
sort of expectation often that people
 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:49.699
sort of expectation often that people
who are married with children can go

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709
who are married with children can go
 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.860
who are married with children can go
home at four o'clock because they have

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
home at four o'clock because they have
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.119
home at four o'clock because they have
to attend to their kids and of course

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129
to attend to their kids and of course
 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.709

a single person or the person without

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599
a single person or the person without
 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.339
a single person or the person without
kids doesn't get to do those things and

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349
kids doesn't get to do those things and
 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.140
kids doesn't get to do those things and
that I think is more out like a family

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
that I think is more out like a family
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.179

status equality fairness issue than it

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189
status equality fairness issue than it
 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.770
status equality fairness issue than it
is a sexuality fairness and equality

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
is a sexuality fairness and equality
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.890
is a sexuality fairness and equality
issue and so a lot of so to me my

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
issue and so a lot of so to me my
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.539
issue and so a lot of so to me my
observation has been that most issues

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549
observation has been that most issues
 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.009
observation has been that most issues
related to sexuality in the workplace

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019
related to sexuality in the workplace
 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.949
related to sexuality in the workplace
are actually issues of family status and
