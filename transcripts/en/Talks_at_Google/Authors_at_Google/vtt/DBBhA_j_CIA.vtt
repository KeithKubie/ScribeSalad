MALE SPEAKER: Hello everyone.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.650
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.840
I work on the Privacy Team.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.230
Thanks for coming to this
Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.180
Let me tell you a little bit
about our guest of honor today.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.392
Robert Sloan grew
up near Detroit

00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:15.850
and likes to say
that he now splits

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.990
this time between San
Francisco and the internet.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.800
He graduated from Michigan State
with a degree in economics.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.000
And from 2002 to 2012, he
worked at Pointer, Current TV,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.356
and Twitter.

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:29.039
At all these places
his job always

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.580
had something to do
with figuring out

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.092
the future of media.

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:34.300
The "New York Times" describes
his recent bestselling

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.300
hit "Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour
Bookstore" as a rollicking

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.920
neo-Borgesian tale about an
unemployed San Francisco web

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.230
designer who takes a job
at a mysterious bookshop

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.560
only to find himself initiated
into the unbroken spine,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.330
a 500-year-old secret
society of bibliophiles

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.660
on an unexpected collision
course with Google.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.020
Please join me in welcoming
to Google Mr. Robin Sloan.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.480
ROBIN SLOAN: Thank you.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.355
It's good to be hear.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:01:00.359
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.900
MALE SPEAKER: So I
think today you're

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.680
hoping to kick us off a
little bit of a reading--

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.140
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.440
MALE SPEAKER: --some
choice bits from your book.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.700
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.380
MALE SPEAKER: And if
anybody has any questions,

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.187
I think we're going
to try to save those

00:01:09.187 --> 00:01:10.270
to the end of the reading.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.370
And you can use the mic here
in the middle of the room.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.905
ROBIN SLOAN: OK.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:13.500
Well thank you.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.980
Thank you for the
kind introduction.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.979
It's go good to be here.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.570
For people who
have read the book,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.950
you know that Google features
prominently into the plot.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.720
And I've just finished
up a little book tour

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.500
to commemorate the
paperback release.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.080
And I have to report that at
every stop across the country,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.740
people always ask, is
Google really like that?

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.570
And I have to confess
that it's not really.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.170
And I tell them, I do say that
the depiction in my novel,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.690
my work of fiction,
is definitely not

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.960
intended to be like
documentary style.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.260
I tell them, though, that is
an affectionate exaggeration.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.620
And I hope it sounds
that way to you as well.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.340
So since I'm here at
Google, and since I just

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.360
had lunch in one
of your many cafes,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.830
I felt like I probably had to
read this very short section

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.130
in which our
narrator who's a web

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.980
designer-- an unemployed
web designer-- who

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.200
works at a mysterious
24-hour bookstore,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.120
he goes to the Google campus--
the fictional Google campus--

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.060
for the first time
and he has lunch.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.880
Wide walkways curve
through the main campus.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.600
There's a bike lane
and Googlers whiz

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.210
by on carbon fiber racers and
fixed gears with battery packs.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.510
There's a pair of gray
beards on recumbents

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.660
and a tall do dude with blue
dreadlocks pedaling a unicycle.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.230
I reserved some time on
the book scanner at 12:30,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.532
Kat says, lunch first?

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:39.650
The Google mess hall comes
into view, wide and low,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.975
a white pavilion staked
out like a garden party.

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:46.170
The front is open, tarp
pulled up above the entryways,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.950
and short lines of Googlers
poke out into the lawn.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.380
Kat pauses, squinting,
calculating.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.680
This one, she says finally, and
tugs me over to leftmost line.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.960
I'm a pretty good
queue strategist,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.270
but it's not easy here
because everyone at Google

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.830
is a queue
strategist, I suggest.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.370
Exactly.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.030
So sometimes there's bluffing.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.030
Hey, this guy's a
bluffer, she says,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.190
jabbing the Googler just ahead
of us in line with her elbow.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.430
He's tall and sandy haired,
and he looks like a surfer.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.115
Hey, I am Finn, he
says, holding out

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:23.260
a blocking long fingered hand.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.580
Your first visit to Google?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.750
It is, indeed, my
ambiguously European friend.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.150
I make small talk.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.520
How's the food?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.510
Oh fantastic.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.310
The chef is famous.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.670
He pauses.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.220
Something clicks.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.000
Kat, he must use the other line.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.700
Right, I always
forget, Kat says.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.665
She explains our
food is personalized.

00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:48.570
It has vitamins, some
natural stimulants.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.870
Finn nods vigorously.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.280
I am experimenting with
my potassium level.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.650
Now I'm up to 11
bananas every day.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.700
Body hacking.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.190
His face splits
into a wide grin.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.890
Wait.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.720
Did the couscous
salad have stimulants?

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.480
Sorry, Kat says, frowning.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.380
The visitor line is over there.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.850
She points across the
lawn, and I leave her

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.460
with the body
hacking euro surfer.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.390
The food is as
promised fantastic.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.440
I get two scoops of lentil
salad and a thick pink stripe

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.470
of fish, seven sturdy
green lines of asparagus,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.160
and a single
chocolate chip cookie

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.050
that has been optimized
for crispiness.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.670
Kat waves me over to a table
near the pavilion's perimeter

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.440
where a quick breeze is
rustling the white tarp.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.850
Little slices of light
dance across the table which

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.220
has a paper covering marked
out with a pale blue grid.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.000
At Google, they eat
lunch on graph paper.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.220
This is Raj, she says, waving a
fork full of lentil salad which

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.520
looks just like
mine, at a skater

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.130
Ph.D. We went to
school together.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.856
Kat studied symbolic
systems at Stanford.

00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:56.372
Did everybody here
go to Stanford?

00:04:56.372 --> 00:05:00.460
Do they just give you a job
at Google when you graduate?

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.560
When Raj speaks,
he seemed suddenly

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.510
10 years older than
his appearance.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.710
His voice is clipped and direct.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.670
So what do you do?

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.040
I hoped that question would
be outlawed here, replaced

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.850
by some quirky Google
equivalent like, what's

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.920
your favorite prime number?

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.250
I point at my badge
and concede that I

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.210
work at a used bookstore,
in other words,

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.310
the opposite of Google.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.760
Ah, books, Raj pauses
a moment chewing.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.220
Then his brain
slots into a groove.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.430
You know, old books
are a problem for us,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.650
old knowledge in general.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.440
We call it OK,
old knowledge, OK.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.150
Did you know that
95% of the internet

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.370
was only created in
the last five years?

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.620
But we know that when it
comes to all human knowledge,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.350
the ratio is just the opposite.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.390
In fact, OK, [INAUDIBLE]
for most things

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.860
that most people know
and have ever known.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.584
Raj is not blinking and
possibly not breathing.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:52.500
So where is it, right?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.250
Where's the OK?

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.330
Well it's in old
books for one thing.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.330
He uncaps a thin tipped marker.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.730
Where did that come from?

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.340
And starts drawing on the
graph paper tablecloth.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.080
And it's also in people's heads,
a lot of traditional knowledge.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.252
That's what we call TK.

00:06:05.252 --> 00:06:06.950
OK and TK.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.070
He's drawing little
overlapping blobs

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.140
labeling them with
these acronyms.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.490
Imagine if we could make
all that OK TK available

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.330
all the time to everyone
on the web, on your phone?

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.330
No question would go
unanswered ever again.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.430
I wonder what Raj
has in his lunch.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.820
Vitamin D, omega 3's,
fermented tea leaves,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.010
he says, still scribbling.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.500
He makes a single dot off
to the side of the blobs

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.456
and smooshes the marker down
making the black ink bleed.

00:06:36.456 --> 00:06:38.080
That's what we've
got stored right now,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.560
he says, pointing to the dot.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.670
And just think how
valuable that is.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.790
If we get all this--
he sweeps his hand

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.690
across the OK TK blobs like
a general planning conquest--

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.379
well if we could
add all this, then

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:52.545
we could really get serious.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.600
MALE SPEAKER: So I have to ask--
my first question would be,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.960
who's your favorite character?

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.000
ROBIN SLOAN: My favorite
character in the book is Kat.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.024
And so for folks who have
read the book, of course

00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:06.992
you know who that is.

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:08.450
For folks who
haven't, I'll explain

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.590
that she is an engineer.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.000
She's actually a Googler.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.380
She's the one who invites
our protagonist to the campus

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.070
and sort of shows him around.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.940
She's a designer.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.010
She's into data
visualization, but she's also

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.680
a programmer in her own right.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.180
And over the course
of the book, she

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.860
becomes more and
more of a manager.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.650
And she's basically a bad ass.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.360
And she's my favorite
character because I

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.580
used to work with Kat
or many versions of Kat.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.620
And as I read everything,
contemporary fiction

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.970
and fiction of technology
in it, and techno thrillers,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.150
and all the rest, I noticed
that Kat or this Kat archetype

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.050
was usually not
present in these books.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.940
And more and more
I decided that I

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.670
wanted to do my tiny little
part to help remedy that.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.870
So I both like her
as a character,

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.030
but I'm also proud
to have kind of put

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.984
that person on
the fiction shelf.

00:07:59.984 --> 00:08:01.650
MALE SPEAKER: Do you
feel like your book

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.140
is sort of filling in
any other maybe things

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.520
that you felt were missing
from the literary landscape?

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.770
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.940
I mean, I'm someone
who-- I worked at Twitter

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.300
for a few years and have
always been fascinated

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.790
by the web and the internet.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.400
And I mean, I really feel
like I sort of grew up

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.340
as both a reader and a
writer on the internet.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.910
It's my native country, right?

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.080
I'm definitely a
citizen of the internet.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.690
And kind of combining that
with all the experiences

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.563
that a person has
in the Bay Area,

00:08:32.563 --> 00:08:34.271
knowing people who
work at Google, people

00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:36.520
who work at Twitter, people
who have started companies

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.740
of their own, I think you end up
with a whole map of experiences

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.490
that are actually
really interesting.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.440
And I would say largely absent
from contemporary fiction.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.740
And whether that's just
because most writers live

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.360
somewhere else or because of the
old divide between left brain

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.190
and right brain or whatever
it is, the more I read,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.680
the more I kind of just
sensed that the things that I

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.520
saw every day and thought
were really interesting

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.354
were like not on the pages
of the novels I was reading.

00:09:06.354 --> 00:09:07.770
AUDIENCE: About
that a little bit,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.740
how was your transition
from IT to being an author?

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.040
Are you a full-time right now?

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.574
And also when you're writing,
what's your day to day?

00:09:16.574 --> 00:09:17.490
How does it look like?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.240
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.760
Good question.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.130
Well I was actually
explaining earlier,

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.220
so the Google office
is nice of course.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.750
Twitter's office
was nice as well.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.420
And I was happy to work
in such a nice office.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.520
Actually, I've worked
at a bunch of companies

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.470
that were all wonderful
places to work.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.200
And I feel like that was
helpful because I still

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.742
didn't like working
in those offices.

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.616
And I figured if I didn't
like those offices,

00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:40.175
I wasn't going to
like any offices.

00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:42.760
So I have found the
transition from-- it's

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.400
been less about tack
to writing and more

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.149
about working in an office
to working on your own.

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:50.940
And that's obviously
a temperamental thing.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.815
Everyone's different.

00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:55.090
But I have found that
totally copacetic.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.250
But what it means is that
my day to day routine

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:03.310
is I think actually pretty
normal for a full-time writer.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.640
I spend most of the
day alone sitting

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.500
at my kitchen table
just pecking away.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.330
This might be
useful folks who are

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.650
thinking about this themselves
or maybe struggling with it,

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.070
I use a program that
is very popular--

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.280
increasingly popular-- among
writers called Freedom.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.640
Anybody know this
program Freedom?

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.140
It's great.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.130
It's free to try.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:28.580
It does one thing.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.330
You open up the
application, and it asks you

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.439
for a number of minutes.

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:34.230
And you type in-- in
my case I usually type

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.730
in about 120 minutes.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.870
You hit Return and it disables
the internet on like a very--

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.750
ROBIN SLOAN: --on
like a very low level.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.550
This is not turning
off your Wi-Fi.

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.500
If you want to turn
it back on, you

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.290
have to restart your
computer and just

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.060
feel like a failure in life.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:51.660
So you don't.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.230
So you just leave it
off until it returns.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.780
And so my day is
mostly me undergoing

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.874
a sequence of internet
deactivations.

00:11:01.874 --> 00:11:02.790
What am I going to do?

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.570
I guess I'll work on this book.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.601
AUDIENCE: I am
fascinated by-- I'm

00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:10.850
sort of the old school league.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.100
You can tell by the gray hair.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.060
It's because I'm old.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.790
And I have many, many
younger friends here.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.640
And I love books on paper.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.710
I discover a lot of people don't
necessarily love books on paper

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.210
anymore.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.180
They want them on their Kindle.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.372
I probably have 4 or
5,000 books at home.

00:11:27.372 --> 00:11:28.080
ROBIN SLOAN: Wow.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.810
AUDIENCE: And I know some
people who have none.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.890
They have their Kindle.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:31.240
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.823
AUDIENCE: Could you
speak a little bit

00:11:32.823 --> 00:11:35.400
to the idea of the
importance of bookstores

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.660
since your book is about
a bookstore and that sort

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.364
of balance between
paper and online?

00:11:42.364 --> 00:11:44.030
ROBIN SLOAN: That's
an awesome question.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.440
Well, I will say one thing.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.530
I think people who do one or
the other are relatively rare.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.520
That is, people who
only have print books

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.350
and have never touched
a digital book,

00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:00.120
and conversely, people who
have these entirely digital

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.250
libraries and have just
abandoned physical books

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.079
entirely.

00:12:03.079 --> 00:12:04.620
Especially for people
who read a lot,

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.759
you find sort of a hybrid mode.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:07.800
I think that's important.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800
People want to frame it
as one versus the other.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.490
And in fact, people read lots
and lots of different contexts.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.840
I think that's a good thing.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.040
I will say that for me
personally the pendulum

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.780
has kind of swung
and then swung back,

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.150
of course, as digital
books became available,

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.360
I read more on Kindles and
phones and my laptop screen

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.860
and everything.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.630
In the last couple years,
it started to swing back.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.390
I never gave up physical books.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.150
But it started to
swing back, and I

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.790
find that my default mode is
physical books more often.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.840
And here's my theory for
why that is the case.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.749
I think that physical
books have a feature--

00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:48.290
and I think it's
important to call it

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.510
a feature it is like it
should be compared to software

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.010
like bullet point
by bullet point.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.230
I really do think we should
think about it that way.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.890
And this is the feature.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:12:59.800
They don't disappear.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.120
I'm thinking of the books
that I buy for my Kindle.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.480
And I often buy things
kind of aspirationally

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.420
or speculatively.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:08.794
I'm like, I'll
read that one day.

00:13:08.794 --> 00:13:09.554
That looks good.

00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:11.220
And it's there and
it kind of hangs out.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.844
But then, of course,
it gets push down.

00:13:12.844 --> 00:13:15.555
And once a book is past
that first page on any

00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:17.780
of these devices,
it's basically gone.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.250
I mean, it might as
well be invisible.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.410
Because you just don't sit
down and scroll through and try

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:25.530
to remember that stuff.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.280
Digital books are very
quiet in that way.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.535
They go they go quietly.

00:13:28.535 --> 00:13:29.535
They don't even protest.

00:13:29.535 --> 00:13:31.210
They're like, what about me?

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.310
Oh.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.050
Never seen or heard from again.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.210
Physical books have
this wonderful feature.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.547
They impose themselves.

00:13:39.547 --> 00:13:41.380
They have this ability
to literally stand up

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.890
for themselves and just take
up a little bit of space

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.070
in the real world and sit on a
shelf or in a pile or whatever

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.322
and remind you that they
exist and remind you

00:13:49.322 --> 00:13:50.905
that you were
interested in them once.

00:13:50.905 --> 00:13:54.290
And it sounds simple,
maybe even simplistic,

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.620
but I actually think it's a
very significant advantage,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.100
especially in a time when our
attention is being whipsawed

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.765
around and we're constantly
getting distracted by things

00:14:03.765 --> 00:14:07.550
and interested in new things
to have this thing that

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.820
caught your eye once be able
to just kind of like take up

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:17.540
some space and remind you
of that moment is actually

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.950
a hugely valuable feature.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:24.660
So I like print books more
and more for that reason.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.490
AUDIENCE: Sort of
as social media

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.640
becomes bigger and a larger
part of everyone's life,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.760
I feel that it's also becoming
a larger part of creators' lives

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.250
like writers, television
writers, book writers, things

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.694
like that.

00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:38.110
When you're writing
a book or when

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.869
you're in your
creative process, you

00:14:40.869 --> 00:14:43.410
maintain a high availability or
a high degree of availability

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.285
for your fans, right?

00:14:44.285 --> 00:14:46.620
So do you think that
influences your writing at all?

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.450
And beyond just you, do you
see that having an impact

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.770
on literature as a whole
for people that are still

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:54.830
out there writing novels?

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.520
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.620
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:56.680
Wow.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.440
That was a really good question.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.180
I think that the
most honest answer

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.610
is kind of the less
satisfying one which

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.730
is that it's
complicated, and I think

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.450
it really depends on the writer.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.340
And all I mean by
that is people often

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.050
talk about engaging
with social media

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.050
as if it was one thing,
like a binary switch.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.300
You either do it or you don't.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.935
When, of course, it's
a whole spectrum.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.120
I consider myself a
pretty serious user

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.760
of Twitter and all this stuff.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.630
There are people who just like
make me look like a luddite.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.350
Make me look like I'm like
taking my horse drawn carriage

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.487
to and from the post
office in the next state

00:15:36.487 --> 00:15:38.570
because they're just on
it and they're so intense.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.810
And they're just having
these conversations,

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.300
they're responding
to everything.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.681
They're inviting these
conversations every day.

00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:46.930
And so there's that end of
the spectrum, which I think

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.457
has its own pleasures and can
be productive in certain ways.

00:15:49.457 --> 00:15:51.290
And then there's other
ends of the spectrum.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.480
Like I think of a few writers
who I really admire who,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.657
there's one in particular.

00:15:56.657 --> 00:15:57.740
He's not a fiction writer.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.340
He's a writer of nonfiction, a
critic, and essayist name Sam

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.580
Anderson.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.290
And his whole social
media strategy

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.300
that he just tweets
once a day and he

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.080
tweets the best sentence
he read that day.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.962
It's really cool.

00:16:09.962 --> 00:16:11.920
And of course, his
sentences are all fantastic.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.100
You go an follow up on them.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.560
This is going to sound not
the way I want to sound

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.580
but it's perfect for
his personal brand.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.390
It is.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.920
It's like the most Sam Anderson
thing you could possibly

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.530
do, to put the focus
on great sentences

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.690
and just leave it at that.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.660
So anyways, that's a very long
way of saying that I think it's

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.320
going to influence everyone's
life and work differently.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.330
And that's a good thing.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.410
If it was one uniform
effect, I think

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.870
that would be quite boring.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.470
I do think that when people
think about it influencing

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.600
the work itself it definitely
can, of course it can.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.300
Every input changes
what you produce.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.790
I do think that, man, when you
sit down to write something

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.660
long and spend day after day
after day alone at your kitchen

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.329
table with the internet off,
I really think like to sustain

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:08.241
that, it's got to come
from somewhere inside

00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:09.740
and that's always
going to be there,

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.430
even if there are these
other little inputs,

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:16.099
these other things that are
coming from email and Twitter

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:20.194
and the web and Facebook and
Google+ and everything else.

00:17:20.194 --> 00:17:22.069
I really do think that
the largest part of it

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.652
is always going to be internal
because if you don't have that,

00:17:24.652 --> 00:17:26.470
then you wouldn't be
sitting there at all.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:27.869
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:30.780
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask
you a little bit about when

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.420
you knew that you had
a book in front of you,

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.390
when you were like, OK,
I'm going to quit my job

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.040
and focus on this full-time, or
did you do it before when you

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.130
said I have this idea and I
think I'm going to make it big?

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.730
And what that process was
when at the point you said,

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.690
I have something.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.615
ROBIN SLOAN: That's
a great question.

00:17:47.615 --> 00:17:50.010
Yeah, I'll tell you
what happened to me.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.350
It was a few things
that were my own doing

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.000
and also some other things
that kind of happened to me

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.890
or I got an assist
from other people.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.730
The story itself, the
seed of the story,

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.930
was actually a short story
that I published online years

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.790
ago back in 2009.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.360
It was also called "Mr.
Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore".

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.340
And it started in the same way,
and then it just kind of ended.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.270
It was like there's
a 24-hour bookstore.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.590
That's interesting, the end.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.362
There was a little
more to it than that.

00:18:20.362 --> 00:18:21.820
But it was very
short, and I didn't

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.819
think there was going to
be anything more to it.

00:18:23.819 --> 00:18:26.230
I thought that was just one
in a series of short stories

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.087
I'd been writing and publishing.

00:18:29.087 --> 00:18:31.170
So there's a little bit
of short sightedness there

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.785
and a bit of failure
on my own part

00:18:32.785 --> 00:18:34.540
to maybe recognize what I had.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.267
Because the response
to it was actually

00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:38.350
quite a bit more significant
than to anything else

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.646
I had written to date.

00:18:39.646 --> 00:18:42.020
And in fact, greater than
things I wrote even after that.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.580
I continue to publish
these little short stories.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.530
And they did fine, but
nothing got the same sort

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.860
of just strong sudden
enthusiastic response

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.090
that this one did.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.240
It took someone else
to tell me that.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.130
It was an agent that I ended
up getting in touch with

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.130
and really hitting it off with.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.690
And it was actually her counsel.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.000
She said, you know, that
story is really good

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.730
and there might be a
bigger story there.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.470
And I had not really considered
that until that moment.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.011
But as soon as she
said it, it seemed

00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:12.510
like it was probably right.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.040
So that was still in the
realm of speculation.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.630
I had a short seed of a story
that had been almost like

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.860
a prototype and it had been
validated a little bit in a way

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.092
that some others hadn't.

00:19:24.092 --> 00:19:26.675
And I now had the notion that
it could be a full length novel,

00:19:26.675 --> 00:19:29.440
but I didn't know exactly
what to do with that notion.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.120
I did have a full-time
job at the time.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.945
I would not have contemplated
leaving my job just

00:19:34.945 --> 00:19:36.760
to try to write this
because at that time,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.040
I had no evidence that I could
actually finish a full length

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.540
novel.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.170
I had never written
anything that long.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.545
I wasn't one of
those people that

00:19:42.545 --> 00:19:44.160
had three drafts in
a drawer that they

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.540
had sort of written to practice.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.250
So I just worked nights
and weekends and holidays

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.820
and basically wherever
I could fit it

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.480
in while I was
working full-time.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.780
And I emerged at the
end of about a year

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.360
of that kind of work with
a draft, a first draft.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.480
And that's what I sent
back to this agent.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.370
And said, hey,
what do you think?

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.610
You said this could be a
full length novel, right?

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.520
And we started talking about
it and editing it and making

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.910
it better.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.254
And from that point, the
process was, in many ways,

00:20:15.254 --> 00:20:16.045
pretty traditional.

00:20:16.045 --> 00:20:18.310
It was drafts and
sending it to publishers,

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.930
and finding a
publisher who liked it,

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.430
and et cetera, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:24.080
And it was after that, after
I sold it, that I left my job.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.496
But I would say that the two
important pieces-- the really

00:20:26.496 --> 00:20:28.870
important piece--
were one, having

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.900
a sense that I had the seed
of something that was good

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.840
and that there were some
validation associated

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.420
with that.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.461
But the fact that it had
been a short story first

00:20:36.461 --> 00:20:39.140
and that this very smart
person said like trust

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.770
me I've published a
lot of books and I

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.040
think there's something here.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.670
And then the other
thing was just

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.050
being willing to do the work.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.340
I was no fun for that year.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.690
I didn't go anywhere
or really see anyone

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:54.370
or form any additional human
relationships or anything.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.552
But that's how I did it.

00:20:56.552 --> 00:20:58.010
AUDIENCE: So I read
the short story

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.630
about three or four years ago--

00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.900
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:00.520
AUDIENCE: --I loved it.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.190
I thought it was amazing.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.320
I didn't even know
you made a book out

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.990
of it until I saw your name
of the Authors calendar.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.700
ROBIN SLOAN: Ha!

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.690
AUDIENCE: But I'm
glad you're here.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:06.880
And I'm glad I get
to read the book.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.860
So something I really liked
about the short story,

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.360
so this question
might be irrelevant

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.470
if people haven't read
it, but the protagonist,

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.220
he never actually says
anything in quotes.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.820
Like he always
kind of says stuff,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.070
but it's never a direct quote.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.510
And I really, really
love that style.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.010
And when I thumbed
through the book,

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.490
I noticed he
actually says stuff.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.190
So I'm kind of curious, was
that on purpose the first time?

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.760
And how did you
transition into doing

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.940
it the other way
for a full book?

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.939
ROBIN SLOAN: That is such
a perceptive question.

00:21:28.939 --> 00:21:30.610
That's like you're
in the inner circle.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:31.010
Yeah.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.180
AUDIENCE: Like I said,
I loved the short story.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:32.441
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:33.316
No, that's fantastic.

00:21:33.316 --> 00:21:35.989
No, you're absolutely right.

00:21:35.989 --> 00:21:36.530
You're right.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.910
This will be interesting to
no one else in this room,

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.860
but I'm totally OK with that.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.010
It was an intentional
stylistic choice.

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.330
As both a reader and a
writer, I have sometimes

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.960
found dialogue, especially
very functional dialogue,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.490
like what do you think, I
don't know, OK, let's go,

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.711
to just be sort of
like boring to read

00:21:56.711 --> 00:21:57.960
and certainly boring to write.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.280
That has a lot to say
about my own skill

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:06.110
level and my own development
as a writer as much as anything

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.806
else, but I definitely
had that in my head

00:22:08.806 --> 00:22:10.430
when I started writing
the short story.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.930
And so yes, it was
very intentional.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.227
I wanted you to
never quite be sure

00:22:16.227 --> 00:22:18.310
whether he was thinking
something or saying it out

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.827
loud because I think
sometimes we're not sure

00:22:20.827 --> 00:22:22.910
if we're thinking something
or saying it out loud.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.284
And I actually
think that there's

00:22:24.284 --> 00:22:29.270
an interesting sort
of malleability,

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.210
like the membrane
between those two things

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.650
is actually thinner
than we sometimes think,

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.670
or fiction would
lead us to believe.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.360
So that was the
effect I intended.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.950
And some people hated
it, for the record.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.580
I really liked it too.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.280
But for the book, I
still kept some of that,

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.600
but especially reading
it at book length

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.440
and knowing that the reaction
in some cases had been negative

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:54.689
or at least people had
expressed confusion,

00:22:54.689 --> 00:22:56.980
I didn't want to go with that
style for the whole book.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.350
So I guess you could say
I capitulated to fiction

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:05.360
standards and put a few
of his obviously stated

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.217
words in quotes.

00:23:07.217 --> 00:23:09.300
But there's still plenty
of the little things that

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.130
exist in that gray area
between internal monologue

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.410
and dialogue.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.320
Good to know.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.210
Good data point
because I like it too.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:20.065
Maybe if I find enough
people like you,

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.440
maybe I'll be
brave enough to try

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.315
to write another whole
story with that style.

00:23:26.506 --> 00:23:28.630
AUDIENCE: So one quick
question and one longer one.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:30.250
Where do we find
the short story?

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.328
Is it available online?

00:23:31.328 --> 00:23:32.828
ROBIN SLOAN: It is
available online.

00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:33.356
It is free.

00:23:33.356 --> 00:23:34.730
You can buy it,
of course, if you

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:37.320
want to have it on your
Kindle or just send me $3,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.110
but it's free.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.230
It's on my website.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.170
I'm RobinSloan.com.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.360
And it'll be there forever.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.150
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.800
And the longer
question is, I'm not

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.140
sure I should mention the
surprise that I got when

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.540
I first was reading the book
and turned off the light,

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:55.490
but could you say a little
bit about how that happened?

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.642
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:23:56.642 --> 00:23:58.100
AUDIENCE: I spent
some time looking

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.660
to see if there was
a message there.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.493
And I seemed to have
missed it if there was.

00:24:01.493 --> 00:24:02.880
ROBIN SLOAN: Yeah.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.907
And since you
asked, I have often

00:24:04.907 --> 00:24:06.490
debated whether to
reveal this or not.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.120
I'll just go ahead and
reveal it because maybe it

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.375
will help sell some books.

00:24:10.375 --> 00:24:11.599
MALE SPEAKER: Spoiler alert.

00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:12.890
ROBIN SLOAN: The spoiler alert.

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.875
The cover glows in the
dark which is pretty cool.

00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:18.000
And many people purchase
the book not knowing that.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.550
And truly, I've gotten
some emails sent,

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.555
I think, late at night.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.280
These are very
contemporaneous reports

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.486
as people type I just
woke up because I

00:24:29.486 --> 00:24:34.230
had to go to the bathroom
and something was glowing

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.574
and it was your book.

00:24:36.574 --> 00:24:37.990
So I can't take
any credit for it.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.740
It was the design team at
Farrar, Straus, and Giroux,

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:42.700
the original publisher.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.690
In particular, the cover
designer Rodrigo Corral,

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.550
who's one of the
great book jacket

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.910
designers working right now.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.150
And yeah, they pitched me the
idea and I told them like,

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.070
are you kidding?

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.300
That sounds fantastic.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.320
You do not have to twist my arm.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.820
It has.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.240
It's been a fun surprise
for a lot of people.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.720
And what was the other
part of your question?

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.179
AUDIENCE: Well, is
there a message?

00:25:06.179 --> 00:25:07.678
ROBIN SLOAN: Oh,
is there a message?

00:25:07.678 --> 00:25:09.340
Because of course,
there's a pattern

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.570
of sort of a geometric slightly
abstracted pattern of books

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.190
on the cover.

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.390
The answer is I don't think so.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.870
If there is, I'm
not aware of it.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.340
I will, to be totally candid,
about two or three months

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.180
after the book came
out, it occurred

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.720
to me for the first time,
wait a minute, what is they

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.460
put a code in there?

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.904
What is they put a code
and I don't know about it?

00:25:31.904 --> 00:25:33.820
I've got to know if
there's a code on my book!

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.820
So I did the same thing.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.520
I kind of like counted them up.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.810
I could not devive
any meaning either.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.412
So if there's a code,
it is cunning indeed.

00:25:41.412 --> 00:25:42.912
AUDIENCE: I'm
relieved to hear that.

00:25:42.912 --> 00:25:44.537
I spent some time [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:44.537 --> 00:25:46.870
ROBIN SLOAN: And it is also
not a code of my own design.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:51.630
So see Rodrigo
Corral, code master.

00:25:53.892 --> 00:25:55.600
MALE SPEAKER: We've
had sort of questions

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.762
about your characters and
your stylistic choices.

00:25:58.762 --> 00:26:00.220
One of the questions
I have for you

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.726
is tell us a little bit
about your writing style.

00:26:02.726 --> 00:26:04.600
I mean, do you start
with a detailed outline?

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.307
Or do you kind of let the
story go where it will?

00:26:07.307 --> 00:26:09.140
ROBIN SLOAN: You know,
a little bit of both.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.530
I feel like all my answers
are a little bit of both.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.190
It's complicated.

00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:14.060
But it's true.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.650
And I do start with a
sense of what I'm doing.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:21.340
I'm not one of those people who
sets up a couple of characters

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.830
or a situation and then just
says we'll see what happens.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:29.240
Part of the fun of writing
is finding out as you go.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.760
There is some of
that, of course.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.280
You don't have everything
kind of plotted out

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.294
like a schematic or a blueprint.

00:26:35.294 --> 00:26:36.710
But certainly
writing this book, I

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.070
did have some sense of
what the puzzles were,

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.670
what the great kind of puzzle
is lurking behind the scenes

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:43.940
or going to be.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.760
More than anything else
though, I tell you,

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.650
I feel like the
thing that is really

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.790
the most central
part of my process

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.240
is neither of those things.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.170
It's not the organic kind
of following the characters.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.860
And it's also not that
the schematic outline.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.220
It's something else.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.620
I actually don't know if this is
particularly productive or not,

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.480
but it's my notes.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.350
I'm a diligent
note taker anytime

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.990
I run into anything
weird or interesting

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.070
or something that just
sticks in my brain,

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.030
you know some things just kind
of seem to adhere somehow.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.400
It could be the
name of a street.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.400
You know, you're driving,
you see a street sign,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.130
or it can be something you
overhear in a coffee shop

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:24.960
or whatever.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.500
I write all those things down.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.670
And then I end up typing
them into the computer.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.490
And when I write, I almost
always have that open

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.950
and I'm just kind of swimming
in this soup of weird old stuff,

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.550
things that caught my eye
at one point or another.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:43.490
And often it's almost
like building with LEGOs.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.240
I don't know if you
ever played with LEGOs

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:45.690
but I remember being a kid--

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:46.260
MALE SPEAKER: Too much.

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.759
ROBIN SLOAN: --yeah, I remember
being a kid-- and part of it

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:51.530
is-- actually, I never
thought of this metaphor

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.062
before but it's
actually quite accurate.

00:27:54.062 --> 00:27:55.270
You want to design something.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.103
You want to build
something with your LEGOs,

00:27:57.103 --> 00:28:00.050
but then you're scraping through
and you're kind of like, oh,

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.510
that's such an awesome piece.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:07.120
And you find a way to make
it part of the creation.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.793
And so for me, writing is a
lot like playing with LEGOs.

00:28:09.793 --> 00:28:11.860
MALE SPEAKER: Like those little
neon antennas from the sci-fi--

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:12.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.630
And the--

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.490
MALE SPEAKER: Is that
in the pirate set?

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.880
ROBIN SLOAN: It was.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.184
It was all the space pieces.

00:28:15.184 --> 00:28:16.600
It was all the
glowy space pieces.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.240
Yes.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.455
So a novel for me is an excuse
to use all the glowy space

00:28:19.455 --> 00:28:19.955
pieces.

00:28:19.955 --> 00:28:20.660
Yeah.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:21.495
That's right.

00:28:21.495 --> 00:28:23.370
MALE SPEAKER: So can
you tell us a little bit

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.071
about maybe your
next writing project,

00:28:25.071 --> 00:28:26.070
what you have coming up?

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.820
ROBIN SLOAN: Sure.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.180
Well it's a two part answer.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.340
The one that is
right now, the one

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:36.000
that's kind of the newest
thing is a short story prequel

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.200
to the novel.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.540
It's called "Ajax
Penumbra 1969".

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.080
It takes place in 1969.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.280
And it is about
how this man, who

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.840
would become Mr.
Penumbra, how he arrived

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.480
in San Francisco, why he came
here, what made him stay,

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.250
and what he saw along the way.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.020
And there's a lot
of fun period stuff,

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.759
especially for people who knew
the Bay Area and San Francisco.

00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:59.800
It's, I think, a lot of
things that will make you

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.830
smile and just maybe people
will learn a few things too

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.550
about the origins of BART and
the origins of the internet

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.740
and the stuff buried beneath
the city of San Francisco.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.460
It's actually pretty crazy.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.697
So that's out right now.

00:29:12.697 --> 00:29:13.780
And it's available online.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.404
And I know we have
physical copies here

00:29:15.404 --> 00:29:17.700
for folks in the room.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.880
And I'm working on another novel
as well-- another full length

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.830
novel that is nothing to do
with bookstores, unfortunately.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:29.840
Nothing to do with the
world of Mr. Penumbra,

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.010
but it's a California book.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.415
The story begins
in the Bay Area.

00:29:33.415 --> 00:29:35.415
There's a lot of technology
in it, although sort

00:29:35.415 --> 00:29:37.080
of a different
kind of technology.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.707
And this book is going to
have a lot of food in it.

00:29:42.707 --> 00:29:45.040
AUDIENCE: Going back to the
previous question about sort

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.514
of your writing process,
one of the things I really

00:29:47.514 --> 00:29:48.930
liked when I read
the book was how

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.660
you incorporated a lot
of real world information

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.700
and events and books into it.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.320
And I was wondering
how that factored in

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.270
as you were writing.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.100
ROBIN SLOAN: Sure.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.730
That's a good question.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:00.730
There's two parts there.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.150
There's the books and
there's all the other stuff.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.620
And I have to say, writing
a book about a bookstore

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.650
is like ultimate
license to just stock it

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.650
with all your favorites.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.630
So any title or author
mentioned in this novel

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:14.610
is it's one of my
favorite books.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:18.810
And you can just interpret
all of those mentions as me

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.120
kind of saying I bow
down to the masters

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.560
and paying homage to
the stuff that I've

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.010
read that just really
made a difference

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.230
and made me want to
write in the first place.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.090
So there's that piece of it.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:35.040
The other piece--
the sort of the bits

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.550
of our world, whether it's bits
of software or real companies

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.480
like Google or
real ideas that are

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.797
very much kind of in
the air right now--

00:30:44.797 --> 00:30:46.380
it relates to some
of the things we've

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.270
already talked about
such as the fact

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.160
that these things always seem
present to me and very much

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.600
part of the world.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.510
But I wasn't seeing them
on the page of novels

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:00.040
and I wanted to remedy that.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.740
I guess maybe the most
accurate way to answer

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.700
is that I, as a reader,
I read a lot of novels--

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.052
contemporary novels, a
lot of science fiction--

00:31:10.052 --> 00:31:12.260
and I have always appreciated
the kind of novels that

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:16.080
seem to just like
grab the Zeitgeist

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.330
and crystallize the moment
that we're in right now.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:19.960
I think of William
Gibson as being

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.418
a writer who does
this really well.

00:31:21.418 --> 00:31:24.280
And Neal Stephenson when
he decides he wants to

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.480
is also great at it.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.834
There are plenty more.

00:31:27.834 --> 00:31:28.500
But I love that.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.730
I just love the feeling
of reading a novel.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.370
And It's almost like it's a
lens and the world is getting

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:37.730
kind of collected and probably
distorted it a little bit.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:39.600
But then beamed right
into your brain.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.860
I just think it's one of the
wonderful functions of fiction.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.024
So I guess I wanted to do that.

00:31:46.024 --> 00:31:47.440
They're my favorite
kind of books.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.250
So why not try to write
your favorite kind of book?

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.190
And also, some of it
was just inescapable

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.470
at-- to give you a
concrete example,

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.080
when I worked at
Twitter, I dabbled

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.710
a little bit with
a software platform

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.580
called Hadoop-- this thing for
sort of big data analytics.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.840
I know Google has its
own version of it,

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.670
or it is a version
of something actually

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.100
that Google kind of originated.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:16.150
But using it was so, to me,
striking and interesting,

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.220
and literally kind of creates
these strange new feelings

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.770
like unfamiliar feelings.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.160
It felt very
oracular to me to be

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.580
able to kind of like
ask these questions

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.782
of this vast database.

00:32:27.782 --> 00:32:29.990
And so having done that and
having a fiction writer's

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.130
brain, literally, this
could have been a novel

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.300
about like an 18th
century whaling family.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.350
And somehow, Hadoop
would have been in it.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.294
I don't know how that
would have worked.

00:32:41.294 --> 00:32:43.710
But there are these things
that-- it goes back to the note

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.670
thing-- they just
sticking in your craw.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.850
And they're just kind of
like glued into your brain.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.187
And yeah, so that happens too.

00:32:51.187 --> 00:32:53.020
MALE SPEAKER: What got
glued into your brain

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.940
that kicked off the
Mr. Penumbra storyline?

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.190
ROBIN SLOAN: Well I mean,
here's the honest answer.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.590
I wish it was way
more epic than this.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:03.940
I wish it was that I'd like
wandered into some spooky

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.660
bookstore somewhere and then
the next day it was gone.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.040
In fact, it was a tweet.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.040
It was not even my own tweet.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:15.700
It was a tweet sent by a
friend of mine years ago,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.340
back in late 2008.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:20.990
I remember very vividly exactly
where I was when I read it.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.570
I was walking down California
Street near my neighborhood

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.170
out in the Richmond
in San Francisco.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:34.400
And her tweet said, just misread
a sign for 24-hour book drop

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.110
as 24-hour bookshop.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.930
My disappointment
is beyond words.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.960
Which seemed very
reasonable to me.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.740
I would have been
disappointed as well.

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.620
And I don't know, it
just made me laugh.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.430
It made me think about
24-hour bookstores

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:50.650
and what a terrible
and wonderful idea

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.250
a 24-hour bookstore would be.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:55.709
And more than anything else,
it just stuck in that way

00:33:55.709 --> 00:33:56.750
we've been talking about.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.540
And so I copied it down,
paste it into my notes

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.990
file, which got transmitted
back to the big sort

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.470
of central repository
on my computer.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:08.070
And a few months later
when I was sitting down

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.400
to start a new short story,
I saw it there near the top.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.620
And it just seemed clear to
me that something interesting

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.120
would happen in a
24-hour bookstore.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.159
But if not for that
tweet, in late 2008,

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.690
it would have been 18th
century whalers all the way.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:25.666
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:25.666 --> 00:34:27.040
AUDIENCE: I really
like the book.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.444
And what were some of
your favorite books?

00:34:29.444 --> 00:34:31.610
ROBIN SLOAN: Oh, that's the
hardest question of all.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.760
That's terrible.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.598
What a burdensome question.

00:34:36.598 --> 00:34:37.639
There's too many to list.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:42.785
I will say, so I have to
split my sort of response

00:34:42.785 --> 00:34:44.060
into two streams.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.620
One is because this novel
is very much a quest,

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.120
and of course, it
itself pays homage

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:55.191
to every YA fantasy series
with dragons or elves in it.

00:34:55.191 --> 00:34:57.190
Of course, those are still
some of my favorites.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.730
I don't know if people have
read "The Chronicles of Prydain"

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.100
by Lloyd Alexander.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.780
Still love those. "The Dark
Is Rising" by Susan Cooper.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.820
Slightly, slightly
less well known,

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:12.540
but I think a nearly perfect
YA sort of fantasy series.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.110
"The Dragonlance
Chronicles" by Margaret Weis

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:17.020
and Tracy Hickman.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.800
There's a character in the novel
who met his best friend back

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.404
in sixth grade
because he spied him

00:35:23.404 --> 00:35:24.820
reading this book
across the room.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.390
And I have a friend who
I've known since sixth grade

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:31.920
because I spied him reading
"The Dragonlance Chronicles"

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:37.050
across the room and I was like,
we should probably be friends.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.700
On the other side,
though, there's

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.337
a lot of science
fiction that I love.

00:35:41.337 --> 00:35:43.670
The stuff that I find myself
responding to most strongly

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.740
right now, like
really at this moment,

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.170
is stuff that is sort of
science fiction and sort

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:52.200
of not, stuff that maybe blurs
the boundary between science

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.060
fiction and literary fiction.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:55.830
And there's a
writer, just to name

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.870
one-- I could go on and
on-- but to pick one,

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:02.610
there's a writer named M.
John Harrison who's British.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.970
He's been writing
for a long time.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.950
But his latest books
form a trilogy-- sort

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:09.535
of a loose trilogy.

00:36:09.535 --> 00:36:11.440
The first one's called "Light".

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.730
One's called "Nova Swing".

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:14.710
The third is called
"Empty Space".

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.941
And I mean, I think they belong
on the literary fiction shelf.

00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:20.440
But at the same time, they're
spaceships and quantum physics

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.930
and weird adventures
in lost nebulaes.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:25.510
And it's fantastic stuff.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.570
It's just like truly,
truly awesome writing.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:30.750
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of trilogies,

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:33.170
the sort of goes
to do authors feel

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.380
an obligation to their readers.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.940
After I read the book, and I
read it maybe six months ago,

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.840
I went to Amazon
to read reviews,

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.360
which is always kind of fun.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.670
And one common thread seemed to
be, gosh, I wish it was longer

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:49.410
or gosh I can't wait until
the next one comes out.

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.600
So the prequel is a delight.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.960
But like when one
comment I remember is

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.180
people are going gosh,
what happened with Kat?

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.570
What happened to
the relationship

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.200
between Kat and
the main character?

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.150
Do you have any interest or do
you feel any quotes obligation

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:09.349
towards your readers
to finish that story?

00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:11.390
ROBIN SLOAN: That's such
an interesting question.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:14.690
It's actually a huge question
and weighs so much more

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:18.380
on other frankly far more
successful and established

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.120
writers than me.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.070
I think when you're just
starting out, happily,

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:26.080
there's just not that
many people reading yet.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.470
And so maybe not that
sense of gravity.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:32.250
I think of stories I've heard
of George RR Martin's fans.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:36.010
Whenever he does anything
like he watches a football

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:38.970
or like writes an episode of
the TV show, they're like,

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.810
what do you think you're doing?

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.315
Get back to work.

00:37:45.315 --> 00:37:49.129
Which is just wrong
in so many ways.

00:37:49.129 --> 00:37:49.670
I don't know.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.503
I don't know if I have
a good answer to that

00:37:51.503 --> 00:37:55.410
as I don't think I've
experienced that yet myself.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:38:00.100
And it would, obviously, be a
privilege to experience that.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.250
I think you have to meet
people halfway though.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.750
Nobody wants writers,
readers most of all

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:12.800
don't want writers to just be
story making machines, kind

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.840
of responding to every little
kind of whim and preference.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.250
It's robotic and it's boring.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:24.840
And it doesn't produce the
work that paradoxically

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.820
inspires that kind of devotion.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.440
So there has to be
some independence

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.310
and some sense of
I'm a do my thing.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.380
But on the other
hand, I also don't

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.032
believe in locking
yourself away.

00:38:37.032 --> 00:38:38.380
Let me put it this way.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.980
If I get enough emails from
people clamoring for more, then

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.470
maybe I'll consider it.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.240
I've only gotten a few so far.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.550
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for joining us, Robin.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:48.880
ROBIN SLOAN: Thank you so
much for your [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.463
Thank you all.

00:38:49.463 --> 00:38:53.720
[APPLAUSE]
