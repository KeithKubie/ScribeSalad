perspective first of all I think that we

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:17.550
perspective first of all I think that we
 

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.780
perspective first of all I think that we
should see more of action again what

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:20.790
should see more of action again what
 

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.470

together but secondly I think it's also

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000
together but secondly I think it's also
 

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.269
together but secondly I think it's also
important that we think of what are the

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279
important that we think of what are the
 

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.430
important that we think of what are the
different roles so for example even if

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440
different roles so for example even if
 

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.290
different roles so for example even if
we see all these companies and I also

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300
we see all these companies and I also
 

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.740
we see all these companies and I also

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:21.790
credit 480,000 job has been created
 

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.030
credit 480,000 job has been created
during this time so there is a massive

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040
during this time so there is a massive
 

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.280
during this time so there is a massive
structural change all the time on the

abroad to other countries that Sweden
 

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.030
abroad to other countries that Sweden
has the black belt in structural change

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040
has the black belt in structural change
 

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.549
has the black belt in structural change
and that's something good because we

00:12:35.549 --> 00:12:35.559
and that's something good because we
 

00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:37.470
and that's something good because we
have decided in Sweden that we won't

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:37.480
have decided in Sweden that we won't
 

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.789

defend old jobs but we defend people in
change so if they lose their job they

00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:44.739
change so if they lose their job they
 

00:12:44.739 --> 00:12:47.039
change so if they lose their job they
should feel that they have new rights to

00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:47.049
should feel that they have new rights to
 

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:49.829

skills or education to go further or

00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839
skills or education to go further or
 

00:12:49.839 --> 00:12:52.439
skills or education to go further or
they have a solid insurance system that

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:52.449
they have a solid insurance system that
 

00:12:52.449 --> 00:12:54.479

their house because they get unemployed

00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:57.009
their house because they get unemployed
 

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:59.789

because they feel security in change I

00:12:59.789 --> 00:12:59.799
because they feel security in change I
 

00:12:59.799 --> 00:13:03.150
because they feel security in change I
think that's a very relevant aspect of

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160
think that's a very relevant aspect of
 

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.819
think that's a very relevant aspect of
this situation now where change is

00:13:05.819 --> 00:13:05.829
this situation now where change is
 

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:08.309
this situation now where change is
happening faster people must follow and

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:08.319
happening faster people must follow and
 

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:10.590
happening faster people must follow and
then you have to not be afraid of change

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600
then you have to not be afraid of change
 

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.960
then you have to not be afraid of change
but as feel that there is a security in

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:12.970
but as feel that there is a security in
 

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.759
but as feel that there is a security in

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:14.769
change so I think Sweden has a good
 

00:13:14.769 --> 00:13:15.070
change so I think Sweden has a good
model

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:15.080
model
 

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.050
model
as well are you prepared to handle that

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:17.060
as well are you prepared to handle that
 

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.540
as well are you prepared to handle that
change these sort of anymore we have to

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:19.550
change these sort of anymore we have to
 

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.430
change these sort of anymore we have to
do more because basically we've always

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440
do more because basically we've always
 

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.530
do more because basically we've always
talked about basic skills now we talked

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:23.540
talked about basic skills now we talked
 

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.080
talked about basic skills now we talked
about different skills also on people

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.090
about different skills also on people
 

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.200
about different skills also on people
that have a university degree might be

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.210
that have a university degree might be
 

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.930
that have a university degree might be
be forced to take a different core an

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:31.940
be forced to take a different core an
 

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.330
be forced to take a different core an
extra cores to actually fit in on labor

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:34.340
extra cores to actually fit in on labor
 

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.670
extra cores to actually fit in on labor
market to transform so I think the

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680
market to transform so I think the
 

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.460
market to transform so I think the
concept of lifelong learning is being

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:39.470
concept of lifelong learning is being
 

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.620
concept of lifelong learning is being
really challenged by this rapid

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:41.630
really challenged by this rapid
 

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.840
really challenged by this rapid
transformation I think Sweden has a lot

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:43.850
transformation I think Sweden has a lot
 

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.880
transformation I think Sweden has a lot
more to do here to actually keep up the

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:45.890
more to do here to actually keep up the
 

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.320
more to do here to actually keep up the
pace and I think other countries are

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:47.330
pace and I think other countries are
 

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.690
pace and I think other countries are
doing more now so we cannot rely that

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:49.700
doing more now so we cannot rely that
 

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.030
doing more now so we cannot rely that
Sweden has a top position I think we

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040
Sweden has a top position I think we
 

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.860
Sweden has a top position I think we
have to do more and I think we need with

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:53.870
have to do more and I think we need with
 

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:58.240
have to do more and I think we need with
your teachers to think of less than that

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:58.250
your teachers to think of less than that
 

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.970
your teachers to think of less than that
people are experts and more of in a
