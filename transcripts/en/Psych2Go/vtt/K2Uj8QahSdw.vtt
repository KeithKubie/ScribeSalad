00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
(intro)

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.439
Depression and mental illnesses are different for everyone

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.559
With this list we are not trying to generalize

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.259
Instead we've compiled certain things individuals with Depression have disclosed they struggle with

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.070
Can you relate to any of these or know someone who might?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.410
Here are 11 things people with depression would like their family and friends to understand

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.419
One. it's not as simple as eating healthier and exercising more

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:46.180
While we appreciate you trying to help us the underlying condition isn't always solved that easily; it still feels like your feelings

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.970
Are being invalidated if things aren't phrased carefully.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.069
Two - it's not always easy to understand why things are this way.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:02.048
Depression doesn't always have a specific trigger. It just happens. It's more complicated than just feeling sad because we got a bad grade

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:05.289
Assumptions like this are diminishing our experiences

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.790
3

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.229
Sometimes there's no emotion sometimes there's too much

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.200
It often isn't very clear why either.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.310
We'd like to understand it better ourselves but depression can make you feel a wide variety of confusing things.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.180
Four - It's not that we're not trying hard enough

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120
No one wants to have depression

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.919
Telling us this when we are trying our hardest is dismissing our struggle. It's hurtful

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.389
5 - we can't just snap out of it. If it was possible to simply get over it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520
We would have done it a long time ago

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.549
It's not a mood that you can come out of when you're done

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.659
6-  we don't want to hurt others.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.440
We hate to feel like an annoyance because of our illness

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.400
We don't want to cause the people around us pain because of what we're going through

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.329
7 - we feel like a burden

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.900
Reassurance might not magically solve our depression, but it can help us open up the better feelings

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.670
We need validation that were not an annoyance to be able to relax around you

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.629
8

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.629
We appreciate your efforts

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.409
We notice you trying to help us and we are very grateful

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.349
Reaching out to us is already a ray of light

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.170
but please remember

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.139
9 - we aren't asking you to fix us

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.789
Being there for us and showing that you're trying to understand is enough

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.109
We aren't asking you for solutions and as well intended as it may be sometimes we just need someone who will listen

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.740
10 - it's not your fault

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.659
There's no one single factor that causes depression. It's an illness

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.010
Certain things can contribute to it, but it's nobody's fault

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.540
11 - we appreciate you asking what you can do for us.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.219
Sometimes it's not easy for us to pinpoint what we need. That's why some people might find it easier if you ask more specific

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.400
Things like can I get you some tea maybe?

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.419
Want to go for a walk ? it might not seem like much

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.140
But it might help a person realize what they really need at the moment

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.610
Do you have any other things you wish your friends and family would understand?
