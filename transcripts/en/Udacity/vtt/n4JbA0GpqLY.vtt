00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.830
In this problem, we're going to use the same

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.190
combination lock as before. And once you write

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.430
a program, create combo lock, to generate a

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.780
combination lock graph given a list of nodes.
