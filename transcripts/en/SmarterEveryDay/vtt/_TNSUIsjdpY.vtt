00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey, it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day (SED).

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.700
So excited about this video

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.300
In the last episode of SED

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.380
I showed you my transparent potato gun,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.840
at 3,000 fps during the day.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.840
3, 2, 1

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.420
But this episode it's going to be the same transparent potato gun,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.240
meaning we can look directly into the science

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.900
at night, at 20,000 fps.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.360
Google up! Science is about to happen.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.160
What happens, if I start the ignition of the potato gun

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.360
from the back?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.360
vs. What happens, if I start it from the middle?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.820
I always thought it would have worked better

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.500
if you go from the middle,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
'cause you get even expansion of those gases.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.880
But, let's record it in high-speed, and let's see what the difference is, between the two.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.240
We'll go from the back first!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We got some potato juices in there.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780
3, 2, 1

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.080
(laughter)

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.620
It's like 9 o'clock.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.520
Alright, let's see it in high-speed.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400
It's completely awesome.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.820
We saw that it started at one end and went all the way to the end.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.280
Now, I'm gonna take this, it's a grill-ignitor,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.080
You can see the little zaps there.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.020
I've got electrodes, set up in the center of the potato gun

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.580
and we're going to zap it from the center

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.720
and we should get a more even combustion, right?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960
So, let me hook it up and then we'll give it a shot.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.200
literally.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.080
Loading the potato gun again.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.480
3, 2, 1

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.000
(laughter)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.740
It doesn't get old!

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.680
Was that cool, or what?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.060
Ok, so check it out, so this is my combustion chamber, right?

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.560
The first time I shot this thing, it was a flint-sparker on the end of this thing, right?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.280
If I hold it, you can see a twist

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.960
and I get the spark.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.280
What you saw on the second time - here are my electrodes that I told you about

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.209
going to hit this button you can see
down in there. Can you see what I'm

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.709
sparking right there in the middle?

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.280
That's how I fired that thing. When we
first start the combustion from the end

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.569
it's a wave

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.019
you've got an oxygen/fuel mixture that
goes all the way down to the combustion

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.360
chamber; when we start right in the
middle,

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.310
we start to expand, we start using that
fuel and using that oxygen, but we run

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.739
out of oxygen before we burn all the
fuel. We're going to shoot this thing

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.549
from the end, we're going to zoom in with
a high-speed directly on the combustion

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.400
chamber and we're gonna see if we can
see that flame front moving one

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.470
Mississippi two Mississippi three
Mississippi four Mississippi three two

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.820
one

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.780
Ok, before i show you the next slow mo, I
want you to understand that it has

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.070
enough information in it to provide for
several phd's ,so I want you to be on the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.010
lookout for a couple of key things that
I find interesting.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.370
#1 When the explosion moves
towards the closed off into the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.790
combustion chamber, unless the fuel/air
mixture is just perfect,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.000
sometimes you'll run out of oxygen and
have unburned fuel

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.870
this creates a compressed pocket of fuel,
that stays unburned until it turns into

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.190
a rarefaction and pulls more oxygen back
in through the barrel, to burn it up

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.520
#2 There's something that
happens in combustion chambers called

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.110
"sidewall cooling" basically the pipe
itself cools the gases down below the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.200
combustion point, so it can't burn right next
to the wall

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.170
this leaves more unburned fuel and
actually counts for most of the

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.660
pollution products caused by the engine
in your car

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.990
The slow-motion you're about to see is
real. I haven't ran the speed, to make it

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.010
look more interesting,

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.390
It's just pure awesome footage. Straight
out of a high-speed cameras.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:41.800
Watch what happens, as the explosion over
expands, the system has to equalize so it

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.970
pulls air back in through the barrel
,into the combustion chamber, which causes

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.630
that fresh oxygen in the air to meet up
with the remaining fuel and start the

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.630
burning process all over again.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.330
It's a pretty inefficient way to burn a
fuel rich mixture;

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
so I think my original hypothesis might
be wrong.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.920
I think it's cool that when the gas
squeezes down into the barrel from the

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.850
combustion chamber, it has to speed up so
that it can maintain the exact same flow

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.460
rate

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.340
One of the things I love about science,
is the ability to look at a complex

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.910
dynamic system like this and try to
understand every physical phenomenon

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.530
that's occurring, but equally important to
me personally is the ability to look at

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.710
footage like this and say "you know,
that's pretty."

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.120
To summarize, what we've learned tonight,
think about this: when you have a

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.500
combustion chamber

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.920
we've learned that it depends not only
on the localized chemistry or the

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.310
stoichiometry, the fuel/air mixture at
any point inside that combustion chamber;

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.590
it also depends on how its vented it's
really fascinating the dynamics of

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.480
venting a combustion chamber effect
directly the ability to create localized

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.380
pressures and rarefactions sometimes at
the end of the video when the add part

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.140
comes up you kind of roll your eyes ,because
you're not excited about it.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.590
Well, this time is different, you see,
SED is supported by

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.070
audible.com and they have supported me for a
really long time and it's a really big deal

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.310
because it's kind of expensive to afford videos like this.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.090
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create an audible event so that you can

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.690
remember to support SED at
audible.com/smarter.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.950
We're going to create the same flame
front that we did before, only we're not

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.160
going to contain both sides of it we're
going to vent one side

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.980
I want you to listen to this huge
audible vent and then we'll look at high

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.660
speed ready? 3, 2, 1... It's on fire!

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.600

that's it.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.870
I'm Destin you're getting smarter every
day have a good one

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.530
(inaudible) i ... going at
watermelons. Yeah and I'm record in slow

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.220
motion

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.630
You are?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.430
Yeah. Is that cool? - That's what they all say...
 You don't do it at night too?

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.430
Is that all right? - It's your property, do
what you want to do on it. You do anything

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.430
you want to do over here! You ain't going to bother
me

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.780
I think it's time to go to bed
