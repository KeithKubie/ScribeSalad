00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
One last thing I'd like to talk about with and --

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'll show you right now.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's make this all be one line again.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay--so I Update this and we have one line.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We can put a tag in the middle of this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We don't actually have to have the line breaks in our HTML.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So when I click Update, we get our line break--

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
no matter how the HTML is formatted.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So we can format this however we want--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
put all these spaces in here--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and when we Update this,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
it'll always come out the same.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There's an example--all this Whitespace turns into one single space.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
All of these new lines here turn into one single space.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You know--this text, space, is really--you know--you get the idea. Okay.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Why do we have two different ways of making new lines?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Why do we have a tag and a &gt;p&gt; tag?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The answer is because the tag is what we call "inline",

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and the tag is what we call "block".

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now--so what the tag was actually doing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
was just ending a line.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So when we have some text and we put a in the middle of it,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it just basically says: the line ends here,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and this guy wraps to the next line.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The tag works differently; the tag

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
actually makes an invisible box.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So when we have an HTML that looks like this--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
this creates an actual box.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So instead of just rendering text, blank line--

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
what this is actually rendering is something sort of like this:

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You've got two lines of text, and there's actually this invisible box around text.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And that's what the tag does,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is it makes this invisible box and this invisible box

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
can actually have height and it can have width--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
where inline elements are just text.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So the example over here would be more like this:

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so it's just two lines of text, and there's really just a little new line here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There's nothing fancy going on.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And the difference between inline and block elements

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
will come up a fair amount later in this course.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And it's just important to know that there's a distinction

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and they have kind of different behavior.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So far, all of the elements we've learned--other than --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
are inline elements.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So inline elements are: &lt;b&gt;, --&lt;/b&gt;

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
even is an inline element.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And we saw how, before, our little image

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
appeared right in the middle of the text.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's because it's inline.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So far, the only block element we've learned is the element.
