00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.710
At the center of our galaxy is a black hole
with the mass of 4 million suns called Sagittarius

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.160
A*.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.870
Around it is a complicated structure of dust
and gas, and after 12 years of peering into

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.500
it, astronomers have discovered several objects
they weren’t expecting to find.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.740
Objects that have some unusual characteristics.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.699
They’re called G objects.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.820
They orbit around Sagittarius A* and have
a dusty appearance.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.160
The first one, imaginatively named G1, was
found in 2004.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.030
G2 was spotted in 2012, and G3, G4, and G5
were just announced in the summer of 2018.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.020
There’s no G6 yet, but I expect when they
find it it’ll move with a Far East Movement.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.530
Nobody under 20 gets that reference.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.550
They look like dust clouds, and astronomers
thought they might just be dust clouds too.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.660
Back when only G1 and G2 had been spotted
they had a very similar orbit, so one hypothesis

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
was they were once part of the same dust cloud
that had been stretched out until it formed

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.531
smaller clumps like beads on a string, a process
that has been observed elsewhere in the universe.

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:09.100
But when these fast moving objects passed
close to Sagittarius A*, they didn’t behave

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.750
how dust clouds should.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.900
See a supermassive black hole would rip a
dust cloud to shreds, but G1 and G2 stayed

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.020
in tact, so they must be something else entirely.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.829
Astronomers deduced they most likely have
a stellar core that’s massive enough to

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.360
keep them intact.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.350
So they’re probably stars.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.220
Huge stars that are so big and bloated that
as they pass by the black hole, the tidal

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.180
forces rip matter out of the stellar atmosphere.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.280
G objects are bigger and put out more energy
than typical stars too, so in all likelihood,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.620
they’re two stars that have merged together.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.350
It’s possible that binary star systems around
Sagittarius A* could be forced together because

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.049
of the black hole’s influence.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.620
This merger would boost energy output and
give the new object a distended appearance,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.610
perhaps for millions of years, until the new
object settles down and looks more like a

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.759
normal sized star.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.590
If these G objects are in fact merging binary
stars, they could help us learn what causes

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.440
stellar mass black hole mergers too, like
the ones we’ve recently detected using gravitational

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.440
waves.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.830
G3, G4, and G5 have yet to be observed passing
close by Sagittarius A*, so we’ll keep a

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.620
close eye on them to make sure they really
are G objects that stay intact.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.170
The next G object we can observe fly close
to the black hole will be G3, 20 years from

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.170
now.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.090
Until then we’ll keep studying them to learn
more about the chaotic environment at our

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.530
galaxy’s center.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.470

by subscribing to our channel, and to find

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.040
out what black holes sound like when they
smash into each other, check out Maren’s

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.330
video here..

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.900
These new G objects were spotted and tracked
thanks to special software that mapped spectral

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.700
data from our galactic center in 3 dimensions.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.690
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker!
