00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.847
Factor t squared
plus 8t plus 15.

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:05.430
So let's just think
about what happens

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.270
if we multiply two binomials
t plus a times t plus b.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.850
And I'm using t
here because t is

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.890
the variable in the polynomial
that we need to factor.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.810
So if you multiply
this out, applying

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.220
the distributive property
twice or using FOIL,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.240
you get t times t,
which is t squared.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.020
Plus t times b, which is bt.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.030
Plus a times t, which is at.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.432
Plus a times b, which is ab.

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:34.140
We essentially multiplied
every term here

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.410
by every term over there.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.950
And then we have two t terms,
I guess you could call them,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.810
this bt plus at.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.210
So we could combine those.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.890
And we get t squared
plus a plus bt--

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.870
I could have written this as
b plus at as well-- plus ab.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.750
Now, if we compare this
to this right over here,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750
we see that we have
a similar pattern.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.670
Our coefficient on the
second degree term is 1.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.750
Our coefficient on the
second degree term here is 1.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.260
We didn't have to write it.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.320
Then a plus b is the
coefficient on t.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.550
So 8 right over here,
this 8 could be a plus b.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.680
And then finally, our constant
term, ab, that could be 15.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.880
So if we wanted to
factor this out,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.670
we just have to find and a and
a b where their product is 15

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.382
and their sum is 8 in general.

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:29.340
In general, if you ever
see-- and I'll write it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.690
in the more traditional
with an x variable--

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.120
if you see anything of the
form x squared plus bx plus c,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.620
the coefficient here is 1.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.930
Then you just have
to find two numbers

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.370
whose sum is equal to
this thing right here

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.840
and whose product is equal
to that thing right there.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.680
Whose sum is equal to 8 and
whose product is equal to 15.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.050
So what are two numbers that add
up to 8 whose products are 15?

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.390
So if you just factor
15, it could be 1 and 15.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.340
Those don't add up
to 8 in any way.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.270
3 and 5, those do add up to 8.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
So a and b could be 3 and 5.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.800
So a and b, this
could be 3 times 5,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.250
and then 8 is 3 plus 5.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.510
Now we could just go straight
and factor this and say,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.400
hey, this is t plus
3 times t plus 5,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.320
since we already
figured out a and b are.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.600
But what I want to do is kind
of factor this by grouping.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.430
So I'm essentially going
to go in reverse steps

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.610
from what I just showed you.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.290
So this polynomial
right here, I'm

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.020
going to write it as t squared
plus-- instead of writing

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.090
8t I'm going to write it
as the sum of at plus bt,

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.870
or as the sum of 3t plus 5t.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.570
So plus 3t plus 5t.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.760
So essentially
I've started here.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.760
And then I'm going to
this step where I break up

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.380
that middle term into
the coefficients that

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.640
add up to the 8.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.980
And then finally plus 15.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.440
And now I can factor
it by grouping.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.610
These two guys right over
here have a common factor t.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.480
And then these two guys over
here have a common factor 5.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.431
So let's factor out the t
in this first expression

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:12.430
right over here, or this
part of the expression.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.680
So it's t times t plus 3.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.400
Plus-- and then over here,
if you factor out a 5

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.660
you get a 5-- times t plus 3.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.170
5t divided by 5 is t.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.110
15 divided by 5 is 3.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.040
And now you can
factor out a t plus 3.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.230
You have a t plus
3 being multiplied

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.720
times both of these terms.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.340
So let's factor that out.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.925
So it becomes t plus
3 times t plus 5.

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:45.830
Let me write that plus
a little bit neater.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.440
Times t plus 5.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.120
And we are done.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.590
But we actually didn't even
have to do this grouping step,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.551
although hopefully you
see that it does work.

00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:59.550
We could have just said,
look, from this pattern

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.640
over here I have two
numbers that add up to 8

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.950
and their product is 15.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.550
So this must be t
plus 3 times t plus 5.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.050
Or t plus 5 times t
plus 3, either way.
