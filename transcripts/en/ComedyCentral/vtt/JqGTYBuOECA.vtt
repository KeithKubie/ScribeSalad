00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.437
it's time
for tonight's #HashtagWars.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.973
(cheering)

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.442
This may not come
as any surprise to you,

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.110
but this year's
presidential nominees

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.980
are the least popular
of all time.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:15.282
One of the main things
people are saying is that, uh,

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:17.251
they're gonna be voting
for the lesser of two evils.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.186
But if we vote
for the lesser of two evils,

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.054
we still end up with-- an evil.

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.189
-(laughter)
-Uh...

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.991
but there have
to be better reasons

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.360
for electing the next president
of our United States of America.

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.228
That's why tonight's hashtag is
#ImVotingBecause.

00:00:28.262 --> 00:00:30.464
And it's very important,
you need to get out and vote,

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.766
you need to get out and vote
or you can't (bleep) complain.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.701
-(cheering, applause)
-That's it. You can't...

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.803
you don't get to complain.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.472
It is...

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.342
it is our right as Americans
to bitch

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.810
as long as you vote.

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:46.246
As long as you vote,
you can bitch all you want.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.216
So, examples might be-- I want
to feel superior to teens,

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.486
or, I'm gonna use that "I voted"
sticker to cover a scar.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.389
I put 60 seconds on the clock,
and begin.

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.824
-Johnathan. -I'm voting
because I look like this.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.726
-All right, points.
-(laughter, whooping, applause)

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.994
Alice.

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.497
-Wait, when is it?
-Uh, points.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.033
-Uh, Johnathan.
-I'm voting because if I don't,

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.235
my <i>12 Years a Slave </i>
screenplay book club

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.838
-would be very upset with me.
-All right, points.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.005
Alice Wetterlund.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.641
Um, I heard 3K
and an "I voted" sticker

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.944
-gets you into <i>Hamilton.</i>
-All right, points.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:19.112
-Jordan.
-I'm voting because feminism

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:21.448
is the new patriarchy,
and I'm here for it.

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:23.450
-WETTERLUND: Whoo!
-All right, points.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.619
-Alice Wetterlund.
-Okay, okay, I'm voting

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.222
because there's a difference
between unpopular and evil.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.990
-All right. Points.
-Okay.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.358
-(applause)
-Jordan.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.261
I'm voting because these fingers
are not for picking,

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:36.930
-they're for rolling, okay?
Um... -All right, points.

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:38.398
-(applause)
-Johnathan.

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:40.701
I'm voting because
I have Tuesday off, so...

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.904
Yeah, okay, points.
Yeah, (bleep). Come on.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.038
Yeah, Jordan.

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:46.540
I'm voting because
my Mexican mechanic

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.108
said he'd give me a deal
if I did.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.610
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:52.379
Points. Alice.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.182
Uh, I like saying
I did a civic duty.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.018
HARDWICK:
Yes, points.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.118
(laughing):
You, good answer.
