00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.260
Let's take the
indefinite integral

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.990
of the square root
of 7x plus 9 dx.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.290
So my first question
to you is, is this

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.060
going to be a good case
for u-substitution?

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.830
Well, when you look here,
maybe the natural thing

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.880
to set to be equal
to u is 7x plus 9.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.204
But do I see its derivative
anywhere over here?

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:24.870
Well, let's see.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.120
If we set u to be
equal to 7x plus 9,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.410
what is the derivative of u
with respect to x going to be?

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.310
Derivative of u
with respect to x

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.080
is just going to be equal to 7.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.470
Derivative of 7x is 7.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.650
Derivative of 9 is 0.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.190
So do we see a 7 lying
around anywhere over here?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.580
Well, we don't.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.340
But what could we do in order
to have a 7 lying around,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.280
but not change the
value of the integral?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.956
Well, the neat thing-- and we've
seen this multiple times-- is

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.330
when you're
evaluating integrals,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.240
scalars can go in and outside
of the integral very easily.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.920
Just to remind ourselves, if I
have the integral of let's say

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.690
some scalar a times
f of x dx, this

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.420
is the same thing as a times
the integral of f of x dx.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.340
The integral of the
scalar times a function

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.650
is equal to the scalar times
the integral of the functions.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.280
So let me put this
aside right over here.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.630
So with that in mind, can
we multiply and divide

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.710
by something that will
have a 7 showing up?

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.330
Well, we can multiply
and divide by 7.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.830
So imagine doing this.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.580
Let's rewrite our
original integral.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.960
So let me draw a
little arrow here just

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.420
to go around that aside.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.100
We could rewrite our
original integral

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.340
as being 9 to the integral
of times 1/7 times 7 times

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.980
the square root of 7x plus 9 dx.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.064
And if we want to, we
could take the 1/7 outside

00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:00.730
of the integral.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.270
We don't have to,
but we can rewrite

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.620
this as 1/7 times
the integral of 7,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.130
times the square
root of 7x plus 9 dx.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.840
So now if we set u
equal to 7x plus 9,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.860
do we have its
derivative laying around?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.410
Well, sure.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.350
The 7 is right over here.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.000
We know that du-- if we want to
write it in differential form--

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.060
du is equal to 7 times dx.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.460
So du is equal to 7 times dx.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.320
That part right over
there is equal to du.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.320
And if we want to care
about u, well, that's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.050
just going to be the 7x plus 9.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.520
That is are u.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.272
So let's rewrite this indefinite
integral in terms of u.

00:02:45.272 --> 00:02:53.120
It's going to be equal to
1/7 times the integral of--

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.160
and I'll just take the 7
and put it in the back.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.710
So we could just
write the square root

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:06.450
of u du, 7 times dx is du.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.110
And we can rewrite this if we
want as u to the 1/2 power.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.320
It makes it a little bit
easier for us to kind of do

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.490
the reverse power rule here.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:20.940
So we can rewrite this as equal
to 1/7 times the integral of u

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.751
to the 1/2 power du.

00:03:23.751 --> 00:03:25.000
And let me just make it clear.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.680
This u I could have
written in white

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.960
if I want it the same color.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.100
And this du is the same
du right over here.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.790
So what is the antiderivative
of u to the 1/2 power?

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.050
Well, we increment
u's power by 1.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.010
So this is going to be
equal to-- let me not

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.260
forget this 1/7 out front.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.110
So it's going to be 1/7 times--
if we increment the power here,

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.520
it's going to be u to the 3/2,
1/2 plus 1 is 1 and 1/2 or 3/2.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.280
So it's going to
be u to the 3/2.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.140
And then we're going to
multiply this new thing

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.980
times the reciprocal
of 3/2, which is 2/3.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.840
And I encourage you to verify
the derivative of 2/3 u

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.630
to the 3/2 is
indeed u to the 1/2.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.750
And so we have that.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.450
And since we're
multiplying 1/7 times

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.440
this entire indefinite
integral, we

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.560
could also throw in a
plus c right over here.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.430
There might have
been a constant.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.990
And if we want, we can
distribute the 1/7.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:36.170
So it would get 1/7 times
2/3 is 2/21 u to the 3/2.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.750
And 1/7 times some
constant, well, that's

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.210
just going to be some constant.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.959
And so I could write
a constant like that.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:44.510
I could call that c1 and
then I could call this c2,

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.140
but it's really just
some arbitrary constant.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.850
And we're done.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.183
Oh, actually, no we aren't done.

00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:51.520
We still just have our
entire thing in terms of u.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.290
So now let's unsubstitute it.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.290
So this is going to be equal
to 2/21 times u to the 3/2.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.710
And we already know
what u is equal to.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.060
u is equal to 7x plus 9.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.720
Let me put a new color here
just to ease the monotony.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.460
So it's going to be
2/21 times 7x plus 9

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.770
to the 3/2 power plus c.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.030
And we are done.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.500
We were able to take a kind
of hairy looking integral

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.120
and realize that even
though it wasn't completely

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.869
obvious at first, that
u-substitution is applicable.
