GWEN MCNAMARA:
One day when I was

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.040
trying to think about
finding time in my day

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.394
to disconnect a little
bit and take a break,

00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:10.810
I decided, you
know what, I'm just

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.570
gonna put on my sneakers or
whatever and I'm just gonna walk.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.403
I'm just gonna walk in a
particular direction.

00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:19.150
And so just happened to come
past the -- by the neuroscience

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.170
building and I saw
this little trail --

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.830
this little rock and
a little inviting

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.980
path that wended into
the woods a little bit.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.160
And I thought, huh, I
wonder where that goes?

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.420
And it was beautiful.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.530
It was just so
lovely to escape just

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.740
for a little bit, the
asphalt, and the buildings

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.640
and feel like you were
diving back into the woods.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.680
It's nice to be able to
walk in and you immediately

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.920
begin to see the dappled
sunshine as it filters

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.830
through the leaves and
plays with light and shadows

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.000
on the ground.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.030
I tend to be looking
down as I'm going

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.310
and can see who's
been there too.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.830
So when you see
some animal prints --

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.510
sometimes you can hear
a bird off to the side

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.010
and if you're lucky be able to
spot it before it disappears.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.770
But just noticing everything
from the small details

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.880
of the wildflowers, or the
leaves, to the larger trees,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.180
it's just really calming and
beautiful to walk down and lose

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.310
yourself in these surroundings.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.170
My grandfather, on my
dad's side, had a farm.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.060
And so growing up we spent
a ton of our time as kids

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.980
just exploring and having fun.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.430
And so, for me, when I think
about places and periods

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.980
of time that bring
me joy, it's always

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.930
seems to be tied to nature.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.330
And it makes me
feel better knowing

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.760
that maybe something
I'm worrying about, maybe

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.070
it's not such a big deal in
the grand scheme of things.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.820
