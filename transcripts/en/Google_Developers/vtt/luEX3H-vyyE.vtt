JOSH LIVNI: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.900
My name is Josh Livni,
welcome to Google

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.450
Maps Developers Live.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.720
So this week I want to talk to
you about a new layer in the

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.620
Maps API that lets you render
private or public content

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.490
that's stored in Google
Maps Engine in a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.800
pretty cool new way.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.940
So to get a little bit of
context, first I want to show

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.090
you here on my screen a
demonstration of our Maps

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.670
Engine layer, which has been
out for awhile, and renders

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.830
data sets that are stored
in Google Maps Engine.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.570
So what I have here is some
watersheds, some reasonably

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.680
complex polygons.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.100
Not too many of them, but it
could potentially be millions

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.380
of features here.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.960
Same general technique.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.850
And the workflow that's going
on behind the scenes is this

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.860
data is being rendered on our
servers as image tiles.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.560
There's a lot of products that
sort of use the same approach,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.610
so nothing particularly
new here.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.800
And what we can do generally
with this approach is we get a

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.300
little slightly different
cursor as we mouse over.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.210
We can have click events.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.840
Usually it opens
an info window.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.920
Here I'm just zooming into
that particular feature.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.740
So nothing new here.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.120
That's our Maps Engine layer.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.970
It's cool, lets you display
tons of complex data sets.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.630
Very fast.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.020
You'll notice as we
zoom in and out it

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.850
renders very quickly.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.130
So now let's take a look at our
new dynamic Maps Engine

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.260
layer, and some of
the differences.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.590
So here we have the exact same
data set, exact same sort of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.900
general code, except we're
calling the dynamic Maps

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.610
Engine layer instead of the Maps
Engine layer in our code.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.840
And I've added some
extra handling.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.010
And some of handling that we
can do is take advantage of

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.760
new mouse events.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.700
So you'll notice as I hover
over, I'm dynamically

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.540
redrawing the polygons that
I'm getting mouse over and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.160
mouse out events on.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.930
And when I click on a polygon
here, what it's doing is it's

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.340
loading up another Maps engine
layer, a dynamic Maps Engine

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.810
layer, excuse me, of the sub

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.620
watersheds for a given watershed.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.200
And similarly here as I mouse
over, I get different events

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.910
getting fired from the dynamic
Maps Engine layer, and I can

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.900
pay attention to those
and redraw.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.000
I can also, if you take a look
at the info box on the left,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.759
get some information from the
features, and put some

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.210
information in there.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.670
And the way that I'm doing that
on the back end is I'm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.210
using the Maps Engine API
to download some feature

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.490
information, and then
do a look up.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.940
As I mouse over here I get the
feature ID, I do a look up

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.960
into the Maps Engine API
response, and paint that

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.920
information, such as the area
of the sub watershed in this

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.270
little box here.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.300
So a lot of cool things you
can do with this kind of

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.990
almost instantaneous redraw.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.980
What's going on behind the
scenes here is similarly,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.960
we're rendering tiles, but this
time it's vector tiles.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.990
And these vector tiles are kind
of optimized for the zoom

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.750
level that you're at, simplified
and so forth.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.690
So you get a really snappy
responses as you zoom in,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.780
seeing all of the data in a
nice, kind of small vector

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.340
format, and you get this
extra interactivity.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.710
So there's a lot of things
you can do here.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.480
So just a quick look at our
documentation on some ways to

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.370
get started.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.080
If you're interested in
rendering public content, you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.390
can do that as well.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.440
People who have stored public
data sets in Maps Engine, or

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.760
of course if you have your own
private data, you can use

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.070
OAuth, and just make sure that
the people that you want to

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.210
have access to it can access
your data using the dynamic

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.020
Maps Engine layer.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.530
The documentation here is under
Libraries, under our

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.360
JavaScript documentation.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.810
So go to Libraries,
Visualization Library, and

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.100
then Maps Engine Layer.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.570
And we have some simple
examples to

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.100
kind of get you started.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.580
You'll notice here the Maps
Engine layer, we have just a

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.900
basic click on a polygon.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.740
We get kind of our
info window.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.930
Scroll down the dynamic
Maps Engine layer.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.260
We can redraw on the fly with
different kinds of effects

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.600
just on hover.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.380
So, pretty cool.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.090
We look forward to seeing
what kind of stuff

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.720
you build with this.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.230
Let us know on feedback
below this video,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.910
or on Google+ Twitter.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.270
We love to see the kinds of
things you guys are doing, and

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.900
hope you enjoy the new dynamic
Maps Engine layer.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.440
Until next time, I'm Josh Livni,
have a great week.
