00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.930
Let's talk about some of
the great innovations that

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.890
are happening at local
levels in our workplaces

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.190
across the country.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.190
If you're like me,
I'm sure you're

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.570
frustrated with
the gridlock that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.340
is blocking any progress in
public policy in Washington.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.750
I've seen this go on for
30 years in our field

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.900
where Congress and the
President can't pass anything

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.140
because there's an impasse
between business and labor

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.300
on employment and labor policy.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
So we need to look to other
places for innovations today.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.800
The good news is that
there's a lot going on

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.690
at the local level in
established companies,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.130
in startups, in state and local
governments, in non-profits.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.550
And so that's
where historically,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.110
most of our major innovations
at work have occurred.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.180
So let's look at a few of these.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.600
You've heard of companies such
as Southwest Airlines started,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.590
in 1970.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.550
It's the most profitable
airline in the United States.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.400
It has consistently been rated
as one of the best places

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.150
to work.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.620
It has great customer
satisfaction,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.380
and it has low prices.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.730
And it's worked effectively
for shareholders

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.100
and for employees and for
customers for many years.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.750
So that's one example,
but there are others.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.670
Across almost every
industry we can

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.460
find good companies
that are able to provide

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.890
good jobs at high
profits and good service

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.930
to their customers.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.810
In the health care
area you often

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.390
hear about Kaiser Permanente,
a major nonprofit health care

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.700
provider that both is an insurer
and clinics and doctors offices

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.460
and has hospitals.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.010
Google, as you all know, is
one of the greatest employers

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.510
today.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.590
It's got the resources to
have parties on Fridays

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.460
and treat employees well
and encourage them to work

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.120
creatively on their own work.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.660
Here in New England,
we celebrate the work

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.810
of Market Basket, one
of our grocery chains

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.780
where employees went on
strike to support their CEO

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.960
to save the business culture
and the business that

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.680
was good for employees
and good for customers

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.630
and good for shareholders.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.900
We'll talk more about Market
Basket in future sessions

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.050
of this class.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.350
On the West Coast, there's
a similar organization

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.900
called In-N-Out Burgers, again
a retail restaurant which

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.350
is doing very very well.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.700
So there are
companies that do this

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.680
but then there are new
forms of work emerging out

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.160
of the so-called
on demand economy

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.810
with names like
Uber, TaskRabbit.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.960
Companies that disrupt
traditional ways of organizing

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.690
work and that bring
customers more directly

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.280
into the work process.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.810
We will discuss the
pros and the cons

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.160
of these new ways of working
throughout this course.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.320
And we see equally
exciting innovations

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.750
all across the world.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.230
The Swedish furniture
maker Ikea, for example,

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.260
is a global leader in
environmental sustainability,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.200
in serving low income
customers with good quality

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.940
furniture at reasonable prices,
and providing good working

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.880
conditions, including ensuring
that its lowest paid employees

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.760
earn a living wage.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.160
Or consider Semco, an
innovative company in Brazil

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.300
that has gained a reputation
for empowering employees

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.320
to control their own jobs
and their work schedules

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.430
and yet has grown to
become Brazil's most

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.030
successful company.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.180
The CEO who grew and shaped
the company, Ricardo Semler,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.850
was recognized by the
World Economic Forum

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.310
as one of the global
leaders of tomorrow.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.000
But what about innovations
on the labor market side?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.170
Well, in the 20th
century, unions

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.110
were the source of
tremendous innovation.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.240
They're happy to tell you
that they are the group that

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.440
brought you the weekend.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.140
And, in fact, that's true.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.580
They negotiated for
time off for holidays,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.100
for weekends, for various kinds
of vacation pay and sick leave

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.990
pay.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.890
But unions, as you can see
here, have fallen on hard times.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.480
They have lost membership
going from about a third

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.670
of the workforce down to
less than 15% percent today,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.520
and in the private sector,
they're even lower at about 7%.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.270
But in the wake of
this decline, we're

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.550
seeing new forms of worker
organization emerge.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.760
Sometimes they're
called cooperatives,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.780
sometimes they're
called worker centers.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.130
Sometimes they're called
fast food strikes,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.500
as we've seen against
McDonald's and other industries.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.000
Sometimes it's protests
against Walmart

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.520
on Black Friday where
workers are protesting

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.690
low wages in that industry.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.650
But we're seeing
these organizations

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.140
come along and develop their
own form of innovation that

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.760
helps to represent workers
and provide workers

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.550
a voice that allows them to
improve their own conditions

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.590
on the job.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.450
And some are using social media
to provide new opportunities.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.110
You've heard about
Mechanical Turk, which

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.980
provides jobs for people who
can sign up on the internet

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.670
to do coding jobs and other
very basic kinds of things

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.230
that they can do from home.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.100
Well, this thing called
Turkopticon has come along

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.850
and it said, we
will rate employers.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.000
Are they good employers?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.880
Can we trust them?

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.640
Do they pay their
employees wages on time?

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.510
Do they live up
to their promise?

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.880
This is all done
spontaneously to organize.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.260
So we're seeing new
forms of organization

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.900
like this come along.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.170
So we can do this.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.760
We need to continue
to put our good faith

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.250
efforts into creating
innovations at the workplace.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.260
We need to ask then, how can
we take those innovations

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.230
and spread them
across the economy

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.850
so that more and more people can
benefit from these good ideas?

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.600
That's our job.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.530
I look forward to
seeing more innovations

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.840
and I look forward to seeing
what you and your generation

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.270
creates as the
next form of work,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.540
the next kind of
organizations that

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.960
will meet the needs
of our economy

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.670
and our society going forward.
