00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.910
If you’ve got a job interview coming up
and you’re feeling a little nervous, don’t

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.910
worry.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.190
If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably
seen enough celebrity interviews to know what

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.760
works and what doesn’t.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.380
Okay, fine, the business world isn’t exactly
star-studded and full of GIFable moments.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.160
But interviews are still a key part of the
hiring process.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.910
You built hype with your resume and cover
letter; that promotional package got an employer

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.910
interested!

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.300
Now, you just have to land that job offer.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.030
And we’re here to help you show employers
your star power, with professionalism and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.310
some top-notch answers to common questions.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.340
I’m Evelyn from the Internets.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.160
And this is Crash Course Business: Soft Skills.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:48.620
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.120
We’ve already talked about how the job search
is sort of like marketing a movie.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.910
You’re just marketing yourself!

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.730
So the interview is your press junket.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.430
It’s a chance for you to dive deeper into
your work experience, show you’re good under

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.379
pressure, and demonstrate your competence,
intent, and integrity face-to-face, instead

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.379
of on paper.

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.850
Just like a movie star going on different
talk shows, you’ll have different kinds

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.850
of interviews.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.530
You could have a one-on-one interview, like
on Oprah.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.280
Or panel style, like The View.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.360
You could be answering questions like you’re
on CNN with Anderson Cooper, or performing

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.950
tasks like you’re on Ellen.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.270
To get a feel for what’s in store, it’s
important to do your research.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.530
You wouldn’t want to be prepared for E!
when you’re actually on Dateline.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
It’s generally fine to ask who’s going
to be interviewing you, if you aren’t told.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.090
But be polite about it!

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.470
It can be helpful to look up your interviewers
or skim their social media.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.439
You know they’re checking yours.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.640
Just don’t accidentally ask someone how
their vacation in Aspen was.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.250
Plus, figure out what skills you want to highlight
by perusing the company’s website or searching

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.650
for news articles, to understand their values
and current projects.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.750
We don’t have time to go deep into industry-specific
questions or styles, because a consulting

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.670
interview is totally different than an art
portfolio review.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.000
For the most part, some employers will use
problem-solving interviews, where you may

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.710
need to perform tasks, take an assessment,
or give a presentation.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.739
And almost /all/ of them use behavioral interviews,
which are personality questions that help

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.549
them better understand your skills and working
style.

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.880
Like a red carpet event where everyone is
asked, “Who are you wearing?”

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.630
there are some behavioral questions you should always be prepared to answer.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.690
Hiring managers sift through hundreds of qualified
applicants, so to find out if you’re really

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.750
interested in their company, they’ll ask:
“Why are you interested in this position

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.750
or organization?”

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.560
To tackle this one, lean on your research.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.250
Talk about parts of the company that you genuinely
appreciate, like their commitment to equality

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.250
and diversity.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.080
or how they encourage creative

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.080
exploration.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.480
To determine your ability to work with others,
you’ll be asked about how you handled a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.310
specific type of situation in the past.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.780
Usually, it’s something like, “Can you
discuss when you handled a conflict with a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.940
coworker or a difficult customer?”

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.639
These questions can also be about a specific
quality you need to succeed in your industry.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.870
So, if you were a freelance YouTuber asked
about a difficult client, you could talk about

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.480
how you helped them hone their scattered vision
to create a 4-minute video with a clear, compelling

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480
story.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.000
We all like to talk about our successes, and
your resume is full of them.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.290
But you’ll also be asked something like,
“Can you talk about a time you failed?”

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.780
or “What’s your greatest weakness?”

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.860
And don’t try and spin your weakness into
a strength.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.530
“I’m just too dedicated to my job”
may be a great excuse to avoid going on a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.380
date, but in an interview, it’s a cop out.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.470
Instead, show some self awareness and talk
about something that has impacted you and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.850
what you’re doing to work on it.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.040
So, if you have trouble public speaking, you
could talk about how you ran a talk show with

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.269
your best friend every morning in college,
which built a lot of confidence.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.530
It can be hard to know what to talk about
when behavioral questions are flying at you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.400
from all different directions.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.260
But there are some general tips that can help!

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.630
For one, be reasonable -- don’t feel a need
to get too personal.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.410
This is a professional interview, and they
don’t need to know the drama of your private

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.410
life.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.220
To avoid getting tripped up, act like a celebrity
who’s trying not to spoil the movie they

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.259
just filmed [*cough* Tom Holland] by having
a set of about 10 pre-planned answers.

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:15.630
To make sure you hit all the key points with
ease, use the STAR format, which stands for

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.120
Situation, Task, Action, Result.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.110
Briefly outline the situation you found
yourself in and the task at hand, then emphasize

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.460
the action steps you took and the result
of your actions.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.890
You should also wrap up with what each experience
taught you.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.200
That shows how you want to grow as a professional.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.660
Preparing answers with STAR in mind will help
you stay clear and succinct, even if you’re

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.660
nervous.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.660
Or tired.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.040
Just like an all-day press junket, interviews
can have multiple rounds.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.320
To see what I mean, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.840
A top-secret government program that prevents
intergalactic threats has seen your amazing

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.940
service record at the NYPD, so they invite
you to an interview.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.880
You have two assessments, a one-on-one interview
with the HR representative, and a panel interview

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.090
in front of some executives.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.080
After completing an aptitude test, you’re
given one hour to come up with and present

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.890
a five-point-plan to prevent consumer identity
theft...by ALIENS.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.010
You’re tired from a long morning, but you’re
only given a short break between the problem-solving

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.250
interviews and the behavioral interviews.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.880
Plus, staring at a panel of six black suits
would make anyone nervous.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.590
But, luckily, you’ve got some stories prepared
in STAR format.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.720
Remember: Situation, Task, Action, Result.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.460
So if you’re asked about when you solved
a problem under pressure, you could say:

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.460
When I came upon a robbery, the suspect took
off.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.500
I quickly and calmly assessed the situation,
calculated potential routes in my head, weighed

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.550
my best options, and gave chase.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.430
I caught the suspect and recieved a medal
of valor.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.540
Or if you needed to talk about working in
a team or resolving a conflict, you could

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.540
say:

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.650
Initially, my teammate Frank and I bickered.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.010
But we had a discussion and adapted our communication
styles to be more forward and direct.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.880
Together, we successfully launched an initiative
to recover stolen jewels.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.290
From this experience, I learned to openly
communicate with colleagues to best understand

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.290
their needs.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.210
In no time, you’ll have shown your skills,
impressed your interviewers, and be on your

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.580
way to saving the Earth!

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.060
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.260
Even if you’re not interviewing for a
secret government program, questions can get

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.260
a little strange.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.800
So, if you’re asked what zodiac sign you most
identify with, pause to gather your thoughts.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.900
You can take a sec on straightforward questions
too -- as long as you’re not doing it for

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.900
every single one.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.000
Be sure to tie your answer back into qualities
the interviewer is looking for.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.610
Like, my Mars is in Taurus, so I’m intentional
in my actions, which leads me to succeed by

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.820
being detail-oriented and driven.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:48.870
It’s true.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.760
Or if you’re thrown a weird problem-solving
question, like “How many penguins are there

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.000
in the United States?”

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.400
don’t stress about getting the right answer.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.390
Instead, show them how your brain works and
explain your thought process.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.710
So you could estimate that there are like
10 penguins in every aquarium.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.639
And if there are 3 aquariums per state, then
there are roughly 1500 penguins in the U.S.

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.450
Remember, there’s always a difference
between strange questions and inappropriate

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.889
-- or even illegal -- questions

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:25.090
No one can ask you about anything covered
under protected status like disability, sexual

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.560
orientation, or gender.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.260
There’s more on this in our Crash Course
Government series.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.740
And questions like “do other people find
you desirable?” could be considered harassment.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.550
We all admire celebrity shutdowns of really
inappropriate or insulting interviewers. Channel

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.680
your inner Rihanna, shut it down.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.840
But if you’re asked something inappropriate,
don’t feel forced to answer it directly.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.810
So if you’re asked, “Are you religious?”
-- a question which is illegal, by the way -- you could

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.270
say something like, “I value the right to
freedom of expression.”

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.290
Or if you’re asked, “Where are you from?”

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:03.180
it isn’t necessarily illegal, but it could
be evidence of discrimination against nationality.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.430
So you could answer it with where you’re
currently living.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.790
It’s also important for you to avoid asking
your interviewer inappropriate questions,

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.750
like “Do you have any more information on
that impending lawsuit?”

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.610
That’s the kind of thing that’s best to
research on your own, or ask about after

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.020
you’ve got a job offer.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.730
It’s better to politely and directly ask
about salary, time off, or other potential

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.350
problems once you’ve already wowed the crowd.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:34.690
Instead, use your interview time to ask questions
that demonstrate your priorities, your understanding

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.950
of the position, and your familiarity with
the organization.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.680
Show you’ve done your homework and that
you value professional development by asking

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:46.080
things like, “I know that the Pawnee Parks
and Rec department is dedicated to community

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.080
service.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.220
Can you tell me more about your young leadership
programs?”

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.670
Or give the interviewer a chance to talk about
their work experience with, “What’s

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.680
your favorite thing about working for this
company?”

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.270
Remember what we said about emotional influence?

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.180
Relevant and thoughtful questions will show
that you’re professional and take pride

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.180
in your work.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.600
You can also emphasize your professionalism
by dressing nicely and conservatively, showing

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.700
up on time, and using the names of your interviewers.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.600
Now, there’s a difference between professional
and formal.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.160
You don’t need to show up looking like you’re
headed to the Met Ball.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.620
But if you look good, you’ll feel good.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.550
And the best way to knock an interview out
of the park is to feel confident and relaxed.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.200
Just like the Hitchhiker’s Guide says:
Don’t Panic.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.221
Instead of frantically reviewing your notes
right before, which was fine in college, but

00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:33.800
not so much now, prepare ahead of time.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.240
That way, you can wait in that lobby while
sipping on some of their fancy cucumber water

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.140
and chilling to your favorite music [-- Solange,
anyone?]

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.520
And your work’s not done when the interview
is over.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.310
Use those written communication skills to
send your interviewers a thank you note that

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.390
includes something memorable you talked about.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.280
Then, sit back and be confident in the fact
that you did your best.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.260
If you don’t hear back right away, it’s
okay.

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.490
Like the Oscars committee, it can take weeks
for organizations to reach a decision.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.180
If you absolutely need to know if you’re
getting the job -- like if you have another

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.990
offer on the table or need to move cities
-- politely ask with a follow-up email if

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.760
you’re still being considered for the position.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.010
And soon enough, you’ll have found a new
gig!

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.820
So, if you remember nothing else from this
episode:

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.820
Know your show.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.000
Do your research ahead of time so you’re
not surprised.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.680
Know yourself.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.640
Figure out what skills you can emphasize and
prepare interview answers ahead of time in

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.600
STAR format.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.100
Know your enemy.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.680
Strange questions happen, but don’t feel
pressure to answer anything inappropriate.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.200
Know your style.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.470
Act professionally, dress for success, and
send thank you notes.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.260
Next time, we’re officially done with our
days at the movies.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:51.240
We’ll cover what happens after you get
a job offer: becoming a master negotiator.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.940
Crash Course Business is sponsored by Google
and it’s made with the help of all these

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.320
nice people and Thought Cafe is our amazing
animation team.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.660
