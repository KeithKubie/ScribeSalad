Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for Monday, January 28th, 2019 what's going on out? Yeah. How's it going? I'm doing this Sunday night cause I'm a busy freckled viva this week. So I actually uh, got a buddy over going to smoke a cigar with him. I was like, well why don't we kill two birds with one stone and I'll just have you on the fucking podcast. The uh, the one and only Josh, Adam Meyers.

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       Hello everybody. How I can't do it. My voice. I know the voice of Holland, Hank, Dj Helen, Hank on emphasis a family. You can officially say that we're back. We've got some funny shit for you this week. Season for everybody. Season Four. You heard me on the radio. I have a feeling Dj Howland. Hank will be making many, many more appearances. I hope so. I love that guy so much. It's not really hard for me to play it. You play a coke addict Dj. I mean that's, you know, just think back into my past. Don't worry. I thought you were, will you? Oxy pills. What we're doing is I know, I mean, I mean I got to do the whole smorgasbord. Uh, let's get that way. You from, I'm from Germantown, Maryland, right outside of Washington DC. Okay. Sports affiliations. My podcast listeners have to, here we go, uh, all crap teams except for one of them.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       A Washington Redskins, Washington Wizards, uh, and the Stanley Cup champion. Washington capitals. I can't believe I get to say that. It's like the greatest feeling in the world. And uh, no Orioles, no national snowmen oils in a nationals fan of cut his splits. I mean, I will, I grew up in an Orioles fan, but I loved brace. Harper and I, I really just root for the whole town. So I'm, I'm a diehard oriels fan, but I'm also going to root for the nets. I just want that you old enough to, to have been a Baltimore Colt fan before they left or no, I was, I was alive, but I was already Redskins. I mean, I mean they left a what, 82 84, something like that. Uh, something like that. 83, 84, somewhere around. I remember, this is what sucks is that I remember just my foot from like from like zero to 10 it was just three Superbowls and then at like 11 I think we got our last one, which was in nine red one the red skins. And then I was just like, oh, we're probably going to be in this all the time. And then nothing. Well that's, that's what's going to happen to like the Patriots and all, all these kids who are lucky enough to be born in the night 1990s

Speaker 1:          00:02:34       and remember 2001 the first one or 2000 2001 you know, it's going to be like, you know, there was, there was kids born when I was born in 1968 and then, uh, they got to watch Dan Marino. I'm able, I'm just saying as far as like just being good and competitive. I always compare it to Dan Marino cause that guy was the best I ever saw man other than Joe Montana. But even then, I think Dan Marino with Bill Walsh, she see definitely wins. One.

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       I only remember, I only remember bad knees Marino. That's, that's where I was at mean bad back bad, which is bad. Everything. When I got in, he was already in the, in the down trodden.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       That was him. He came in and he was with Don Shula and Don Shula like was a man who was a man but, but by then everybody had caught up with them, stolen all his fucking tricks and he was on like, cause he was in the final 10 years of, of going back to like, like the 19 like fifties I want to say. He was on the giants at one point and you was on offensive or defensive coordinator and the other guy was Tom Landry. Okay. Those were the two guys or something like that one though. I always forget who the hell it was. But anyways, um, I just remember, you know, we, they went from Bob Greasy to fucking Dan Marino is his name. They just kicked our ass for like the first 20 years of me watching the Patriots. He just couldn't take it. And, and I, I look at the dolphins fans now, like this still waiting. I feel so full for that. Next. Dan Marino,

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       my cousin is the biggest dolphins fan. He named his dog Marino like he fucking loves this team so much and it was like, I remember at the beginning of the season I was like, dude, they're looking good. The winning some games and he's like, they're going to fuck it up and then boom. It's just what they finished like seven and nine. There are seven and 19 I mean, I can't talk to Redskins are what? Like six and 10 I gave up, what can I say once I know all four of our quarterbacks, broken leg. I was like, all right. I was like, we deserve it. Racist team name. We can't, you can't be four and 12 with a racist team name. You gotta be 12 and four we can't help it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       I will say this too. I still can't believe in all of this, this fucking Hashtag and all this shit. The fact that they still do the Tomahawk chop all like, I can't believe that in all of that. Fuck it. It's so fucking bad. It's so fucking bad. And they sit there like it does. I love when white people justify it. Like it's literally the people are saying don't

Speaker 2:          00:05:03       do where they're like, but we're honoring the parents because we committed genocide. Who's kidding? Who with against those? That would be like if the Germans one and then at the soccer game everyone was chanting, oh Yay or nay. You know, it's funny, 22

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       is that, Whoa is old school Hollywood imitating their singing and all that thing on so many fucking levels. It's just like, dude, what can you just, and they just, they fucking refuse. And I don't know. That's why, that's why there's this like a backlash now on white privilege site. There's people going out there and uh, do what? Just, there's white people saying that white privilege doesn't exist, which is fuck. And then you listen to their stories and all their stories are as basically that they weren't born rich, but at no point was there, hey, I was driving down the, and because I was

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       white, I got pulled over tased and then shot to death and then the cop got free. I've got a cop was released. There's none of that shit is not. Yeah. Like two, two is like, look, there's to sit there and act like the right privileges, those privileges in everything. There's all different levels to be in white and this and this shit. This shit that as if you're just like a regular white guy, shit that you see the private school white kid doing. That pisses me off. And there's different levels, different levels of black people. You know, there's the hugs for sure. Yes. I grew up, I grew up middle class, some little note, lower middle class and it's just like I had that friend that just like, dude, I had a friend who was like super rich. His Dad worked for the FDA, right. This kid always had money.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       Their family always had money. His Dad went into a lone star. I remember that. That steak house where they put like you to give you peanuts and then you just throw the shells on the floor. Right. His Dad's slipped on the floor, hurt his knee, got like $10 million. They were already rich. Like, that's the kind of shit that should have happened to my dad cause he had, she would've happened to, my dad doesn't remember when, uh, being in New York City one time and there was this publicist who fucking snapped or something out on, on and she was out like I want to say she was out in the Hamptons Long Island and sh oh or something, somewhere out there she snapped cause something about some club or a restaurant and she backed into like 17 fucking people. I don't mean the lash rove away. Oh that's horrible. Drove the fuck away. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:07:29       they got a license plate. They knew who she was in. The cops showed up and the lawyer was in the driveway, met the cops and said she'll turn herself in tomorrow morning. Irish. Remember reading that going like, what the fuck? How is that possible? Is that, what is that? Yeah, but so to sit there and act like, I dunno, like I five, it's fucking hilarious. It is hilarious. It's, it's ridiculous. Every, but the thing is back with the reds, the work in a warehouse and unloaded trucks. It's just like, I know, but there, at no point did anybody ever look at you and like you have white skin get out of this neighborhood and they just let him be. That's the thing with the Redskins though, is that it's, it's every, every like six years a senator or a congressman says, you gotta change the name.

Speaker 2:          00:08:15       And I completely agree at this point I'm like, just change him. I can't believe the owner wouldn't do it considering, I honestly don't notice now because it's just been called that for so fucking long now. But you're looking at this and go look at the owner is first of all, we have probably one of the worst owners in football because he's like Jerry Jones, just, it doesn't know anything about football. So he's fucking the team up causing all these problems, you know? And, and he wants money so bad that you would think that he would change the name to get all the merchandising money. Like dude, that's like another, you know, $100 million worth of shit. Like that pays for a new parking lot. And here's an argument that I been, I been something that I've been wondering about for a long for a while now,

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       and I think I kind of understand it. Where in every sport that I like Major League baseball, I thought they counted world series titles back to the 18 days, but they kind of, the first one, that account was in 1903, which I think was the Boston red sox. I literally looked it up last week. I already forget. But like they caught the all the way back to fucking, uh, 1903 all right. When it was a segregated league, all of this shit, right? Like, you know, crazy Lake Johnson who was fucking 10, loved him, 10 teams of whatever, right? Stanley Cup goes about that far back. NBA titles goes back to the 1940s. And even the Lakers count an NBL title. They somehow want an end and a title, the NBL and that was counted as a fucking NBA title was there when they were the Minneapolis Lakers. Yeah. They're first looking of, they want an NBL and then they want for NBA titles in Minneapolis.

Speaker 1:          00:09:50       And, uh, but they, they for some reason caught that one. But Superbowls, they only started in 1968 and what kills me. Oh I saw you post something about this. Yeah. It's just like, so see it telling me and people are saying, because it's, I guess because they call it a merger, but it was like the AFL came in, it was like the Xfl of the USFL or the world football league. It was just this other competing football and the NFL laugh on you're some fucking, you know, piece of Shit League. But it was early enough on I guess where they, you know, and they made an up moves and had enough money or whatever and then we'll, the style that they played that they started to compete with them and then they played them in the first two games, Superbowl one and two, which were called Nfl AFL championship game. And they got the shit kicked out of them because they weren't as good a league.

Speaker 1:          00:10:40       And then then the AFL one in Superbowl three which was still not called the Superbowl, it was still the AFL NFL championship. All right. So then after that they agreed to merge all the owners agree in the AFL to merge with the NFL. Al Davis was the only one. He wanted to put the NFL out of business because he was fucking Al Davis and she's like, this is why I got to love him. Right. So, and then at that point they just go, all right, so those first three games against the AFL NFL, that's when we're going to start like I guess cause they called it a merger rather than, but I mean like the Aba in a way merged with the NBA. Yeah. And they still count all that shit back to the 19 four days. They only NHL teams. They only took some teams from the Aba. They didn't take everybody.

Speaker 1:          00:11:25       Okay. But still. Oh yeah. But still it was, it was a competing league that was fucking with their numbers and they had a more exciting game just like the AFL. And then in the end the NBA at euro was losing too many players too. It same way was the NFL. At some point it's like can't beat them. Join them. And then they came together, but they still count all those Celtics championships in the 60s and all that. So it's like you're telling me that Johnny Unite John Unitas. I gotta look at him in a certain way or in all of the, and half of those fucking teams, the browns, the rams, the bears, the packers, the giants, all of those fucking teams were in the NFL playing each other. There was, it was actually in a way you could say, you know, I could, you can't say it was more talent than, but I'm just saying like, I don't get why they just wipe that away.

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       They don't fucking talk about it at all. And that the Steelers with six fucking chat in 2018 six championships. Yeah. Like it's so fucking ridiculous that, that the Patriots, right. If we win Sunday, which would be next Sunday, which would be fucking awesome. We would be tied for the most championships won in NFL history and we've got our first one fucking 17 years ago. That doesn't, that doesn't make sense. And you're, you're, that doesn't make any fucking sense. That's still, I see where you're coming from, but at the same time, um, you know, we're going by super bowl one. I think, listen, I'm, I'm not a patriots fan. I think they have in the instance they started winning them and what 2001 was that the first one? Yeah. I mean they're, they're definitely one season. They're definitely, you know, one of the strongest things, but all the people that want to fight and put up the fight about saying that, you know, will like saw that thing that guy posted.

Speaker 1:          00:13:08       The Greenbay has like, we've got like 14 or whatever, but here's green bay though. Green base won four Superbowls and they won like fucking 11 NFL titles. They've been winning the entire fucking time you have. If there's ever one in a minute. I mean, how long has it been since Green Bay's one was that 2005 something like that. Oh, like nine or 10 or something. Okay. You're right. Yeah, but well, I'm not talking about that with that. Well then why would you fucking count the Broncos have a one in 20 years? So what those there's don't count. No, they, no, no. They count are they? I'm saying they count, but I just thought you were getting mad about somebody posting that Green Bay had x amount because they were enclosed and the earlier one. That's my argument. They should keep those. Yeah. But those should fucking count.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       If the fucking Montreal Canadians can count when they fucking beat somebody playing on a pond. Oh, I didn't know what Jangle you were going with. I'm sorry. I thought you were going against, I thought you were saying nor Octos people for it. Oh, okay. Then I love the history of the game. The NFL has been the NFL and a bunch of fucking leagues have tried to, to, to compete with them. They've never, they've never been able to, the best you've ever had was the AFL merged with them, but it was still called the NFL. It wasn't called the AFL. It wasn't called the NFL. Slash. Afl, like Sirius Xm or whatever. And right. It was called the fucking NFL. You joined the NFL. Yeah. So those other championships were NFL championship. That's cause now you call it the fucking super bowl. Sure. It was still the two best teams and those, you know, before the AFL existed, those were the two fucking best teams of who the fucking classic giants Colts Game Played In fucking Yankee Stadium. The winter that it can't camp fucking walk up to somebody who super bowl four and said, I know what that feels like. They know exactly what it feels like. A lot of people are dying off, but yeah, they know what it feels like. 100% that's a great point. They are dying. I don't know. I count them. I that the Green Bay packers are the fucking New York Yankees and I think the giants are next and that's the way it should be. Did I think it was

Speaker 2:          00:15:13       Redskins are up there. The Redskins have, we have no, you've got you. I have three. And then we had, I think we had like four of the world championship ones.

Speaker 1:          00:15:22       All right. I'm going to give you some trivia. Where did the rams first started? Um, and city. St Louis.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       No, no. Cause I know it was with Los Angeles. I don't fucking know. Jesus. Great. You know, you just sounded like me and math class a long time ago. That's what I love about you is that you, I know, I know sports, but dude, you know fucking sports like you like I can imagine

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       because I used, I used to no fucking everybody in the league and I just, I just don't have time anymore. So I don't know. But they started off in Cleveland and I've never understood why they were called the rams. I don't know that there was any rams in there. Um, all right, let's, let's look up. What am I looking at? Washington Redskins. What's your fights on

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       all to the Redskins? Don't re Braves on know what bad fight for. Oh, daisy. Oh there you go. And then it goes into some weird thing. Brandon doesn't jump in. There's a lad, Steven Dapa. Duba let the points. So,

Speaker 1:          00:16:34       hey, go NFL championships pre 1970 merger. Uh, you got to right. Five pretty good. I'll take it. Yeah. So you've got five. So right now, as for the way I look at your tie with the Patriots, we've got five super bowls. You got, you've got five champion. We got, we have five championships. I wish everybody thought like you cause a lot of, you know, do you a lot of people, if you fucking people have ever said that,

Speaker 2:          00:17:02       no, I completely agree with what you're saying. If he, if the one before it was the official Superbowl, it's still a championship. Unfortunately a lot of those people have died.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       Yeah. Who would care, I guess. Um, let's see here. Yeah, that, that [inaudible] all right. Uh, Le League championships. All right. The NFL champ pre 1970s, um, the giants won four. So they've won for NFL titles and they won four super bowl ties. Those you go to the stadium said no way to be found. They know they're not listed. It's like it never fucking happened.

Speaker 2:          00:17:41       See the angle you're coming with right now, and I respect the, what you're saying, dude, 100% that's not fair.

Speaker 1:          00:17:48       I'm not saying not fair. Not Fair. I'm just, I'm just asking why, why, why would your brother, dude lead championships? Chicago bears. Okay. They one fucking nine 19 2119 323340414346, 1963 and anyone a soup, 1985 and all they have is one fucking banner hall hanging over their stadium. Check one of the scores when they beat the Redskins and one of those league championships. It's like, it's like crazy fucking lopsided. 70 to like 70 to eight from not mistaken. So I don't know a lot about sports, about facts, but I do know that, that that is right. All right, let's look up the, uh, Los Angeles Rams. All right. And you'll find nervous. Are you nervous about Sunday? Oh yeah. Always. I'll tell you what's the funniest thing. My a verse, he texted me and he's like, dude, Todd Gurley, is it Todd Gurley tug earlier? Yeah. He goes, he's heard.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       And in my head I'm like, dude, there's no way to stand up comedians know the injury status of the key running back for the rams. If, if praise. I got a guy on the inside. Yeah. Who's your guy on the inside? espn.com this is my, if, if he was really fucking hurt, we wouldn't know. They would keep that under wraps. But he was hurt in the last game. I saw him on the bike for a little bit. I know, but here's the thing, what is it? Everybody's heard this time of year. They all said he's got to funny bruise of per cover. He's going to fucking play. If they're leaking it out that he's hurt, that means that he's, he's way better than they thought he was going to be because that's just good. Always hurt and like, but they know Bella check is going to be like, well I guess we don't have to prepare photog Gurley.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       Um, but it was just funny. You know, he showed up. Yeah. Alright. Nfl Championships Pre 1970 the rams, they wanted 45 and 51 and then they won in 1999 and they were the yarn. Cleveland Rams from 1936 to 1942 they took 43 off to finish off the Germans and the Japanese. 1944 1945 that was the last year and then they moved to Los Angeles. They stayed there until 94 came back to 2016 which brings me to something I was making fun of and let, did you see, do you watch the saints ramps game? I did. All right. Everybody thought the worst fucking thing in that was that fucking helmet to helmet. No pass interference call. The worst thing in that game was when they cut to the stands after the rams won. And you saw those guys in the rams jerseys in their twenties maybe early thirties crying. I saw that. Yes. Yeah, I did see that. Girlfriends were trying to comfort them. It's just like buddy, you will fucking two years old when they moved away. Like what are you doing here? You can waiting since 2016 it says, listen, you're, you're fucking bill. Ryan went bill when you, cause if you remember how, what happened when we watched, because you watched the caps game with me when they won the cup where you are on my computer. I was in London in London that I was facetiming you so you could watch the game if everybody was asleep.

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       And I was a pitch black and I was in the bathroom of my hotel. My wife and daughter were sound asleep and I was going to it. I'm so happy for you just just, and I was sitting there like, dude, I care graduations, you always facetiming with you when you had your fucking TV on, but you were like, congratulations buddy. [inaudible] I know it. But my wife probably thought I was in there talking to a hooker. Okay, everybody's asleep. Oh man, it's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. But what was, what was so funny is if you would have seen me, and I mean like I remember in [inaudible] 91 with the Redskins won, but I remember the day after because my mom, like I was watching the game and then the uh, my mom made a bunch of, of her famous Superbowl Chili and I ate a bunch of it and then I fell asleep in a laundry basket.

Speaker 2:          00:21:44       Uh, I was 11 and then I didn't get another championship until this caps one. And we were watching it together and you were facing the screen. And I remember I was just like cheering as the clock ran down and then the member, it stopped for a second, there was like a stoppage of play, like 0.06 seconds. So I was screaming and then I got quiet and then they win the game and everybody's running on the ice and I'm just dead silent. I thought, I was like, am I dead inside it? What is wrong with me? And then they brought the cup out and dude, I just started weeping, just weeping dude. It's like, why does it matter so much? It's so, so it's everything. It's just all the, it's all due to, to everything. It's all the, it's all the, it's all the, you know, the Times that they, they, they chunked it before when they were supposed to win and all the times that, you know, they, they did, she put so much into it and to finally get it just was so sweet, man.

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       And it was like, I started thinking about like, this is, I'm going to go really like John Cougar Mellencamp here. But then I thought about all like the middle class people that live in the Washington DC area that worked these dead end jobs and then they just, they get that championship cause they want it so bad and that, that team, whether it's the Redskins and the caps or whoever, it's like that's what they have to him to help them escape. And so I, you know, I wouldn't say spring senior team raised the cup is just like I, I kind of was just,

Speaker 1:          00:23:14       I don't think I'm ever going to see the Bruins through it. And when they finally did it, I watched him from 1980 to 2011. That's how long it took me to, what's that 10 2031 years. 31 years I watched him. And um, so from age 12 to a, what does that 43 when they finally they finally did it and uh, I, I was, I told this story before, I was at the Chicago Theater on Jim Norton's tour with Jim Breuer, David telling myself on this tour called the antisocial tour. And I watched the first period and a half. Then I went on stage and then when I got off stage, I watched the final seven minutes upstairs in one of those where the green room is something like that. And I remember being up there by myself cause none of them cared because it wasn't their team. And the show ended and they went out to do the meet and greet and I stayed up there and there was like three minutes left and they scored a goal or it's just not enough time for the other team to come back. Vancouver and I was by myself and my eye went up like 900

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       because I was like, and I

Speaker 1:          00:24:21       one to see, they were like, they were like, come on, you got to come down from the meet and greet people saying, where the fuck are you calling you? The bony for now. And I was like, wait, did I say, I just had to see him lifted up and I told my wife to tape, but I knew she was taping it. And just when I saw it as a, and I'll just lifted, I'm just going,

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       good dude. That was 31

Speaker 1:          00:24:37       years just coming out of you and just, Ah, all those years of not being able to get past the case, not being able to win in the forum, man. Fucking getting past the Canadians and then run into those fucking Gretzky Edmonton Oilers in the mark messier the Edmonton Oilers and just, and then just, you know, Neeley's getting his fucking leg taken out, you know, and bore Kevin. It goes somewhere else to win a cup and it's just fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck the lockout.

Speaker 2:          00:25:04       Oh yeah, all of that. [inaudible] I'll just go through your head and then Bam, that's like, you literally feel like they're good.

Um, hey, you have a podcast?

Speaker 2:          00:33:11       I do. I, you know, it's funny, I was watching you read that and like you just keep going when you make the mistake. And like when I tried to tape stuff like that, if I like, if I fuck up at all, I just like, I'm like, all right, God damn. And I just like to have a start over. It's just seeing you do it so effortlessly perfectionist where you're so comfortable doing it. Well I do. I've established right out of the gate that I'm a moron. Yeah. I guess out in the front of it. Yeah. It's like [inaudible] an idiot. Bill Clinton saw what happened to Gary Hart and you just got out in front of it. They would just like, did you, is I fucked them all and then he fucking, you know? Yeah. But then he went back to his old ways. I did not have sex with that woman.

Speaker 2:          00:33:51       That's a good Glenn Dude. And I, if I said, if I would, I, I do not have problems reading out loud. Like that would be the end. I would get impeached. Sure. That'd be I, you know, I wouldn't leave just like him. I need to leave my flaws in. That's what it taught me to do. Yeah, I do have a podcast. Uh, I love it. Bill. I'm telling you I love this. I'm more than 500, the 500. It's about stock car race. It is not about that. It is about the 500 greatest albums of all time. I'm going through rolling Stone Magazine's list of the 500 grade his albums starting at 500, working my way down to one. Uh, each week I sit down with a comic actor or musician now, uh, you know, and I gave them a week with the record and then I break the record down and we sit down and talk about it is kiss got one in the [inaudible] I just did.

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       I just did with Jeff Ross kiss destroyer. I was going to say, you know he shit, you could've got Steven Adler. Ah. I mean I've got he lose love. I would love to get Steven again in there. Dude, I love this so much man. Like, cause it's not just being able to sit down and talk with my buddies about the album and ask them questions around like the meanings of the songs and the facts from the record. But Dude, since I've started doing this, like I have listened to music than I thought I would never listen to him, didn't even know about. And it's like touching me and it's just so incredible. Right now I'm listening to Steve Earle Guitar town. You ever heard of him? This guy is funny. He's like, he's like the key. This is like his born in the USA, but country record dude, I'd never listened to country.

Speaker 2:          00:35:23       I fucking love this record dude. When did it come off? 1985 and he has a song called guitar town and it's, it's just, it's just incredible. I mean once, especially once you know, the history, this guy and like how he dropped out of school and then went to Nashville, like you know, to, to find Townes van Zandt and leg was writing songs for people. And then the record company was like, all right, well we want you to make a record. And he was like, all right. And He's, he just sat down and wrote the first song and the last song and then just the whole album came together. But it's like that's what I love. How many albums?

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       Yeah. Oh he's got a shitload. I listen to anything else. So he must be real quality cause I don't know who we are. You know what I mean? Cause I figured like if I know who a country person is for the most part, they suck because it's going to be like, you just know like the pop kind of, here's the thing though. You don't know. It's like, you know, like if, if, if you were, I don't know if somebody say name is speed battlement metal band.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       Everybody would say motorcycle. That's right. You would say motors. Motors, sickle, our favorite band. Now this is, this is the thing. The guy could have been like enormous. But then he developed like a drug problem and then kind of fell off. And now he actually still makes music but a country, the country, uh, fan base doesn't really fuck with him anymore because he leans very left. And I was actually watching a documentary of his, cause I'm getting ready to record the episode with Tom Everett Scott from that thing you do. Um, he played the drama, you remember when he came and did it at the jam. Um, and you look at the youtube comments, you know, of this documentary and it's like, I used to like his music but he's a fucking stupid leftist, liberal, tarred. And it's just like, because they can't accept that, you know, you can play country music but still lean towards. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:19       It's also why I think, you know, you shouldn't be constantly putting out your political opinions. Like, listen, I just completed, I completely agree. I make fun of people, you know, the white privilege thing. I like this. I make fun of feminists and shit. I try to be like even handed or whatever. But uh, you know, all you do is just like nobody, all you do is get people who agree with you to agree with you and then people who don't agree with you too now hate you and not want to watch something that you do because they can't separate the two. Like I can stay at a fucking Trump hotel and not like Donald Trump and for a lot of people can't get past that because in their minds, the people who run the Sheridan, who were also billionaires for some reason didn't vote for Donald Trump.

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       They're all there. They're all the same. Fucking get 100% yeah, by no, not dense. Imagine like it's just, they're just painful. His name outside the thing, it's not like living, it's, I've been in a Trump hotel. They're extremely nice. They're incredible. They're incredible. Yeah. I said Nice. I mean, everybody knew what I meant. You don't have to one up me and say incredible. It was incredible. I've only stayed at one. It was fucking fantastic. Like does that one opinion credible what this guy should be doing? Fuck yeah, dude, it is to stick to a hotel on residency.

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       Was he competent as his fucking hotel? I mean this, this, this. We would be back. He would make it great again if it's tax cuts were as good as his bath towels. I made come the fuck. You know what? I was making fun of it the other day. Somebody said, well, like there was some, I guess there was some sort of taxing out there. If you make $11 million or more and people make $11 million and while we're complaining, Oh yeah. So, uh, somebody had tweeted that, you know, hey, you know, this is fucking bullshit. Just pay your fair share. So it makes $11 million a year, doesn't work any harder than somebody who makes 20 grand a year. And I was fucking dying laughing. I was like, oh yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. You wonder why a guy make an $11 million. He's getting a fucking divorce.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       It's cause he never sees his wife. That's why it's true. It doesn't see his kids has a pool, never been in it. And it's just like, yeah, this, there's 24 fucking seven. I, I've made 20 grand a year. You always great. It's the second the fucking whistle blows. You don't even think about that job. But once I think that nobody calls you up, hey bill, uh, tomorrow, when you unload the boxes, could you maybe do we to get out of her fucking conference call and how you unload the fucking truck? It's just his people don't think that people think of like when you think somebody makes 20 million a year, like we just know shit from like Falcon Crest and dynasty. All those shows are, they're like, they don't do anything. Yeah. They hang out in country clubs and they piss on us 20,000 hours. Yeah. And you have pay petty fights with people within your family?

Speaker 2:          00:40:05       Yeah, that's all they do. Like nobody sees them like you know in the office from, you know, from 6:00 AM until like 3:00 AM and then they go home, like walk into their kid's room, the kid's sleeping, they sh t single teardrop falls and then they'd go bang the mate and go to sleep. Yeah. It's kind of what I, that's what I assume happens. I have no idea. I grew up lower middle class, but I love, I, what I love about this podcast is that I would do this if nobody was listening because I wanted to listen to these albums. And I started to, um, I was just going, I want it to feel inspired. I think I was as musically tapped out and, and I was like, all right, I'm going to listen to an album a day, over 500 days. And I started posting about it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:47       And when I got to like four 98, which was like on the third day, Jim Jefferies reached out to me. He's like, dude, he's like, that stone roses record is one of my favorite records. He's like, oh, the stories that I think of when I hear that music and then like hit me. And I was like, that's the podcast. I've been waiting to do a great voice. He can sing. He's incredible voice. Uh, but he came on and he did, and he did that episode. And that's basically what it is. It's like, you know, we're going to go through these great records and we're going to talk about, and we're gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask, you need more than a day to listen to one album that no, I give them a week. He just pointed at me. No. Oh we, I give you a week. Oh yeah. Were you did it?

Speaker 2:          00:41:30       You did. I thought you only took a day to listen to it because you're so busy because you're making $12 million. So you're out on how can we can have $1,000,001 11,000,001 so I was the one who complained. I could tell it was you that was so, but what it is is like I give every comic or actor or whoever it's going to be a week with the record, and then I break the album down and like ask them questions about their life using the meaning of the songs, the facts from the records. So, so the album is really just like the celery and the carrots and the onions have the soup, but it's really just, you know, the basis for me just to have a really, you know, funny or deep or whatever the fuck it is. It's just a good conversation when you run out of those albums. And I was over that. Oh, I know how you'd do it, which I do. You could do the 500 albums. That should have been in the top 500 that'll be a 9.61 years. And uh, that's not a bad idea, but I might just be, you know, I think I've been, when I retire it on May 31st, 2028. Oh, that's what I'm going to have. My goal is on the final episode to have a Oprah. I don't know why, but it's just, it's my way. Wales, what's the number one sergeant pepper's lonely hearts club band.

Speaker 2:          00:42:53       Then it's, then it goes a number one album, number one. Then number two is pet sounds. And then number three, I think his revolver, this is white rough. The number one white rock in the top 10 note, Marvin Gaye's in the top 10 Marvin Gaye's number six, Marvin Gaye, what's going on? But it's all over the place. The like album 500 was outcasts equipment. I and then for life I'll be saying is because the Beatles who really went rogue and started their own Beatles where essentially a boy band and then they that they took control there, Chris with a lot of people because the Beatles now get a ton of shit by people being like, you know, like they, there's like people who think they stink. Like I've, I've listened to two things. The Beatles stink dumb people will their, they're dumb. Yeah. I'm not saying you can't be into them, they don't move you or whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:43:44       And they spent a long time but that, that's, that's like saying count Basey steaks or something like that. No, it's just a night. Yeah. He don't learn. Teach. That's the thing is that somebody like my age, I'm 39 like I, I, you know, was born in 79 so I wasn't really alive during the Beatles era. And from what I've been told and everything I've read, like there will never be an artist as big as the Beatles were like, they were enormous. Like we can't even, this was, they broke out of what usually binds you and they took control of their career and started their own label. And then when they should have fizzled out, they made this left turn where they reinvented themselves. You know, when they started doing drugs and grew their hair and all that shit, like rubber soul and then yeah, in revolver

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       and all that stuff. And then when that kind of went to, they will now what the fuck do we do? It's like, all right, let's just play characters now will be these, these guys. How would these guys do that? So during that time, Marvin Gaye, I think he was stuck in the Motown shit and he's got to sing what they're writing for them. And by the 70s you know, he was doing what they did as far as he kind of broke away is like, well I want to sing about what I'm thinking about rather than doing my version of she loves you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where he's doing like heard it through the grape vine and all that stuff, which I still love all the songs. I mean, but then he wanted to go like deeper so maybe they think that that's because, well sergeant pepper, I was asking what's going on is a better record than that. Sergeant pepper. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       I mean it's, listen they, all of these, all of this whole list is completely, you know. Yeah. It's, it's, it's all over them. It's designed to do, there's your, you got like, cause the way they made it, because I've already had this discussion with people.

Speaker 3:          00:45:32       What is it? It's 20 years ago today. It's not the job, the band and play that are going in and out of style. Common Schema. Lava down the dial. That's good. You the one in eligibility, she is escaped diva ski but Duba Doo.

Speaker 2:          00:45:51       Yup. Something like that. One of the best moments we've had on the jam is when Jim Jefferies sang that first time he did it, he did sergeant pepper and then into with a little help from my friends and he was wearing a jacket that he bought at John Barbados that the only reason he bought, it's the gaudiest like most expensive, weirdest Jackie you ever seen in your life. And it costs like $10,000 and he only bought it because he was at this John Barbados like event. And he put it on de Laugh about it. And then Ringo Starr walked by and when you look good in that, so he was like, well, I gotta buy it now. I mean, if a beetle tells you you look good in something, it's like you gotta fucking get the fuck I'm gonna go start was there? No. Yeah, dude, bring, it was always at like Barbados events.

Speaker 2:          00:46:35       He wears all that. Like interview with a vampire. Clothing was an event. It wasn't as, it wasn't a store. Not a did. No, no, it was, I was at an event. I spaced halfway through the okay out. It's great. It's great. It's what I'm saying is, is that, you know, Sargent pepper was this huge thing for the Beatles. What was the coat? What did it have on? Oh my God, I'll send you a picture. Sorry. It was like an alligator gold style, like, like Rock Jack. I don't even know what you'd call it. Just like an allergy piece of that. If he buys it. Was it a Beatles coat? No, it was just a job. He wasn't, he was seriously saying he looked good in that fucking coach. It just saying to John, he was ain't a gym that you look good in it. And so he told him, you know, he's like, you look good. So Jim bought it. That's the story areas. It was boring the second time. It was interesting. The final spaced out. The moment everybody's laughing at, you know, I'm not

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       fucking listening from, but we're not paying attention or whatever. Uh, you didn't think that when I sang a Johnny paycheck,

Speaker 2:          00:47:36       take this job, but shove it down day, I believe. But now buddy

Speaker 1:          00:47:42       do what Josh has been trying to get me to do. You're going to do it. Um, he wants mother fucker. You are gonna do this. Wants me to get a brown curly wig. Go out on stage is Don Henley. And then he wants me to play drums and Sing Hotel California.

I do a show called the goddamn comedy jam where Comedians do stand up. They tell the story about a song and then they sing it. Bill has done it. You've done it more than fucking like anybody. You're the only counts it cause it was pre the NFL AFL merger. They don't call back. Alright. But, but uh, we had my birthday coming up and, and I asked you, I was like, could you please do that?

I've gotten this call a few times where it's like, Josh, dude, I got too much shit going on.

Speaker 2:          00:48:45       I can't learn this fucking song. Don't make me learn this. I can play the song. But the fact that they have to sing along with it and I can't sing, but you, you understand that's a song that's so popular. The second you start playing it, the whole audience is going to fucking join in with you and then you can just kind of mimic it. And then I'll be singing in the bass player will be singing the [inaudible] like all the fucking lyrics in front of me. Like it's going to be a shit show thing I could do.

All right. Body shaming. You'll Billy Brown shirt. I don't know. Brown ship meat. So it wasn't that the people who are sympathetic to fucking Hitler, I have no idea who won't. Brown shirts went brown shirts. Uh, wait a minute. I can look that up. Now you got to Google something political. Maybe they hear sole unit picture that you posted in a brown shirt and they are, they're just rhyming in it. Brown shirt. Do they said so many weird things like Billy elbows or Billy dangled down. Yeah. So they just made it up. No Brown shirts. Political.

Speaker 4:          00:50:49       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       Nazi party. His original parliamentary did played a significant role in Adolf Hitler's rise to power. Oh, I guess I'll eat meat. It was brown shirts. Say. See that's what the Internet stupid cause I just, I just fucking grazed over all at gray's. Breezed. Graced. All right, you'll Billy Brown shirt. I vomited a little in my mouth halfway through your tirade against fat clients when you suggest, I don't remember doing this. Those who don't conform to your body dysmorphic ideal should get therapy and sort out their lives. Did I say that guys? You have to understand something like I have to do an hour usually by myself and whatever topic comes up, I have to destroy it because I'm trying to make you laugh anyways. I haven't heard anything less healthy commodity your mouth for some time. All right. You know something dude? First of all, the I vomited a little bit in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:51:44       You're the fact that I'm supposed to literally take what you're saying seriously and you're speaking in soundbites. Let me get Stan, did you shake your head before you rolled on the floor? Laughing your ass off anyways. If my partner thought my weight was a deal breaker, I'd thank her for the honest glimpse into where vacant prisons, soul and abandoned her in a heartbeat. No, you wouldn't. You overly sensitive jackass, uh, in a heartbeat to the Greyhound Hound inspired Instagram influencers and consumer program. Neil Neil is, you seem to champion, diversity is not a mental illness, but body shaming is, ah, God. Yeah. Wow. I gotta I gotta I gotta like that's, that's worded so much in that speak that I don't even believe that that's true. No, they're just throwing buzzwords together, Brown shirt, all of that type of stuff. I love, now I see why they called you Billy Brown shirt.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       Like I'm a not mad at you. Yeah, they're mad at, you know, cause what it was was there was a guy who is with some chick, she had a little meat on the bones, whatever, and he was went into it thinking I should probably fucking lose it eventually. I don't know why he thought that people tend to just get fatter. Yeah. People, people do tend to age. It'd be like this guy has a little gray hair. Maybe it's going to turn Brown. No, it's going to fuck it again. More Gray. Yes. So anyway, my age and if so what happens is, but she was putting it on at what he considered to be an alarming rate. So he wanted to stay with her, but he needed to know how to approach to ask her in a polite way to stay in shape. Here's what all these not least gained way. Here's what all these proud fat people are not like they're killing themselves. So if somebody gives an intervention and that this isn't about fatties is they'll fucking sit there and I'll talk about how addiction, food addiction and all that is no different than drug addiction. I agree with you. You legally agree with have it. You have an intervention with people to be like, you're killing yourself with this heroin. So I haven't for some reason with big MACs. Yeah. You can't fucking be like, hey, why don't you lay off your fucking chicken tenders there.

Speaker 2:          00:53:48       So I have a friend that, that just had a kid, uh, my buddy, and, uh, he, he was, he lost a little bit of weight because he had prediabetes, but he's putting it back on again. And like, we had a thing tonight. And, uh, and I was like, I was like, hey man, like you, you know, you look like you're putting on more weight. And he goes, yeah, you know, it's just the stress and blah, blah, blah. I'm like, I know, but you know, we're celebrating your kid's birthday. It's just, you should just, you know, and he read wants to do it. It's like that by saying that, it's just that reality check just to let them know. I'm not shaming him, but I don't think he's shaming his girlfriend either. That the, you know, that dude that, that wrote in. So it's, it's just kinda like, hey, you know, it's like you said, it's health. You know, it's, you gotta you gotta Stop, you know? Yeah. Fucking, just, you gotta be exercise. If you want to live, you got to exercise and take care of yourself. What you eat is fuel. It doesn't need to be doing everything.

Speaker 1:          00:54:40       I'm not gonna say his name, but a guy I knew a couple of years ago. Yeah. Oh, the last time I saw him, I saw him sit down and go, this guy does not look good. And he was not eating healthy food. Any I you fucking dead a month later. Fuck yeah, dude. And it's just like, but you're not supposed to say something. Somebody who is addicted to heroin but out and I got a temper and shit. My wife can skin step in on that. But there's something about like, you know, being fat. These people are just like, no man, I'm a fucking eight. You've just been convinced by sis. Like they take it, like you're saying, they're not beautiful people. It's like, you know, if I just saw you would just some fat shit. Yeah. I don't know. But it wasn't my fucking idea either, man. So yeah. Yeah. You can go fuck yourself with all your stupid like that, that, that all, all of that. So you went to about brown shirt. The way this whole thing is written, this is the kind of person that tries to make you lose your job.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       1000000% there. They're very active on Yelp.

Speaker 1:          00:55:33       Yeah. All right, and then fell titles. Hey, pasty pigs. Spin takes chem professor, you've asked about super bowl titles. First, NFL championship. Oh Great. Maybe this person has this solution. The issue here is not the answer, it's the question. If someone asks which team have never won a Superbowl, it has a different answer than if someone asks which team has never won an NFL championship. Even a complicated more, you could ask who has never won a league championship, which also includes AFL champion chips and other leagues. All right, I understand all of this. For official NFL champions from 1920 to 1932 there was no championship game. The championship champion was decided by the best record only. Okay. Now none of this is answering my question. That's like back in the day when baseball, all those world series that they count, do you not winning the pennant was back in the year.

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       Back in the day, you had the brand of the regular season. If you had the best record in the American league, you won the pennant, there was no play off. Yeah. And then you went to the champions. You went to the world series. Yeah. So all those years, the Yankees won all those fucking titles. They had one playoff series to win. It wasn't this divisional, it wasn't three rounds of playoffs, which people have to do now are they doing, but were they doing, when they got into that world series was, how many games was it was [inaudible] seven that was still seven games. The early 19 hundreds where it was best was best five on a nine. That's five out of nine. Yeah. Fuck Dude. That would go until like December if they did that now, like I think the Red Sox, 1903, we won that world series five games to three. Hey man, it's gay made coming to your house for gay mate.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       Um, anyways, from 1933 to 1969, there was a championship game and the winner of that was the NFL champion from 1966 on that champion went on to play in the Superbowl and then when it was called the world champion, that's not true. 66, 67, 68, the end of those seasons or whatever, those are 66, 67, 68, 69, whatever it was. Those first three against the AFL was called the AFL NFL title was not called the soup bowl. Later on retroactively, it was named the super bowl from 1960 to 69 AFL had champions. That's true. But they aren't counted as NFL history, but they are counted as the team's history. If you are asking how many? Yes. Okay. Uh, from 1966, 69 in the NFL AFL champions played the Superbowl. I skies just telling me Shit. They didn't play the Superbowl. It was renamed that designers should be called facts. Yeah, just facts.

Speaker 1:          00:58:07       Facts. Facts, facts. Facts. Okay. So in 1966, the AFL channels, the Kansas City's ship chiefs, the NFL champions, green bay packers. This is the plus one league championship for each team. Chiefs lost when they played in in the first NFL. If so, they didn't get a Superbowl win, but they still the AFL champion. I understand all of this. I understand all of this. None of that cleared anything up. I'm saying why don't they count those? Yeah. It's like you go to the stadium, like the AFL merge to be part of the NFL. So you're saying that at any most NFL stadiums, there are no trophies to represent the league champions. Just yes. If you look at the flow, I'm sure in the, somewhere in the stadium maybe they'll have, they'll have that, but it's just like, you know when you go to a, you know, you go to the fucking Red Sox, Fenway park, I mean we have our banners right down the thing, 1903 to fucking 2018 yeah. Everybody has all of that. They're all of them count. Know that that's there. I appreciate it was fun to read all that history, but that didn't answer my question. Why aren't they counted?

Speaker 5:          00:59:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:27       I mean when it comes to the Superbowl man, it's just if it's not in, there's those words super in bowl or before them they, they just, they act like it didn't happen. You Act like it didn't happen. Yeah. Well I mean it's just, you could still say do championships, but I I, I completely see what you're saying right now. It actually kind of fucked up day on set about the eagles. They've never won a Superbowl. They last thing they one was an NFL title. It's like, yeah, well that was the peak of fucking 1960 they were the best fucking football team out there. And you're talking about her like it would like they, they, they, they lost the election. Yeah, I dunno. Anyways, living in Wyoming. Hey Billy, silly. It's silly city slicker. I was listening to some older podcasts episodes and came across a rant you had about Wyoming.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       I like Wyoming. I didn't remember what I said. Like these people, they just find tidbits. I live in Wyoming. I got to say, you are not too far off. I listened to the podcast every week while I feel my cows off, feed my cows off the back of a flatbed truck. Shut up. I know this guy's fuck with me. Last week we killed a problem mountain lion and next weekend we'll be entering into a competitive coyote hunt. I live in the absolute middle of fucking nowhere. This sounds amazing. This guy, this guy listens to Steve Earle. Yeah. But this guy is way more interesting in a party than I am. I do stand up comedy. Oh yeah. What did you do? You know, I saved five of our sheep, you know, from a mountain lion by, uh, I came in third in it off. I came in third in the coyote hunt nationals. I want to talk to that guy. The nearest town population is 3000 miles and it's 40 miles away. Also, just to clear the air, most of the billionaire cons live up in Jackson, uh, and the rest of Wyoming. Oh, that's what I was saying. I still want to be the Douche in Hollywood that gets a place in Wyoming and the rest of Wyoming pretty much discounts. Jackson is being

Speaker 1:          01:01:21       part of the state anyway, so I'll pretty much discounts it as being part of state. Partially unrelated. I finished getting my pilot's license last year and hope to start on my helicopter rating within the next year. Good for you. My family has used a bell jet ranger to hunt coyotes. Jesus. How much more of an advantage do you need for three generations now? And I'm ready to start flying the Holly, do you have like one of those fucking Vietnam guns? Dead Job. Yeah. Job Doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Today. How do you shoot a doe? Easy. You just don't lead him as much. Uh, am I ready to start flying the heli to carry on the, Oh and I'm ready to start flying. They had to carry and a tradition, so cheers to a fellow pilot. That's cool as shit. Uh, just wanted to let you know there's at least one can listen to your podcasts in Wyoming and love all the shit you put out things.

Speaker 1:          01:02:05       And Go fuck yourself. That's cool man. I'm trying to get eight hours a month, uh, flying. And have you been flying a lot recently? I got 7.9 for this month and I'm fine tomorrow morning. And then what are you gonna take me up dude? Huh? When I have three over 300 hours, uh, I want to do a little bit of instrument training and just get better at it and, and like do some full, I would, I would do full downs in the whole fucking thing before I would ever take up my first passenger. And I love you too much to have you be my first passenger, but there's a few people in my life that I like, so I'll be taking them up first. Okay. I believe that. And then, do you know what I mean? It's just like, do I want to kill this guy or this guy?

Speaker 1:          01:02:41       Wait, dude wasn't like Sophie's choice with a helicopter. How are we going to go? We're going to go to see iron maiden in Las Vegas and then that should be like the time that we do that. Does that, sorry. Ps. If you want to try a new cigar, checkout deadwood, tobacco company out of Deadwood, South Dakota. The sweet Jane is is my favorite cigar I have ever smoked. See you. You see your ball. Fuck. Well I mean some guy out there in the fucking range shooting coyotes. I bet you know. Go to deadwood. Yeah, that sounds fucking pretty cool to me. All right, we've got to wrap this thing up. Do we get some gas and the smoke in the desert? It's our three minutes. Perfect. Alright. Drone. You'll Billy up there. Uh, you were talking about a drawing last week that would taxi people around. Sounded like the one you mentioned was unmanned.

Speaker 1:          01:03:31       Check this thing out. It's 57 batteries yet to do that is, I was joking about that fucking thing dude. They, they're going to do this thing rather than deal with the population problem. The next thing they do is have like, like I got, it looks like a, it looks like a helicopter and you just get in it. There's nobody in there and he'll just like take you across to la now. First of all, I would think it would be super expensive unless it's electric. Unless, yeah. Uh, Elon Musk can make the thing, but dude, you know, you fucking laptop crashes. Your phone craps out on you. Oh, you open like dude, you're going to fly somebody like over eight, like the level of insurance. Like how are you going to do that? I was joking that you're going to have some hipster come fly through was on his way to a pocket watch convention out in fucking Venice beach or something.

Speaker 1:          01:04:15       Oh we found was his handlebar mustache. Yeah. He was on his way to this to meet this food truck. Um, yeah, whatever. I think it was. So there, there is a, so what I just thought I'd get this clear in. Okay. Can I show you something super pleased show to me. Boy. I remember just trying to, cause I'm not, I'm kind of confused. You're saying there is going to be a transportation that like is it a drone? So it's like you get into a tube and then it just lifts the tube up and flies. You kind of looks like a helicopter. It looks fucking cool as shit. I figured it looks fucking cool. You show it as though he's showing me now. Wow. I want to show you this, this app here for flight. Um, and this is what I'm getting better at here. So this, this here, once I get good at, you know, confident enough in my abilities and I take up a passenger so it just, you don't have to know.

Speaker 1:          01:05:06       It's not like back in the fucking day we'd had to have like a fucking sectional map on your and you fucking thigh as you're flying around. This thing gives you all the, uh, the airports, all the, um, any of Santa Barbara. Where are we? Where are we? The, there's Van Nuys, there's Burbank right there. So it's pink. So that's a Charlie. Uh, and then you got, oh, it's so great is you could just fucking type in whatever you want to type in. It gives you, the aid is, it gives you the, uh, contact tower. It has a map runway. This is probably what most of the time would you land out there and why they slam on the brakes because this is so fucking short. That is a small ass landing strip. Yeah. Uh, well I don't know how he could tell it from the APP. I think cause I just told you it was um, uh, being a cut right now.

Speaker 1:          01:05:55       Uh, there's Lti Burbank, there's El Monte. It's one of my favorite ones but it has all but it has, see what would you see with, this is so boring for people here, but you see right there, that's a delta. So grounded 2,400. So right here when you're flying it on the, the two 15, you know, I'm going to be in the aerospace, I got to call them and they'll just give you clearance all the way through. And then once you learn how to read this fucking thing, you can kind of just fly around out here. Now the rest of the country, they actually have to deal with that weather. See I don't have to deal with because people like you should just fly across the country. It's like, this is a dry climate. I don't have to ever deal with, hey, everything's do all that it all of a sudden yet I can't see anything.

Speaker 1:          01:06:34       There's a brutal fucking call of a guy who like me is not instrument rated. Yeah. Which means if the clouds came in underneath me, I don't know how to get back down other than to just shut my eyes and go through the clouds and hope I fuck. Yeah. Yeah. So he's up there in the soup is or whatever the fuck they call it and do this guy is free. I've got a dog. And then they fought, the guy talked him down and then afterwards he fucking so he lived. Yeah, but he called the tower. He goes uh yeah, thanks about, and the guy says total ice go. Yeah. Well he goes, what happened up there? Yeah, you fucking pussy is basically saying what happened up there as he got involved in some shit that, that you know, he wasn't looking for. So that's, that's the one weird thing about flying is you learned by other people die are doing dumb shit cause he died one, one size going, she'll be one one time with this guy was doing a tour in the 44 a Robinson 44 and he had three people then when he took off, right?

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       Yeah. I'm fucking just did this really just, I don't know what, he just didn't go, like he just ignored everything you're supposed to do. He was loaded up with people. He had, I imagine, you know, a low, heavy with fuel. So what you wanna do is you should forward momentum to get going. And he just pulled all this fucking power and as low RPM horn comes on. And now the weird thing was the chicken, the passengers, she was going, whew. Like why did this like the same fucking note? So he didn't hear it at first and all he had to do, he was bank, come out of the bank, lower your collective and it'll go off and then just gradually climb up. And he did it for a second and then he pulled it out again. And it came on again and then he just started descending.

Speaker 1:          01:08:12       And your instinct is want to poke cause you want to go up. Yeah, she wanna you actually want to bring you collect it down. He kept pulling power in these. Fuck, we're in the ground. They all fucking died. Oh fuck man. So I'll take you up. All right. Girlfriend is pregnant. Hey Billy sat. It's um, I'm, I'm 28 years old. Am I? 26 year old girlfriend just found out she's pregnant. Now you're saying this dude like you didn't blow the load dinner. She found out she's pregnant. Like she got fucking shingles of something. Uh, this came as a big sharp because I previously had a vasectomy when I was 22. Ah, there's the ants. Jesus Christ at 22. You, they had nine kids by then and he never wanted any here in the second 22 said, I never had never wanted kids after she told me, I went to a urologist who told me I had regained a sperm count, although rare, it was not unheard of.

Speaker 1:          01:09:04       When I met this girl, she changed my life. I had never trusted her. Loved any woman the way I do her. She's the light of my life, but weren't planning on this. We both have okay jobs, but living in California is expensive and adding a third mouth to feed and paying for doctors visits will crush us financially. She doesn't have health insurance. Do you have any advice for me? My fear is losing the chance to have kids with her as this may be a miracle considering my vasectomy and considered you waited a long time to have kids. I want to know if you think this would be a good for someone in my position to go through this. Thanks for taking the time to read this poorly and probably not under understand my situation. You will. Great. Cont uh, the old grey county word, he used to be.

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       Love your shows and I hope you here. I hope to hear more of your ramblings from you. Best to you the baby and go fuck yourself and your gay ass patriots. All right. Um, can I take this cause I think that he should do it. Yeah, I think you do. Don't, don't wait on life for your financial situation, man. If, if, if you guys will make it work, that's what you will make it work. You'll figure it out. You might not think that you have enough money right now, but something like life is constantly changing and evolving and it's just like lay off the micro Bruce and have the kid. Yeah, exactly. It's like you'll make it work. Just I think you should, you should. You should consider it a miracle. Just like you said, I think it's a great thing. I'm actually really happy for you and I think a, put it this way, I wish, you know, I wish I didn't wait as long as I did.

Speaker 1:          01:10:35       And the other day I was watching this, I was watching this, uh, this kid's song. Um, it's just as simple as like snow flakes, Snow Flake lit. Oh, snow flakes, no flakes, snow flake, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. And my daughter was trying to sing it and she was throwing her head back goes, Yo. Flags I think wasn't quite impaired, dude. I, I had to fight off getting emotional. Just watching her do that. She's the most beautiful thing in the world. And there's nothing, up until then, anything fucking I've done. Madison Square Garden was not as good as that, not eat and not even remotely is he like lit Madeline's programs like wow, that's amazing. But that moment with my daughter, I was like, this is what life is all about. 100% this is what it's all about. And then another great thing is you become a dad and one of the greatest fucking things ever and some sage advice I learned from a good dad is he said, how awesome is cause he goes, it's not about you anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:11:32       And at first I kind of took that as like, you know, cause I'm a very like, like don't tell me what the fuck to do idiot sometimes. And then I realized, uh, uh, how great that is. Like the other day I finally had a day off and my wife wanted to go on and go get some breakfast. She goes, you want to do that? I was like, no, finally homeowner to stay home instead. I was just like, I fuck it. That's what she wants to do. And we just went out there and I said, yeah, it's not about you. They want to go out to breakfast, take them out the fucking breakfast. And I went out to breakfast and I had a great fucking time and I had a great time. And it's weird when you're home, you're a dad or whatever, blah, blah. But when you go out, you kind of feel more like a dad.

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       I don't know why. We know, it's like you can take them out to dinner or whatever out of the car. You're walk and she's holding your hand or you're carrying her. You go in, you get her in the little booster seat, he'd get her or whatever. Like it's usually like a Mac and cheese or like a cut up hot dog or some shit. And I assume that she's at that age and you didn't, you just, people are looking at the kid and look how beautiful the kid is and everything. I know. It's just like, dude, you're in your element, man. Yeah, no, it's awesome. I know what's cool. She's really, really beginning to talk now. So, uh, yeah it's getting to the point where I can actually convey to her and she will understand how much I love her, which is going to be great cause that's doable.

Speaker 1:          01:12:43       Yeah. Cause I always say you as how much I love you. Do you understand that? And it should just be looking at you smiling or whatever, but I'll, I'll actually be able to say it. She'll be able to understand it. Yeah. I can't wait. Can't wait to fucking play catch with her. I want to teach her how to drive my truck. Three on the tree. What kid born in 2018 is going to know how to work seven. Sorry. No, I know. I did forget about drivers stick five three on the column. I took it today. I took it over to a Jiffy Lube, which I know a lot of fucking car people are going to give me shit for that. You went to Jiffy Lube? Well I would change it but the, the way they designed the, the guy who ever fucking design the engine did not talk to the guy who fucking design the frame on that truck.

Speaker 1:          01:13:18       Because the frame, there's like literally a piece that goes from one side or the other right underneath the fucking plug for the drain play at Penn. So the only, it's just a giant fucking mess. Like when they do what they have to have this giant thing underneath it and it comes down and it splashes all over that, that piece that goes across. And then they have like this spray thing and then the air thing that they shoot all off. It's like, I'm going to do that in my garage and have a fucking oil spill. I can't do it. I hate it. I used to love doing it when I was a kid. I used to though. It was like my favorite thing because I knew how to do what I would change the fuel filter. I knew how to do a loop job and he'll do the whole fucking, all of that maintenance stuff. But I never had the balls to start taking apart the fucking engine or whatever. But uh, anyways, that's the podcast. We've got a cigar to smoke. Uh, Hey, your pick for the Superbowl patriots. A Rams I think is going to be the patriots. I really do think so. I do. I can do

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       to be honest with you. Like I, I kind of, I love watching greatness and I know what people like to hate on the Patriots and I know I teased you sometimes, but it's just like, dude, he's, he's so good.

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       Well, I think it's going to, I'm going to die a thousand deaths as always and I really think that, uh, I mean we're going up against what's looking like the next bell a check.
