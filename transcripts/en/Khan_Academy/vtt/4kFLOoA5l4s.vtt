00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.870
- [Instructor] You will hear
the term production function

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.950
thrown around in economic circles,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.510
and it might seem a little intimidating

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.350
and a little mathy at first.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.450
But as you're about to see,
it's a fairly basic idea.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.430
It's this idea that you could
have these various inputs.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.800
Let's call this input number one,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.090
and then you have input number two.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.430
And you can keep going,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.490
and then you put them in, their inputs,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.350
into some type of process.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.040
And then that function,
let's just call that f,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.260
that's going to describe

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.600
how much output you can
get given that input.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.590
We can also describe it a
little bit more mathematically.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.360
Those of you who remember your Algebra Two

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.810
might recognize this.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.470
Or we could say the output,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.690
it's often use the letter
Q in economic circle,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.860
it's going to be a function,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.690
it's going to be a function
of the various inputs.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.450
So I'll put input number one,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.410
input number two, and you could go,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.900
you could have as many
inputs as is necessary

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.600
to produce that good.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.020
And these inputs, if you
wanted to categorize them,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.480
these are the classic
factors of production

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.290
that we would have talked about before.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.070
These would be,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.290
these would be your

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.363
land, labor, capital,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.520
and entrepreneurship.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.490
And it doesn't have to be all of them,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.040
but each of these inputs
would likely be factored

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.220
as one of these.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.650
Now, this might still seem
very abstract and very mathy.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.305
So to make things very tangible,

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:34.500
let's give a, well, let's
give a tangible example.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.730
Let's say that we're trying

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.510
to make a bread toasting operation.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.490
So what we need to do is we take bread,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.890
we stick it in a toaster,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.050
and then once it's toast, we're done.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.650
And so what are our inputs there?

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.190
Well, you're definitely
going to need some bread,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.140
so let me draw some bread right over here,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410
my best attempt at drawing bread.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.420
So that right over there, that is bread.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020
You could call that input number one.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.220
Now you're also going to need a toaster,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.020
at least one toaster, or
toasters I should say.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.510
And let's say the toasters
that we use for this operation,

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.563
they can toast four
pieces of bread at a time,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.700
and it takes 10 minutes to do that,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.690
four slices in 10 minutes.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.850
Now you might say, well,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.100
aren't those going to
be all of our inputs?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.830
But then the obvious question
is that bread isn't just going

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.900
to jump into the toaster on
its own and then jump back out.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.190
Someone, there's going to be,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.050
needs to be some labor to
operate this operation.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.040
So we're going to need
some toaster operators,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.650
and let's say that they can process,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.390
they can process one slice per minute,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.020
one slice per minute.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.060
I know many of you all are thinking

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.260
that you could do better than that,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.820
but try to do it all day,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.970
one slice per minute.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.080
Now based on this,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.480
if these are really
all of the three inputs

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.670
into producing the output
toasted piece of bread,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.550
we could try to construct
a production function here.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.930
So let's do that.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.080
So let's say then the output
is going to be the number

00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.300
of slices of toasted bread.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.780
And it's going to be equal to,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.260
and I'm gonna write this as,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.900
well, I'm gonna make
our production function

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.590
as being the minimum of several values.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.790
And what you're going to
see, it's going to be based

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.700
on what's going to be
our rate-limiting factor?

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.270
And I want to get too much in
the weeds with you on this,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.870
but just to help us understand,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.040
so it's going to be the minimum of,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.610
well, the amount of bread
you have, so slices of bread,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.610
slices of bread.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.900
And why does that make sense?

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.180
Well, you're only,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.110
the amount of toasted
bread you can produce

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.977
is always going to be limited

00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:55.760
by the amount of untoasted bread

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.690
that you put into your process.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.800
If you only have 60 that's
going in per hour here,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.010
well, then you can only produce

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.200
a maximum of 60 right over here,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.140
and this is going to be per hour,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.330
per hour.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.330
So this is gonna be the
slices of bread per hour.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.190
Now, our other input,

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.190
how much toast can one
toaster toast in one hour?

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.740
Well, if they do four
slices in 10 minutes,

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.680
we'll multiply that time
six to get to an hour.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.460
That's gonna be 24 slices per hour.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.460
So we could do 24 times
the number of toasters,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.263
times the toasters.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.393
And then last but not least,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.520
how much bread or how many slices

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.410
can one person process per hour?

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.550
Well, it's going to be 60 slices per hour.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.510
So we'll do 60 times,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.890
times, let's call them workers,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.840
I was gonna call 'em toasters,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.740
but we are using that for the equipment,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.750
times the number of workers.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.270
And so it's worth, at this point,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.050
just pause this video and
really process what's going on.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.613
What are the inputs here,
and what are the outputs?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.130
Well, the inputs are right over here.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.950
This is the number of
slices of bread per hour,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.310
the number of toasters
we have at our disposal,

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.370
the number of workers.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.120
Toasters you could view as capital.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.940
Workers you could view as labor.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.580
And now another interesting
thing to think about,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.150
and we will talk a lot
about this in economics,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.920
is what's going on in the
long run and the short run?

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.860
And production functions are useful

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.540
for thinking about the
long run in the short run

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.210
because the short run is defined,

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.550
the short run is defined

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.630
as the situation in which at least one

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.640
of your inputs is fixed.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.640
Let me write this down, at least,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.640
at least one input is fixed.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.500
Now, what does that mean

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.320
in our bread toasting
example right over here?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.750
Well, let's just say that we can,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.750
it's very easy to get slices of bread.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.147
If we have the capacity and
we want to produce more bread,

00:06:09.147 --> 00:06:10.650
the slices of bread are,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.720
let's say it's just never
our rate-limiting factor.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.650
So that part isn't fixed.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.680
But to get a new toaster,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.170
let's say these are special toasters,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.010
and you gotta order them
and it takes a month.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.843
So let's say that there's

00:06:21.843 --> 00:06:23.750
a one-month lead time on this input,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.053
one month lead time.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.800
And let's say, for workers,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.650
there's just not a line of
people ready to toast toast.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.210
You have to put a job posting out there,

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.890
and you're going to have
to interview people.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.890
And so let's say that it takes
two weeks to hire someone,

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.950
so two weeks to hire,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.110
or I guess you could also say two weeks

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.920
to hire or to fire someone if
you want to reduce capacity.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.420
Let's say it takes one month
to either get a toaster

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.240
or to remove a toaster.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.300
Well, in that case, the short
run in this situation is

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.650
a time period where at least
one of the inputs is fixed.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.720
So pause this video, and think about

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.013
what would be the short
run in our situation?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.380
Well, the short run in our situation,

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.420
the number of toasters
we're going to have is going

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.290
to be fixed for at least a month.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.130
So our short run, in this
situation, is up to a month,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.040
so up to,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.960
up to a month.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.020
And then the other side of it,

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.723
what would the long run be?

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:30.920
Well, in the long run,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.810
by definition none of
your inputs are fixed.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.070
You can change the number you
have of any of these things.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.190
So our long run is
going to be greater than

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.490
one month in this example.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.700
Now, it's really worth noting

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.890
that was just for this example.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.740
If we were talking about some
type of automobile factory

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.640
and the output is the number
of automobiles produced per day

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.060
or per month and then you
have all these inputs,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.520
you would have your metal,
you would have your labor,

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.590
and then you would have the equipment

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.320
for the factory itself,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.100
well, there, the long run,

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.990
it might take another
year or even two years

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.710
or five years to build a factory.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.500
In that case, the long run
would be the time period

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.730
greater than amount it takes
to build another factory.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.380
Usually, capital is the
thing that is most fixed

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.120
for the longest period of time,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.930
and that's why it made it hard
for us to get our toasters.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.250
So I will leave ya there.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.510
This is just an introduction

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.590
to the idea of a production function.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.990
But hopefully with our
bread toasting example,

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.053
it is not so intimidating.
