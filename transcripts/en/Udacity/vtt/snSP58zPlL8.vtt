For this situation, there's a simple relationship between the day and the number

00:00:04.306 --> 00:00:08.406
of units that have been produced up till' that point. I'll begin by telling you

00:00:08.418 --> 00:00:12.460
that the total number of wiper blades that have been made, which I'm going to

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:16.481
label n right now, is equal to some number times the number of days that have

00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:20.585
passed. And from now on, I'm going to call the number of days that have passed

00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:25.803
d. So, what I just said is that n equals some number times d. Remember, n refers

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:30.816
to the total number of units that have been made, and d refers to the number of

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:35.656
days that have passed. So, fill in the blank right here with the number you

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.409
think belongs in that spot.
