00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
We spend a lot of time thinking about atoms
as looking like this.

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:07.640
There's a ball and there's a stick, and there's
another ball and another stick.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.019
It's just a bunch of balls stuck together
by these little wooden bonds. Simple.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.900
Pretty easy to understand, and thus — as you have probably come to expect — it is entirely incorrect.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.620
Nuclei really can be understood as little
balls, and that's more or less correct,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.540
though when you get to some of the bigger, less stable ones they start looking more oblong and weird like a rugby ball.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.320
Atoms are basically ball-like as well, with electrons and a spherical cloud around the nucleus.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.820
But molecules, as we discussed last time,
do not look like balls on sticks.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.980
Bonds don't form into neat little lines.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.340
They form from overlapping electron clouds or shells, flowing around the nuclei of bonded atoms.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.300
If you really get down there and
understand what they look like,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.140
they're like lumpy, clumpy globs of probable
electron locations.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.380
And these lumpy, clumps of probable electron locations do not behave the way you might initially expect them to behave.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.059
Oh no. That would be far too simple.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.180
They behave based on quantum mechanical, 3-dimensional
wave functions,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.860
probabilistic distributions of electrons in
space.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.720
And yeah, by the end of this episode, you're going to understand what I just said and it's gonna be awesome!

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:23.460
[Theme Music]

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.640
Let's start with water, because all the interesting
things on our planet start with water.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.120
It's also universally common, not just on
our planet but in our galaxy and our universe.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.400
Case in point: In 2011, astronomers discovered
a cloud of water-ice surrounding a black hole

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.340
that contains 140 trillion times more water
than we have here on Earth.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.939
And while we don't have any confirmed worlds
covered in water outside of our solar system,

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.220
we do have some right here in our solar system.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.770
Europa contains so much water, probably salt
water, that its entire surface is just ice.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.720
What did any of that have to do with atomic
orbitals? Nothing.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.060
I just felt like maybe I scared you with all
that quantum mechanics talk before the intro

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.270
and I wanted to chill you out for a second.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.220
Okay, so water. We did its Lewis structure
last week, remember?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.080
Each hydrogen bonding to the oxygen atom,
and voilà!

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.450
But that drawing is linear, just a straight
line through all the nuclei,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.280
and we know, just instinctually at this point,
that water is a bent molecule.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.800
But why?
Why is water crooked?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.700
Unbonded atoms within a molecule generally like to be as far away from each other as possible,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.440
especially if they have the same partial charge
as the 2 hydrogens do with their partial positives.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.280
But something is keeping those hydrogens closer
together than they would like to be.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.760
So why on earth are they not stretched out
as far away from each other as possible?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.099
I ask this because if they were, the water
molecule wouldn't be polar,

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:50.080
and if water was suddenly non-polar we would
all instantly die, as would all life on Earth.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.120
And suddenly, we realize that this seemingly normal thing that we knew about the world is really weird.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.760
And weird stuff is my favorite stuff because
it means interesting questions.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.000
Interesting questions I want to know the answer
to.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.280
It's an even more compelling question than,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.780
"What the heck is a quantum mechanical 3-dimensional
wave function?"

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.040
Well, of course, the answer to this question
has a great deal to do with

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.640
quantum mechanical 3-dimensional wave functions,
so let's start there.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.620
Oh, look!
I've got a telephone cord!

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.129
This is what old people used to use to get
their voices into wires

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.160
so they could be transmitted across the world
before cell phones,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.319
but today it's pretty much only useful for
demonstrating electron fields.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.489
Electrons are both particles and waves, which
is not an easy thing to imagine.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.100
Very basically, you can think of them as an excitation of the electron field, which exists everywhere.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.080
When energy is dumped into the electron field,
electrons exist inside a wave function.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.720
What's a wave function?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.820
It's a mathematical function that describes the probability that an electron is in a certain place at any given moment.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.940
So, this telephone cord is an electron field.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.060
I dump some energy into it and we create what's
called a standing wave.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.980
The wave function is the mathematical function
that describes it.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.160
Electrons function the same way.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.090
They exist as excitations in the electron
field around the nucleus in a standing wave.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.260
The simplest of these wave functions is the
s orbital,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.549
which can contain 2 electrons and is a spherical
pattern of standing waves around the nucleus.

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.200
This standing wave can have different numbers
of nodes,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.079
allowing patterns to repeat themselves when
there are more electrons around the nucleus.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.879
Every orbital can contain, and indeed is at
its lowest energy when it contains, 2 electrons.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.009
Hydrogen has one electron in its s orbital.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:31.139
Helium, an ultra-stable, very low-energy noble
gas, has 2.

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.169
It's happy cause it has its shell filled.

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.949
But, of course, there are other sorts of orbitals
as well.

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.489
After we fill the first and second s orbitals,
we move on to filling the p orbital.

00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:45.580
Or rather, I should say p orbitals, because
we're talking about 3 dimensional space here,

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.189
so there can be one on the x axis, and one
on the y axis, and one on the z axis.

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.080
Each of those can contain 2 electrons for
a total of 8

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.249
with 2 in the s orbital and 6 in the 3 p orbitals.

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.619
And yes, those 8 electrons are the reason
for whole the octet rule thing.

00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:02.469
Remember now, the periodic table is a map
of the orbitals as they fill.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.619
Elements in the s block are filling their
s orbitals.

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:06.659
Elements in the p block are filling their
p's.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.320
Same with the d's and the f's.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.399
So, s orbitals, very simple, spherical, p orbitals a little bit weirder, d and f orbitals, so crazy.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:17.919
Some of the f orbitals in particular have
just ridiculously cool geometries.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.139
Lots of fancy math is involved in writing out these wave functions and understanding them.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.680
So, with hydrogen, we've just got the one
s orbital.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.020
It's a sphere.
Marvelously uncomplicated.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.020
But, in the second shell, we have an s orbital
and 3 p orbitals.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.939
The p orbitals, if they were all by themselves,
look like this.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.040
But, when you actually stick them around an atom, the s and p orbitals start to interact with each other,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.399
doing their best not to overlap and changing
each other.

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.279
The s and the p orbitals can merge into hybrid
sp orbitals.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.180
Instead of being 2 different kinds of orbitals, they become 4 identical orbitals trying their best not to overlap.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.760
This is called orbital hybridization.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.570
When the s orbital hybridizes with all 3 p
orbitals it's called sp3 hybridization and

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.479
it forms a tetrahedral shape.

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.919
And this is that tetrahedral shape.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.599
It's the easiest way for all the orbitals to form something like a sphere around the atom, but not interact too much.

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.330
I didn't do anything fancy to make these balloons
take this shape.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.429
I just tied them together at the base.

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:18.419
They naturally formed this shape because they
can't overlap with each other.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.420
And yes, this is exactly what's going on with
water.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.800
In water, oxygen's 8 electrons are arranged
with 2 in each sp3 hybridized orbital.

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:29.050
2 of those electrons are from hydrogen.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.429
6 are from oxygen, including 2 lone pairs.

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:36.469
Those lone pairs, even though they're not participating in any bonds, still have their orbitals.

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:39.619
And so water is locked into that tetrahedral
structure.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.699
No matter which orbital you stick the hydrogen atoms to, you're stuck with an asymmetrical molecule.

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.699
That, along with the difference in electronegativities
of oxygen and hydrogen,

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.539
leads to the polarity of water and the existence
of life.

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.580
But s and p orbitals can hybridize in other
ways as well.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.629
How, for example, could you imagine sp3 orbitals
forming a double bond?

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.929
You can't have 2 orbitals mashing together
in the same space,

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:06.839
and sp3 orbitals are pretty much stuck in
their tetrahedral structure.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:10.059
Well, if a molecule is going to be at its
lowest energy state by forming a double bond,

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:11.550
it has a nice simple solution.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:17.619
It only hybridizes 2 p orbitals with the s
orbital, forming 3 sp2 hybridized orbitals

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:21.059
with an unhybridized p orbital sticking up
from the center.

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:24.619
Tie balloons together like that, and you get
what we call a trigonal plane.

00:07:24.619 --> 00:07:30.629
Each sp2 orbital is 120° away from the other,
drawing a line straight through their centers,

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:32.679
and you get an equilateral triangle.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.760
One of the 2 bonds in the double bond has sp2 orbitals merging together nicely in line with the nuclei.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.059
This straightforward sort of bond is called
a sigma bond.

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:43.309
A second and weirder bond forms,

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:47.699
this one from the unhybridized p orbital sticking
out above and below the nucleus.

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:50.599
These atoms merge to form a pi bond.

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:54.399
That's your nice symmetrical double bond that
you see in molecules like ethylene.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.560
And, yes, sp orbitals, where the s only hybridizes with one p orbital, are also all over the place.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.360
These occur when an atom is either triple bonded to another atom or is double bonded to 2 atoms.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.020
The sp orbital, the one that forms the sigma
bonds here, is linear.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.580
There are just 2 of them, balloons, easy,
see? Straight line.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.779
The trick is to have those 2 unhybridized
p orbitals that can engage in 2 pi bonds,

00:08:18.779 --> 00:08:23.349
either to form a single triple bond or to
form 2 double bonds like in carbon dioxide.

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:27.760
Carbon dioxide's orbital structure is actually really cool, so let's take a look at it as an example.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.739
The carbon is going to have 2 double bonds,

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:34.539
so it has to have 2 un-hybridized p orbitals
and one sp hybridized orbital.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.300
The oxygens are going to have one double bond,

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.460
so they need to set up as sp2 hybridized with one un-hybridized p orbital, for the double bonding.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.200
As they come together for the bond, the sigma
bonds will occur between the hybridized orbitals.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.360
Very simple.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.300
One oxygen will line up to form a pi bond with the vertically oriented p orbital from the carbon

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.630
and the other will line up with the horizontally
oriented one.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.300
There you have it.
Bond, bond, bond, bond.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:02.840
But, of course, as will always be the case in your unrelenting search for more knowledge, there is yet more to learn.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.640
d and f orbitals can hybridize with sp hybridized
orbitals

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:09.160
and with each other, forming some gorgeously
peculiar geometries,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.509
and when 2 d orbitals hybridize with sp3 orbitals,
you get d2sp3, an octahedral structure,

00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:19.389
which those of you who play role playing games
will recognize as an 8-sided die.

00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:21.899
These orbital configurations determine the
shape of molecules,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.620
and the shape of molecules determines how they behave, what forms they take, what properties they have.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:34.740
It's pretty dang amazing, really, that wave functions determining the probable locations of electrons keep water bent,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.860
and thus polar, and thus able to dissolve
nutrients and form a stable home for ourselves

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.860
so that we can walk around as weird bags of
mostly water thinking about stuff,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:50.040
making YouTube videos, trying to learn more about the world, or maybe just trying to pass a test.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.360
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:58.240
If you were paying attention today, you learned that molecules are clumpy globs of probable electron locations

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.160
determined by wave functions that are a bit more complicated than waves on a telephone cord,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.699
that water is an asymmetrical molecule because
of oxygen's sp3 hybridized orbitals forcing

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:10.120
the electrons into a tetrahedral structure,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.060
and that s and p orbitals can also hybridize
other ways as sp2 or sp

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:20.800
and how those hybridizations allow for double and triple bonds using both sigma and pi bond types.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.620
Finally, you learned that d orbitals can get
involved too,

00:10:23.629 --> 00:10:27.439
allowing for hybridizations that form even
cooler 3-dimensional shapes.

00:10:27.439 --> 00:10:31.500
