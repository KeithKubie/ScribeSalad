00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.469
So my name's Kurt Smith, I'm a data scientist

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.440
on the Analytics team here at Twitter. Been here about

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.180
two and a half years right now and I

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.280
took, you know, a somewhat long and windy path to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.210
getting here. I actually started out in college studying

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.390
chemical engineering and then ended up doing a PhD in

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.260
computational fluid dynamics and molecular modeling And spent quite a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.870
while working in academia doing computational research I went from

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.210
there I moved to San Francisco several years back, and I

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.420
initially started working in the chemicals industry doing a lot of

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.030
molecular modeling. And from there the first big leap I would,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.980
I may that I would say brought me more to the data

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.860
science direction was, moving to a startup in the healthcare space,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.170
that was doing a lot of data analysis on a risk modeling

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.570
around chronic disease. And that really was the opportunity, or gave

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.660
me the opportunity to take a lot of my mathematical background, and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.810
apply it to data driven problems. After working in

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.340
that area for a few years, I started to look

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.440
around in other fields with interesting data challenges. And

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.640
that brought me to moving to social media and Twitter.
