00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
So when you just compared algorithm A with algorithm B, I guess there were certain parts

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.560
of the running time that you did have a look at and that you based your comparison on

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.510
and there were other parts that you ignored.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:19.860
So the parts that you probably ignored are the +10 and the +256 because those are just constants

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.520
that we add to the running time function, and also when we compared function,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.860
we didn't really care about the -n or the -50n because we just look at the growth

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.150
of the 2n versus 3n².

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.980
And even the 3 here is not that important because if we had say 5n² here or 6n² or even 100n²,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.030
2n would still grow much faster.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.220
And this is why in theoretical computer science, we used a notation called Big O-notation

00:00:48.220 --> 99:59:59.000
that leads away all those things that we didn't really care about when comparing the algorithms.
