00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.280
so "Black New York" is a course that I
teach here at Columbia University which

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.250
really encourages students to think
about not just Columbia's relationship

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.859
to Harlem but think about the black
experience throughout the city. As a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.699
Bronxite I think it's very important for
our students to get a sense of the black

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.490
experience in New York beyond Harlem,
right? So looking at historic

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.179
neighborhoods in Brooklyn or in the Bronx
or in Queens and even going further

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.360
downtown looking at places like the
African burial ground which is a

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.450
historically significant site in
Manhattan in lower Manhattan so the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.579
course really is allowing students to get in
immersion into the particularities and

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.510
the dynamic cultures of the black
experience New York City. In recent years my

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.719
work has turned to sports and its
relationship to American identity

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.579
national identity and politics. I think
sport is a really fascinating venue to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.420
look at all sorts of questions: what we
think about manhood and womanhood, gender

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.550
identity, what we think about our nation,
patriotism, sports' relationship to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
the larger political economy. So sports
and looking at relationship to these

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.920
changing identities in politics allows
us to understand I think U.S. society in

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.100
new and novel ways
