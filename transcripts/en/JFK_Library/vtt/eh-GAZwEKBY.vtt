00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.487
(gentle classical music)

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.230
- This particular story
is just special in that it

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.960
occurred at a very particular
moment in our history,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.040
in the history of the
Civil Rights Movement,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.680
and it kind of linked
together what was happening

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.100
in this country as well
as that spirit of freedom

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.870
that was also sweeping across
Africa at the same time.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.100
We started planning it
six or nine months ago.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.650
Now there was quite a number of things.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.450
So we had obviously the
beautiful dress that Jacquelyn

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.620
Kennedy wore that evening.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.730
The gifts that the
president of the Ivory Coast

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.923
presented to President Kennedy

00:00:40.923 --> 00:00:44.120
and then just some of the
documents that show the meticulous

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.647
planning that went into this
event and really all of the

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:49.680
state events that are planned
mostly by the first lady.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.340
Her touch was really on every detail.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.340
Our collection holds
about 60 or 65 dresses.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.540
And it's a particularly
beautiful one, it's sparkly,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.160
and glittery, and it
really speaks to the glamor

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.430
and kind of the formality
and the dignity of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.570
a state event.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.570
A state event is always a
way for the host country

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:21.807
to kind of show off the
best of their country

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.057
and so our hope is that
people will come and see these

00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:29.740
original things and it
just reminds them that oh

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.460
President Kennedy and
Mrs. Kennedy occupied the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.104
White House.

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:35.320
They were, you know these
are the actual things,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.180
the physical materials
that they you know touched

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.850
and used and that chronicle
the things they accomplished

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.963
in the White House.
