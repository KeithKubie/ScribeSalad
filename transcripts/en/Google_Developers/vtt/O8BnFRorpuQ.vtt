TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.883
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.883 --> 00:00:08.154
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:09.570
Understanding the
various meanings

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.524
of a particular word in text is
key to understanding language.

00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:14.940
To help with this
challenge, we're

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.850
happy to announce the release
of Word-Sense annotations,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.480
manually annotated with senses
from the new Oxford American

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.500
Dictionary.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.970
This is one of the
largest releases

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.640
of fully sense-annotated
English corpora,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.069
and the GitHub link
is on the post.

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.110
There were three posts
this week from Google Play

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.420
in conversation with
developers about their success

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.370
on the platform.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.640
First, the co-founder and CEO
and the growth-hacking manager

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.000
of Wallapop explained how using
store listening experiments

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.820
has increased their
conversion rate by 17%

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.180
and has allowed them to
optimize organic installs.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.640
Next are some tips from
Peak and SoundCloud

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.290
on how to grow your
startup in Google Play.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.960
And a Southeast
Asian Indie developer

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.300
talked about how they
used Google Play features

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.330
to improve their conversion
rate by 25%, another

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
to significantly improve user
retention, and a third to grow

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.580
revenue by 100%.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.170
Google Cloud Audit
Logging helps you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.930
determine who did what,
where, and when on Google

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.210
Cloud Platform.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.780
We've significantly
expanded the set

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.510
of products integrated
including Google Computer Engine

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.430
and Google Container Engine.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.600
Details on how to get
started are on the post.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.470
A range of New York
City public datasets

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.390
are now available
on Google BigQuery,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.420
including over 8
million 311 service

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.720
requests, one billion
yellow and green taxi

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.370
rides, and a lot more.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.110
I know this because
Reto Meier told me

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.480
so on the first
episode of "Today

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.950
I learned with BigQuery."

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.990

big data or the next link

for this week's episode on how
to run a terabyte of queries

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.645
on Google BigQuery each month
without needing a credit card.

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:54.584
One more thing.

00:01:54.584 --> 00:01:56.750
We recently announced that
we've signed an agreement

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.240
to acquire Fabric to continue
the great work that Twitter

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.740
put into the platform.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.020
Fabric will join Google's
developer product group,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.570
working with the Firebase team
to help you build better apps

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.560
and grow your business.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.470

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:11.490
And I'll see you next week.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.112
