the question with any technology that
has both tremendous benefits and

positive contribution figure out a way
to try out new technologies in a

to try out new technologies in a
 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.289
to try out new technologies in a
decentralized small-scale way right now

break up communities or find some way to
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:23.320
