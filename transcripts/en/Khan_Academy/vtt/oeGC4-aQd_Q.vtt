00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.820
- [Instructor] Mirror equation
problems can be intimidating

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.240
when you first deal with them.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.360
And that's not because

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.180
the mirror equation's all that difficult.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.013
It's kinda easy.

00:00:08.013 --> 00:00:10.280
It's just a few fractions added together.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.270
The place where it gets tricky is deciding

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.420
whether these should be
positive or negative.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.240
So there's a bunch of positive
and negative sign decisions

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.370
that you have to make.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.820
And if you make even one
of those incorrectly,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.230
you can get the wrong answer.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.450
So let's do a few mirror
equation problems,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.460
and you can see how the signs work.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.640
Now I have to warn you,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.930
everyone has their own sign convention.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.500
There's a lot of
different sign conventions

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.900
when you deal with optics.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.760
The one I'm gonna use is the one

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.640
that I feel like most
textbooks are using these days,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.300
and it's the one where anything

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.640
on the front side of the mirror,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.240
so, by front side, your eyes
should be over here somewhere.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.350
So let's say your eyes
are over here, right?

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.970
You're looking at some object.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.890
Maybe it's an arrow or a crayon
right here, a blue crayon,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.390
you're holding in front
of this mirror right here.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.440
So this is the mirror right here.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.750
And the convention I'm using
is that anything on this side

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.610
of the mirror is gonna
be counted as positive.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.870
So if it's a focal point
on that side, positive.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.440
If it's an object distance
on this side, it's positive.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.710
And if the image distance
comes out positive,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.540
you'll know that it's also on
this front side of the mirror.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.190
Anything that comes out negative,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.910
so if we get a negative image distance

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.800
after we do our calculation,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.000
we'll know that that thing
is behind the mirror.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.070
That kinda makes sense,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.490
negative like behind,
positive like in front.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.700
So this side over here is in
front of the mirror, positive.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.350
And back here would be behind the mirror,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.580
and that would be negative.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.130
So I've got some numbers in here already.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.430
Let's just solve this one.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.420
So what do we do?

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.250
We're gonna use this mirror equation.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.580
We're gonna say that one
over the focal length,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.230
and already we have to decide

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.830
on a positive or negative sign.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.860
So this mirror, the way
it's shaped right here,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.750
based on how we're looking
at it, is a concave mirror.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.970
And with the sign
conventions we just discussed

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.180
and the signs I'm using in this formula,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.700
concave mirrors always have
a positive focal length.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.510
So, in other words, since this focal point

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.760
is four centimeters from
the center of the mirror,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.490
I'm gonna have to plug in the focal length

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.110
as positive four centimeters.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.740
Notice I'm not converting.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.573
That's okay.

00:02:12.573 --> 00:02:13.990
If you leave everything in centimeters,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.040
you'll just get an answer in centimeters.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.360
So it's okay, you don't have to convert

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.370
as long as everything's in the same units.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.920
We'll set that equal to one
over the object distance.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.160
Just one other warning,
sometimes instead of d o,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.320
you'll see this as s
o for object distance,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.603
or you might see d i as
s i for image distance.

00:02:32.603 --> 00:02:33.653
It's the same thing.

00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:35.460
It's just a different letter.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.910
So the object distance, again,

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.720
is on this side in front of the mirror.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.640
So it's gonna be positive 12 centimeters

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.370
since it's located 12 centimeters

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.190
from the center of the mirror.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.620
So this is also gonna be
positive 12 centimeters.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.530
And now we're gonna add to that
one over the image distance.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.960
The image distance, we don't know.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.360
I haven't drawn the image on here.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.420
It's gonna be a surprise.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.530
We don't know what this is gonna be,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.890
but we can solve for it.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.420
So we can solve for image distance.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.170
I'll subtract one over 12 from both sides,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.350
which will give us one
over four centimeters

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.910
minus one over 12 centimeters,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.700
and that's gonna have to equal
one over the image distance.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.810
So 1/4 you could rewrite as 3/12.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.680
So 3/12 minus 1/12 is just gonna be 2/12,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.240
and that's gonna equal one
over the image distance.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.083
But 2/12 is just 1/6,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.540
so one over the image
distance is just gonna be 1/6.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.620
But that's what one over
the image distance is.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.050
Sometimes people forget
to flip this at the end.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.780
We don't want one over the image distance.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.220
We want the image distance.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.920
So finally, you take one over each side.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.300
And we solve, and we get
that the image distance

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.160
is gonna be six centimeters.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.250
And it came out positive.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.390
That's important.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.340
This came out to be
positive six centimeters.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.900
So where's our image gonna be?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.610
So since this image distance
came out to be positive,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.080
our image is gonna be
in front of the mirror.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.070
So it's gonna be over here.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.790
It's gonna be six
centimeters from the mirror,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.180
somewhere around here.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.400
So at this point right here is
where our image is gonna be.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.870
But we don't know how big it's gonna be

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.250
or whether it's right-side
up or upside down.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.550
To figure that out, we have
to use a different equation,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.080
and that equation's called
the magnification equation.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.660
It says that the magnification is equal to

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.760
the height of the image divided
by the height of the object.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.670
That's equal to negative
the image distance

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.030
divided by the object distance.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.100
So it turns out this ratio
of negative image distance

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.740
over object distance is
always equal to the ratio

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.240
of the height of the image
over the height of the object.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.810
So what's the height
of our image gonna be?

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.880
Let's just solve for it.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.100
If we solve for the height of our image,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.280
we get that the height
of the image is gonna be,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.020
multiply both sides by h o,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.130
we'll have the negative
sign's already here,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.370
so negative height of the object times

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.550
this ratio of the image distance
over the object distance.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.070
And now we can just plug in numbers.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.000
The height of the object,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.240
it says it's three
centimeters tall right here.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.710
So it's three centimeters,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.940
so negative three centimeters
times the ratio of,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.840
the image distance was six,
the object distance was 12.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.010
And so if you solve this,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.070
you'll get one half of negative three,

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.430
which is negative 1.5 centimeters.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.870
The negative sign means that
this image got inverted.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.820
So it got flipped over.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.530
It's gonna be upside down
compared to what it was before.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.800
And the 1.5 is how tall it's gonna be.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.770
So what we end up with is

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.900
an image six centimeters from
the mirror, and it's gonna be,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.980
have a height half as
tall, so 1.5 centimeters.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.750
And it's gonna be upside down

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.450
because of this negative sign.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.360
So it's gonna be 1.5 centimeters
tall and upside down.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.850
That's what you're gonna see
if you look into this mirror.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.870
It's like a funhouse mirror.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.520
It's a weird, curved mirror.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.080
You'd see an upside-down image right here.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.260
It might look like you
could reach out and grab it,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.630
but it's gonna be an optical illusion.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.630
There's gonna be no object there.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.410
It's just gonna be the
image of this object here.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.150
So that's an example
using a concave mirror.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.510
What would change, what if we did this?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.990
What if we took our object,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.820
so say we don't put it here anymore,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.840
we move it inside here.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.340
So instead of being at 12 centimeters,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.300
we moved it to like three centimeters.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.940
What would we do differently?

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.090
Everything would be the same.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.190
We just would plug in, instead
of positive 12 down here,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.120
we'd plug in positive three.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.530
So the mirror equation
works exactly the same.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.800
You still plug in whatever
that object distance is.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.270
You solve for your image distance.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.640
We're, of course, gonna get
a different image distance.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.510
But whatever you get,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.130
that would tell you where the image is.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.080
And then you would take that, plug it into

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.730
the magnification equation
if you wanted to decide

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.460
how big the image is gonna be

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.850
and whether it's gonna be
right-side up or upside down.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.220
So these numbers are gonna be different,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.200
but you would use this
equation the exact same way.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.610
Now what would happen if instead
of using a concave mirror,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.170
we used a convex mirror?

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.290
Let's say we used a
mirror shaped like this.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.610
So imagine our eye, again, is over here,

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.250
looking at this object
inside of the mirror,

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.230
and we're gonna see an
image of the object.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.480
We're gonna see the object right here,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.390
but we're also gonna see
the image of the object.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.370
This mirror, this time instead of concave,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.350
this is a convex mirror.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.960
So its focal length is behind the mirror.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.310
So what do we do now to
figure out where the image is?

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.590
We, again, use the mirror equation.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.200
We're gonna use the same equation.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.410
We're gonna have one
over the focal length.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.240
And, again, I immediately have

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.200
to make a decision on the sign.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.680
With the convention that I'm using,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.740
this focal length is behind the mirror.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.760
So this focal length for a convex mirror

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.690
is gonna be negative.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.820
So this would be negative
four centimeters.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.960
And that's gonna equal one
over the object distance.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.220
Well, again, the object is

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.470
in front of the mirror 12 centimeters.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.320
So this object distance is gonna
be positive 12 centimeters.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.380
And then we add to that
the image distance,

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.500
which we don't know.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.830
This is what we're gonna solve for.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.810
So this time if we solve,

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.590
we're gonna have one over negative four.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.330
And, again, we have to
subtract one over 12,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.820
and that's all gonna have to be equal

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.570
to one over the image distance.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.900
So now on the left-hand
side, we have negative 1/4,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.650
but that's the same as negative 3/12.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:06.650
So negative 3/12 minus 1/12
is the same as negative 4/12,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.720
and that's got to equal one
over the image distance.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.820
But negative 4/12 is the
same as negative 1/3.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.840
So one over the image distance has

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.330
to be equal to negative a third.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.530
And if we flip that over, we
get that the image distance

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.090
finally is gonna be
negative three centimeters.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.820
So, in other words, this
here is negative 1/3.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.330
So when you flip that over,
you get that the image distance

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.960
is negative three centimeters.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.490
Where is this image gonna be?

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.050
Well, since it came out negative,

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.210
that means it's behind the mirror

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.290
'cause that's the sign
convention we're using.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.780
So it's gonna be three
centimeters behind the mirror.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.890
So it's gonna be like over here about

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.160
at this point right around here somewhere,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.620
three centimeters behind this mirror.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.380
And, again, if we want to figure
out how tall it's gonna be,

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.080
whether it's right-side up or upside down,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.200
we're gonna have to use
the magnification equation.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.750
And that magnification
equation looked like this.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.500
It said that the height of the image

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.960
over the height of the
object had to be negative

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.870
image distance over object distance.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.930
So let's just see what this
right-hand side's gonna be.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.720
If we just set this equal to,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.270
it's gonna be negative of,

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.220
negative three is the image distance,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.780
so I have to plug in the negative three.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.600
And you keep that negative in there.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.120
This negative out here comes along always,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.700
but now we have another negative

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.310
inside of this image
distance of negative three.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.220
And the object distance,
again, was 12 centimeters.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.300
So what are we left with?

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.290
We get negative of negative three,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:31.470
which is positive three over 12,

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.710
which is positive 1/4.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:35.180
And the centimeters cancel.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.730
So what this ratio tells you,
which is the magnification,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.940
is that the image is
not gonna be inverted.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.220
This positive means it's
gonna be right-side up.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.360
And the 1/4 ratio means
it's gonna be 1/4 as large,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.740
the image, I should say,
is gonna be 1/4 as large

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.380
as the object is gonna be.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.240
And the reason is this ratio
is equal to height of the image

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.180
over the height of the object.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.830
So, in other words, if I can multiply,

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.790
if I want to multiply both sides,

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.420
I can say that height of the
image is equal to positive 1/4

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.770
times the height of the object.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.240
Well, the height of our object was

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.960
three centimeters in this case.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.570
But whatever your height of the object is,

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.173
you multiply it by this ratio
of negative d r over d o,

00:10:13.173 --> 00:10:14.700
and you get what the height
of the image is gonna be.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.720
So we're gonna get 1/4 three.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.530
So we get positive 3/4 of a centimeter.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.850
So it's gonna be tiny.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:22.683
This is gonna be little,

00:10:22.683 --> 00:10:25.050
little image that's
gonna be right-side up.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.530
So it's gonna be right here,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.940
but it's gonna be teeny.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.040
It's only gonna be like this,
3/4 of a centimeter tall.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.090
That's what our image is gonna look like.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.170
So recapping, you can
use the mirror equation

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.060
to figure out where the
images are gonna be located.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.970
The sign convention we're using is that

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.830
objects, images, and focal lengths

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.910
in front of the mirror
are gonna be positive.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.350
Anything behind the mirror
is gonna be negative.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.140
And you could use the
magnification equation

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.120
to figure out how tall
the image is gonna be

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.520
relative to the object by taking
negative the image distance

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.083
over the object distance.
