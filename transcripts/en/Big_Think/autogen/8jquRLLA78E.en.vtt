00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.260
Young person, you'll find in your life that
sometimes your great ambitions will be momentarily

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:20.499
stymied, thwarted, marginalized by those who
were perhaps luckier, come from money, where

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:26.919
more doors opened, where college was a given--it
was not a student loan; it was something that

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:35.590
Dad paid for--to where an ease and confidence
in life was almost a birthright, where for

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.800
you it was a very hard climb.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:49.380
You cannot let these people make you feel
that you have in any way been dwarfed or out-classed.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.810
You must really go for your own and realize
how short life is.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.990
You got what you got, so you have to make
the most of it.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.440
You really can't spend a whole lot of time
worrying about his.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.860
You really have to go for your own.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.549
If you have an idea of what you want to do
in your future, you must go at it with almost

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.340
monastic obsession, be it music, the ballet
or just a basic degree.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.590
You have to go at it single-mindedly and let
nothing get in your way.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.750
You're young.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.549
That's why you can survive on no sleep, Top
Ramen noodles and dental floss and still look

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.280
good.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:38.590
All the people you admire, from Mohamed Ali
to any politician, they work and work and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.020
work.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.249
Your president right now is a man who got
where he is through very hard work and scholarships,

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.469
mainly hard work and application and discipline.

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.999
If these people can do it, why not you?

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:04.060
We live in very interesting times and, as
a young person going into a very turbulent

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.790
and fragile economy that is going to get better--it's
going to take awhile--, it is easy to lose

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:16.720
your moral compass, your decency, your sense
of civility and your sense of community.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.720
Very easy.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.470
You known, things in traffic make you mad.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.950
People are getting a little desperate.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.400
They might not show their best elements to
you.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.670
You must never lower yourself to being a person
you don't like.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:40.100
There is no better time than now to have a
moral and civic backbone, to have a moral

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.280
and civic true north.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.340
This is a tremendous opportunity for you,
a young person, to be heroic, to be morally

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.810
upstanding, to be helpful, almost Boy Scout-like,
presidential, to be altruistic.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:05.120
Weakness is what brings ignorance, cheapness,
racism, homophobia, desperation, cruelty,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.160
brutality, all these things that will keep
a society chained to the ground, one foot

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.030
nailed to the floor.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.731
It's by being strong in the face of all of
that, not lowering yourself to it, that's

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.360
how you lead.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.610
That's how you liberate others and maintain
freedom.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.530
You don't have to beat your chest.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.440
You don't have to wave a flag, but to maintain
a high level of decency

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.960
And it sounds like I'm a cranky old man, like
something you want to rebel against, but really

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.670
think about what I'm saying.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.600
I think I'm right about this.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.410
When you look at what real desperation and
ignorance looks like, when you have to run

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.210
from it, like, literally run from it, you
don't want to be that.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.440
You want to be that which leads others out
of that.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.690
And now more than ever is the time to show
these great qualities, to extol these great

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.440
qualities and to embody these great qualities,
which you have.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.790
Now it's time to magnify them, personify them
and inspire others with them.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.680
And there's never been a time where they're
needed more than right now.
