00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So what can we change?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Do we have to change the function poker?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Do we have to change the function hand rank?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Do we have to change the function card ranks?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Or the function straight?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, I said I wanted to get it down to changing 1 function,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but that might not be possible, so select all the functions

00:00:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that you think are going to need changes in order to accommodate that ace-low straight.
