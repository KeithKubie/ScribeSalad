00:00:07.204 --> 00:00:12.482
Astronomers have discovered thousands of
planets orbiting stars other than the Sun.

00:00:12.482 --> 00:00:14.175
They come in all sizes,

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.994
at different orbital distances 
from their stars.

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:20.143
The closest of them are trillions
of miles away,

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:22.813
and even the largest 
are just fuzzy patches

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:25.754
in the fields of high-powered telescopes.

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:28.985
But if one of these planets is close
in size to the Earth

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:33.854
and orbits not too close
and too far away from its parent star,

00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:37.253
it could be rocky and warm enough
to have oceans

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.635
and perhaps life.

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:42.904
Astronomers discover these potentially
habitable planets,

00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:45.546
and their eyes get big and wide.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:49.506
Could one of these distant worlds
carry the building blocks of life?

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:52.916
Or even a living, breathing, civilization?

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:57.926
Is the question, "Are we alone
in the universe?" about to be answered?

00:00:57.926 --> 00:00:59.044
But wait.

00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:02.584
Maybe we should 
ask a different question first.

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:06.254
Should we try to find out 
if we're alone in the universe?

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:08.747
If we do find the atmospheric 
fingerprints of life

00:01:08.747 --> 00:01:11.727
on one of these small,
distant worlds,

00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:15.146
should we try to contact any beings
who may live there?

00:01:15.146 --> 00:01:17.116
Is that wise?

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:21.156
Three decades ago, NASA decided
the answer was yes.

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:24.666
Voyager 1 and 2 were launched in 1977

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.765
to explore the giant planets 
in the solar system.

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:31.565
Each spacecraft carried a golden
phonograph record,

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:35.377
a time capsule of sorts that included
clues and messages

00:01:35.377 --> 00:01:38.915
meant to convey the story
of human civilization.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:43.386
The contents of these gold-plated
copper disks were chosen by a committee

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:47.157
chaired by American astronomer
and author Carl Sagan.

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:49.318
They included over 100 images,

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.677
and a range of sounds 
from the natural world:

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.206
ocean waves,

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:54.116
thunder,

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:55.269
the sounds of birds

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:56.656
and whales.

00:01:56.656 --> 00:02:00.646
The records also included music from
many different time periods and cultures,

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:02.876
greetings in 55 languages,

00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:05.638
and messages from 
the President of the United States,

00:02:05.638 --> 00:02:08.399
and the UN Secretary General.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.957
They also included a map.

00:02:10.957 --> 00:02:14.847
Each golden record displays the location
of our solar system

00:02:14.847 --> 00:02:17.469
with respect to fourteen pulsars.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.128
Their precise, unique frequencies
were indicated

00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:23.378
so that intelligent,
extraterrestrial lifeforms

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:26.448
could use them to find the Earth.

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:29.698
Many years later, renowned physicist
Stephen Hawking said

00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:34.437
that it was a mistake to give
an alien species a roadmap to our planet.

00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:37.519
Hawking suspected that any 
extraterrestrial life

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.798
probably wasn't any more complex
than microbes,

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:44.887
but he warned that if an advanced
alien species did visit Earth,

00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:48.819
it could be as catastrophic as
Christopher Columbus's arrival was

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.049
for the Native Americans.

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.458
Meanwhile, the golden records
continue their journeys.

00:02:54.458 --> 00:03:00.109
In 1990, both Voyager spacecraft
passed beyond the orbit of Pluto.

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.359
Voyager 1 entered interstellar space
in 2012,

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.357
and will reach the nearest stellar system
in 40,000 years.

00:03:08.357 --> 00:03:11.599
If either spacecraft is discovered
by extraterrestrial life,

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.716
there's a possibility that they could
decipher the clues from the golden record

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:18.387
and one day reach our planet.

00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:19.554
That's particularly true

00:03:19.554 --> 00:03:23.870
if theirs is a much more 
technologically advanced civilization.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.951
That life could be benevolent,

00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:30.710
as we would hope to be if humans are one
day able to achieve interstellar travel.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.470
Or it could be hostile.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.110
Searching for planets that might have life
means staring into a great abyss.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.224
We'll likely have no clear knowledge
of the evolutionary stage,

00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:43.000
sentience,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.940
character,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.278
or intentions of the first form of life
we discover.

00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:49.930
So it's a risk to turn our eyes outwards.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.239
We risk our very way of life.

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.641
But it may be a greater risk not to look,

00:03:55.641 --> 00:04:01.031
to deny the very pioneering spirits
that help shape our own species.

00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:04.253
We are all born curious about the world
and the universe.

00:04:04.253 --> 00:04:09.250
Pursuing that curiosity is one of
humankind's greatest achievements.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.911
Perhaps there is room to push 
the frontiers of science,

00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:15.031
provided that we cradle alongside 
our fervor

00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:17.671
another of humankind's greatest assets:

00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:19.511
hope.
