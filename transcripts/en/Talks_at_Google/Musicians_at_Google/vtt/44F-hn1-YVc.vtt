00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:04.740
CATHERINE ARMATO: Hi.

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:07.590
JONO GRANT: Hello.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.534
It's like "Pigs in Space."

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:10.950
CATHERINE ARMATO:
So I just wanted

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.530
to thank you guys so
much for coming today.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.680
We're really excited to have
you here at Google, and here

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.580
in New York City.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.064
You just announced your new
album, "We Are All We Need."

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:20.605
And I was wondering
if you could tell

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:22.448
us more about what we
can expect from it?

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:24.500
JONO GRANT: Did you see that?

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:29.050
TONY MCGUINNESS: It's is a
mixture of reggaeton and trap.

00:00:31.513 --> 00:00:33.096
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: Why
are you laughing?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.800
TONY MCGUINNESS:
It's the most tracks

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.060
we've ever put on an album.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.855
16 tracks.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.380
Features collaborations
with Justine Suissa,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.490
of OceanLab fame, you will know.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.345
Zoe Johnston.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.020
And Alex Vargas.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.570
In terms of the subject
matter, I think the title,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.092
"We Are All We Need,"
comes from a song

00:01:02.092 --> 00:01:03.800
that Zoe wrote that's
on the album called

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.400
"We Are All We Need," which I
believe premieres this week.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.790
JONO GRANT: Times
Square, 7:00 PM.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.050
TONY MCGUINNESS: And
it sort of suggests

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.010
a kind of mutual
self-reliance that's

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.050
a theme that comes up
a lot on the album.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.530
So if it was appropriate
to call it that.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.960
It feels like a development
from "Group Therapy."

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.970
It's about what you can
achieve with other people.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.693
And it feels like a very
Above and Beyond thing

00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:32.430
to say as well.

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.340
Overcome emotionally.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.480
CATHERINE ARMATO: You mentioned
that Alex, Justine, and Zoe

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.063
will all be featured
on the new album.

00:01:43.063 --> 00:01:45.700
How do you go about finding
such amazing vocalists?

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.510
And how do you determine
which songs they'll sing on?

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.190
JONO GRANT: Well,
first of all, I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.220
think tend to look for
people who haven't worked

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.620
with a lot of other
people in our area.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.650
So rather than just get the
kind of off-the-shelf singer

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.920
of the moment who's had a
few hits with someone else,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.750
we will try and
dig a bit deeper.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.230
And maybe look outside of
the genre that we operate in.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.590
So with Zoe, she had
worked with Faithless,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.919
who do do dance music.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.550
But she'd also why
worked with Bent as well,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.040
who've done some amazing music.

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.430
So we just look for something
a little bit different, really.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.760
And outside the usual
channels, if you like.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.610
CATHERINE ARMATO: Tell us about
the journey to Madison Square

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.110
Garden.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.920
What made you choose New York
as the ABGT100 celebration?

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.400
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: Well, obviously
we do one of these big shows

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.540
a year to celebrate
our radio show.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.300
Last year was Alexandra
Palace in London.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.550
Year before that we were
in Bangalore in India.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.050
And so on.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.320
Yeah, for us it really
felt like we really

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.145
wanted to do one in
America this year.

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:48.020
We'd already done LA.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.747
Sp we thought, OK.

00:02:50.747 --> 00:02:51.830
New York would be awesome.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.440
But where?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.830
And so we're thinking of
all these potential venues.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.114
And then somebody
says, OK, yeah.

00:02:58.114 --> 00:02:59.780
I think we can do
Madison Square Garden.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.680
And we're like, no.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.440
We can't do Madison
Square Garden.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.534
It is not going to happen.

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.200
But really, it's been
quite the journey.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.590
We were here in January.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.610
We did a site visit
to have a look at it.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.790
So ever since January,
it's been just planning.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.290
Doing.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.890
Making music.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.240
Figuring out what we
want to do with the show.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.590
Who should come with
us, and everything.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.620
So it feels quite unreal
that just in two days

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.830
we'll actually
finally get to do it.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.162
I'm just beyond excited.

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:28.870
A little nervous, but
that's always good.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.770
It'll feel even better
when it goes all well.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.521
JONO GRANT: Yeah.

00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:33.770
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: What a venue.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.856
JONO GRANT: It's also
about-- I was going to say,

00:03:35.856 --> 00:03:37.730
it's also about picking
those moments to make

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.680
a step up somewhere.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.480
We felt the same when we did
Alexandra Palace in London.

00:03:43.494 --> 00:03:44.910
When I moved to
London, I remember

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.930
seeing-- we went to a
gig at Alexandra Palace.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.340
And I never dreamed
of playing there.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.430
I mean, it's a huge venue.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.440
And again, with
Madison-- I'd never

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.720
have dreamed of playing
at Madison Square Garden.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.419
But this was the right time
for us to have a go at it.

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.460
And you know, the response,
with the ticket sales

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.751
and everything, was incredible.

00:04:02.044 --> 00:04:04.710
CATHERINE ARMATO: How did you go
about choosing the artists that

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.462
are playing with
you on Saturday?

00:04:06.462 --> 00:04:08.170
TONY MCGUINNESS: We
was trying to include

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.685
other artists on the label.

00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:11.159
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.700
There's one of them
on the phone now.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.677
They basically rang us up
like that, out of the blue.

00:04:18.677 --> 00:04:21.510
And said, what are you
doing next Saturday?

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.815
No, we was trying to include
other artists on the label.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.080
And we try and rotate those
year by year as much as we can,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.430
to give everybody a chance of
appearing on these big shows.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.020
And it's definitely
Ilan Bluestone's year.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.920
He's done some incredible
work in the last 12 months.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.670
Mat Zo goes from
strength to strength.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.740
Andrew Bayer is an enormously
important part of the label

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.740
and of Above and Beyond.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.100
So it sort of chose
itself this time.

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.190
CATHERINE ARMATO: So it
was really special for us

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.782
as fans to hear all of the songs
stripped down for acoustic.

00:05:01.782 --> 00:05:03.490
I was wondering if
you could tell me more

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.740
what your experience was
like producing and performing

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:06.320
that album?

00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:07.930
JONO GRANT: Yeah.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.180
I mean, when-- it was
actually Tony's idea

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.630
to do an acoustic
project, if you like.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.564
And I think both
myself and Paavo

00:05:15.564 --> 00:05:17.480
were a little bit resistant
to the idea of it.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.900
Because you're essentially
putting yourself

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.450
in the arena of other bands.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.040
And saying, we're a band.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.050
And up until that point,
what the public knew of us

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.370
was only our dance music.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.090
And we do play instruments.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.990
We always have done.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.250
But it's not something
we've shown to the public.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.220
So it was quite a
nerve-wracking thing to do.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.430
But at the same
time, we're sort of

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.750
coming at it with a mildly
kind of blank canvas,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.320
because no one's ever seen
us do that kind of a gig.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.480
It could have ended up being
a really Spinal Tap disastrous

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.730
kind of thing.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.640
And I think it
didn't, thankfully,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.710
judging by all your
response to it.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.620
But it was great fun.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.330
Because when we were
doing the acoustic album,

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.190
we'd rock up to the
studio with Bob,

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.265
who is kind of the designated
producer and musical director

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.390
for the whole show, really.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.650
And we'd play our parts--
piano, Rhodes, guitar.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.710
And we were being
produced by Bob.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.699
And so the tables
really were turned.

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:19.240
And you could actually
relax into it,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.680
rather than sort of talking
over a talk-back mic to a singer

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.690
saying, can you sing
this a bit differently?

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.870
We were in that chair
playing our instruments.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.500
And it was great having someone
else telling you, you're great.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.970
Play it a bit more like that.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.204
It was a great experience
end to end, wasn't it?

00:06:38.204 --> 00:06:39.620
TONY MCGUINNESS:
Yeah, definitely.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.119
CATHERINE ARMATO: And Tony,
this is a question more for you.

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.980
Will we hear any more
from Making Plans,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.994
or was that strictly
an acoustic release?

00:06:45.994 --> 00:06:48.410
TONY MCGUINNESS: It is on the
new album, I'm happy to say.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.040
It was an interesting
one to try and produce

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.050
in a form that fit on the
album, because we wrote it

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.940
such a long time ago.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.670
And it hasn't ended up the way
I imagined when we wrote it.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.670
But it's amazing, I think.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.470
JONO GRANT: It was in a really
difficult range, BPM-wise.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.432
Sometimes you get a track
that is, say, around 65 BPM,

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.390
or something like that.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.140
And you can kind of
double it up to 130ih.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.580
It's just some tracks
just work at some tempos.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.230
And that was one of the hardest
tracks to work at dance tempo,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.154
wasn't it, really.

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.730
CATHERINE ARMATO: Paavo,
I saw some of the photos

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.142
that you posted at Burning Man.

00:07:28.142 --> 00:07:29.850
I was wondering if
you guys could tell me

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.060
more about that experience?

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.950
And if you prepare for
those sets differently?

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.190
And if you got to experience
the festival at all?

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.810
PAAVO SILJAMAKI:
Well, obviously,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.434
that was our first
time at Burning Man.

00:07:38.434 --> 00:07:41.352
And it's one of those
festivals that we've always

00:07:41.352 --> 00:07:42.310
really wanted to go to.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.190
And we didn't quite know.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.880
I think it's like
one of those things

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.476
that you can't really
describe even correctly.

00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:52.100
You have to go there
and experience it.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.700
But we did we did the
yoga sets with Elena,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.090
who's actually from New York.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.200
An amazing yogi?

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.010
At Robot Hut during sunset.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.560
Which was a really interesting
set for us to play.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.230
Because, obviously, we normally
don't play that chill music.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.840
And, you know, I've
dabbled a little bit

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.500
with yoga myself over the years.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.020
So I could kind of
imagine what might work.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.770
[CELL PHONE RINGS]

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.090
JONO GRANT: That's Mat Zo.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.298
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: And do that.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:23.476
Hey, Mat.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.380
We also did a deep
set over there.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.320
Not too unlike what we're
planning to do on Saturday.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.220
We open the show.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.730
So we had those opportunities
to do something really,

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.730
really different
from our normal gigs.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.530
And then our gig at White
Ocean was really more

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.840
of a traditional
Above and Beyond gig.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.780
Butt the audience was definitely
not the traditional audience.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.000
It was such a mix of people.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.820
Just wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful atmosphere

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.320
over there.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.865
And I came out of Burning Man--
you know, I knew I'd be wowed.

00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:03.920
But I came actually touched.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.890
I was really touched seeing
the burning of embrace

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.760
as my last thing over there.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.000
And really seeing how
Burning Man is really

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.110
about people doing really
cool things for each other.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.310
And when you see people
doing really cool things

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.640
for each other, you want
to also do the same thing.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.612
So I was kind of
thinking, one day,

00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:26.570
maybe the world's going
to be like Burning Man.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.790
And it'll be a good place.

00:09:28.327 --> 00:09:30.160
CATHERINE ARMATO: That
would be pretty cool.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.243
TONY MCGUINNESS: Would be.

00:09:31.243 --> 00:09:33.115
There'd be a lot more
nudity, for a start.

00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:34.005
Good thing.

00:09:35.495 --> 00:09:37.370
CATHERINE ARMATO: In
addition to the deep set

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.480
you did at Burning
Man, you also released

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.110
an Anjuna Deep Editions set.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.140
You remixed the set for
the Anjuna Deep Edition.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.150
Do you think there'll be more
deep sound releases coming

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.250
from Above and Beyond, or
stick with the club sound?

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.970
TONY MCGUINNESS: Well, we
like playing deep music.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.830
We just don't get much of
a chance to do it, really.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.910
That's why Burning
Man was nice to do.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.520
We played in Brazil a few
weeks ago at the World Cup,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.990
and got away with
playing a deep house set.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:08.800
It's just a nice and very
popular area of music

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.210
that we're kind of involved in.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.690
And we just don't really
get a chance to do it.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.310
So when we do get a chance
to do it, it's nice to do it.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.290
Like Paavo said, we're
doing the warm-up

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:21.870
set for ABGT100, which
will be mostly Anjuna Deep.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.660
One or two others.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:28.590
And I would like to do more of
those when the occasion arises.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.140
Obviously, for our
shows, for the most part,

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.030
people want to hear the Above
and Beyond songs and the vibe

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.680
that they know.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.240
And whilst those things work
in a smaller environment--

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.925
on the tail end of a yoga
session or warming up for one

00:10:42.925 --> 00:10:44.372
of our shows--
it's not something

00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:45.830
we really get a
chance to do a lot.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.080
But I would like to do it more.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.700
I'm actually really interested
in all kinds of dance music.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.210
We sort of make a living from
doing one particular bit of it.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.010
But it would be nice
to have a broader

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.097
canvas, if we were
able to do that.

00:11:00.097 --> 00:11:01.180
JONO GRANT: I think, yeah.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.220
I have a feeling we might
end up doing what he said.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.261
And doing a bit more of
that in the future, yeah.

00:11:06.064 --> 00:11:07.730
CATHERINE ARMATO: We
had a lot of people

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.330
that were curious
where the names came

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.725
from on the new album cover.

00:11:11.725 --> 00:11:13.422
Can you shed some light on that?

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.540
JONO GRANT: Well, we just
did a Google Hangout,

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.290
and we decided it was all smoke
and mirrors, really, didn't we?

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.190
But they came from social
media, essentially.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.435
We'll leave it that.

00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:24.310
CATHERINE ARMATO: OK.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.590
TONY MCGUINNESS: We
don't really want

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:25.714
to say how we getting them.

00:11:25.714 --> 00:11:27.860
Because then people,
if we say, actually,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:30.220
we pick them up from Twitter
on Wednesday between 3:00

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.630
and 4:00, everybody's
going to start

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.755
tweeting between 3:00
and 4:00 on a Wednesday.

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:36.010
And it'll ruin it.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.020
It's people who are actively
involved in our online family.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:49.180
And "We Are All We Need"
includes all of you guys.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.096
JONO GRANT: Is anyone
on the album cover here?

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.669
There you go.

00:11:53.669 --> 00:11:55.960
TONY MCGUINNESS: We're trying
to include as many people

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.260
as we can on the artwork
through the campaign,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.410
with all the single
sleeves as well.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.040
But if you can't wait to
see yourself on there,

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.595
you can actually make
your own album artwork

00:12:05.595 --> 00:12:06.970
with a bit of
software that we've

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.720
had designed that sticks
your name on right now.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:11.410
Well, good.

00:12:12.715 --> 00:12:14.090
CATHERINE ARMATO:
One of the ways

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.923
that you connect with
fans during your shows

00:12:15.923 --> 00:12:18.160
is the messages that
you have you come up

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.100
on the screens behind you.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.080
How did that start?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.374
And are you typing those live?

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:23.290
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: Yeah.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.590
That actually started
because we were bringing

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.605
a laptop to our gigs
anyway as a backup.

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:31.230
This is still when
we were playing CDs.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.920
Just so you could burn a CD
if you're missing a track.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.768
JONO GRANT: So he could
burn a CD, not us.

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:36.920
PAAVO SILJAMAKI:
Because it was there,

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.950
you'd have Photoshop
or Illustrator

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.670
for writing little messages.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.920
JONO GRANT: So he could have
Photoshop or Illustrator.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:44.670
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: So, OK.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.580
So then I decided to
write a little message.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.645
Show the laptop to the people.

00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:52.320
When we're in venues like
200 people, it's awesome.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.440
Works great.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.450
And suddenly felt like
we had this new means

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:57.740
of communicating with people.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.950
Like, really directly, actually.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:04.030
But then in 2010, we were
at ADC at the LA Coliseum,

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.140
and just holding up the laptop
to a little bit more than 150

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.320
people felt like it
didn't quite work.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.350
So we're showing it to
the camera over there.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.770
And they put it
up on the screen.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.769
And we thought, hang on.

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:17.380
Maybe that's the
way we can do it.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.255
JONO GRANT: So he went
off into a rabbit hole

00:13:19.255 --> 00:13:21.120
and coded a system to
do that, didn't you?

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.810
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: I did.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.310
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.820
I love technology.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.040
And I've been always really
interested in the show,

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.570
and how this show can
be used to enhance

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.950
people's feeling of
connectedness to the music

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:34.700
and to each other.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.405
And how we can use to enhance
the atmosphere of the event.

00:13:37.405 --> 00:13:39.280
JONO GRANT: At this
point, I should point out

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.730
that Paavo actually
wrote a clocking system

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:49.330
to send the BPM of the decks
to our visual system as well.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.740
And all sorts of stuff.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.780
TONY MCGUINNESS:
That's only half of it.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.290
JONO GRANT: That's
the minor thing.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.300
TONY MCGUINNESS: We
discovered that the output

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.117
from the Pioneer mixer wasn't
high resolution enough.

00:13:58.117 --> 00:13:59.450
So he got in touch with Pioneer.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.390
And now it is.

00:14:04.332 --> 00:14:05.540
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: That's true.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:15.973
But-- you I suppose we're at
Google, so it's all right.

00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:17.400
CATHERINE ARMATO: Yeah.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.860
I was actually going to ask next
how you guys have been using

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.401
technology to connect
with your fans.

00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:23.677
Like, in addition to the
messages at your shows.

00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:25.260
PAAVO SILJAMAKI:
Well, our first thing

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.330
was when we actually started.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.740
Big record companies
were basically saying,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.530
we don't do websites.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.590
And internet was like
this sort of thing

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.347
that some young people
are doing somewhere.

00:14:36.347 --> 00:14:36.930
But actually--

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:37.090
JONO GRANT: If you
did [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.465
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: The real
world doesn't interact with it.

00:14:39.465 --> 00:14:42.180
But we really started
with the internet in mind.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.800
And very early on, we
had an internet forum

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.450
that for us was the
first sort of step.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:50.158
Hang on, we can actually
use the internet

00:14:50.158 --> 00:14:52.752
to really get to know the
people that listen to our music,

00:14:52.752 --> 00:14:53.710
and interact with them.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.780
Then we saw the music as
a distribution platform

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.410
quite early on.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.800
So we had a shop where we
were first selling music

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.760
with copyright protection.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.499
Downloadable.

00:15:07.499 --> 00:15:08.790
This is really a long time ago.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.266
I can't believe we
even tried that.

00:15:10.266 --> 00:15:12.390
JONO GRANT: I think we were
one of the first labels

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.750
to-- one of the first
independent labels, at least--

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.140
to do online distribution
of our music.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.944
MP3 downloads, basically.

00:15:19.944 --> 00:15:21.610
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: And
this is a long time

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.759
before iTunes or Beatport.

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:26.300
TONY MCGUINNESS: Or
Google, actually.

00:15:29.207 --> 00:15:30.290
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: But yeah.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.456
It's been amazing seeing
how the internet has really

00:15:32.456 --> 00:15:34.810
grown from that kind of
almost underground movement

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.390
into something that everyone,
pretty much everyone

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.330
around the world, either
has something to do with,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.140
or their lives are
definitely being

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.890
influenced by the internet.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.620
And it's a tool for learning.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.530
I think it's just
beyond amazing.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.600
And I can't wait to
see what it leads to

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.910
over the next 25 years.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.160
I personally use it
when I want to learn

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.880
how to be a better barista.

00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:02.650
Google it.

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:04.670
It's a speedy learning tool.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:05.820
It's incredible.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:06.670
JONO GRANT: One
of the things, one

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.753
of the incredible things
I find now is on YouTube.

00:16:08.753 --> 00:16:11.290
If you go onto
YouTube, and you want

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:13.310
to find out how a
particular track is made,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.390
there are people
who've basically

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.810
dissected one of your tracks.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:21.240
And recreated the whole
record in Fruity Loops

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.510
or Keybase or Logic.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.760
I just find that mind-blowing.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.010
Because when I was growing
up with learning about music

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.510
production, I would
learn everything

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.340
from magazines and
from my own experience.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.950
And now this is wealth
of knowledge on YouTube.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:36.450
Where if you don't know how
to make a certain white noise

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.080
sweep, you'll find
it on YouTube.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.849
I think that's just
amazing, you know?

00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:42.640
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: Where
I think social media

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:48.070
these days is really that
the genuinely amazing things

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.280
that people see and
feel like one to share.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.840
Those are the
things really work.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.041
And that would work
in this room as well.

00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:56.790
If somebody sees
something really amazing,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.623
they're probably going
to tell someone else.

00:16:58.623 --> 00:16:59.510
And so it spreads.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.410
So I think there's so
much concentration--

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.359
how can we use social
media in the best way?

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.329
And how do we know what
the best techniques?

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.550
And what's the
new silver bullet?

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.630
But I think what
we've taken from all

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.230
of this is that if we really
concentrate on the core of what

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.369
we do-- we try make the
best songs that we can,

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:24.700
and give people the most
amazing experiences at the shows

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.170
and online-- then, hopefully,
they'll tell others.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.920
And so it works.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.087
At least, that's the theory.

00:17:31.087 --> 00:17:32.920
JONO GRANT: That's a
really important point.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.720
Because I think there's
a big attraction

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.230
to the social media
side of things.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.640
But actually, in a
cold-hearted business sense,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.830
the product is the music.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.990
And you've got to
put that first,

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.300
and not the social media.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.490
The social media is very
much a secondary thing.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.570
If you make a great
record, that will blow away

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.545
a million tweets.

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:53.280
It's really important.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.113
Because I see a lot of
kids getting into it,

00:17:55.113 --> 00:17:57.720
and kind of believing
it's really important

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.970
to have a great
social media presence.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.370
But that can be
dealt with, I think,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.050
by good management and
a good team around you.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.470
Whereas having the right ideas
to make the right records,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.024
that's the most important thing.

00:18:10.024 --> 00:18:10.690
That's the core.

00:18:11.504 --> 00:18:13.170
CATHERINE ARMATO: In
just a few minutes,

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.095
we'll be taking questions
from the audience.

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:16.970
So if you guys have
questions, please line up

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.179
at one of the microphones
on either side of the room.

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:21.136
TONY MCGUINNESS: And if
you can't think of one,

00:18:21.136 --> 00:18:22.260
you can phone a friend.

00:18:23.855 --> 00:18:25.980
CATHERINE ARMATO: So I'm
a huge "Breaking Bad" fan.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.080
I wanted to hear the story
behind the creation of "Walter

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:30.580
White."

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.370
And what your favorite
"Breaking Bad" episode is.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.830
JONO GRANT: Well,
that track-- and I'd

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.530
be lying if I said we came
up with the idea of doing

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.940
a "Breaking Bad" track,
OK, first of all.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.352
But as we were
making the track, we

00:18:43.352 --> 00:18:45.060
realized that it had
a split personality.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.660
There's a very dark, clubby
kind of intro and outro

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.364
to the track, with
a kind of uplifting

00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:52.280
break down the middle.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:57.020
And Walter White, he's
a very two-sided--

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.480
or, well, maybe more than
two sides to his character.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.417
So it just felt like the
right time, the right name.

00:19:04.417 --> 00:19:06.250
It was just one of those
things-- of course,

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.730
we'll call it Walter White.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.840
It just felt right.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.890
PAAVO SILJAMAKI:
There's a new track

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.630
called "Saul" on the new one.

00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:15.430
JONO GRANT: No.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.366
That might be a joke track.

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.990
CATHERINE ARMATO: I'd be excited
to hear what that sounds like.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.080
OK.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.246
We're going to take our
first audience question now.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.240
JONO GRANT: Hello.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.364
AUDIENCE: My name is Naomi.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.760
So, your music is like, really
emotional, and, like, really

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.510
inspirational to me, and I
bet a lot of other people

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.600
in this room.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.025
And inspired me to get
a sun and moon tattoo.

00:19:38.025 --> 00:19:38.900
TONY MCGUINNESS: Wow.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.380
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted to
know, what inspires you guys?

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.327
TONY MCGUINNESS: So
much inspires me.

00:19:46.327 --> 00:19:47.910
I went to see a film
last night that I

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.280
didn't know anything about.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.650
I came away-- I mean, I was
close to tears at the end.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.320
It's called "The
Skeleton Twins."

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.855
And I come away from
experiences like that,

00:19:55.855 --> 00:19:57.990
or reading great book, or
hearing a great record.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.680
And it lives with
me for a long time.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.440
And little bits go in.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.950
When you come to write songs,
ideas that you've heard,

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:09.770
and experience from other
media, really are important.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.590
I think no input,
no output, really.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.230
So everything that we see
and experience in our lives.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.700
Everything that
we read in books.

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.200
Every record that we hear,
every film that we see,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.980
goes in somewhere and
comes out eventually.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.630
So many things, I
think, especially now.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.910
The way that YouTube
and on-demand TV are.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.550
We can really feast on
things that we like.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:37.060
And I think, if we had the time,
we could spend all our times,

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.320
all our lives, watching TV.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.010
But there's so much
great stuff out there.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.060
I think we're getting--
I saw loads of trailers

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.060
before the film started.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.281
It feels like we're
getting into Oscar season

00:20:47.281 --> 00:20:49.780
again, because they were like,
yeah, I want to see that one.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:50.988
Yeah, I want to see that one.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:52.637
It's great.

00:20:52.637 --> 00:20:54.220
I think there's some
incredible stuff.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.025
They made so much
music that's around

00:20:56.025 --> 00:20:58.120
at the moment to
get inspired by.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.110
With our Kindles, we can
read books all the time.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.776
It's just great, I
think, at the moment.

00:21:04.127 --> 00:21:04.626
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.690
PAAVO SILJAMAKI:
For me, at least,

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.700
the moments where I've
felt really inspired

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.940
is often when I feel
like I can connect

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.610
with a sort of
emotional state that I

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.470
can remember from
having experienced.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.927
So be, like, utter happiness
and joy, or a really sad moment,

00:21:21.927 --> 00:21:22.885
or something like that.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.012
The way I write a lot
is playing the piano.

00:21:30.012 --> 00:21:31.720
So if I'm playing the
piano, I can really

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.620
get into that emotional state.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.000
And often I then
find that really

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
helps to feel really inspired.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.220
And the nice thing
with being creative

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.110
is you can't really plan it.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.220
You can't really
go into something

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.310
knowing what's going to
come out at the other end.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.950
I love the journey
of getting there.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.837
And that's why making
music is so cool.

00:21:50.837 --> 00:21:53.420
JONO GRANT: I think one of the
most amazing things about music

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.130
is-- so, drawing from that--
when you are in a state

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.026
and you write something,
and someone else

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:00.400
can listen to that
piece of music

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.547
and be taken to that place.

00:22:02.547 --> 00:22:04.130
That's just the most
incredible thing.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.920
Because it's not something
that we're taught at school,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.020
how to interpret music.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.760
But it's a kind of universal,
world-wide language.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.440
And I can't think of anything
else that is quite like that,

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:14.940
really.

00:22:16.116 --> 00:22:16.990
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.370
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: Thank you.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.170
JONO GRANT: Thank you.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.480
CATHERINE ARMATO: I'll
take a question over here.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.021
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:20.021 --> 00:22:21.560
My name is Jesus.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.460
I DJ in my free time.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.480
And some of my DJ
sets that I recorded

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.424
live, I uploaded
them to Some Cloud.

00:22:28.424 --> 00:22:29.840
And they were
flagged because they

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.875
contain copyrighted
material, obviously.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.620
So my question is,
like, what do you

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.600
think about the
situation in copyright

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.130
that we are living in?

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.650
Should the users of your music
be punished for sharing them?

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.240
Or should be increased
to share them

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.330
so that they can go
to your concerts?

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.090
And do you think that
sharing live mixes and DJ

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.919
sets has helped you or
has hurt your career?

00:22:56.919 --> 00:22:59.210
JONO GRANT: It's a really
difficult question to answer,

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:03.370
because if we weren't able
to perform and do gigs,

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.190
we wouldn't be able
to do this job.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:09.340
Because we earn a living
from performing shows.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.640
People who make music full
time really struggle-- really,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.680
really, struggle-- to
earn a living from that.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.210
It's a question I've
struggled to answer, really,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.170
because I have so many
mixed feelings about it.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:28.360
When U2 gave away an album--
I'm sure they got paid for it,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.725
right?-- but it's
great promotion.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:37.020
I mean when Radiohead, they
released an album a long time

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.090
ago, and invited fans to
pay what they wanted for it.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.270
And that's fine for
Radiohead to do that,

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.200
because they're such a big band.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.080
They don't need to worry
about the royalties

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.710
that they'll earn from that
particular record as much.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.609
However, it does set a
precedent for everyone

00:23:51.609 --> 00:23:53.150
in the music industry
to some degree.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.260
And then to try and
meet that precedent

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.650
if you're a smaller
artist is challenging.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.210
And what do you do?

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:05.005
Because if we said that, we'd be
all right, because we do shows.

00:24:05.005 --> 00:24:07.010
But on the other hand,
a really small artist

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.450
who's up and coming, maybe
it would be a great success.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.420
And maybe people would
pay lots for the album.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:16.890
But I just feel like when you
devalue music in such a way,

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.590
it really does restrict
it to those artists who

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.100
are able to go out
and perform live.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.370
And not everybody
is a performer.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.530
Not everybody is a DJ.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.960
Not everybody can go and
stand in front of 1,000 people

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.674
and do a convincing performance.

00:24:29.674 --> 00:24:32.090
But there are a lot of people
who can make a great record,

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.370
as well.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:38.160
So my question back to
anyone is, how do we--

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.651
should we-- make those people
included in the music industry

00:24:41.651 --> 00:24:42.150
still?

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.830
Because that's a real
challenge, isn't it?

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.788
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: But as
it seems at the moment,

00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:49.000
the future of music
distribution is streaming in

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:49.950
all its many forms.

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.650
And maybe some that
haven't yet been invented.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.405
And I think that is pretty
much-- it's a compromise.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.120
Subscription models
and streaming.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.880
But I think that way, people
can do what they want to do.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.610
Which is they can share music.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.670
They can listen to
whatever they want.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.110
And the musicians
still at the other end

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.960
should get some royalties.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.210
Maybe not enough for to
do as a full-time job.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.001
JONO GRANT: I think
you've hit on it there.

00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:19.090
Because I think the
answer really is,

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.500
you shouldn't have to
have your mix taken down,

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.030
but the royalties
need to be tracked

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:24.860
so that someone gets paid.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.479
That's I think a fair
answer to it, really.

00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:29.520
I think you should be
allowed to put your mix up.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.920
But, yeah.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.700
Those records need
to be accounted

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.780
for by SoundCloud or something.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.130
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: But the
internet and music distribution

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:43.030
through the internet has vastly
helped us around the world.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.250
That is how most of
our fans have first

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.310
heard our music-- somehow,
by the internet, I think.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.700
And I think it will
continue to do that.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.330
And even better than at
the moment, I believe.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.010
Because more people are
getting online every day.

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.270
And there's so much interest
for electronic music

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.820
around the world.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.460
And it's still brand-new
in so many countries.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.012
So it's very exciting times.

00:26:10.012 --> 00:26:10.845
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.050
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.150
My name is Jude.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:19.170
So obviously, I have a
like for British bands.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:23.210
And my question
is, for vocalists,

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.160
like with "We Are All We
Need" and "Sun and Moon"

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.100
and all that stuff, do you--
they write their own lyrics,

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:30.600
right?

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.010
So do you tell
them, like, this is

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.860
the kind of vibe
we're going through?

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:39.030
Do you make any bit of
the song first and then

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.194
work with each other?

00:26:40.194 --> 00:26:41.360
TONY MCGUINNESS: It depends.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.394
It depends on who we're working
with and what the song is.

00:26:45.394 --> 00:26:47.810
In the case of "Sun and Moon,"
for example, we wrote that.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:48.350
JONO GRANT: With

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.599
TONY MCGUINNESS: And then
we got-- with Justine, yeah.

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:52.680
And we got Richard
to sing that for us.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.800
And he sang the lyrics that
had already been written.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.785
When we write with Justine, she
often writes most of her songs.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.650
Same with Zoe.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.350
It really depends on
the track in question.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.900
AUDIENCE: So let's say they
wrote one of their lyrics,

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.400
or whatnot.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.220
How do you go about
putting it all together

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.480
into a song where
everything sounds good?

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.060
Do you have a tune?

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.860
Or do you let them write
a song, and then think,

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.440
this melody will sound
great with these vocals,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.192
or vice versa?

00:27:21.192 --> 00:27:23.400
TONY MCGUINNESS: We tend to
write the song with them.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.972
So the two things are
happening at the same time.

00:27:25.972 --> 00:27:26.680
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.540
Well, all right.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.040
Thank you.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.010
First of all, I
want to thank you

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:35.300
guys for helping me get my
job done, because I listen

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.040
to your podcast for
four hours every day.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.620
My question is--

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.245
JONO GRANT: Thanks
for giving us a job.

00:27:44.381 --> 00:27:44.880
And

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.880
AUDIENCE: I'll see you
at your show on Saturday.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.570
The question is, there's
a lot of collaboration

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.340
in the EDM music industry.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.840
And can you tell
me more about that?

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.170
Because compared to
other genres of music,

00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.310
EDM's always like,
one form, one artist

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.972
is mixing off some
other artist, who

00:28:01.972 --> 00:28:03.180
is mixing off another artist.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.013
And you get several of
them coming together.

00:28:05.013 --> 00:28:07.655
And it's an unusually strong
form of collaboration.

00:28:09.574 --> 00:28:11.990
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: I think with
electronic music, obviously,

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.990
most of the music is, first of
all, produced electronically.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.367
So it's easier for
people to collaborate,

00:28:19.367 --> 00:28:20.950
even if they're not
in the same place.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:27.130
Because obviously if you're
playing live instruments,

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.690
you really have to play
in the same room together

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:33.010
to really get into
that vibe together.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:36.400
And also, dance music has
a long history of remixing.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.690
So we started as remixers.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:44.110
And so many people are used to
remixing other people's stuff.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.590
So it's just a
tradition, I think.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.150
There's a lot of
collaboration all throughout

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.940
the electronic music community.

00:28:52.347 --> 00:28:54.680
JONO GRANT: Also, I think,
generally, people work better

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.280
in teams than they do alone.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.630
I think that's a fair comment.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.130
And it's true of
the music industry.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.990
You look at an album like
"Dark Side of the Moon,"

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.231
and, again, it comes back
to that musical investment

00:29:05.231 --> 00:29:05.730
question.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.490
Because I'm not sure if that
album could be made easily

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.459
today, because of the
amount of people involved

00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:12.750
and the amount of money
invested in a record like that.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.290
It's a really cool thing when
great people get together--

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.550
a great engineer, great band.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.800
And I think some of
the best dance records

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.090
are being made that way,
where you have a great singe.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.570
Maybe two great producers.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.605
And maybe someone else
it mixes the record.

00:29:28.647 --> 00:29:29.355
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:29:30.629 --> 00:29:31.170
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:32.280
I'm Camille.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.430
I just had a question.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.219
At Trance Around the
World 350, you guys

00:29:35.219 --> 00:29:37.010
debuted "Sun and Moon,"
and asked the crowd

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.890
to name the song.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.015
Will you guys be doing the
same thing this Saturday

00:29:40.015 --> 00:29:41.425
with your new album coming out?

00:29:41.425 --> 00:29:41.750
JONO GRANT: Was
it "Sun and Moon?"

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:43.624
I think it was-- wasn't
it a different track?

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.260
AUDIENCE: I remember
"Sun and Moon."

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.647
People were yelling
"Sun and Moon."

00:29:48.647 --> 00:29:49.480
TONY MCGUINNESS: No.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.610
Because people already know
it's called "Sun and Moon."

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:53.120
Yeah.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.995
AUDIENCE: But will you
be debuting a new song

00:29:54.995 --> 00:29:57.027
and asking the crowd
to name the track?

00:29:57.027 --> 00:29:57.860
TONY MCGUINNESS: No.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.700
I don't think we're going
to be doing a name the song.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.077
We've kind of named
them all this time.

00:30:04.077 --> 00:30:04.660
AUDIENCE: Sad.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.320
Dang.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.736
TONY MCGUINNESS: Yeah, we got
round to doing it this time.

00:30:07.736 --> 00:30:10.909
So yes, there won't be a naming
this song section, I'm afraid.

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:11.450
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:12.010
Sounds good.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:12.843
TONY MCGUINNESS: OK.

00:30:12.843 --> 00:30:13.850
AUDIENCE: Thanks,

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:14.760
CATHERINE ARMATO: Got
a question over here.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.770
JONO GRANT: Over
to the east wing.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:16.612
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:30:16.612 --> 00:30:17.570
Thanks for stopping by.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.600
It means a lot to us.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.170
I'm curious about your
music creation process.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.410
I know it's probably different
for every specific song.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.300
But my specific
question is, who do you

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.100
think about when
you're writing songs?

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.360
Or rather, who do you write for?

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.680
I know some artists that
write mainly for themselves,

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.305
and some artists who
think about others

00:30:34.305 --> 00:30:35.840
who'd be great to
play at a show.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.819
I mean, even writing a song for
a fan to listen to at a show

00:30:39.819 --> 00:30:41.860
is very different than
writing a song for someone

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.520
to listen to by themself
in their bedroom.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.915
So I'm just curious
about is there

00:30:46.915 --> 00:30:48.560
a general trend or
general direction

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.893
that you usually think about
when you're writing a song?

00:30:50.893 --> 00:30:53.609
JONO GRANT: I think from a
musical perspective, rather

00:30:53.609 --> 00:30:55.150
than the lyrical
perspective, for me,

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.020
it's definitely
writing for myself,

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.080
in terms of whatever
ideas spring to mind.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.900
And then afterwards, during
the production phase,

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.490
you may produce--
obviously, you've

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.390
got certain formats
to think about.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.380
Like a radio mix, or
something like that.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.406
But I actually think it's
kind of really important,

00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:17.030
if you're going to
move things forward,

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.240
you kind of need to do
what you believe in most.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.490
And I think lyrically, it's
a similar thing, isn't it?

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.990
You don't think, oh, I'll
write this song because they're

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.640
going to sing along to it.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.223
TONY MCGUINNESS: I
mean, I tried that.

00:31:30.223 --> 00:31:32.790
Well, we tried it
once, I remember.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.340
A long time ago with OceanLab,
with "Beautiful Together."

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.360
That was a song that
we decided to write

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.230
for a specific purpose.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.260
And I don't think
it's that's good.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:47.860
I think it's a lot healthier and
a lot easier-- I mean, it's OK.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.670
But it's not-- to me, it
wasn't-- I can see through it,

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:52.170
I guess.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.910
It's difficult for
me to listen to it.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:55.440
JONO GRANT: I think once
you've written it, you--

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.280
TONY MCGUINNESS:
But I think it's

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.510
about it's a lot easier
and a lot more meaningful

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.570
to write from the heart.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:03.270
So you write-- as Jono said--
predominantly for yourself.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.554
These are things that you
feel like you've got to say.

00:32:05.554 --> 00:32:07.720
And then when you're in the
process of thinking what

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.230
songs might make the album,
how they'll be produced,

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.230
and maybe you're
thinking about how

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.470
they might transpose
to somebody else.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.930
But the moment of creation,
it's a very personal thing,

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.020
actually, I think.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.310
JONO GRANT: But
I think there are

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:22.090
sort of two phases to writing.

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.190
The one where you have
the original idea.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:27.330
And that's the most organic bit.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.930
And then there's the moment when
you take a step back from it.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:31.860
And you hone that idea.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:36.450
And I suppose that is more the
contrived side of it, that bit.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.920
It's more considered,
and less of what

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.510
Paavo was talking about earlier,
when you're just getting on

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.550
with it and it's flowing.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.840
You do sit back.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.220
And you go, well, hang on a sec.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.180
This song's 12 minutes long.

00:32:50.479 --> 00:32:51.520
That isn't going to work.

00:32:51.794 --> 00:32:52.710
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: Yeah.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:56.310
And the real art of production
and great production

00:32:56.310 --> 00:33:00.500
is doing all the analytical
stuff without killing the song.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.890
And we sometimes
started from something

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.600
we felt like has an
incredible core, produced it,

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.370
and then we lost something.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.430
We went back.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.175
Tried it again.

00:33:11.175 --> 00:33:11.800
Tried it again.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.140
And three years later,
we've got "Sun and Moon."

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.710
JONO GRANT: Yeah, "Sun and
Moon" is living proof for us

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.169
that you can work on about
50 versions of the song

00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:22.210
and sort of get it right.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.204
Because sometimes you think
if you overwork something,

00:33:27.204 --> 00:33:28.370
it's going to make it worse.

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.187
And it does make it worse.

00:33:30.187 --> 00:33:32.270
And sometimes you have to
leave it for next album.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.811
We've got songs we've written
for this album that didn't make

00:33:34.811 --> 00:33:38.230
it on that we'll revisit,
I'm sure, in future years.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.730
And "Sun and Moon"
was one of those.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.520
It was supposed to be
on the OceanLab album.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.780
As was "Thing Called
Love," actually, wasn't it?

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.590
But those songs wouldn't have
been as good as they are,

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.487
perhaps-- or certainly
not how they've ended up--

00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:53.570
if we hadn't have left
them and come back to them.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.934
They would have been on
there, but maybe-- maybe they

00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:57.100
would have been even better.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.160
Dunno.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:58.680
Can't say.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.210
But we had a lot of versions
we weren't happy with,

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.242
is what I can say.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.910
AUDIENCE: Awesome, thanks.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.260
CATHERINE ARMATO: We have
time for one more question.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:07.197
TONY MCGUINNESS: Awww.

00:34:07.197 --> 00:34:08.030
AUDIENCE: I'm lucky.

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.530
Hi.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.670
My name's Jeff.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.969
My favorite song right now
is Ilan Bluestone's remix

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:12.940
of "Satellite."

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.360
So I'm wondering what
your favorite remix

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.060
or mash-up of your own song is.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.000
TONY MCGUINNESS: My
favorite remix of our songs

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.090
is the Seven Lions remix
of "On My Way to Heaven,"

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:31.583
because-- it's a weird
thing, because obviously, I

00:34:31.583 --> 00:34:33.999
don't think I'd ever heard
anything like the kind of music

00:34:33.999 --> 00:34:36.500
that he makes when
we wrote the song.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.904
And the one issue that
they raise with the song

00:34:38.904 --> 00:34:42.690
is it's not a very traditional
song structure tool.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.420
It goes through
various different bits.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.650
And suddenly, here was
this kind of music form

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.570
where in the space
of five minutes,

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.260
you could have seven
different themes and vibes.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.719
And it just-- everything
works so well.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:56.790
It's great.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:57.516
I love it.

00:34:57.516 --> 00:34:59.432
JONO GRANT: I couldn't
pick one, to be honest.

00:34:59.432 --> 00:35:02.190
But I agree with you, that
was a fantastic remix.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.540
When we did a remix
competition, people

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.400
think-- I think
people think-- we're

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.280
going to pick something that
sounds like what people think

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.297
Anjuna Beats is
about at the time.

00:35:12.297 --> 00:35:13.880
Anjuna Beats is
changing all the time.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.670
It might be something different
tomorrow, next week, next year.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.960
But that remix just popped out.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.277
It wasn't what we
expected to get.

00:35:22.277 --> 00:35:23.860
But it was just
incredible, wasn't it?

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:24.830
TONY MCGUINNESS:
Yeah, it was amazing.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.663
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: And I
remember you guys did

00:35:26.663 --> 00:35:28.590
the Stereosonic
tour in Australia.

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:31.150
And I was tuning
into it live when

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.910
you were on stage in Sydney.

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:37.530
And I heard the "You Got
to Go" and Believe in Me"

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:38.790
bootleg for the first time.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:39.270
TONY MCGUINNESS: Oh, yeah.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.945
PAAVO SILJAMAKI:
I was like, what?

00:35:39.945 --> 00:35:41.477
Hey, that's brilliant.

00:35:41.477 --> 00:35:43.310
I didn't know it was
happening, but you guys

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:45.143
were preparing all that
stuff for that tour.

00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:48.210
And it's been interesting.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.490
Because obviously, sometimes
remixes are really interesting,

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:55.950
because somebody's really,
like, actually built a new thing

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.330
around the core of the song.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.920
Bootlegs can also be
really interesting,

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.130
where sometimes when
you match up vocal

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.640
from another and instrument
from another, somehow

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.360
they make more sense
out of both of them.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.415
And that was the
case with those two.

00:36:11.415 --> 00:36:13.790
TONY MCGUINNESS: And on a good
day, the "Metropolis" mix.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:14.680
I mean, it's uncanny--

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.888
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:15.888 --> 00:36:17.990
TONY MCGUINNESS: --how
those things work together.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.110
JONO GRANT: Artie
actually wanted

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.110
to put a vocal on "Believe
in Me," didn't he?

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.730
He kept on sending
us these vocals.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:24.551
And we weren't
quite sure if he'd

00:36:24.551 --> 00:36:25.800
got the right one at the time.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.606
And then, so, when putting those
two tracks together, kind of

00:36:29.606 --> 00:36:31.480
solved the problem for
him, I think, as well.

00:36:31.937 --> 00:36:34.270
AUDIENCE: It's a great name,
too-- "You Got to Believe."

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:35.510
TONY MCGUINNESS: Yeah.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.640
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:35.940
Thank you.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.100
JONO GRANT: You have to.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.190
You got to believe.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.600
TONY MCGUINNESS: Sorry about
that, west wing, east wing.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.100
JONO GRANT: Oh, go on.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.720
Let him--

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.083
TONY MCGUINNESS: Go on, quick.

00:36:42.083 --> 00:36:42.850
Quick question.

00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:45.202
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:46.780
So you mentioned a
bit about genres.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.540
About how you were
noticing how genres

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.587
are changing and
becoming more popular.

00:36:51.587 --> 00:36:53.170
I was curious about
what your thoughts

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:55.890
of how electronic music has
grown, and where it's going.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.590
And what sort of
genres you might

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.260
be interested in
looking towards.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:01.640
And how that influences the
way you make your music.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.540
PAAVO SILJAMAKI: I realize
that maybe like 10 years ago,

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.850
we played a lot of places
that had a real genre tack.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.470
We played a lot of trance
clubs, for example.

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.970
And what's happened, because
largely down to the internet,

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.590
is that a lot of the
electronic parties

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:21.050
happen in venues that
don't have a genre tack.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:24.740
You might get a bit of
dubstep, and a bit of house,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.650
and a bit of trance.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.120
And at the moment,
I feel like we

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.340
live in a kind of
genreless place, in a way.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.820
And I find it's
very interesting.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.620
When people are
going to the studio,

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.760
there's less people
thinking of, you know,

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.720
today I'm going to make
a music in this genre,

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.960
and more people going
into the studio saying,

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.190
I'm going to make a track that's
going to be great for my sets

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.330
next weekend.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:53.560
And it's that kind of
freedom of restriction

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.420
that's made music
really interesting.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.060
And future is a little bit--
you know, it's not written.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.685
We don't know where
it's going to lead.

00:38:00.685 --> 00:38:01.820
But it's exciting.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.320
JONO GRANT: Genre is a useful
labels for the press, I guess.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.152
But I view genre as
like race, or religion,

00:38:06.152 --> 00:38:07.110
or any of those things.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.040
And I'm a proponent
of secularism.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.120
So genre is kind of p-ing
me off a bit, really.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.660
I mean, I just like music.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:17.956
And the press can label us
or anybody what they want.

00:38:17.956 --> 00:38:19.830
TONY MCGUINNESS: It's
exactly that, actually.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:20.605
This may be--

00:38:20.605 --> 00:38:21.480
JONO GRANT: Divisive.

00:38:22.892 --> 00:38:24.600
TONY MCGUINNESS: But
the important thing,

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.058
I think, about the way it works
in the way that make people

00:38:27.058 --> 00:38:29.250
make tracks, is they
bits of loads of genres.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:31.750
If there was an app like
Shazam that sort of told you

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.590
what genre it was.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.964
I always feel like this when
I'm listening to something--

00:38:34.964 --> 00:38:36.630
is this tech house or techno?

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:38.280
I sort of feel like
I want to know,

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.399
because I want to appear
knowledgeable about it.

00:38:40.399 --> 00:38:41.940
But if there was an
app that told you

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.140
what it was, it wouldn't
say, it's techno.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.530
It would say, it's
got 20% of techno.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.180
It's got 5% of dubstep.

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.900
It's got 20% of trance.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.230
That's the nature of
electronic music, actually.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.760
It isn't one genre.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.770
We're not one race.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.946
We're loads of different
ones, all mixed together.

00:38:57.946 --> 00:38:59.570
And I think that's
what makes it great.

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.780
JONO GRANT: And as an artist,
you can't own a genre.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.810
But you can own your
own artist name.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:07.580
So with rock bands-- OK,
I've just mentioned a genre--

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:10.600
but rock is, I think, a lot
looser genre, in the same way

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.990
that you could say dance
music, for example.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:17.790
You can own your own kind
of brand in that respect.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:22.020
But Trance Around the World, we
can't own the genre of trance,

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.630
if trance goes in a direction
that we don't like, with Trance

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.880
Around the World, for example.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:30.410
So by being Group
Therapy in that instance,

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:33.740
we're able to create above
and beyond world, rather

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:38.012
than clinging onto a genre
that's slipping away somewhere

00:39:38.012 --> 00:39:38.970
we don't want it to go.

00:39:40.565 --> 00:39:41.440
CATHERINE ARMATO: OK.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.400
We're out of time.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.800
I just want to thank you
guys so much for coming.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.925
TONY MCGUINNESS: Thank you.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.350
JONO GRANT: Thank you.
