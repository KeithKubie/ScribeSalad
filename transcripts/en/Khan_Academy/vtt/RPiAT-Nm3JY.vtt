00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:01.815
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians,

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:04.853
we've talked about prepositions of time

00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:06.954
and we've talked about
prepositions of space

00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:09.218
and I couldn't come up
with a cute name for these

00:00:09.218 --> 00:00:11.877
because the following five prepositions

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:14.315
are examples of what we
would call prepositions

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:18.658
that have connotations for
neither time nor space.

00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:20.677
Some of them do have time connotations

00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:22.937
and some of them do have
physical connotations

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:25.489
and what we're going to
talk about today, however,

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.489
are the uses of these
words, these prepositions,

00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:33.077
that don't have anything
to do with time or space,

00:00:33.077 --> 00:00:37.013
they just have, they
encode other relationships.

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:39.335
Let's get to it, I'll
show you what I mean.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:41.684
When we say about it can mean

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:45.318
you're talking about a specific subject.

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:50.062
So I could say to you,
"Tell me about yourself!"

00:00:50.062 --> 00:00:55.062
The word by can be used to
denote agency or doing this.

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:57.466
You'll see what I mean by that.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:01.726
I mean we can figure out who
is responsible for something

00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:03.734
with the use of the word by.

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:06.568
The book was written by Sudhir.

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:07.496
So who did the thing?

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:08.750
Sudhir did the thing,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.978
he's the person with
agency, he's the doer.

00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:15.428
The word for denotes use.

00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:17.835
So if you were to ask me, for example,

00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:21.269
"David what's a wood chipper used to do?"

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:23.866
I would say, "It's for chipping wood,

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:28.866
"for turning wood into chips,
it's purpose is chipping."

00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:31.362
Of has this connotation of belonging

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.683
or being part of a place.

00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:36.976
So we can talk about the great
green dragon of Inverness.

00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:41.140
Inverness is a place, it's in Scotland.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.046
Are there dragons there?

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:44.526
I don't know, I've never been.

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:49.526
And with means together or part of.

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:53.826
There goes that snail
with the painted shell

00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:56.214
which indicates that
the snail and the shell

00:01:56.214 --> 00:01:58.496
are part and parcel, they're together.

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:00.981
So yeah, so these prepositions can be used

00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:02.304
for all sorts of things.

00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:04.691
I understand this can be confusing.

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.875
Prepositions are probably

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.530
the most complicated part of English

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.318
and the problem is you
just need to memorize them.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:12.623
But the good thing is that
there aren't that many

00:02:12.623 --> 00:02:14.179
because, as I've said before,

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:18.057
prepositions are a closed
group, we don't mint new ones.

00:02:18.057 --> 00:02:19.334
So you don't have to be

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:22.295
constantly trying to collect
more ones, or pick them up,

00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:23.432
or figure them out.

00:02:23.432 --> 00:02:26.256
You have a limited set
that you need to master

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:28.114
and the way to do that is to read,

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.912
and listen, and talk a lot.

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:35.070
You can do that, you can
learn anything, David out.
