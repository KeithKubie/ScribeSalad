00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:10.349
Are Fireman's Poles Really a Thing?

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.500
Fireman’s poles, sometimes simply referred
to as “fire poles” are a staple of fictional

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.160
fire-fighting and Ghostbusting.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.730
Though these devices have helped save real
world firefighters valuable seconds over the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.560
decades, they’re now in a strange state
of flux and nobody really knows if they’re

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.250
going to be phased out or not.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.480
It’s reported that prior to the invention
of the fire pole in 1878, most fire stations

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.250
simply contained a set of stairs that firefighters
would have to descend whenever an alarm rang.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.739
At this time, stairs in fire stations were
almost always of the spiral variety, legend

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.899
has it to stop curious horses from venturing
upstairs and inevitably getting stuck.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.890
Of course, documented instances of this ever
happening are seemingly non-existent as far

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.329
as I can find, and the supposed problem could
have easily been solved by simply tying up

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.310
the horses or putting them in stalls, among
other simple solutions.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.520
And, let’s face it, you don’t just let
horses you might need at the ready at a moment’s

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.740
notice wander around as they please, so it
may well be that spiral staircases were common

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.080
in fire stations at the time for the same
reason most other spiral staircases are put

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.350
in- to save space.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.770
If you’re curious about why firefighters
of this age spent the majority of their time

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.510
above the ground floor, that has a lot to
do with how firehouses back then were constructed,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.520
to quote:

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.750
“The majority of firehouses in the nineteenth
century were two or three stories.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.700
Typically, the horse-drawn fire carriages
(and horses) would occupy the first floor,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.540
the second floor would be the firefighters’
sleeping quarters, and, in some cases, a third

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.200
floor would serve as a hay bale storage unit
to feed the animals.”

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.259
As you can imagine, whenever an alarm sounded,
it would invariably end with a crush of firefighters

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.080
desperately trying to force themselves down
the same, tiny spiral staircase.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.360
The story goes that this all changed when
a Chicago firefighter called George Reid working

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.230
for Engine Company 21 heard an alarm on April
21, 1878 while he was in the hayloft.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.010
It’s noted that when the alarm sounded,
George was in no position to get to the first

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.330
floor quickly, and happened to notice a hay
binding pole that had been stored in such

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.450
a way that it led all the way back down to
the loading area.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.330
Rather than rushing for the stairs, Reid instead
grabbed onto the pole and slid down to the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.330
loading area in a matter of seconds.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.870
Reid’s split second decision attracted the
attention of Captain David Kenyon, who, depending

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.750
on which source you want to consult, was either
with Reid in the hayloft when he did this,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.910
or was on the ground floor observing.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.540
Whether this is really how inspiration struck,
or is just a nice story that has grown up

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.860
over the years, what we do know for sure is
that Captain David Kenyon around this time

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.990
really did set about making a permanent pole
from the top floor of the building to the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.560
bottom a real thing.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.940
After pitching the idea to his Fire Marshall,
Kenyon was given permission to cut a hole

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.780
in the floor to install a pole to see how
it would go.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.440
Company 21 then purchased a large beam of
hard-wearing Georgia pine and sanded it down

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.080
until it was about 3 inches in diameter.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.890
They then coated it in several layers of varnish
and some paraffin to protect their hands as

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.069
they slid down it.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.240
It is generally reported that Engine Company
21 were widely mocked by their peers over

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.200
the pole, but this may well have had little
to do with the pole itself, and more to do

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.769
with just finding any excuse to make fun of
them.

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.129
You see, with the exception of David Kenyon,
Engine Company 21 consisted solely of black

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.129
firefighters.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.720
And it wasn’t just the pole they were mocked
for.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.270
The Chicago Tribune is noted as having been
particularly harsh on Company 21, patronisingly

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.030
referring to them as “boys” in articles
detailing their heroics and on more than one

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.890
occasion publishing racist cartoons and sketches
about the group.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.220
With this in mind, it may put a smile on your
face to hear that, for the most part, whether

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.230
because of the pole or just personal pride
to prove the naysayers wrong spurring them

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.290
on, Company 21 consistently out-performed
their fairer skinned peers in response times.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.900
The credit for this was ultimately given to
the fire pole, which resulted in other stations

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.750
around town installing their own poles, and
the practice spread from there.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.750
firepole
Holes in the floor next to potentially sleep-dazed

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.750
individuals.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.750
What could go wrong?

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.750
;-)
While fire poles are undoubtedly useful, in

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.020
more recent years they have become noticeably
more rare, partially because newer fire stations

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.750
are often constructed across a single floor.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.910
Although older, refurbished stations can still
be found containing fire poles, they’ve

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.910
had to be changed somewhat to accommodate
modern safety concerns.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.660
Along with being updated to feature shock
absorbers and cushioned bases to limit damage

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.590
from a fall, some poles feature baskets to
stop firefighters accidentally falling and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.150
breaking their necks, a very real concern.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.660
For instance, in 2003 a firefighter in Seattle,
Washington, Mark Jones, accidentally fell

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.360
down the pole hole when he woke up in the
middle of the night and was blearily stumbling

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.180
towards the bathroom.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.050
While he survived the 15 ft fall, he suffered
brain damage, a fractured pelvis, broken ribs,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.639
and fractured vertebrae.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.960
On top of that, one of his lungs was punctured
and his very full bladder, which he had been

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.730
getting up to relieve, ruptured.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.780
On the flip side of the coin, some stations
and states still embrace the pole thanks to

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.270
the reason it was first invented- speed.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.460
Though estimates vary, it is generally thought
that fire poles can reduce response time by

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.620
as much as “20-25 seconds” in multi-storied
fire stations.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.820
There’s also some concern that having a
bunch of firefighters rushing down stairs

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.810
at the same time might end up being no safer
than the poles.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.090
As one firefighter, who asked not to be named,
stated, “It only takes one person’s misstep

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.260
and you’re going to have a crew of people
at the bottom of the staircase.”

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.930
That said, according to an interview with
one of the few manufactures still making brass

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.050
fire poles, McIntire Brass Works Inc, some
fire stations today have them purely for show,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.490
sometimes even installing fire poles that
come from a hole in the ceiling that leads

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:25.360
to nowhere.
