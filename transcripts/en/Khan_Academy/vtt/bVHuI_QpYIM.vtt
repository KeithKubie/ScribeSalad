00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.191
- [Voiceover] So we have two
different substances here

00:00:02.191 --> 00:00:03.564
and just for the sake of an argument,

00:00:03.564 --> 00:00:05.736
let's assume that they
are in their liquid state.

00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:07.702
Well you probably already recognize

00:00:07.702 --> 00:00:08.976
this substance right here,

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:10.847
each molecule has one oxygen atom and two

00:00:10.847 --> 00:00:14.318
hydrogen atoms, this is
water and we have drawn all

00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:16.504
neat hydrogen bonds right over there.

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:18.118
Now this substance, at least right now,

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.777
might be a little less familiar to you,

00:00:19.777 --> 00:00:21.633
you might recognize you have an O-H group,

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.909
and then you have a carbon chain,

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.268
this tells you that this is an alcohol,

00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:26.370
and what type of alcohol?

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.030
Well you have two carbons here,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.437
so this is ethyl alcohol
or known as ethanol.

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:34.296
So this right over here,
let me write that down.

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:38.255
This is ethanol, which is
the primary constituent in

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:41.494
the alcohol that people drink,
it's also an additive into

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:45.709
car fuel, but what I
wanna think about here,

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:47.601
is if we assume that both of these are

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:49.731
in their liquid state and let's say

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:51.391
they're hanging out in a cup

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:53.445
and we're just at sea level

00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:56.348
so it's just a standard
pressure conditions.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:01:00.746
Which one is going to
be easier to vaporize

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:02.570
or which one is going to have more

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.276
of it's molecules turning into vapor,

00:01:04.276 --> 00:01:06.633
or I guess you could say
turning into vapor more easily?

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.837
Well you immediately see that
they both have hydrogen bonds,

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.381
you have this hydrogen bond between the

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:13.973
partially negative end and
the partial positive ends,

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.213
hydrogen bond between
the partial negative end

00:01:16.213 --> 00:01:17.792
and the partial positive ends.

00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:19.033
The other thing that you notice is that,

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.459
I guess you could think of
it on a per molecule basis,

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.493
on average you have fewer hydrogen bonds

00:01:23.493 --> 00:01:25.593
on the ethanol than you have on the water.

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:28.136
Ethanol-- Oxygen is more electronegative,

00:01:28.136 --> 00:01:29.900
we already know it's more
electronegative than hydrogen,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.792
it's also more
electronegative than carbon,

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:34.011
but it's a lot more
electronegative than hydrogen.

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:35.519
So you have this imbalance here

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:36.877
and then on top of that, this carbon,

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:38.887
you have a lot more atoms here in which

00:01:38.887 --> 00:01:40.882
to distribute a partial charge.

00:01:40.882 --> 00:01:42.426
There could be a very weak partial charge

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:44.504
distributed here amongst the carbons

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.652
but you have a stronger
partial charge on the hydrogen

00:01:46.652 --> 00:01:48.707
but it's not gonna be
strong as what you have here

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.646
because, once again, you
have a larger molecule

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:53.641
to distribute especially
around this carbon

00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:55.870
to help dissipate charging.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.400
So you're gonna have
weaker partial charges here

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.071
and they're occurring in fewer places

00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:03.404
so you have less hydrogen
bonding on the ethanol

00:02:03.404 --> 00:02:05.761
than you have on the water.

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:10.721
Let me write that, you
have less hydrogen bonding.

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:12.557
As we've already talked about,

00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:15.158
in the liquid state and frankly,
in the solid state as well,

00:02:15.158 --> 00:02:17.340
the hydrogen bonding is what is keeping

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.128
these things together,
that's what's keeping the

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:21.368
water together, flowing
next to each other.

00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:23.400
This is what's keeping
the ethanol together.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.801
So if you have less hydrogen--
Let me write this down,

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:30.079
less hydrogen bonding, it
actually has more hydrogen atoms

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.349
per molecule, but if you
have less hydrogen bonding,

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.369
it's gonna take less energy
to break these things free.

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:37.968
Before I even talk about
breaking things free and these

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:40.753
molecules turning into vapors
entering their gas state,

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:43.112
let's just think about how that happens.

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:45.514
When we talk about the
temperature of a system,

00:02:45.514 --> 00:02:48.116
we're really just talking about
the average kinetic energy.

00:02:48.116 --> 00:02:50.471
Each molecule, remember
they're all bouncing around

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:53.153
in all different ways, this
one might have, for example,

00:02:53.153 --> 00:02:55.726
a much higher kinetic
energy than this one.

00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:57.194
They're all moving in
different directions,

00:02:57.194 --> 00:02:58.515
this one might have a little bit higher,

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:00.234
and maybe this one all of a sudden has

00:03:00.234 --> 00:03:02.231
a really high kinetic energy
because it's just been

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:04.413
knocked in just the exact right ways

00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:07.768
and it's enough to overcome
both these hydrogen bonds

00:03:07.768 --> 00:03:11.065
over here and the pressure
from the air above it.

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:13.558
Remember this isn't happening
in a vacuum, you have

00:03:13.558 --> 00:03:17.380
air up here, air molecules,
I'll just draw the generic,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.772
you have different types of things,

00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:20.956
nitrogen, carbon dioxide,
etcetera etcetera.

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:23.161
But if I just draw generic air molecules,

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:26.295
there's also some pressure from
these things bouncing around

00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:29.824
but this one might have enough,
this particular molecule

00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:32.180
might have enough kinetic
energy to overcome the hydrogen

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.373
bonds and overcome the pressure
from the molecules above it

00:03:35.373 --> 00:03:39.530
to essentially vaporize,
to turn into its gas state.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.492
The same thing might be true over here,

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:43.302
maybe this is the molecule that has

00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:46.367
the super high kinetic energy
to be able to break free.

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:50.825
In that case, it is going to
turn into its gaseous state.

00:03:50.825 --> 00:03:52.748
The hydrogen bonds are gonna break apart,

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:55.443
and it's gonna be so far from
any of its sibling molecules,

00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:57.773
I guess you could say, from
the other ethanol molecules

00:03:57.773 --> 00:04:00.144
that it won't be able to
form new hydrogen bonds.

00:04:00.144 --> 00:04:02.143
Same thing with this
one, once it vaporizes,

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:04.764
it's out in gaseous state, it's
much further from any other

00:04:04.764 --> 00:04:06.388
water molecules, it's not going to be able

00:04:06.388 --> 00:04:08.212
to form those hydrogen bonds with them.

00:04:08.212 --> 00:04:11.022
Because there's more
hydrogen bonds here to break,

00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:13.483
than here, you can imagine
it would take, on average,

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:18.138
more heat to vaporize this thing
than to vaporize this thing

00:04:18.138 --> 00:04:20.553
and that is indeed the case.

00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:23.999
The term for how much heat do you need to

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.157
vaporize a certain mass of a
substance, you can imagine,

00:04:27.157 --> 00:04:30.756
is called the heat of vaporization,
let me write that down,

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:35.756
heat of vaporization and you can imagine,

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:41.909
it is higher for water
than it is for ethanol

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.395
and I will give you the numbers here,

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:44.776
at least ones that I've
been able to look up.

00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:46.528
I found slightly different numbers,

00:04:46.528 --> 00:04:49.283
depending on which resource
I looked at but what I found

00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:54.283
for water, the heat of vaporization
is 2260 joules per gram

00:04:56.318 --> 00:04:58.896
or instead of using joules,
remember joules is a unit of

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:01.438
energy it could be a unit of
heat, instead of joules if you

00:05:01.438 --> 00:05:02.854
wanna think of it in terms of calories,

00:05:02.854 --> 00:05:07.854
that's equivalent to 541
calories per gram while the

00:05:10.206 --> 00:05:13.561
heat of vaporization for
ethanol is a good bit lower.

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.011
The heat of vaporization for
ethanol--let me make this clear

00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:20.984
this right over here is
water, that's for water.

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:23.417
The same thing for ethanol.

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:27.295
The heat of vaporization for ethanol is,

00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:32.295
based on what I looked
up, is 841 joules per gram

00:05:32.484 --> 00:05:37.484
or if we wanna write them as
calories, 201 calories per gram

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:40.809
which means it would require, roughly,

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:45.150
201 calories to evaporate,
to fully vaporize

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.150
a gram of ethanol at standard temperature,

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:52.685
keeping the temperature constant.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:54.286
We could talk more about
that in other videos,

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:56.782
but the big thing that
we're talking about here

00:05:56.782 --> 00:05:59.707
is, look, it requires less
energy to vaporize this thing

00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:02.911
and you can run the experiment,
take a glass of water,

00:06:02.911 --> 00:06:04.861
equivalent glasses, fill them
up the same amount of time,

00:06:04.861 --> 00:06:08.229
a glass of water and a glass of ethanol

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:10.707
and then see how long it takes.

00:06:10.707 --> 00:06:12.526
You can put a heat lamp on top of them

00:06:12.526 --> 00:06:13.835
or you could just put them outside

00:06:13.835 --> 00:06:15.449
where they're experiencing the same

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.314
atmospheric conditions,
the same sun's rays

00:06:18.314 --> 00:06:22.049
and see what's the difference--
how much more energy,

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:23.989
how much more time does it take for

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:26.276
the water to evaporate than the ethanol.

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:28.877
There's a similar idea here
which is boiling point.

00:06:28.877 --> 00:06:30.908
We've all boiled things, boiling point is

00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:35.877
the point at which the vapor
pressure from the substance

00:06:35.877 --> 00:06:40.877
has become equal to and starts
to overcome the pressure

00:06:40.937 --> 00:06:43.841
from just a regular atmospheric pressure.

00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:45.720
And so you can imagine that water

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.274
has a higher temperature
at which it starts

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:50.876
to boil than ethanol and
that is indeed the case.

00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:55.275
Water's boiling point is
exactly 100° Celsius, in fact,

00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:58.154
water's boiling point was
an important data point for

00:06:58.154 --> 00:07:01.057
even establishing the Celsius
scale, so by definition,

00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:04.238
it's 100° Celsius, while
ethanol's boiling point is

00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:07.465
approximately 78° Celsius.

00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:09.763
So it boils at a much lower temperature

00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:11.260
an that's because there's just fewer

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.763
hydrogen bonds to actually break.
