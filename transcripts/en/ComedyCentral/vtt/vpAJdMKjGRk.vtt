WITH EXTRA CHEESE.
OH, HELL, IT'S MY LAST DAY.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.775
JUST BRING US A BOWL OF CHEESE!

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:10.077
[laughter]

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.645
- HEY, LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.780
IF THIS WERE
YOUR LAST DAY ON EARTH,

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:16.083
I MEAN, IF THERE WERE
NO REPERCUSSIONS BEYOND TODAY,

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.520
YOU COULD JUST GO FOR IT,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

00:00:19.553 --> 00:00:23.090
- WELL, I-I-I GUESS I--
- NO, NO, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.759
DON'T TELL ME.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.362
JUST DO IT.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.564
- OKAY.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.803
EXCUSE ME.

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.272
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO LEAVE,

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:41.542
GO BACK TO MY PLACE,
AND [bleep] RIGHT NOW?

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:49.816
- NO.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.218
WHERE ARE YOU--
- OH, MY GOD!

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.520
- THAT IS FANTASTIC!
THAT'S THE THING

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.556
TO DO ON YOUR LAST DAY.
[laughs]

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.325
WELL DONE.
[laughs]

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.127
OH--OH, NO. OH, NO.
[laughing]

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.162
- HEY, EVERYBODY!

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:06.800
- WHO--WHO WANTS TO GO [bleep]
ME AND MR. MACNEIL RIGHT NOW?

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:09.136
