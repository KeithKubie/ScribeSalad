00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So we defined the confidence interval to be mean

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Â±1.96 of the observed standard deviation over the data said size.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the question is where did the 1.96 come from? Remember the Central Limit Theorem?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Remember what it said? For large sample sizes N, the mean outcome of the sum of N

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
independently drawn excised becomes more and more normal.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now it turns out the Central Limit Theorem is directly related to the value of 1.96

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and it isn't entirely obvious so I didn't make it a quiz.
