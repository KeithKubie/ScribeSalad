00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:07.618
(music)

00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:11.090
(jumpy music)

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.778
(applause)

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:17.335
Salman: It's exciting to be here.

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:23.515
Well as Mark said, I am the founder
and the faculty of the Khan Academy.

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:25.569
(laughter)

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.901
Very bureaucratic organization.

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:28.819
(laughter)

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.651
And as he said, I started off,
just a little background on me,

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:36.022
I kind of have a techie
background, a math background.

00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:39.981
And then I sold out, and I became
an analyst at a hedge fund.

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:41.438
But while I was an
analyst at a hedge fund,

00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:44.363
I always had this little
bit of an itch to teach.

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:49.612
And no one believes me, but my
motivation for working at a hedge fund,

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:52.042
I didn't even know,
someone told me it's the

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.186
best job to learn about everything.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:57.035
You get to see what happens to
crop prices when an oil tanker

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.290
in this part of the world
disappears, and then that happens,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.734
and gold prices ...

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.207
That's a great job, and then someone
else said and it pays pretty well.

00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:04.741
I said, "Oh."

00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:08.941
But I was at a, I sold out, I was
working as an analyst at a hedge fund,

00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:13.119
and I started tutoring my
cousins in New Orleans.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.649
And we would do this kind of
remote tutoring type of thing,

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.312
and we'll talk more about the form factor,

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:19.612
because that's what I really
want to make this talk about.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:24.551
And I wanted to scale up, so I
just started making YouTube videos.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.366
And fast forward about four or five years.

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.827
and as Mark said, it's now
fourteen hundred videos.

00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:32.189
I started just doing Algebra.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.777
And after about seventy videos,
I said, "Gee, that's Algebra."

00:01:36.777 --> 00:01:39.919
And this was kind of a
part time thing for me.

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:42.970
And then I said, "Maybe I
can do Pre-Algebra too."

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.943
And then another seventy videos
later, I said, "That's Pre-Algebra.

00:01:45.974 --> 00:01:48.685
"I'll do Trigonometry. And maybe Calculus.

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:51.025
"And maybe I'll do Arithmetic.
And I'll do Physics."

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:54.070
And before we know it, fast forward,
there's fourteen hundred videos,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.933
like Mark had mentioned.

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:59.989
And the YouTube people told me that
it's now the most used open course

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.943
video library on, definitely on YouTube.

00:02:03.943 --> 00:02:08.312
More views than MIT, and
Stanford, and Berkeley.

00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:10.443
And as far as I know the Internet.

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:12.963
And this is all from-

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.404
(laughter and applause)

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:21.461
And this is all from one dude who
is a guy working at hedge fund

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:24.173
in his part time with
no budget whatsoever,

00:02:24.173 --> 00:02:26.029
really just starting to tutor his cousins.

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:31.122
And now it's sixty thousand video
views, and fourteen million views,

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:33.680
two hundred thousand
unique students a month.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.183
And you can kind of view it as it's
the largest school in the world.

00:02:36.183 --> 00:02:40.365
But before I go into the actual why,
and I want to make this kind of a

00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:42.444
conversation about why I think
it's working, because I think it

00:02:42.444 --> 00:02:46.326
has ... it can be moved to other
domains in all of our lives, I think.

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:49.032
And I think it will tell us something
about how we learn and all of that.

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.571
I want to show you a quick
video, just so you understand

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:53.778
the form factor, and then we
can talk a little bit about

00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:57.211
why, maybe we collectively
think it might be working.

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.961
So if you start up the video.

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:06.057
Four x squared, squared, plus two
times the product of both terms

00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:14.556
two times four x squared, times y
squared, plus y squared, this term

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:21.282
In October of eighteen o five,
in October of eighteen o five,

00:03:21.282 --> 00:03:27.619
the French Navy gets destroyed by the
British in the Battle of Trafalgar.

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:28.660
This is Trafalgar.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.232
It's actually written here.

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:32.432
Tra-falgar.

00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:39.288
And they get destroyed by Napoleon's
good old friend Admiral Horatio Nelson.

00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:40.410
Horatio Nelson.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.745
So this guys was definitely
a thorn in Napoleon's side.

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:45.595
Horatio ...

00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:48.718
D eight positive T cell.

00:03:48.718 --> 00:03:51.349
It has a C D eight proteins on it.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.893
And this would be called
a C D four positive.

00:03:54.893 --> 00:03:57.437
C D four positive T cells.

00:03:57.437 --> 00:04:04.803
P of x y i plus q of x y j.

00:04:04.803 --> 00:04:06.294
Right this is just a
vector field, over ...

00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:10.788
Problem thirty four.

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:14.995
A landscaper estimates that
landscaping a new park will take

00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:18.545
one person forty-eight hours.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:23.810
If four people work on the job,
and they each work six hour days,

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.755
they each work six hour days ...

00:04:25.755 --> 00:04:29.375
(applause)

00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:34.089
And I'm curious, and don't, feel free,
I'm very open to the negative feedback.

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:38.310
What are the things, if you were to
just compare that to your experience

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.722
when you might have been exposed
to some of those same concepts

00:04:40.722 --> 00:04:43.973
either when you learned it
at high school or in college,

00:04:43.973 --> 00:04:47.553
or even if you've learned it
watch some of the other online
video libraries out there,

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:52.109
what are the things that stood out
to you, that were a little different?

00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:53.361
Any?

00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:55.051
Audience member: You can fast forward.

00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:56.552
Salman: Yeah, no that's actually a huge.

00:04:56.552 --> 00:04:58.571
And I think that's
online video in general.

00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:00.642
The comment was that you can fast forward.

00:05:00.642 --> 00:05:05.256
I was going to talk about this later,
but there's this whole notion that

00:05:05.256 --> 00:05:08.092
anything online is kind
of just nice to have.

00:05:08.092 --> 00:05:10.636
It's not as good as a live interaction.

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:13.277
And I think that assumption is something,

00:05:13.277 --> 00:05:15.225
this bias that we always have in life,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.561
that something for free, that has
zero incremental delivery cost

00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:20.690
has got to be worse than
something that's really

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.888
expensive and hard to do.

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:28.015
And if you think about it, there is
value of being in a room together.

00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:28.888
It's something like jail.

00:05:28.888 --> 00:05:29.943
It's a shared experience.

00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:31.555
We can get inspired together.

00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:34.074
But if we're, if it's a broadcast lecture,

00:05:34.074 --> 00:05:36.296
and it's kind of mundane,
and no one's really ...

00:05:36.296 --> 00:05:39.335
there's not a lot of interaction.

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:42.914
it's an interesting question to
say, "Gee, is video in any way

00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:47.897
"less good than an
actual live interaction?"

00:05:47.897 --> 00:05:49.114
And because you can pause.

00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:50.273
You can repeat it.

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.230
You don't have to take notes.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.419
It is actually something as far as
I can tell, better in every way.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.847
You watch it on your own terms,
whenever you want to watch it.

00:05:57.847 --> 00:06:00.342
If you don't understand a concept,
you can watch a previous video.

00:06:00.342 --> 00:06:02.226
You can look on Wikipedia
and see what that word meant.

00:06:02.226 --> 00:06:04.309
So, yeah that is one of the
... and I would say that's

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:07.237
general of all online video,
not just the Khan Academy.

00:06:07.237 --> 00:06:09.557
Any other things that just kind of
popped out at, when you saw those videos?

00:06:09.557 --> 00:06:10.188
Yeah?

00:06:10.188 --> 00:06:13.438
Audience Member: You don't have to
worry about pleasing the teacher.

00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:15.736
In other words, you weren't
distracted by the social interaction.

00:06:15.736 --> 00:06:16.992
You're just listening
for your own benefit.

00:06:16.992 --> 00:06:18.144
Salman: Right. Right.

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:20.795
So the comment was that you're not
worried about pleasing the teacher.

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:22.410
You're just doing it for your own benefit.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.064
And that's actually ... when I
started, like my teaching career,

00:06:26.064 --> 00:06:28.721
and it's full time now, I
quit my job in September,

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:33.509
I was tutoring my cousins
and I was doing it remotely.

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:34.310
They were in New Orleans.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.309
I was in Boston.

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:37.060
Now I'm in Northern California.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.170
And they were doing really well.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.394
But then I started doing
these YouTube videos.

00:06:39.394 --> 00:06:42.595
And I assumed it was not going to
be as good as the live interaction.

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:45.694
I assumed, "Oh this is
just nice to have for them.

00:06:45.694 --> 00:06:47.625
"Maybe other people will watch it."

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:49.015
I kind of said, "Oh, it's
a little bit of a legacy.

00:06:49.015 --> 00:06:52.365
"Maybe my great grandchildren
might be able to watch,

00:06:52.365 --> 00:06:54.069
"learn Calculus from these videos."

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:56.205
I just thought it would be a
nice thing to put out there.

00:06:56.251 --> 00:06:59.063
But the first point of
feedback I got from my cousins,

00:06:59.063 --> 00:07:01.391
was it was a little bit of
a back-handed compliment,

00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:04.895
is that you're better on
YouTube than you are in person.

00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:06.495
(laughter)

00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:11.287
And after a little bit of getting,
not being defensive about that,

00:07:11.287 --> 00:07:13.064
I think they were saying exactly this,

00:07:13.064 --> 00:07:15.975
when we had the live interaction
and the one-on-one session,

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:17.814
that's stressful for the student.

00:07:17.814 --> 00:07:20.065
That's stressful ... "Oh do you get this?"

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.439
And they might kind of get it.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.974
It might be like an eighty
percent understanding of it.

00:07:23.974 --> 00:07:25.940
But they don't want to waste my time,

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.227
and I'm their cousin,
and I'm volunteering.

00:07:27.227 --> 00:07:29.394
They don't want me to judge
them in any negative way.

00:07:29.394 --> 00:07:31.268
So, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it."

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:33.643
But that's bad information for me,
I'll move on to the next concept.

00:07:33.643 --> 00:07:35.142
They're stressed out the whole time.

00:07:35.142 --> 00:07:36.893
They want this whole
interaction to be over.

00:07:36.893 --> 00:07:39.560
But with this, you're not
afraid to ask the question.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.744
The question literally really is.

00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:44.114
You to to that, as Mark said there's
fourteen hundred videos, you're like,

00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:46.200
"You know what, I'm a little
shaky on negative numbers,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.791
"even though I'm in Calculus."

00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:50.256
There's no way in a traditional
classroom, that you'll have the guts

00:07:50.256 --> 00:07:53.732
to raise your hand and say,
"Wait, a negative times ...
why is that a positive?"

00:07:53.732 --> 00:07:54.390
(laughter)

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.154
You can't do that.

00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:56.527
(laughter)

00:07:56.527 --> 00:07:58.191
But YouTube you can kind
of pause a video and say,

00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:02.299
"Let me go watch a little video, just to
make sure I understand that properly."

00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:04.102
Any other things popped out?

00:08:04.102 --> 00:08:05.446
Right here.

00:08:11.232 --> 00:08:15.562
Yeah, so the comment was,
colors, I repeat a lot

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:18.441
and I cater to different learning styles.

00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:20.833
And I'll throw out another one
that I things that's related is

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:21.993
that you don't see me.

00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:25.197
You don't see the teacher.

00:08:25.197 --> 00:08:27.788
And I'll tell you, huh?

00:08:27.788 --> 00:08:28.788
But you can hear me, exactly.

00:08:28.788 --> 00:08:29.738
Exactly.

00:08:29.738 --> 00:08:31.341
And I'll tell you why I did it.

00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:33.502
I don't want to make it sound
like I'm this grand desiger

00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:36.344
and I had all of this
interesting ideas in mind.

00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:40.513
I did it initially because I
did not have a video camera.

00:08:40.513 --> 00:08:43.725
(laughter)

00:08:43.725 --> 00:08:48.020
And I thought, well, when I did
it with my cousins in New Orleans

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.731
they didn't see me either.

00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:51.514
But it seemed to be working with them.

00:08:51.514 --> 00:08:53.151
All they heard was my
voice on the speaker phone,

00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:54.650
and we had like a shared notepad.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.197
We were using Yahoo Doodle at the time.

00:08:56.197 --> 00:08:57.400
And if I wrote something,
they would see it.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.566
If they wrote something, I would see it.

00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:01.943
And we made the ... I just liked ...

00:09:01.943 --> 00:09:05.811
I don't know if there's a movement
against or for whiteboards,

00:09:05.826 --> 00:09:06.699
but I hate whiteboards.

00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:09.809
I think black is just like,
there's this emptiness.

00:09:09.809 --> 00:09:10.991
It's just like the universe.

00:09:10.991 --> 00:09:13.316
Then you can start kind of
putting in little bits of ...

00:09:13.316 --> 00:09:15.067
And it seems like such a
subtle thing, but for me,

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:17.340
like that one video where
you see the white background,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.230
it's kind of like a struggle for me.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.982
I need that clean,
literally a clean slate.

00:09:22.982 --> 00:09:25.476
But I did it because it
worked with my cousins,

00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:27.696
and I didn't have a video camera.

00:09:27.696 --> 00:09:31.746
But as soon as I put it out there
like that, the feedback I immediately

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:36.145
got from people on YouTube
is, it feels intimate.

00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:39.810
Even though they know that it's a
recording and I'm not really there,

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.022
they said it actually feels like
you're sitting next to me tutoring me.

00:09:44.022 --> 00:09:46.747
It doesn't feel like ... think
about the other experience where

00:09:46.747 --> 00:09:51.401
I'm all the way over here, at a
chalkboard, "and the next step,"

00:09:51.401 --> 00:09:54.904
and I'm projecting over
to you and you're distant.

00:09:54.904 --> 00:09:56.206
You're not in any way
connected to the the teacher.

00:09:56.206 --> 00:10:00.664
When you have kind of this voice
in your head, it feels intimate.

00:10:00.664 --> 00:10:02.428
Actually some people have
said it feels even more.

00:10:02.428 --> 00:10:03.911
It feels like, not only are
we sitting next to each other,

00:10:03.911 --> 00:10:06.569
it feels like you're actually in my brain.

00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:07.451
(laughter)

00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:10.067
That I'm ... and even more, I've
actually gotten several people

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:14.495
say that, "When I take the exam, as
soon as it ... when I think in other

00:10:14.495 --> 00:10:16.859
"domains I have a normal voice-

00:10:16.859 --> 00:10:17.689
(laughter)

00:10:17.689 --> 00:10:21.437
"but as soon as I see a calculus
problem, it's like, Well and the next.'"

00:10:21.437 --> 00:10:22.604
And you hear-

00:10:22.604 --> 00:10:23.097
(laughter)

00:10:23.097 --> 00:10:24.040
you-

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.470
(laughter)

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.563
So it's a ... any other notions?

00:10:26.563 --> 00:10:27.404
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:27.404 --> 00:10:29.815
Audience member: The audio is
consistent, unlike in a classroom,

00:10:29.815 --> 00:10:33.065
where the teacher turns
around and you can't hear.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.583
Salman: Oh yeah, no that's another
thing, that is actually one of

00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:37.654
motivations for doing it, is
I've looked, before I started

00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:38.842
I looked at a lot of this stuff.

00:10:38.842 --> 00:10:39.925
I'm not the first person
putting up videos.

00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:42.166
I looked at the MIT stuff,
which I think is great.

00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:44.155
And I was like, "Gee."

00:10:44.155 --> 00:10:46.496
The video camera was at that same seat.

00:10:46.496 --> 00:10:50.421
I went to MIT, and it's like
the same seat I used to sit in,

00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:53.239
and like fall asleep in.

00:10:53.239 --> 00:10:56.846
And sometimes ... I think
it's tremendous what they did.

00:10:56.846 --> 00:10:59.359
I don't know if anyone realizes the
history of this open course thing.

00:10:59.359 --> 00:11:01.738
In like two thousand or two
thousand one, it was all happening.

00:11:01.738 --> 00:11:04.565
Every other university was thinking of
a for-profit model distance learning.

00:11:04.565 --> 00:11:06.243
MIT said no, everything's for free.

00:11:06.243 --> 00:11:08.798
So I think it's like this
hugely awesome thing they did,

00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:12.818
but it's hard to see what's
going on in the classroom.

00:11:12.818 --> 00:11:15.995
And the other feedback I get is that,
the lecture is actually distracting.

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:18.440
We naturally want to engage with
the human eyes and the hands,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.457
and that's what you want to look at.

00:11:19.457 --> 00:11:20.651
You don't want to look at the math.

00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:22.742
And when the professor's
there, that's what you look at.

00:11:22.742 --> 00:11:24.927
And you get disengaged and all.

00:11:24.927 --> 00:11:25.824
Any other?

00:11:25.824 --> 00:11:26.407
Any other?

00:11:26.407 --> 00:11:27.176
Here.

00:11:27.176 --> 00:11:27.945
Audience member: Go at your own speed.

00:11:27.945 --> 00:11:28.714
Salman: Go at your own speed.

00:11:28.714 --> 00:11:29.849
Exactly.

00:11:29.849 --> 00:11:32.265
You can go exactly ... some people
have actually they've written

00:11:32.265 --> 00:11:34.104
little apps that actually
will speed up or slow down

00:11:34.104 --> 00:11:36.425
the actual without changing the pitch.

00:11:36.425 --> 00:11:38.262
Audience member: Well I
mean (unintelligible).

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:39.570
Oh yeah, exactly.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.673
Audience Member: You can go
slow of you can go quickly.

00:11:40.673 --> 00:11:41.946
Salman: And that's the
thing that shocked me,

00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:43.697
I thought this is for my cousins,
they can fill in their blanks.

00:11:43.697 --> 00:11:46.446
But over and over again, I got
letters from gifted students

00:11:46.446 --> 00:11:48.820
and parents, saying that this is
allowed my students ... and people with

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.068
learning disabilities that say that ...
and people with attention deficit disorder

00:11:52.068 --> 00:11:55.151
saying that ... and so it's all of these
things that just kind of fell into place.

00:11:55.158 --> 00:11:58.067
And I'll tell you kind of the
other thing I think makes it

00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:01.317
very different is, it's
just conversational.

00:12:01.317 --> 00:12:06.293
Some of it is because the form factor
is it feels like I'm next to you.

00:12:06.293 --> 00:12:09.646
I get to kind of chat about
it more with you as opposed to

00:12:09.646 --> 00:12:11.907
being pedantic and sitting at
a board, "and the next step."

00:12:11.907 --> 00:12:14.221
I can be very natural.

00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:18.984
A lot of people say how do
you prepare for these videos.

00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:19.898
Can I have a transcript?

00:12:19.898 --> 00:12:23.776
Can I have ... and what
I say is there is none.

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:27.444
When I turn on the video, it is
literally a chain of thought process.

00:12:27.444 --> 00:12:32.194
It isn't scripted in any
way, and I started doing that

00:12:32.194 --> 00:12:35.153
actually out of laziness.

00:12:35.153 --> 00:12:36.447
You know, it's for my
cousins what do I care.

00:12:36.447 --> 00:12:39.239
I actually have a few of the videos
I actually answer telemarketer calls

00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:40.247
during-

00:12:40.247 --> 00:12:41.246
(laughter)

00:12:41.246 --> 00:12:43.709
the video.

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:48.746
But the takeaway, all of these
things I have done out of laziness,

00:12:48.746 --> 00:12:50.296
I now can say oh, this
is brilliant and all,

00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:55.049
but the takeaway that people
love to see, and you never get to

00:12:55.049 --> 00:12:56.216
see it anywhere else.

00:12:56.216 --> 00:12:59.408
I mean, just like reflect back
on your entire education career.

00:12:59.408 --> 00:13:01.406
Everything you saw was
the finished product.

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.606
The professor when they
teach that concept to you,

00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:05.324
then had done that problem
twenty times before.

00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:06.696
They reviewed the solution manual,

00:13:06.696 --> 00:13:08.195
and they just give you
the finished product.

00:13:08.195 --> 00:13:10.073
They're just like, "Oh, you're an
idiot, if you just don't immediately

00:13:10.073 --> 00:13:12.109
"do step A, B, C, and D."

00:13:12.109 --> 00:13:13.743
But when you watch these videos,
and I guarantee you, like

00:13:13.743 --> 00:13:16.074
ninety five percent of the videos,
when I'm doing it on screen

00:13:16.074 --> 00:13:18.238
I have never seen the problem before.

00:13:18.238 --> 00:13:22.576
And every now and then, every
now and then I make mistakes.

00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:27.598
I forget a negative sign, or I go down
a path that was not the right path.

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:31.892
But ... this is probably the single
issue I get the most emails about.

00:13:31.892 --> 00:13:34.675
People say it's makes me
comfortable with mathematics.

00:13:34.675 --> 00:13:35.910
It allows me to see the art.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.673
It allows me to see someone who looks
like the know what they're doing,

00:13:39.673 --> 00:13:42.071
but they too stumble every now and then.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.365
They sometimes go down the wrong
path, and you can kind of see

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:47.821
out loud the thought process
of going through this.

00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:52.278
The one thing ... Mark's saying,
tell us about what you really think

00:13:52.278 --> 00:13:56.454
makes Khan Academy a standout,
and why it seems to have

00:13:56.454 --> 00:13:58.409
struck a chord with people.

00:13:58.409 --> 00:14:02.320
And I think it's kind of an
artifact of how my own brain works.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.073
I'm this ... I don't know whether
I was exposed to something,

00:14:05.073 --> 00:14:09.077
or this is just how I learned to
learn, but I'm almost, I cannot

00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:13.656
process anything unless it's distilled
down into really, really, really

00:14:13.656 --> 00:14:17.600
simple nuggets, and it's almost ...
it's almost obvious by the time ...

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.015
and it was almost difficult
when I was in school.

00:14:21.015 --> 00:14:23.004
If you just told me, gave
me a formula and said,

00:14:23.004 --> 00:14:24.993
"Just apply that formula,
steps A, B, and C,"

00:14:24.993 --> 00:14:26.984
I like, my brain just
starts, it can't do it.

00:14:26.984 --> 00:14:30.395
So I would fall behind in
class because I wanted to play

00:14:30.395 --> 00:14:32.937
with the equations and make
connections and understand

00:14:32.937 --> 00:14:36.902
why it was interesting and what's
it really saying about the universe.

00:14:36.902 --> 00:14:40.351
But later on obviously that
became a huge asset because

00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:42.741
in Eleventh grade when you get
exposed to a concept, you're like,

00:14:42.741 --> 00:14:46.445
"Oh, well I spent, I invested
all that time in Eighth grade,

00:14:46.445 --> 00:14:47.830
"and this concept that they're
saying is a new concept, that's just

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.621
that Eighth grade concept, and they're
just re-branding it a little bit,

00:14:50.621 --> 00:14:53.120
"now it just looks like this
Eleventh grade concept."

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.613
And while my peers are getting,
who are smarter than me,

00:14:56.613 --> 00:15:00.221
are getting stuck memorizing things,
and not knowing what they're doing,

00:15:00.221 --> 00:15:01.571
and then forgetting things the week after.

00:15:01.571 --> 00:15:03.225
I'm like this is frustrating.

00:15:03.225 --> 00:15:10.185
So, the single biggest goal in the
Khan Academy is to try to deliver

00:15:10.185 --> 00:15:12.323
things the way I wish
it was delivered to me.

00:15:12.323 --> 00:15:14.527
You get the intuition from the beginning.

00:15:14.527 --> 00:15:19.291
I will not make a video unless I
have a intuition on the concept.

00:15:19.306 --> 00:15:21.572
The best example is on entropy.

00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:23.696
I'm not like, you know ... when
I went through my education

00:15:23.696 --> 00:15:26.191
I wasn't this thermodynamics
jock, so I didn't really ...

00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:29.442
I could do the problems, and I
could get the question right,

00:15:29.442 --> 00:15:31.779
but I said I'm going to
make a video on entropy.

00:15:31.779 --> 00:15:36.122
I said I know the steps but none of
these textbooks are really doing the job,

00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:39.370
doing the trick, and really letting
me know what entropy really is.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.765
And I have just the suspicion that
it's not, they're not saying ...

00:15:41.765 --> 00:15:44.696
so I literally, I took two weeks
off, and I just pondered it,

00:15:44.696 --> 00:15:48.228
and I called every professor, every
buddy, everyone who I could talk to,

00:15:48.228 --> 00:15:50.445
and I'd say let's go have a
glass of wine about entropy.

00:15:50.445 --> 00:15:52.121
(laughter)

00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:55.074
And after about two weeks,
it clicked in my brain,

00:15:55.074 --> 00:15:58.528
I was like, "Now, I'm ready
to make a video on entropy."

00:15:58.528 --> 00:16:00.198
So if there's one takeaway
from the Khan Academy, is that

00:16:00.198 --> 00:16:03.777
it's just focused on,
narrowly focused on intuition.

00:16:03.777 --> 00:16:07.526
And just to show you, and to
really reinforce the point

00:16:07.526 --> 00:16:11.622
that I think, and it wasn't
obvious from the get go

00:16:11.622 --> 00:16:15.049
that this is not just a nice to have.

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:19.219
This isn't just something that might make
an A minus student, into an A student

00:16:19.219 --> 00:16:20.221
or an A plus student.

00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:24.362
I want to read some of the letters.

00:16:24.362 --> 00:16:26.279
And I get on the order of now,
I get like a couple hundred

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:30.096
letters a day from students,
and teachers, and home schoolers

00:16:30.096 --> 00:16:32.024
around the world now.

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:35.033
The content's actually being distributed
in offline services into Ethopia

00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:37.215
and places where they
can't even find teachers.

00:16:37.215 --> 00:16:41.278
But these comments, some of them
are nice and funny and simple,

00:16:41.278 --> 00:16:45.571
but some of them really speak to there's
a deep hunger for this type of thing,

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:47.033
and it's just not being addressed.

00:16:47.033 --> 00:16:49.193
This is a comment on a calculus video.

00:16:49.193 --> 00:16:52.031
"First time I smiled doing a derivative."

00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:54.165
(laughter)

00:16:54.165 --> 00:16:57.868
This person did a derivative,
and then they smiled.

00:16:57.868 --> 00:16:58.929
(laughter)

00:16:58.929 --> 00:16:59.684
They smiled.

00:16:59.684 --> 00:17:02.117
I remember EP calculus,
no one was smiling.

00:17:02.117 --> 00:17:03.545
(laughter)

00:17:03.545 --> 00:17:06.138
And then the next, the next comment,
this is in reply to that response,

00:17:06.138 --> 00:17:08.095
Same thing here.

00:17:08.095 --> 00:17:10.640
"I actually got a natural
high and a good mood

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.893
"for the entire day, since I
remember seeing all of this matrix

00:17:12.893 --> 00:17:17.370
"text in class, and here I'm
all like I know Kung Fo."

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.644
(loud laughter and applause)

00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:23.373
And the underlying theme here,
the underlying theme here,

00:17:23.373 --> 00:17:26.581
I used to think when I went though
my career, that only like math geeks,

00:17:26.581 --> 00:17:29.204
like me and Mark, we're
the only type of people

00:17:29.204 --> 00:17:31.257
that like to like understand things.

00:17:31.257 --> 00:17:34.451
And everyone else just wants to ...
but the takeaway here is that everyone,

00:17:34.451 --> 00:17:36.867
I don't care if whether you're
the math geek or whether you are

00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:39.189
the kid who's about to drop out,

00:17:39.189 --> 00:17:41.281
or you're the kid who thought
they hated mathematics.

00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:43.867
When you actually learn
something, really learn something,

00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:46.845
not just learn the steps
and jump through the hoops.

00:17:46.845 --> 00:17:50.523
When you really learn something,
it's arguably the highest high

00:17:50.523 --> 00:17:52.982
any human being can have.

00:17:52.982 --> 00:17:54.731
And you see it time ...
this is another one.

00:17:54.731 --> 00:17:56.389
This is an except.

00:17:56.389 --> 00:18:00.032
"My eldest kid is dancing around in
my room here because she is so excited

00:18:00.032 --> 00:18:03.206
"that she finally found someone
that teaches like this."

00:18:03.206 --> 00:18:06.173
She did a math problem,
and then she danced.

00:18:06.173 --> 00:18:12.371
(laughter)

00:18:12.371 --> 00:18:16.945
Now, this you know, I was working
as a analyst at a hedge fund,

00:18:16.945 --> 00:18:19.115
and the site traffic started to take off

00:18:19.115 --> 00:18:21.449
and I said, "Gee," you know I was
telling my wife "This is so exciting,

00:18:21.449 --> 00:18:24.469
"and I want to do this, and people are
writing me letters, but there's no,

00:18:24.469 --> 00:18:27.313
"it wasn't making ..."but you know I
said, "I have some savings, I could quit."

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:29.623
I was really on the edge about this,
I said "I really want to do this,

00:18:29.623 --> 00:18:30.351
"but I can't figure out ... "

00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:32.626
And then I got this letter.

00:18:32.626 --> 00:18:35.469
And this letter, and I'll
read an excerpt of it.

00:18:35.469 --> 00:18:39.316
It to me, I mean, I was like if I only
got this letter this would be worth it,

00:18:39.316 --> 00:18:41.317
but this is, there could be
a million people like this,

00:18:41.317 --> 00:18:42.567
and this person's the only
person, I mean it's ...

00:18:42.567 --> 00:18:47.373
"Mr. Khan, no teacher has ever done
me any good. This may sound harsh,

00:18:47.373 --> 00:18:50.196
"but I mean it quite literally. I
was forced on medication to keep

00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:54.110
"from talking and chastised for
not speaking when called on.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.624
"About five years ago my family
collected enough money to move from

00:18:56.624 --> 00:18:58.950
"where I was born, so I could
have chance at having an education

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.081
"and living a real life.

00:19:00.081 --> 00:19:03.464
"But without a real mastery of
elementary math I was slow to progress

00:19:03.464 --> 00:19:07.035
"I am now in college, and learning
more than I ever have in my life.

00:19:07.035 --> 00:19:09.724
"But an inadequate math background
has been holding me back,

00:19:09.724 --> 00:19:11.649
"I found the Khan
Academy in June of 2009."

00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:13.308
So it was like a year ago.

00:19:13.308 --> 00:19:16.356
"Right after I completed Math
141, a college Algebra course,

00:19:16.356 --> 00:19:18.873
"I spent the entire summer
on your YouTube page,

00:19:18.873 --> 00:19:21.282
"and I just wanted to thank you
for everything you're doing.

00:19:21.282 --> 00:19:22.622
"This is a God-send.

00:19:22.622 --> 00:19:25.227
"Last week I tested for a math
placement exam, and I'm now in

00:19:25.227 --> 00:19:26.574
Honors Math 200."

00:19:26.574 --> 00:19:28.480
Now this is the next sentence
is the one that really got me.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.569
This is on a placement exam.

00:19:29.569 --> 00:19:31.999
This is not on like the regular
exam you have in class where

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:35.284
you know what you're studying for,
this is like all of mathematics.

00:19:35.284 --> 00:19:37.537
This is on the placement exam,
the entrance placement exam.

00:19:37.537 --> 00:19:41.285
"No question was answered
incorrectly on the placement exam."

00:19:41.285 --> 00:19:44.453
This was a kid who had basic
deficiencies in mathematics,

00:19:44.453 --> 00:19:46.705
and they watched YouTube
videos for a summer,

00:19:46.705 --> 00:19:49.286
and they did not get one question wrong.

00:19:49.286 --> 00:19:51.037
"I can say without any doubt,
you've changed my life,

00:19:51.037 --> 00:19:52.537
and the lives of everyone in my family."

00:19:52.537 --> 00:19:54.914
I mean you read that, and you're
like screw the hedge fund world.

00:19:54.914 --> 00:19:57.346
(applause)

00:19:57.346 --> 00:19:57.723
Good (unintelligible).

00:19:57.723 --> 00:19:58.558
Thank all of you all.

00:19:58.558 --> 00:20:02.558
(applause)
