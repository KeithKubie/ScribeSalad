00:00:05.601 --> 00:00:06.801
Fisher: I'm Jeff Fisher,

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.434
and this is a short
introductory video

00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:12.033
on using the .Net Client Library
Google Data APIs.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.767
Let's get started.

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:16.234
First, you have to download
the SDK

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:20.033
from our code.google.com page
at this URL.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.200
I've already downloaded the SDK,
so let's install it.

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:33.634
For this demo, I'm using
Microsoft Visual C#

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.634
2008 Express Edition,
which is free

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.467
and a good way to get started.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.767
However, the SDK assumes
we're using Visual Studio 2005,

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:43.567
so we have to copy
the Project Templates.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:46.167
If you're using
Visual Studio 2005,

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.534
you don't have to do this step.

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:55.901
Now that we've done that,

00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.100
we can go ahead
and open Visual Studio.

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.300
Since we have these Templates,
printing a new project is easy.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.801
First go to New Project.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.067
We can create
a Google Picasa project

00:01:11.067 --> 00:01:13.734
with one click.

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:18.334
This creates a new blank project
with some code for us.

00:01:18.334 --> 00:01:22.100
It also creates a dialogue box
for the user to log in.

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:26.367
If you look at the code
behind this,

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:28.767
we first discuss some
of the high level principles

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:30.367
of our Client Library.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:33.767
The Client Library is organized
into the following components.

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:35.267
There is the Service Class,

00:01:35.267 --> 00:01:37.501
which deals with the connection
to the API.

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:40.000
There are Query Classes
which allow us to construct

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.267
particular queries
against the API.

00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:44.300
And there are also
Feed and Entry Classes

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.868
that contain the data model.

00:01:45.868 --> 00:01:47.334
In this simple example,

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:49.701
we first create
a new service class.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.968
Then we get our log-in
information

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:56.000
from the form provided
by the template.

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.868
And then we're able to create
a new AlbumQuery.

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:07.234
Then we get back a feed
of all the users' albums.

00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:09.968
Looping through this feed
gives us a number of entries

00:02:09.968 --> 00:02:11.767
which contain information
about each album

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.567
that the user has.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.934
We are then able to update
a GUI element

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:17.734
with information
about these albums

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:19.534
and display it to the user.

00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:21.868
Let's run this example.

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:26.334
First I have to log in.

00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:33.300
And now you can see each
of the albums in my test account

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.934
along with the number of photos
that are in each album.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.934
That's a simple way
to get started.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:43.467
But perhaps you want a more
detailed code example to copy.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:50.200
For that, we can go
into the SDK directory

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.367
in our start menu
and open up the Sample solution.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.133
Again,
since we're using 2008,

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:02.734
we have to quickly convert
the existing solution.

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.901
Now that we've done that,
we can see that there are

00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.868
a number of samples
provided for us.

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:13.901
The first one I'd like to show
is the Photo Browser.

00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:17.133
This is an advanced form
of the demo that we saw earlier.

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:27.634
Again, we have to log in.

00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:36.701
Again, we see the list
of albums,

00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:38.801
but this time,
we can see the album cover

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.067
and double-click to see
each photo inside of the album.

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:45.200
All of this code
is open source

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.901
and available for you to use
in your own applications.

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:51.901
One other sample
I'd like to show you

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:53.133
is the DocList Uploader.

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.434
Go ahead and set this
as a StartUp Project.

00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:04.567
This sample allows us to quickly
log in to Google Docs...

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:11.534
See our existing Docs,
open them,

00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:14.200
and also upload new ones
by dragging and dropping.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.634
Again, this sample
is Open Source,

00:04:16.634 --> 00:04:18.400
and you can see
all of the code.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.534
Now that we've gone through
some of the samples

00:04:23.534 --> 00:04:25.734
and gotten you started
compiling your own application,

00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:28.067
let's talk about some of
the resources that are available

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:30.133
to help you develop.

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:31.667
All of our resources
are available

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:33.467
on code.google.com

00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:36.767
starting at the Project Page
of the .net Client Library.

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:38.834
Besides downloading the SDK,

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:42.400
you can also view
the documentation.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.734
The documentation includes
a Javadoc style reference

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:50.567
for all of the classes,
members, constructors...

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:53.734
and objects used
in the Client Library.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:00.467
We also have a number
of Developer Guides

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:02.334
for each particular API

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.734
that walk you through
each operation

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:06.734
that can be performed.

00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:09.901
Lastly, if you have
any questions,

00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:13.701
we have a discussion group
available

00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.868
for you to ask any questions,
concerns,

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:18.767
or request any features that
are not currently available.

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:20.601
Thanks for watching this video.

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:23.000
I hope that you'll create
some interesting applications

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.801
and share them with us.
