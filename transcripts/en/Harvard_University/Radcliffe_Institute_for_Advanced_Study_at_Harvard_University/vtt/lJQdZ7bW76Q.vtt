00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.790
-Welcome back.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.581
It's a great crowd.

00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:13.860
It was great this
morning-- still great now.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.890
I apologize that Ron
Sullivan is not here

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.830
to introduce Greg Hampikian,
but I am thrilled to do so.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.070
You've got his bio
in your program.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.590
He is a professor of
biology and criminal justice

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.770
from Boise State University
and founder and director

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.120
of the Idaho Innocence
Project and has

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.620
been involved in forensic
DNA testimony and cases

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.880
like those of Amanda
Knox and Sarah Pierce,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.370
that I'm sure will
have heard of.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.110
He is a true Renaissance man.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.620
This is quite a bio-- also
an award-winning playwright

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.460
and a fellow of the National
Academy of Inventors.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.290
He holds patents
for power generation

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.170
and a miniature pump using
magnetic shape memory

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.010
alloys, whatever that is.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.420
This cannot help to be a
fascinating talk, so Greg,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.926
please welcome.

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:09.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.910
-First of all, happy
wrongful convictions day.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.310
Honestly, that's what today is.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.990
It's the first time the
International Innocence

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.990
Network has decided to
declare this that day.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.770
And another coincidence is
that four years ago today, I

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.590
was at my home in
Boise, actually

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.840
just flying out
to CNN in Atlanta

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.360
because we were going to hear
about Amanda Knox's appeal.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.890
So she had lost at trial.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.870
She had been incarcerated
for four years in Italy.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.860
At that point, I'd been working
on the case for three years,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.610
I think.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.630
And we were going to hear
the judge would free her.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.110
And her sister just
posted on Facebook

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.520
that tomorrow's the
anniversary of that release.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.420
So it's great to be here to
talk a little bit about DNA

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.530
and especially something
that I do a lot of now, which

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.260
is post-conviction testing, that
is, people who claim innocence

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.470
and write to us.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.720
I work at the Idaho
Innocence Project.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.990
I volunteer as the
director over there.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.770
But I helped start
the one in Ireland,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.280
worked with the Georgia one and
really all over the world now.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.990
Because I'm the
only scientist who's

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.970
the director of one of
these organizations,

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.900
they send me all the really
hard cases, hopeless ones

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.520
that take a long time to solve.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.970
And enjoy that work quite a bit.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.110
So I'm going to talk
about some advances in DNA

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.240
and I'm going to talk about
some problems with DNA,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.140
because I'm a bit
of a person who

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.950
likes to hunt down problems.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.480
Last time I was at
Harvard-- I think

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.190
this was the last time-- I was
here for an Innocence Network

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.900
meeting.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.640
And the three
gentleman in the front

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.780
here are three men whose cases
I worked on for the Georgia

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.320
Innocence Project, just to
show you that it doesn't all

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.000
stay in the lab.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.990
And one of the people in this
picture actually was a student

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.240
and helped free two of
them as his internship.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.890
Most people who
volunteer with us

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.300
leave very disappointed,
because as I say,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.100
these cases can take
10 years and they want

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.490
to stick around for six months.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.550
People always ask
about death row.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.660
And Charles Fain, from my state,
I did not work on his case

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.170
but was spent 18
years on death row

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.690
for the rape and
murder of a little girl

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.060
nearby near where I
live and DNA got him

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.430
out-- mitochondrial DNA
got him out of prison.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.840
But if we speedily dispatched
the justice system,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.920
people do tire of
justice taking so long--

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.640
Charles Fain is not one
of those people-- he

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.700
would have been killed.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.440
The average time on death
row is over nine years

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.260
before someone is exonerated.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.020
So a lot of these people
that are being killed,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.207
of course the network
groups do not get

00:03:52.207 --> 00:03:53.290
involved with their cases.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.255
We don't know how many innocent
people have been killed.

00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:59.130
So I want to show you
one of the great things

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.320
that DNA can do and
one of the things

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.590
that we don't do so well.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.720
So I was talking with some
computer science people

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.800
last night at supper and they
said, one of the things people

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.870
do better than machines is
facial recognition, still.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.432
And that's true up
until this point,

00:04:13.432 --> 00:04:15.140
though there's been
a lot of improvement.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.480
So this is a standard lineup.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.260
This is actually a lineup that
John White here in the center

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.019
was called for.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.700
He was working.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.130
They said, can you come in?

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.920
There's been a rape.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.370
An older woman who was 74 had
been raped in the neighborhood

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.470
and beaten.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.840
And they said, look, we can
just get this over quickly.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.381
She's going to go
through the lineup.

00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:35.662
He said sure, came in.

00:04:35.662 --> 00:04:37.620
They're like, where do
you want to stand, John?

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.740
He's like, right in the middle.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.900
Let her get a good look.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.270
And she picked him.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.830
And so that was 1980.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.830
The student that I showed
you in the first slide

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.260
worked on this case.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.170
And we actually got John White
out just a few years ago.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.190
And when we got him
out, we got a hit

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.040
to the database of
the actual rapist

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.730
or whoever left the semen
on this woman who was raped.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.280
And we were very excited.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.830
We got the name.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.474
And the student said,
I've seen that name.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.390
And I thought, well, a
lot of people write us.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.580
And some of those
people are guilty.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.440
So maybe this guy
wrote us from prison.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.630
He was in the system.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.546
That's why his DNA
was in the system.

00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:19.170
He said no, I know
it's from somewhere.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.620
So he went through all
the stacks of information

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.660
that we had on this
case and found out

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.150
that James Edward Parham,
by absolute coincidence,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.175
happened to be there
at the jail that day.

00:05:31.175 --> 00:05:32.300
They stuck him in a lineup.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.160
They're like, you're
just a filler.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.070
If she picks you,
don't worry about it.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.710
You're not a suspect.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.120
That's how bad we are
at facial recognition,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.490
even though we're better
than the computers.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.080
So DNA cleared this up.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.540
And so I want to say,
yay, DNA is great.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.320
And then I'll talk about
some of the problems.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.500
So imagine that we can find
a gene that causes crime

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.180
and we could just eliminate
that gene from the gene pool

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.880
somehow.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.120
That's kind of a
part of what I posit

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.130
in the piece I wrote for the
New York Times that was titled

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.880
by them, "Men: Who
Needs Them?" which got

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.332
me hate mail from men's groups.

00:06:10.332 --> 00:06:11.790
And I was like,
where were you when

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.390
I was an angry divorced man?

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.760
So anyway, these are
mostly guys who've

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.472
lost custody battles
who were very upset.

00:06:19.472 --> 00:06:21.430
There was only one I
turned over to the police,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.970
but I got hundreds
of these letters.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.080
And I was just talking about
the Y chromosome and the fact

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.260
that most of my clients in
prison for violent crimes

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.080
are men.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.390
And so we have the gene.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.550
Well, we know where it is.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.320
It's on the Y chromosome,
if there's a gene.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.610
And should we do
anything about it?

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.570
But mostly I was
extolling the virtues

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.790
of the female half
of our species,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.900
which I consider the
only living half.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.710
I think the men-- we only give
three picograms to that baby.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.200
She's losing bone mass.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.260
And if you added up all the
mass of the male contribution

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.030
to humanity from the beginning,
all these millions of years

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.740
we're talking about, it's
less than a teaspoon.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.430
So anyway, I'd recommend
you take a look at that

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.930
if you want.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.670
But the way I got
into forensics was

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.760
I was working on the Y
chromosome in marsupials.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.730
So I titled this
"DNA is Universal:

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.540
From Fruit Fly Eye Color"--
which I worked on at University

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.310
of Connecticut, down
the road, for my Ph.D.,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.350
as part of my Ph.D.--
"to Murder and Rape."

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.910
And "marsupial sex
determination,"

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.670
I threw in there because
that's what I did in between.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.276
I went to Australia-- thank
you very much, taxpayers--

00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:32.900
on a National Science
Foundation grant,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.130
to study marsupial
sex determination

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.249
and was part of the group
that I've found SRY,

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:40.540
the sex-determining region,
our collaborators in London

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.970
did-- turned a female blastocyst
mouse into a male mouse.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.180
And that allowed me to give
talks all over the world.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.560
It was a lot of fun.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.980
Then I became a house husband
after that for a while

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.190
to take care of our kids.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.900
So I learned a little bit about
what a lot of women go through.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.640
But because of the Y chromosome
work, I started getting calls,

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.620
could we identify a stain as
male or female if it was spit?

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.850
Now, this was 1990.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.660
And I though, well, yeah,
we could do that using SRY,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.974
or blood or anything else.

00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:13.640
And so I started
consulting a little bit

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.200
in crime in the early '90s.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.990
And just to show you how
universal all this is, the eye

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.500
color of drosophila,
this is a kit developed,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.780
the IrisPlex system by Manfred
Kaiser and others in his group,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.940
that now we can look at a
stain, because of their work

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.360
and others, and tell what eye
color, it is if it's light blue

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.400
and if it's dark brown.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.390
Now, the hazel people you give
us a little bit of a problem.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.570
And to show you just how
sensitive all these tests are,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:47.610
it's the single loci,
these single areas

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.930
of the genome where just single
base changes can make changes

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.809
in eye color that
are predictable.

00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:56.850
And so we used to go to
all the forensic meetings

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.250
and they'd scan our eyes
and they'd take our DNA

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.570
and they built this database.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.060
And apparently it's very good.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.630
I have not seen
this used in court

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.150
or in any crime solving yet.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.930
But it's a pretty
robust kit and has

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.450
been reviewed over and over.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.440
So my lab got involved with
some of the newer technology

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440
as well.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.780
My mother lived
in Paris and so I

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.910
got to know some
gendarmes as young folk

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.870
and then they went on and became
fairly important in the police

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.810
departments.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.570
And they called me
about a case that

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.340
had languished for 10
years where a woman was--

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.020
she made a 911 call
and all you can hear

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.610
is her screams and
then a couple of men.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.350
And then they found
her body burned,

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.370
but some semen was recovered.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.670
They got a full hit.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.190
I mean, they got a full profile.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.560
Every bit of the DNA that
they wanted to measure,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.360
they measured, put it
into the French database,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.420
nope-- no hits.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.769
So no criminal was
already in the database.

00:09:55.769 --> 00:09:57.310
And they called me
up and said, look,

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.185
we've heard something
about familial testing.

00:09:59.185 --> 00:10:01.150
Nobody's tried it in
continental Europe.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.520
They've done it in England.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.530
Do you think we
could do it here?

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.670
We don't have the software.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.880
And so I hooked them
up with some friends

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.380
who had the software.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.035
It got all the way up to the
president's level in France

00:10:13.035 --> 00:10:14.410
and the president
said, no, we're

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:18.840
not going to do familial
testing in France.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.350
And so I said, well,
there's one other trick.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.130
And if you just set the
dial on the match stringency

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.180
that the FBI software
has, the CODIS,

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.450
you could just set it for
a half match, basically.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.380
Don't find me a perfect match.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.480
Find me half of the chromosome
markers that are in common.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.230
Who would that be?

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.310
Dad, son-- right.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.960
And so that's what they did.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.160
And I thought you probably
got 1,800,000 in the database.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.150
I had no idea.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.764
I'm not very good with the math.

00:10:47.764 --> 00:10:49.680
I didn't how many hits
they were going to get.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.830
But I thought we'd get
at least a few dozen.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.560
Turned out we got just one hit.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.740
So this is just part
of what the crime was,

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.800
the facts of the crime.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.200
They had a condom
with some semen

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.930
recovered, cigarette butts,
nothing for 10 years.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:09.950
1,800,000 convicted
offenders and arrestees,

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.140
and we got one hit.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.630
We then confirmed that with a
male-only Y chromosome test,

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.450
then got a sample from
the putative mother, found

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.260
out all the missing alleles
were there, and found out

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.500
that the person that it
matched as a potential would

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.550
be a son of this guy.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.030
And he had a son about the
right age who had died,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.780
Gregory Wiart, and
he died in 2003.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.340
And so before they
exhumed the body--

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.582
I'm guessing that they tapped
all the phones and found out

00:11:43.582 --> 00:11:46.040
when they started digging up
the body, who was making phone

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.030
calls among his old friends.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.280
They got a voiceprint
or a voice expert

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.440
to identify the voice
of one of the friends.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.880
And they think that was the
second voice on the 911 call.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.690
So that's the way these
things are starting to evolve.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.990
And even if you were
not in the database,

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.750
even if you're not
in family tree,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.500
whatever, eventually
we'll be able to find you.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.570
We'll just reconstruct
the missing bits

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.029
and for the purposes
of identification,

00:12:13.029 --> 00:12:14.570
we will probably be
able to find you.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.840
Right now, we need to
confirm it with actual tests.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.420
Something new that
we got involved

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.330
with-- I have a very
similar case in Idaho.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.530
Chris Tapp was a man who was
interrogated for 35 hours.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.960
I think-- was it Dateline
who did the show?

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.960
One of the big shows came
in and did the story.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.840
Anyway, and after
all those hours,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.970
they offered him a
deal if he would just

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.690
say who the other guy was,
because the DNA didn't

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.480
match crisp.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.189
But they thought
maybe he knew it was.

00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:40.980
If he would just say
who the other guy was,

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.460
they would give him
no time in prison.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.090
And so they'd been
interrogating him for 35 hours,

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.250
telling him the
name of this guy,

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.310
and so he gave them the name.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.310
They tested the guy
and it wasn't a match.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.940
They came back.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.194
They said, Chris, it wasn't him.

00:12:56.194 --> 00:12:56.860
Who else was it?

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.160
So he mentioned everybody they
mentioned in this small town

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.220
during the interrogation.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.140
They tested 54 people, I think.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.644
Chris was crying
at the end, saying,

00:13:05.644 --> 00:13:07.560
I'll give you my mother
if you think it's her.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.670
Who do you think it is?

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.650
Anyway, so they revoked
his deal and charged him

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.350
with murder and rape, even
though the DNA on the semen,

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.100
on a dead girl's body,
didn't match him.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.990
And we've tested things
since then-- pubic hairs,

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.200
we've had them tested, that
were found on her face,

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.450
et cetera, et cetera,
clothing that they tested--

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.890
everything matches one guy not
in the Idaho criminal database.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.320
So working with the
police, we suggested,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.610
what about looking for the
last name of the semen?

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.760
Treat the semen like an adopted
child looking for its daddy.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.360
And so they did that.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.974
I think they used methods that
maybe I wouldn't have used.

00:13:47.974 --> 00:13:49.390
And it's been a
bit controversial.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:54.290
But they did genealogy testing,
got the last name of someone,

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:55.160
tested that person.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:55.877
It wasn't him.

00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:57.710
And that shows you the
problem we then have.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.040
We have to go to the
papers, the paperwork

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.654
and find out who else is
related to that Y chromosome.

00:14:03.654 --> 00:14:05.820
But that's the kind of thing
that's going to happen.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.361
And I think it was mentioned if
everybody was in the database

00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:13.320
eventually, how much easier
all this stuff would be.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.180
This is kind of
the results you get

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.530
when you do that type
of search of publicly

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:19.630
available databases.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.640
But sometimes you get people who
don't want their name listed.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.670
And so you won't
get a last name.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.340
And a court order was
used in that case,

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.280
in the case I talked about.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.480
Some basic DNA-- let's look
at how it's done just really

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:35.980
quickly.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.850
Here's this cell.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.150
Hopefully, you've
seen one before.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.370
That's the nucleus.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.435
This is a gigantic mitochondria.

00:14:42.435 --> 00:14:43.310
They're not that big.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.180
There could be 1,000
of them in the cell.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.850
We get them only from Mommy.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.240
Like I said, Mommy
gives us everything.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.050
Daddy gave us a
little bit of sperm

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.820
and he's actually
not even there when

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.490
the nucleus enters the egg.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.590
He's already gone.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.310
It happens a day later or so.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.960
But anyway, the mitochondria
come only from Mom.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.690
There's thousands of them, or
thousands sometimes of them.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.820
So we can even get mitochondrial
DNA from a broken hair.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.640
Mitochondrial DNA
was famously used

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.530
to identify the unknown
in the Tomb of Unknown

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.890
from the Vietnam War.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.770
So there is no unknown
from the Vietnam War.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.300
And the family had to
fight to get that done.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.170
The military resisted.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.530
But anyway, that tomb is now
not only unknown, it is empty.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.640
We get our DNA from swabs.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.460
I carry them in my
bag wherever I go.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.540
And basically it's a
Q-tip type of thing.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.280
And the cells look like this
unless they're sperm cells.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.910
Sperm cells are really tough.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.534
They have a
disulfide head and so

00:15:38.534 --> 00:15:40.450
we can separate them
from all the other cells.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.350
It's the only type of
cell we can separate.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.940
And so that's how
in a sexual assault

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.314
we can get what
we call the male,

00:15:46.314 --> 00:15:49.420
profile all the
male contributors.

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.060
And we don't care about
the three billion bases.

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.769
We only want to know
the size of 13 areas--

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:58.310
how big a piece you've got in
the sperm, how big piece you've

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.934
got in the egg.

00:15:58.934 --> 00:16:01.650
So for several of the
chromosomes, we do that.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.632
If we have 13 of those
areas, just the size

00:16:03.632 --> 00:16:05.465
from Mom, the size for
Dad, and their number

00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:09.130
is, like, five, seven--
very, very simple numbers.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:10.250
We know those sizes.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.710
We can find you.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:12.720
So there's the cell.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.230
We magnify it a few hundred
times, again, a few hundred

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.770
more times.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.150
If we could see the
bases, it'd be like this.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.750
And we're just going
to amplify this

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.360
with something called
polymerase chain reaction that

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.330
won the Nobel Prize
for Kary Mullis.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.460
Here are the 13 areas that
the FBI currently requires.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.840
They're going to be
expanding soon to over 20.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.940
But these are the chromosomes.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.880
And chromosomes are
nice because they

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.914
were discovered before
anyone really knew how

00:16:39.914 --> 00:16:41.080
they were working very well.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.800
So the big one is called
1, the less bigger one 2.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.300
There's one actually
kind of out of order.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.200
And then you have
the X and Y here.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.780
Is this a man or a woman?

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.530
It's a man, right?

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.500
Y chromosome.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.590
So if we have a Y
chromosome for humans,

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.415
we're generally a man, unless
you have a mutation in SRY

00:16:59.415 --> 00:17:02.000
or a couple of other genes.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.200
All right, here's the data.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.480
Ready?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.045
I want to teach you how
to read one of these.

00:17:05.045 --> 00:17:06.560
This is called an
electropherogram.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.790
Can you say electropherogram?

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.800
electropherogram.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.079
Great-- you're on your
way to testifying.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:17.109
So now those areas, those 13
areas, this is one of them

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:17.650
right here.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.800
This is from chromosome 3.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.210
And you see the
size is 16 and 17,

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.040
so Mom and Dad had
two different sizes

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.420
that they gave this person.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.290
So this is another
location on a chromosome.

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.774
Mom and Dad gave the
same size there, 15.

00:17:29.774 --> 00:17:31.190
And that's why the
peak is higher.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.590
It means there's more DNA.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.930
Here's another one, size 21, 22.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.260
When I find then the
frequency of the 16 allele

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.530
in the population, I can
multiply it by the 17 allele

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.400
and I can find out how often
I would expect this profile

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.910
to come up in the population.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.180
That's the statistic
I would use.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.800
So this is a single contributor,
no more than two peaks

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.720
at any one locus, location.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.710
Now, let's talk about
some of the problems.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.170
I'm very concerned about
the problems in DNA,

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.260
because I think we're
having a large number

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.890
of wrongful prosecutions
with DNA mixtures,

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.370
where there are
mixtures, or whether it's

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.630
very small amounts of DNA
like in Amanda Knox's case.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.220
And she was convicted based
on a very small amount of DNA

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.820
that they found on
a knife blade that

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.370
was consistent with the victim.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.760
And Amanda's DNA
was on the handle.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.910
We said that that DNA
on the knife blade

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.490
was spurious, probably
a contaminant.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.130
It was never repeated.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.740
It was below the level
of DNA the FBI would even

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.770
look at at the time, or any
of the labs I worked with.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.840
And that lab hadn't
been-- the Italian lab

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.940
hadn't been accredited
yet, certainly not to work

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.760
with that low template DNA.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.890
So just because
there's DNA doesn't

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.610
mean that it's good science.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:55.092
Report language can be very
weird and be very biased.

00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:56.550
For example, you
can call something

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.320
a profile when there are
several people in it.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.600
So you can say the profile
matches the client.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.070
But there's actually several
people in the profile.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.050
And oftentimes, that
lack of a plural

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.830
confuses members of the jury.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.694
And then we can talk about
statistics and DNA transfer,

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:13.360
if there's time.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.200
I'll get through as
much of this as I can.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.920
Peter Gill, one of the
great experts in our field,

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.880
has said, if you show 10
colleagues a DNA mixture,

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.120
you'll probably end up
with 10 different answers.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.706
You won't hear any
experts say that

00:19:26.706 --> 00:19:28.830
on the stand who's coming
in for the state, though.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.590
They'll just say
this was a match.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.820
Here's my calculation.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.570
But all of us in the field
know that this is a problem.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.070
We didn't know how big a
problem until [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.080
and myself did a study and
now John Butler at NIST

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:43.760
has followed up.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.350
And I think they're
very telling,

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.683
and I'll show you what they are.

00:19:46.683 --> 00:19:49.500
So this is what a
mixture looks like.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.850
In any case, there's
lots of peaks here.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.930
And there's three peaks
here, so it's obviously

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.250
more than one person.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.410
So what happened was with
that data from that slide,

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.900
we took that data-- it's
an actual case where

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.650
I have-- there's
a man in prison,

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:05.980
Kerry Robinson in Georgia.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.160
I believe he's innocent.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.380
He was convicted of being in a
gang rape, a guy whose DNA was

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:15.020
perfectly in that sample
from that poor girl

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.640
and who admitted to shooting
people and to raping her,

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.960
then was offered a deal.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.620
Tell us who the other
guy was, we'll knock 8,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.000
10 years off your
sentence, whatever it was.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.700
So he said, Kerry, and he
gave a wrong last name,

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.150
and then, like, Kerry Robinson.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.320
And so they went and
arrested Kerry Robinson,

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.680
a guy he didn't like.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.640
And Kerry's like,
I didn't do it.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.650
All they have is evidence
for Kerry Robinson.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:40.820
The woman who was raped
picked the other guy out,

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.530
didn't pick Kerry out.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.620
All they had for
evidence was the word

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.400
of this guy who
was making the deal

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.960
and a corroboration of the
DNA scientist who said,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.940
I can't exclude Kerry
Robinson from that mixture.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.050
I think he's excluded.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.350
Eric Carita, who was at
the Connecticut Crime Lab,

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.680
thought he was excluded.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.040
And Fox News in Atlanta did a
story on it and I said, look,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.830
this is a statistics problem.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.080
But I think we can explain it.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.860
I said, swab four people.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.000
Here are swabs.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.950
Four of your
reporters, swab them.

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.810
They swabbed them
and I did the DNA.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.270
All of them were included,
according to the GBI.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.470
So we took that data and
we gave it to 17 scientists

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.310
at a accredited North American
crime lab and asked them,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.970
is this profile
included, excluded,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.280
or you cannot conclude,
is inconclusive?

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.340
We gave them no
contextual information.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.502
And most importantly, we
didn't allow them to talk.

00:21:32.502 --> 00:21:33.960
Like, if I allowed
you to talk, you

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.020
might all decide I'm
giving a good talk, right?

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.390
But there's 15 of you in
here who think I'm terrible.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.190
We do this
groupthink-- maybe 10.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.270
We do this groupthink and
we come to conclusions.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.360
Oftentimes, you do a
straw poll of a jury,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.610
they find the client innocent.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.820
By the end of the day--
that's their first straw

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.570
poll-- by the end of
day they can convict.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:57.010
We process things
socially different

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.870
than we do when we're alone.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.860
And so we did the study
and out of those 17,

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.350
only one scientist
at that lab agreed

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.470
with the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation--

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.419
only one of the 17.

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:09.710
And we published it in a
peer-reviewed journal, Science

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:10.610
and Justice.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:11.710
And it got a lot of press.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.310
So The Economist
picked up on it.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.790
New Scientist picked up on it.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.610
One out of 17--
I'll just skip that.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.110
So then I had a lawyer write
the head of the Georgia

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.760
Bureau of Investigations
DNA, like,

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.780
what rules are you
actually applying?

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.590
Because it seemed like even if
you had one allele in common

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.400
with all of those
markers, just one--

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.860
and I have one in just
about every case I'm with,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.340
they would say you
cannot be excluded.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.470
And in fact, what the
head-- you can't read this--

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.560
but what George Herrin
said was even if there

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.200
are no alleles in the
evidentiary sample

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.860
consistent with or matching
those observed in the subject's

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.500
known DNA profile, no
alleles with the evidence,

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.060
this does not constitute
a conclusive exclusion

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.199
of the subject, since
the absence of evidence

00:22:55.199 --> 00:22:57.240
is not the equivalent of
the evidence of absence.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.500
What this means in
practical terms is,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.750
anybody who wants to reduce
their sentence could point

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:08.250
to any of you in the room and if
you had zero DNA in common with

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.730
the evidence, that would
be a corroborating fact,

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.900
because you cannot be excluded.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.410
That's all it takes.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.770
So while I can understand how
George might have said this--

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.050
like, what he's trying
to say is, I can't say--

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.240
he should have said
it's indeterminate,

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.180
it's inconclusive-- not,
it's cannot exclude,

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.280
which in DNA language--
he should know--

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:32.330
in DNA language means
you're included.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:35.769
So there were no stats
used in the report that

00:23:35.769 --> 00:23:36.810
convicted Kerry Robinson.

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.480
Thank goodness 2010,
the scientific working

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.390
group on DNA analysis
and methodology

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.410
says, you have to
have statistics.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:44.670
Hurray, we all say.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.454
Now there's going to be science.

00:23:47.454 --> 00:23:49.120
So John Butler at the
National Institute

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.050
of Standards of Technology does
something like what we did.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.600
He starts a study in
2005, actually before we

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.300
did, and just
gives the same data

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.880
to a bunch of volunteer crime
labs all over the country.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.420
They pick out the right people.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.270
And then he asked
them for a stack.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.080
Give me a matched statistic.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.460
Now, when you go to court,
you have damage to your bumper

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.000
and you have to have
two receipts generally,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.750
one for $30, one maybe
for $45-- the judge

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.420
chooses the one in the middle.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.350
With DNA, he gave
the same DNA and what

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.010
did the stats look like?

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.500
These are the stats
for one of the samples.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.470
And the conclusion was some of
the labs had it at 10 to the 5

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.660
and some had it at 10 to 15.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.660
There were 10
orders of magnitude.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.210
That's a difference between
a $30 damage to your bumper

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.800
and a $300 billion damage.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.960
So you should get
the $150 billion,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.870
minus, give or take, $30.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.000
So that was 2005.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.740
2013, we've published our paper.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.840
I thought, finally they're
going to do something

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.830
about these mixtures.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.240
I've been talking with
John Butler at NIST

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.960
and asked him to redo the
study-- please, please, please.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.264
He always intended to.

00:24:57.264 --> 00:24:59.430
And please, please, please,
publish your last study.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.360
He never did.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.250
I'm hoping he'll
publish this one.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.540
And they had five
different cases in 2013.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.360
They sent the same data out
to all these volunteer labs.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.530
So four person mixture,
four people from John's lab

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.970
add DNA to this thing and
they pretend it's a ski mask,

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.130
send the data out
to all these labs.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.810
They also send the labs, two
of the lab people's profile who

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.550
were actually in the mixture
and one person who wasn't.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:27.350
And they say, who's in,
who's out, give us a stat.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:32.490
108 labs-- C is the person
who is not in there.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.800
Out of 108 labs, only
seven excluded C. You

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.150
could go to prison for the
rest your life on a mixture.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.260
And this is the kind
of nonsense that's

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.820
actually going on in this
country and all over the world.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.010
This is not science the way
it's supposed to be done.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.050
And DNA got a pass when the
National Academy of Sciences

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.654
looked at all of the
forensic sciences.

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:56.820
They didn't like bite marks.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.295
They criticized
fingerprints because they

00:25:58.295 --> 00:25:59.211
don't have a database.

00:25:59.211 --> 00:25:59.900
They love DNA.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.080
And I was just very upset
that day when that came out.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.250
So out of those
labs, 76 of the 108

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.010
included the person
who wasn't in it

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:10.920
and provided a match statistic.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.910
The match statistics
weren't like, 1 in 10,

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:14.740
could be anybody.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.020
It was one in nine for some
labs-- could be anybody--

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.090
to one in 344,000 that I
guarantee you would convict.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.410
Where else does this happen?

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.860
This is Taiwan, Taiwan
Association of Innocence,

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.980
a new organization, came to
one of the national meetings

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.840
in 2013.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.750
They were telling me
about this guy who

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:40.720
was arrested because there were
two escorts who had been raped

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.750
in a warehouse and this guy had
an interest in the warehouse.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.330
There were three suspects.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.610
Two of them were convicted
in 2010, so a year later.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.800
And then they start
prosecuting Mr. Chen also, who

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.830
says he was innocent,
never had consensual sex.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.430
The other guy said they had
consensual sex with the women.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.839
So here's the Y chromosome
profile from the underwear.

00:27:01.839 --> 00:27:03.130
This is the victim's underwear.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.120
This is a typical
way we work a case.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.470
These are just locations
on the Y chromosome

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.716
and what size DNA
each person has.

00:27:10.716 --> 00:27:14.850
So that's Mr. Chen, Suspect 1,
Suspect 2 who were convicted.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.200
And as you see, at the first
location, Chen is a 15.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.140
What's the underwear?

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.290
15, so it's a match.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.950
Any time I say
match, my students

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:28.134
have to say statistic--
so match, statistic.

00:27:28.134 --> 00:27:29.800
Actually we can't
calculate it for this.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.230
But that's probably, let's
say, 1 in 10 for the purpose

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:33.990
I'm going to put here.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.690
A 12 allele, they're all 12s.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.880
Well, there's 12
in the underwear.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.910
We go through-- guess what?

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.790
Poor Mr. Chen, he's
in the underwear.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:44.710
It's a match.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.210
That's now statistically
pretty robust.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.520
We have all of those
parts of the Y chromosome.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.910
In fact, that's the entire kit.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.490
We can't go any further.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:53.490
What do we say?

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.380
I said to the
people, why don't we

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.190
see if we can do more
locations on the Y chromosome.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:59.790
Maybe he'll be excluded later.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:03.810
So they go to court
and more of this date.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.730
So he's guilty in 2012.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.830
His appeal's denied, 2013,
we take the case, 2013.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:13.680
And we go to court and the
Taiwan lab worker said,

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.820
we have a new test.

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.070
It's got more loci.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.711
It's got six new
locations in addition

00:28:18.711 --> 00:28:20.460
to the other ones that
were already there.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.690
And there's Mr. Chen.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.260
He's a 17.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.870
He's excluded at two
of the locations.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.350
There's Mr. Chen.

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.970
And finally I got
to meet Mr. Chen,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.100
because he could travel
just a few months ago.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.650
So here's again a case
where you have a DNA match.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:39.490
It looks good.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.150
It looked good even to me.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:42.330
The full kit was used.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.290
But it's a mixture.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.210
And these mixtures in
reality are very difficult

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:50.754
and they are confounding juries.

00:28:50.754 --> 00:28:52.420
Now, I told you about
the mitochondrion.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.520
Mitochondria are good
for us because if there's

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.470
a fraction of a hair
left without a root,

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:58.940
we can use mitochondrial DNA.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.915
We do a lot of mitochondrial
DNA on the Basque.

00:29:00.915 --> 00:29:03.480
I study the Basque
in my lab as well

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.090
and we have some
projects on them.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.867
But anyway, the
mitochondrial DNA

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:08.450
is something you get
from your mother.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.457
We can do lineage
stuff, and it can

00:29:10.457 --> 00:29:12.290
be used when there's
just a fragment of hair

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.770
or the body's very
decayed or burned.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:20.130
And Donald Denman-- this is
from the Albuquerque journal.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.170
He went missing.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.075
He was 49 years old.

00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:23.950
His family struggled.

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.866
They never had the body,
never found anything.

00:29:25.866 --> 00:29:28.800
Finally, some bones are
found near the house.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.740
And so they identify
those bones.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.540
This is February of
2008 and donations

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.970
could be sent to the Salvation
Army for Donny Denman.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:43.654
The FBI confirms the DNA by
mitochondria of those bones.

00:29:43.654 --> 00:29:46.320
Since it's from the mother, they
get one of the mom's relatives,

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.860
one of her sisters
in another state.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.960
They finally confirm it.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.944
Now we're in March
of 2008, same year.

00:29:52.944 --> 00:29:54.360
It's tough for his
brother to look

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.540
at the photograph
of his brother.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.680
As he stared as the image,
he couldn't help but wonder,

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.555
would his brother have
turned his life around

00:29:59.555 --> 00:30:01.720
if he had lived?

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.800
This is now May 3, same year.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.680
I said match.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.370
You didn't say statistics.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.643
So with mitochondria, it's
generally one in 2,500,

00:30:16.643 --> 00:30:19.230
one is 5,000,
something like that.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:23.020
And so it was a coincidental
match to somebody else's bones.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.434
A friend of Donny
Denman, who was repairing

00:30:25.434 --> 00:30:27.350
his car in his garage,
putting down newspaper,

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.780
sees the obituary,
calls Donny and says,

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.130
Donny, they buried you.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:33.450
And he's like, you're kidding.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.310
He's like, well, who
spoke at my funeral?

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.090
Like, your pastor.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.867
So he called the pastor.

00:30:37.867 --> 00:30:39.450
And like he says,
I'm very much alive.

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.180
It's a trip, isn't it?

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:47.360
Once again, good
DNA, a true match,

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.280
a statistic that
is not an identity.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.010
It is a good statistic.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:53.500
1 in 2000 sounds good.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.040
1 in 5000 sounds good.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.900
So now we'll talk
about sensitivity.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.280
Can we become too sensitive?

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.120
Here is a slide of some sperm.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.340
When I was first doing DNA in
the '80s, we'd need about 500

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.080
of these slides to give a
really good DNA profile.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.690
We were using a technique where
we couldn't amplify DNA yet

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.690
because it hadn't been invented.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.610
Now, single cell.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.817
So I want you to consider this.

00:31:21.817 --> 00:31:23.900
As our instruments and our
kits have gotten, like,

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.290
a millionfold better,
yet most police work

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:29.520
is still collecting
evidence the same way.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.330
Let's think about what
a problem might be.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.950
So I try to boils down to
people's practical experience.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:37.056
How many of you swim
in a public pool,

00:31:37.056 --> 00:31:38.180
have swum in a public pool?

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.230
Great.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.660
So the problem is this.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.620
What if one person,
man or woman,

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.510
goes into that public pool
with an ejaculate on them

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.290
or in them?

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.510
And I got news for you.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.700
As you're swimming, that
water is doing more than

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:50.760
going over your body.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.670
It's cleaning you out a bit.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:57.100
And if one person goes in, 300
million sperm cells from one

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.966
ejaculate in that
public pool, how much

00:31:59.966 --> 00:32:01.340
water do you have
to swim through

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:04.090
before you get a sperm cell?

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.390
Well, there's 300,000
gallons in an Olympic pool.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.790
It's pretty easy.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.540
There's 1,000 sperm
cells per gallon

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.570
for every ejaculate
evenly dispersed.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.500
Now, if you happen to get
a rich area of ejaculation,

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.340
swim with your mouth closed.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:24.160
So in 1982, I'd need
1,000 of those gallons

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.530
to do a DNA profile.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.510
Today, I need about a teaspoon.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.590
So how does that work
into forensic casework?

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.290
Well, Meredith Kercher
was the young lady who

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.900
was killed in Italy,
the student who

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.290
was killed that Amanda Knox
served time for and was

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.960
eventually exonerated for.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.770
That's Amanda and Rafael, her
co-conspirator who supposedly

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.680
were involved in the murder.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.850
They were suspects
before any of the DNA

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.330
from the room or the
fingerprint evidence was done.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.840
And so it was a gut feeling
from the prosecutor.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.930
And, can you have gut
feelings in science?

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.090
Yeah, they're called
hypotheses, right?

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.080
But the difference between a
theologian-- some of my friends

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.580
who went into
theology-- and me, who

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.572
went into sciences, a theologian
will die for their ideas.

00:33:08.572 --> 00:33:10.405
And that is the measure
of their dedication.

00:33:10.405 --> 00:33:12.370
And a scientist's
measure of dedication

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.746
is you let your ideas die.

00:33:14.746 --> 00:33:16.370
You put that baby
that you've-- I mean,

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.570
I've tried to cure
cancer for a long time.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.270
You put it up for
a test every time.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.630
And everything you thought
was going right, you abandon.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.140
There was a lot
of press on this.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.740
They spray a tan on you at CNN.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.180
That was before the beard.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.140
So, only two people's
DNA-- when they finally

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.360
do the DNA and the
fingerprints, only two people

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.980
are in the murder room,
the victim and Rudy Guede,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.930
who they try and
they put in prison

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.350
and they still persist
with Amanda and Rafael,

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:43.470
based on that gut feeling.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.840
Finally, we had the ruling
from the Supreme Court

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.870
just a few weeks ago
that said, no, they

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.870
got it completely wrong.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:49.953
She's completely innocent.

00:33:49.953 --> 00:33:50.890
It was ridiculous.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.510
She should have been
released immediately.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.260
He's serving time.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:01.800
This is the bra clasp that
convicted Rafael, Amanda's

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.590
boyfriend of a couple weeks.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.630
They picked it up 46
days after the murder,

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.220
after the teams had been
through a couple times.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.040
They said they forgot it.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.330
I could show you
the collection film.

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:10.120
They actually have it.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:10.929
They're passing it around.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.239
They're touching it, passing
it from one guy to another.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:14.905
And then they put it
back on the ground,

00:34:14.905 --> 00:34:16.889
because they forgot
to photograph it.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.739
So here they are, totally
in the bunny suits

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:20.760
and they're putting
evidence on the ground.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.310
And they said they're
changing their gloves

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.500
and the gloves are
clean and we had

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.958
evidence their
gloves aren't clean,

00:34:24.958 --> 00:34:26.840
and we showed all that video.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.100
That's the knife that
supposedly Amanda used.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.560
And that's where DNA consistent
with the victim was found.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.100
This is the electropherogram
of that DNA from the victim.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:41.460
What is important here
is that the y-axis, which

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.159
the FBI at that time wouldn't
look at anything below 200,

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.900
there's only one
peak above 100 here.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.400
They were never
able to repeat this.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.850
It was an invalid procedure
and that's why she's free.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:55.000
We repeated this in my lab
as we were studying it.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.734
We collected soda cans from
the dean's office at lunch.

00:34:58.734 --> 00:35:00.900
And then I told my people,
save money on the gloves,

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.850
just like they apparently did.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:03.892
Don't change your gloves.

00:35:03.892 --> 00:35:05.558
Change in every other
piece of evidence.

00:35:05.558 --> 00:35:06.980
Collect a can, go
in another room,

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.300
and unpack a knife
from the Dollar Store

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.980
and put that in a
separate evidence bag.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.620
Keep everything separate,
then change your gloves.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.960
Do it for five people.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.640
We did it for five
people and we found

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.830
one person's DNA
transferred to the knife--

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.950
one out of the five.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.150
I'm going to skip through this
just because we're at the end.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.750
So, happy ending.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:25.496
There we go.

00:35:25.496 --> 00:35:27.370
Amanda, that's a few
weeks after she got out.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.300
We had Thanksgiving
together at her house.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.210
And then both of our
families went rafting

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.090
for three days in Idaho.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:38.380
I'll show you one more
example of how this can go.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.190
And somebody's going
to have to shoot

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:44.150
me to get me off the stage.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.130
I mean a photograph.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.980
My mom lived in Europe, so I
followed this story for years.

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.640
For 15 years, this woman
was committing crimes

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.830
all over Europe.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.090
Rarely was there a witness.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.190
There's a murder.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:01.060
There are Romany
chiefs, feuding Gypsies

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.520
who use guns and her DNA
is found on the guns.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.020
She robs.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:06.480
She injects herself with heroin.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.662
They found syringes
with her DNA.

00:36:08.662 --> 00:36:10.370
Kills with almost
professional precision.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.000
As far as German detectives are
concerned, she has no identity.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.200
They test 800 women
in Heidelberg.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.500
They do DNA test on
her-- nothing, no match.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.300
Bruno Bosch says in
2008 he's traveled

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:26.310
60,000 kilometers questioning
witnesses-- nothing.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.240
They did 800 women,
as I told you.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:34.551
And in the end, it was a woman
who worked in the Bavarian swab

00:36:34.551 --> 00:36:35.050
factory.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.340
She was leaving a little
something on her swabs.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.970
That's the Phantom of Heilbronn.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.700
Why wasn't this detected?

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:46.960
Because we don't track our
errors in forensic science.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.170
And I'll show you my
lab's answer to that.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:53.050
We study the smallest sequences
that don't exist in nature.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.480
We call them nullimers.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.990
For DNA, they were
recently 13 bases long.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.320
For proteins, they were
five amino acids long.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.770
And we call them nullimers.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:05.020
And we've made cancer-killing
agents out of the proteins.

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.200
But out of the DNA,
what we've done

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.390
is we've made a marker
that amplifies better

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.560
than any of the human markers
and it looks like this

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.480
on an electropherogram.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.396
Those are human markers
that have been diluted

00:37:15.396 --> 00:37:18.300
100,000 times after PCR.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.110
And then we diluted
it a million times

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.160
and tried to PCR up everything,
all the human markers

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.620
and our nullimers,
put it on a knife,

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:26.912
and you can still see that.

00:37:26.912 --> 00:37:29.120
And so that means when you
give a swab to the police,

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.085
at least one thing we can avoid
is they make a billion copies.

00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:34.210
That's what I do in my lab.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.960
You give me DNA, I
make a billion copies--

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.310
first thing I do.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.220
Each of those copies
is indistinguishable

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.404
from the original in PCR.

00:37:41.404 --> 00:37:43.070
It's not like a
traditional fingerprint.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.849
The Supreme Court got that wrong
when they said that it's just

00:37:45.849 --> 00:37:47.140
like a traditional fingerprint.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.810
We can take them from arrestees.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.310
It's not.

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:53.150
I make a billion copies and one
of those copies in an aerosol,

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:56.610
on a tube, on a glove,
is enough to convict you.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.330
And that's why we've
invented the nullimer marker.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:01.070
So I'll skip all this.

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.680
If you're interested more in
hearing-- because we're out

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.990
of time, right?

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:08.750
You can read my book or contact
me at hampikian@yahoo.com.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:09.658
Thanks.

00:38:09.658 --> 00:38:12.466
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:12.466 --> 00:38:16.429
-We've got time for about
four or five questions.

00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:18.470
If you guys want to come--
is the microphone out?

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.052
I can't quite see.

00:38:20.052 --> 00:38:21.010
We've got a microphone.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.800
I guess we can-- in
the middle there.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.480
Come on up, say who you
are, and if you can just

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.410
keep it to a question,
that would be awesome.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.550
And maybe while we're
waiting for folks to come up,

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.580
I'll just ask you.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.790
If you were to recommend one
thing to the police, one thing

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.560
to the labs, one thing
to analysts to improve

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.100
this system, what would it be?

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.710
-What I tell my students in
lab is keep your arsenic out

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.260
of the spice cabinet.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.220
And for God's sakes, if
you keep them together,

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.010
don't keep your arsenic
in an Old Spice bottle.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.320
So what I'd say is
these are the-- I'm

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.740
going to do it by demo.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.600
We work in very small
volumes in lab now

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.950
and these are the racks.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.670
And you can't possibly
read the writing

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.870
on the little tubes
in here, so it's

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.161
all about the order they're in.

00:39:07.161 --> 00:39:08.340
I skipped a case.

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.080
I have two cases where they're
just swapped tubes that that's

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.480
what put people in prison.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.640
And Las Vegas just apologized
to a guy they did that for.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.386
So I would say, keep
suspect things separate.

00:39:18.386 --> 00:39:19.760
They should go to
a separate lab.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.890
There should be one national
lab or maybe a couple

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.900
national labs that
just do known samples.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:27.920
And then the rest of the
crime labs do their thing.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.792
But they've got to keep
them separate all the time.

00:39:30.792 --> 00:39:32.500
I think there's a lot
a mixup being done.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.900
And the tragic thing about
those is there's no way to tell.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.275
There's nothing I can do for
somebody if that's happened.

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:40.650
-Questions.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:41.150
-Hi.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:43.360
Great talk.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.110
Given that we know that
there are trace amounts

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:47.485
of genomic DNA
all over the place

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:50.049
and it's quite hard to amplify
STRs and stuff like that

00:39:50.049 --> 00:39:51.590
from trace amounts,
what do you think

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.940
the probability is that the
forensics community will turn

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.940
away from STRs and mitochondria
and to, like, low coverage

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:00.300
genome sequencing?

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.190
-Well, it's funny
you should ask.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.930
So the FSI Genetics
that I just picked up

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:06.850
in the mail on my way
over is "New Trends

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.620
in Forensics Genetics."

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.200
And it's all about
massively parallel

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.880
sequencing, even things
like microbial genetics.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.070
Do your microbes identify you?

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:19.640
Probably.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.389
I want to do a study
actually about people

00:40:21.389 --> 00:40:24.320
who take antibiotics
and then get divorced.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.050
It is because after years, we
develop the same microbiota.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.900
And if one partner's taking
antibiotics and going

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.030
traveling, you change
your fingerprint.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:35.940
Does it change your behavior?

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.340
Does it change your interests?

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.490
Do you find a different
smell pleasant?

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:41.170
So they're looking at microbes.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.840
That's all free stuff.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.627
That's my idea.

00:40:43.627 --> 00:40:44.960
You can take it and run with it.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.180
But they're looking at
other ways of mostly just

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.850
massively parallel sequencing.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.950
You can now-- and with
mixtures, I can only

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.460
tell three people apart.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.070
They can look at 1,000 people
and say if one person is

00:40:57.070 --> 00:40:58.210
included or not.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:00.870
So it's pretty impressive,
but nobody's used it in court.

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:01.600
Yeah?

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:01.840
-Hi.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.600
I'm Denise McWilliams.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.260
I'm with the New England
Innocence Project,

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.200
and thank you for your
help to us over the years.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.116
-Yeah, you're welcome.

00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:09.120
-I recently was at a
conference in New York

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.710
where I watched the
scientist and attorneys

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:13.770
for the prosecutor
and the defense

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:18.150
literally scream at each other
about the use of low copy DNA.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.140
-That was in New York?

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:19.920
-There was in New York.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:20.650
-Yeah, of course.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.150
-Just curious what
your thoughts are

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.970
about the use of low copy DNA.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:26.480
-Well, low copy means
two different things.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.350
The original meaning
of that meant

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:30.347
we did extra rounds of PCR.

00:41:30.347 --> 00:41:32.680
And in that case, you actually
see what we call drop-in.

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.590
And all the drop-in
is, is DNA that's

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.250
just kind of floating
around or in the glove

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:40.280
when you buy-- on the
glove or in the tube

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.467
that you don't see with these
normal 28 rounds or 30 rounds.

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:45.550
But when you do the extra
rounds, you get drop-in.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.679
But low template
DNA, which probably

00:41:47.679 --> 00:41:49.220
is something they
were arguing about,

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.440
is when you have very low levels
like in Amanda Knox's case,

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.320
you'll get different results
in some of those cases.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:58.430
And so in New York
at the OCME, they

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:01.170
were saying, oh, if you get the
result two out of three times,

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.060
you can report it.

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.871
And when I did a
case in London, they

00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:07.370
said, well, it has
to be repeatable.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:08.703
And I thought, that makes sense.

00:42:08.703 --> 00:42:10.180
A repeatable result is reliable.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.720
And then I looked
at their records.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.994
They did, like, 10 tests.

00:42:12.994 --> 00:42:14.410
Two of them were
what they wanted.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.500
They picked the two.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.120
They called it repeatable.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.570
So I think there's
a lot of problems

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.070
with some of those techniques.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:23.390
But frankly, that
bar keeps moving.

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:25.460
As we get down to
single cell resolution,

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.420
it won't be as much
of a question anymore.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.280
So we keep lowering the bar
of what low template is.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.930
So, yes, it should be used.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:36.090
Yes, there are problems.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.280
-Hi, I'm Faye Flam.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.730
I'm a journalist with
MIT Technology Review

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:44.570
and I was intrigued by these
cases where there are mixtures

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:47.600
and the statistics looked
good, where there was like a 1

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.540
in 2000 chance it was wrong.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.310
Is the problem there
that the person

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:55.110
was the 1 in 2000 or the problem
that people are screwing up

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:58.640
the numbers, that they're
making statistical errors?

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.300
-The problem is that there
are several good methods

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.070
to do statistics
and they produce

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:05.310
extremely variable results.

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.780
So when I say good, they're
based on mathematics.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.450
All the statisticians agree
they're good, robust methods.

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.950
But you get 10 to
the 10 differences.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:16.940
And then you get labs
that will exclude.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.350
Most labs are still
applying rules of thumb.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:21.410
If there's only one
allele, we won't call it.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:23.170
Utah told me there
had to be at least two

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.880
that weren't found
to exclude somebody.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.820
They all have these rules of
thumb that they're applying.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:31.270
So the statistics are helpful.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:34.010
But also, I think our idea
about these statistics is wrong.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:38.420
If I say 1 in 5,000 in
a Boston crime, that

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.405
means there's 1,000 people
in Boston who might--

00:43:41.405 --> 00:43:44.140
who are I match, a
definite match, right?

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.880
And so if you think of it
in terms of epidemiology

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.060
or in terms of medical
testing, that's

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:53.090
a false positive
rate of 999 to 1.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:58.720
So for every one person in a
1 in 5,000 match in Boston,

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.617
for every right one,
there are 999 wrong ones.

00:44:02.617 --> 00:44:04.200
And it doesn't mean
we don't use that,

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.110
but you have to start
giving a better perspective.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:11.130
Because jurors hear 1 in 1,000,
1 in 10,000, 1 in a million,

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:12.690
and they think it's over.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:15.550
They don't hear
numbers like that.

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.910
They hear 50-50.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:19.087
It's 20% chance.

00:44:19.087 --> 00:44:21.170
When they hear those kind
of overwhelming numbers,

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:22.630
they generally convict.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.590
-Thank you.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:30.180
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:30.680
-Thanks.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.080
And I'll be around if
you have questions.
