00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.350
We have about 600 miles of flood
channels in the whole Las Vegas

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.930
valley.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.580
Two or three of the tunnels
go right beneath the strip.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.760
A few go beneath
the downtown area,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.330
and then the rest
are just everywhere.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.650
You can see the neon lights,
the 40 story tall casinos,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.890
the polished lobbies.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.530
And then right beneath that
is this dark and gray world

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.830
where people are just
trying to survive.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.050
I go to the tunnels maybe
two or three times a month,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.170
just to check on people.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.290
I started a community
project called

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.280
Shine A Light to try to do what
I can to help the people who

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.240
are living down there.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.143
You ready to see who's around?

00:01:05.143 --> 00:01:05.643
Let's do it.

00:01:08.805 --> 00:01:09.305
Creepy.

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:12.655
It's a stuffed animal
wrapped in caution tape.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.780
That's the kind of thing
if you're by yourself late

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.610
at night walking and you see
it, it can give you the chills.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.390
Craig, is that you?

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.220
Can you give us a quick
tour of your camp?

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.940
Just describe--

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.260
Well, I just made this up.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.880
I locked this down to make
sure the wind and air can

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060
come through, a pretty
decent amount of air.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.410
You can lower this if
you need to and shut it?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.090
It's cold.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.740
The floor is cold.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.690
The floor is cold enough to keep
the food preserved a little?

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.250
You found this in a trashcan?

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.870
Yeah, dumpster diving.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.246
Craig is one of the
masters of dumpster diving.

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:51.620
Even when he had
an apartment, he

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.041
would dumpster dive and
furnish it with stuff he found.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:57.540
I wouldn't want to be homeless
anywhere else, I would think.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.626
Out of sight, out of
mind here, in Vegas.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.260
You're left alone.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.020
You have some privacy, and
strangely, a sense of security

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.880
down here.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.941
How are you doing?

00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:17.440
OK.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.939
Yeah?

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:18.530
How are you?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.030
Good.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.040
Good to see you.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.120
You've lived down here
off and on for how long?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.932
Oh, my god.

00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:30.860
Since 2004.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.360
Wow.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.170
Take me back to that moment.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.990
You lived, white picket
fence, family, kids?

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.960
I came down here,
and I expected it

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.800
to be dirtier, more humidity--
raw sewage going through

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.710
or something.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.210
Right.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:44.085
And I saw how it was.

00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:44.940
And I was like, wow.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.840
That's not as bad as I thought.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.890
Whatever my man
chooses or whatever,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.370
that's what I want too.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.276
If he wants to live
down here, then I'll

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:54.360
live down here with him.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.420
Can you give us a little tour?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.330
This is one of the
more elaborate camps,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.930
you'll see down here.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.970
The bed is elevated on
these shopping carts.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.575
That's my refrigerator.

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:06.350
The cooler?

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.620
I keep the food,
yeah, and water.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.675
Aren't those the coin
cups from the casinos?

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:13.195
You use that as a bathroom?

00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:16.760
That's our bathroom, our toilet.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.820
People get so comfortable living
down here with their couch,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.160
and their milk crate, and
their clothes hung up.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.380
And I think
sometimes, they almost

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.630
forget that they're
living in a flood channel.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.770
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.750
It says, aghast, the devil stood
and felt how awful goodness is.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.490
I think it's a line from
Milton's "Paradise Lost"

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.570
that a guy named Ricky
wrote on the wall.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.320
He's a bit of a poet,
a rough guy, tough guy.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.390
But he also has a
more sensitive side.

00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:07.999
Yeah, this is a roulette table.

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.360
Wow.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.574
You use it just as a curtain?

00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:12.074
Yeah.

00:04:16.514 --> 00:04:17.014
Wow.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:19.721
You have a canopy, huh?

00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:20.220
Yeah.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.611
This keeps you warm.

00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:22.860
Oh, you can pull it down over?

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.360
Yeah.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.420
Is that a thin mattress
or a few blankets?

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.560
Those are two McDonald's crates.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.800
That they unload
their supplies with?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.540
Yeah, and they didn't get back.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.720
So what is it about the tunnels
that attracts you to it?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.380
For one thing, it's free rent.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.820
I know my future, and
I'm past 50 years old.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.075
I have extensive
prison background.

00:04:45.075 --> 00:04:48.120
And I know I won't get no work,
no decent work around here.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.350
So what?

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.070
You feel you don't
have any future,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.815
so you just don't mind
staying down here?

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.020
Unless you could think
of a better future than I

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.960
could think of.

00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:09.250
And what I've discovered is
it's very tough to get someone

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.370
to come out literally
into the light

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.700
and to face the issues that
made them become homeless

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.060
in the first place and to
try to change and turn that

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.360
around and give up the freedom.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.600
The people down here have
been really good to me

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.130
as far as welcoming
me into their homes,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.114
sharing their stories with me.

00:05:38.114 --> 00:05:40.970
The thought part of
helping just one of them

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.370
or brightening
one of their days,

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.960
those are the kind of
things that keep me going.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.010
In another episode
of "Seeker Stories,"

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.560
find out how a controversial
medical procedure

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.990
is saving lives.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.890
So we process stool
from healthy donors

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.610
and send it out to hospitals
all over the country.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.640
The population that
we're treating this way,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.020
this is their last resort.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.950
They've been sick for a
minimum of six months.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.783
And this cures them.

00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:21.420
This classic case that I
take care of has an over 90%

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.180
success rate.
