00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.670
Lex Luthor with
a hair transplant, Elon Musk,

00:00:03.704 --> 00:00:06.507
just unveiled his plans
to send human colonists to Mars.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.342
The proposed spaceship
would hold 100 people,

00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.711
who, judging
by every sci-fi movie,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.379
would be brilliant scientists
and engineers

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.214
who are also super (bleep).

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.650
-(laughter)
-Musk says the journey

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.851
could take as little as 80 days,

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:19.253
unless there's traffic
on the 405.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:20.654
Then they could just take
Sepulveda.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.423
But they might as well leave
right now.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:27.494
They'll arrive just in time to
see Trump set the earth on fire!

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.863
So, to pass the time on the way
to the red planet,

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:32.366
Musk has all kinds of fun
activities planned,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.735
like movies, zero-G games,

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.471
figuring out how to build
a fuel refinement plant on Mars

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.906
so you don't die alone in space.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:40.307
All the fun stuff the kids love.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.976
But I'm sure they're still going
to have some hours to fill,

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.411
so comedians, how else will
these colonists

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.313
pass the time on their way
to Mars?

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.982
-Bruce Campbell!
-I won the game already.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:50.951
HARDWICK: No, that's just
the first question.

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.686
It doesn't... I don't...
You still have to answer.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.421
Oh, this is just other things
you can do?

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:55.822
Yeah.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.759
-I'd come up with a cool quote
for when they land. -Yup.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:00.894
'Cause right now, the best thing
they got is, uh,

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.829
"Suck our (bleep), Buzz Aldrin."

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:03.997
-HARDWICK: All right.
-(laughter)

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.832
So...

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.901
(applause and cheering)

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:09.169
It's a winner.

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.905
(applause and cheering swell)

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.709
(laughing):
Points.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.910
Nick Swardson.

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:19.479
Floating turd volleyball.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:20.981
-HARDWICK: Yeah, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:21.014 --> 00:01:24.918
(applause and cheering)

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.854
Justin Willman. Yes.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:26.954
Waiting for the beverage cart
to go by so you can finally pee.
