one possibility in other words you
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.889
one possibility in other words you
couldn't just wire in one belief you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899
couldn't just wire in one belief you
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690
couldn't just wire in one belief you
would have to wire in something which

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
would have to wire in something which
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.600

alternatively maybe you would say oh my

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
alternatively maybe you would say oh my

gosh what did I just say I said I had an

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
gosh what did I just say I said I had an
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.400
gosh what did I just say I said I had an
older brother man older brother I I have

I have a sister or I'm an only child
what made me say that in that case what

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270
what made me say that in that case what
 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.400
what made me say that in that case what
we would see is that whatever the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410
we would see is that whatever the
 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500
we would see is that whatever the
surgeon did it wasn't wiring in a belief

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
surgeon did it wasn't wiring in a belief
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.870
surgeon did it wasn't wiring in a belief
because as soon as you reflected on it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880
because as soon as you reflected on it
 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.210
because as soon as you reflected on it
boom it just vanished it disappeared

boom it just vanished it disappeared
well if it's a belief then it's got to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
well if it's a belief then it's got to
 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.170
well if it's a belief then it's got to
be secured to a lot of other beliefs

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
be secured to a lot of other beliefs
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.240
be secured to a lot of other beliefs
that's just on the nature belief you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250
that's just on the nature belief you
 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.320
that's just on the nature belief you
can't have an isolated belief like I

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330
can't have an isolated belief like I
 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.730
can't have an isolated belief like I
have an older brother living in

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740
have an older brother living in
 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.660
have an older brother living in
Cleveland if that state was one that you

Cleveland if that state was one that you
seem to be in we'd want to explore to

seem to be in we'd want to explore to
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.400
seem to be in we'd want to explore to
see what came along with it and either

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
see what came along with it and either

we would decide that you had some weird

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600
we would decide that you had some weird
 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.220
we would decide that you had some weird
sort of growth in your brain that made

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
sort of growth in your brain that made
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.650
sort of growth in your brain that made
you fixate on a sentence sort of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660
you fixate on a sentence sort of
 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.850
you fixate on a sentence sort of
parrot-like and you'd say I'm an only

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860
parrot-like and you'd say I'm an only
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680
parrot-like and you'd say I'm an only
child and I have an older brother living

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690
child and I have an older brother living
 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.100
child and I have an older brother living
in Cleveland which of course would be

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110
in Cleveland which of course would be
 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.740

contradicting yourself what we wouldn't

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750
contradicting yourself what we wouldn't
 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360
contradicting yourself what we wouldn't
decide is that you believed you had an

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370
decide is that you believed you had an
 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.210
decide is that you believed you had an
older brother living in Cleveland what

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
older brother living in Cleveland what
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.850
older brother living in Cleveland what
this little thought experiment shows is

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860
this little thought experiment shows is
 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.160
this little thought experiment shows is
that beliefs don't parcel themselves out

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170
that beliefs don't parcel themselves out
 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.949
that beliefs don't parcel themselves out
the way sentences do you could take any

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959
the way sentences do you could take any
 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.900
the way sentences do you could take any
sentence on any topic and write it on

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
sentence on any topic and write it on
 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.240
sentence on any topic and write it on
any medium you like and put it in a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250
any medium you like and put it in a
 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.820
any medium you like and put it in a
drawer and there it would be beliefs

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830
drawer and there it would be beliefs
 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.240
drawer and there it would be beliefs
aren't like that they come in systems

aren't like that they come in systems
they cohere in large clumps this is

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370
they cohere in large clumps this is
 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.400
they cohere in large clumps this is
sometimes called holism

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410
sometimes called holism
 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.710
sometimes called holism
and there's still some theorists who

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720
and there's still some theorists who
 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.410
and there's still some theorists who
think that holism is a bad idea I think

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420
think that holism is a bad idea I think
 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.259
think that holism is a bad idea I think
it's got to be the case holism is a good

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269
it's got to be the case holism is a good
 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.449
it's got to be the case holism is a good
idea that a particulate non holistic
