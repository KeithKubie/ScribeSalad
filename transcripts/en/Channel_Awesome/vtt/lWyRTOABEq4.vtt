00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.359
- Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie, yet another Disney Channel movie based on a Disney Channel show that I have never watched.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.489
Honestly, I didn't even though this is where Selena Gomez came from. Once again, seeing how I haven't seen the show,

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.899
I can't really compare it to the original source material, but I can say for a newcomer,

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.739
I actually followed it surprisingly well, and also as a newcomer,

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.869
I actually didn't see it as that bad.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.300
My first initial thought was it was gonna be another Harry Potter spin-off like some of these other Disney Channel movies.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.110
But that's not really quite the direction it goes. Alex, played by Selena

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.470
Gomez, is part of a family of wizards that lives on Waverly Place.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.050
But they don't stay there long as the mother decides they need to grow closer together, so the family takes a vacation.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.159
But the teens, being normal teens, are not having a lot of fun. Alex

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.590
eventually feel so shut in that she accidentally uses her powers to make it seem like her mom and dad never met.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.188
The spell works. The parents have no idea who each other are or the kids.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.859
And they seem like completely different people when they're single.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.000
Using their magic irresponsibly, not caring that much about other people, all the usual stuff.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.339
But it looks like they only have 48 hours before

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.169
reality sets in and the kids themselves will disappear. In fact, their memories already seem to be going.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.309
But it just so happens they come across a half-assed magician who used to be a wizard--

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.379
in fact, the parrot used to be his girlfriend-- who has a secret map to the stone of dreams, a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.699
magical device you can make one wish upon that will come true, so it's Harry Potter

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:35.700
slash

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310
Even Stevens slash

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.640
Indiana Jones slash

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.049
Beach Vacation that all these Disney Channel movies seem to like to go on.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.320
Upon hearing the plot, you wouldn't think very much of the movie, and truth be told, its strength is not in its writing. Its strength

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.020
is in its

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.439
performances. In a lot of these Disney Channel movies, you always kind of feel like these actors are shoved together really fast

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.589
and yet they're supposed to act like a family, like they've known each other for years.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.080
And you can't blame 'em. I doubt they have much rehearsal,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.839
and they have to just go, but here, because I think they did have years of being on a show, they really have a camaraderie.

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:07.839
- All right, people.

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's move. This way.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.839
- The other way.

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.039
- The other "this way."

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.200
- They have the one-liners.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.189
They have the zingers.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.388
But they never seem too mean. They seem like the kind a normal family would make.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.380
Take for example this scene where the father asked for the wand back.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.550
- Just give me the wand.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:23.460
Come on.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.440
- Come on.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.040
- Give me the wand.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040
-Give me the wand.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.589
- Now, written down, him mimicking him wouldn't be that funny, but because the performances seem very real,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.250
it works. That really is the saving grace of this movie. I legitimately like watching these people. Nobody seemed out of place.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.660
No one was giving an awkward acting job. They all seemed legitimately believable. Even something as silly as this magician talking to his parrot.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.359
It's so dumb, but by God, every minute he's on screen I believe that parrot is his girlfriend.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.130
He sells it as well as Jimmy Stewart does making you believe there's a rabbit in the room.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.099
- Yeah. Yeah, but I know. I know you were sentenced to 50 years in feathers.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.250
But if you take the stone first, it'll disappear forever.

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.459
You're kind of good at this, aren't you?

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.480
 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.459
I hate it when

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.410
we fight too.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.719
- They not only work in context of the comedy, but they work in connection to the other characters.

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.229
I totally buy every single one of their relationships.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.000
And they would act how they're acting towards one another. The only part where I get a little lost-- and again,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.940
maybe this comes back to having to know the show-- is that there's this

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.899
competition at the end that they have to go through in order to become real wizards.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.650
But it kinda springs out of nowhere in that they talk about a little bit.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.370
But you don't think it's gonna be the climax.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.970
They both have to try in order to become real wizards so that they can get the spells to put everything right, and yeah.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.319
It's pretty. It's neat.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.099
It's creative.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.608
But I just don't think it was fully explained or worked into the story that great.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.879
Especially when you find out what saves the day, it almost kind of seems pointless.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.328
But still, most of the funny moments work. It looks nice.

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.969
It's creative, and even some of the dramatic moments

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.910
hit bull's-eyes, and again, that comes from the surprising believability of these performances. Does every joke work?

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.669
No. Does every line work? No. Are there awkward moments?

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.759
What Disney Channel movie doesn't have that? But still, at the end of the day,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.190
I like watching this family. They're snarky, but you can tell they love each other, and it doesn't feel manipulative.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.789
It's the same way Malcolm in the Middle acts so mean to each other but at the end of the day

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.479
you know they're a unique unit, and they still function as a caring family.

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.239
That's more than enough for me to say this ain't half bad.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.060
 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600
