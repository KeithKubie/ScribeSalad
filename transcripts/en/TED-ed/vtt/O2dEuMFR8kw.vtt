00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.724
9th of January, 2007

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:22.127
Joshua Bell, one of the greatest violinist in the world,

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:23.771
played to a packed audience

00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:27.982
at Boston's stately Symphony Hall of 1,000 people

00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:31.808
where most seats went for more than $100.

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:34.576
He was used to full, sell-out shows.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:39.002
He was at the peak of his abilities and fame.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.960
Three days later,

00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:45.001
Joshua Bell played to an audience of

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.228
nobody!

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.002
Well, maybe six people paused for a moment,

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.516
and one child stopped for a while looking,

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:58.088
as if he understood that something special was happening.

00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:00.607
Joshua said of the experience,

00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:06.410
"It was a strange feeling that people were actually ignoring me."

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:12.839
Joshua Bell was playing violin in a subway station.

00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:18.268
"At a music hall, I'll get upset if someone coughs

00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:21.375
or if someone's cell phone goes off,

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:24.797
but here my expectations quickly diminished.

00:01:24.797 --> 00:01:28.853
I was oddly grateful when somebody threw in a dollar."

00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:33.973
What changed?

00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:35.196
Same music,

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:36.881
on the same violin,

00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:38.407
played with the same passion

00:01:38.407 --> 00:01:40.499
and by the same man.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:44.695
Why did people listen and then not listen?

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:50.021
Aristotle would be able to explain.

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:52.731
What does it take to persuade people?

00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:54.702
2,300 years ago,

00:01:54.702 --> 00:01:58.859
Aristotle wrote the single most important work on persuasion,

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.161
&lt;i&gt;Rhetoric&lt;/i&gt;,

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.504
the 3 means of persuasion:

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:05.610
logos,

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.521
ethos,

00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:08.558
and pathos.

00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:13.591
Logos is that the idea makes sense from the audience's point of view.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.880
This is usually different from the speaker's point of view,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.990
so work needs to be done

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.675
to make the idea relevant to the world view,

00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:23.808
the pains and the challenges of the listeners.

00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:25.753
A good argument is like good music.

00:02:25.753 --> 00:02:29.811
Good music follows some rules of composition;

00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.487
good arguments follow some rules of logic.

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:36.060
It makes sense to the audience.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.461
Ethos is reputation, what are you known for;

00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:44.164
credibility, do you look and act professional;

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.619
trustworthy, are your motives clear,

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:50.788
do you show the listener that you care about them as much as yourself?

00:02:50.788 --> 00:02:54.800
Authority is confidence plus a concise message,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.701
a clear, strong voice.

00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:01.138
Pathos is the emotional connection.

00:03:01.138 --> 00:03:06.280
Stories are an effective human tool for creating an emotional connection.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.242
There are moments where an audience is not ready

00:03:08.242 --> 00:03:10.147
to hear the message.

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:15.469
A speaker must create the right emotional environment for their message.

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.047
What changed?

00:03:17.047 --> 00:03:20.242
Why did people travel for miles to hear him play one night,

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:24.113
and not even pause for moment to listen the next morning?

00:03:24.113 --> 00:03:28.636
The answer is that ethos and pathos were missing.

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:30.040
Ethos

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.870
The fact that the great concert hall hosts Joshua's concert

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.557
transfers its trust to Joshua.

00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:40.194
We trust the institution, we now trust Joshua.

00:03:40.194 --> 00:03:43.060
The subway does not have our trust for musical talent,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.175
we do not expect to find great art,

00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:45.783
great music,

00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:48.113
or great ideas,

00:03:48.113 --> 00:03:51.093
so it confers no trust to Joshua.

00:03:52.308 --> 00:03:53.888
Pathos

00:03:53.888 --> 00:03:55.912
The concert hall is designed for an emotional bond

00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:58.988
between an audience and an artist,

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:01.093
a subway platform is not.

00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:04.430
The hustle and movement and stress is just not conducive

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.066
to the emotional connection needed between performer and listener.

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:10.512
Logos,

00:04:10.512 --> 00:04:12.043
ethos,

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.680
pathos,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.577
the idea is nothing without the rest.

00:04:16.577 --> 00:04:18.214
This is what Joshua Bell learned

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:21.560
on that cold, January day in 2007.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.430
If you have a great idea,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.347
how do you build credibility and emotional connection?
