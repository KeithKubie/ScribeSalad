Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience to go see this one championship event in Bangkok. Wow. That guy, one of my friends like pet. Damn, he's a, he's a a stadium like champion and he's fighting one championship again and it's like, it's, it's just six seaman. Yeah. I don't think people understand how big it is in Asia either. Well, there's a lot of American fans that are just really, they're missing it. Yeah. It's like Asia's version of the UFC. It's gigantic. Bigger. Yeah. Yeah. The numbers are insane. And they got some fucking killers over there. Yes. They got some legit killers. Yeah. That's like that Guy Nasty Ucan who just knocked out a Eddie Alvarez. Yep. I try to tiger dude. That guy's legit. Yeah. I remember to train with him at all. No, I would like alongside him. I didn't personally try with them, but I remember one day we were doing a, we were training and he was the last one on the mat.

Speaker 1:          00:54          And, uh, our wrestling coach frank was like, he's like, he said something like 10 more sprawls in like you beat Eddie Alvarez or something and the guy's just grinded like he's just digging himself into the Maddie. It was, it was cool to watch him prepare for that fight. But there's, there's guys like that that's like, yeah, he trains there all the time and he beat Eddie Alvarez. Like that's a big deal. I think it's a big factor over there too, that they don't cut weight. I think that's a bad factor if you're used to being the bigger fighter all the time. Yup. And then all of a sudden now you're not, now no one's cutting any weight. I mean they, they have some sort of a system. Ben Asked her was explaining it to me. I don't really remember how it works, but there's some sort of a system where they stop you from cutting.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Yeah. Like the check your hydrated check your hydration levels, yet you gotta be some other way to do it. And he's the right, he's correct. He's smart. It's the right way to do it. We should've done it a long time ago in the UFC. I really think that all the way cut issues, all that stuff, like ruining cards, all that, it would all be eliminated, right? Yes. Ruining cards. And even more importantly, I think causing fighters to fight it less than their full potential. How many fighters got hit when they shouldn't have gotten hit because if they were recovered completely, if they didn't have to, uh, not recover completely. But if they, they didn't have to recover from a weight cut. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's shots you ate because that you wouldn't have eaten. Yeah. Right. Especially if you are some guys cutting a brutal amount of weight.

Speaker 1:          02:15          It's entirely possible that you could get hit with something you wouldn't have. You didn't have to cut weight or author. Yeah. Right. We got five more often and the training would be a lot better too because we wouldn't like a lot of fighters spending the last three weeks, four weeks of their fight or their cap. China's weight lose weight. It's, it's the whole way, the approach of learning and building strength and all that stuff that you could do. So I don't know. I think it'd be awesome. The only argument forward is that the guys are tough enough to do it and cut a shitload of weight, have this massive size advantage and sometimes it allows them to win and they think they should be able to do it because they're tough enough to cut all that weight. Yeah, I get it. I mean it does.

Speaker 1:          02:56          It's hard to do. You have to be a strong person, but I just don't think it's good for anybody. I don't think it's good for the athletes. I don't think it's good for the sport. I don't think it's good for anybody. It's just an old way. It's just an old thing that people are doing so they don't have to fight the bigger people. You know? It's crazy because I have to answer that question a lot for people who don't, like some of my friends are just like, oh, like they'll hit me up like, hey am I can't talk this week. Like I got to cut weight, like it's not a good time. And they're like, fuck, how do you, how do you lose 20 pounds in a day and why do you do that? You know? I'm just like, I don't know how to explain it. It's just because that's what we do, you know?

Speaker 1:          03:31          There's not really, it's just what I have to do. When you see certain fighters get on the scale though, like Conor Mcgregor, when he made one 45 crazy, looked like a, like a Zombie man is walking dead character. Yeah. I was like, Holy Shit Man. He looks like the ice king. Yeah. What's that? No, the winter king is the, what do you call them? The night tonight? Yeah. The night king. He did look like the Nike, but did you see him when he fought at, uh, when he fought Nate? Nate at one sone. Look Great. You look great. Right? Right. There's a difference. Definitely. Yeah. I mean there's, wow, get the difference it saying, oh my kids are happy right there. He's just like, yeah, I just, yeah, I just had a burger. I know what to sleep good. And then what's the math and the other one? He's like, yeah, dude, he's on death's door right there. Really? Only three months apart. Four months apart. 2015 and March, 2016 is that right? Yeah. Wow. Wow. You know what's crazy too? Sometimes wait, cutting messes up the mind to cause you see yourself so shredded, right. At one point in your life. And then like, I can get maybe like five pounds. I'm like, ah, man, I'm out of shape. Like I gotta get back in shape. Yeah. You get accustomed to it. Yeah.
