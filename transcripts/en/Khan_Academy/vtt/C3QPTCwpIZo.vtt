00:00:00.727 --> 00:00:02.023
Voiceover:Let's see if we can factor

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:06.242
36a to the eighth, plus
2b to the sixth power

00:00:06.242 --> 00:00:07.558
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:09.789
and try it out on your own.

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.885
So let's see if we can express this,

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:15.960
or re-express this as
the difference of squares

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.209
using imaginary numbers.

00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:22.088
So we can rewrite 36 as, six squared,

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:24.367
and a to the 8th is the same thing as,

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.318
a to the fourth squared,
and so let me actually

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:28.307
just rewrite it this way.

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:33.247
We can rewrite it as 6a
to the fourth squared.

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:36.180
That's this first term right over here.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.210
And then the second
term we can write it as,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.435
actually just let me
write it this way first.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:44.378
Let me just write it as a square.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:51.944
Plus, the square root of 2, b
to the third power, squared.

00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:54.337
Now we wanted to write it
as a difference of squares.

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:56.454
So instead of writing it this way,

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:58.217
let's get rid of this plus, and let's -

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:03.373
so let me clear that out,
and I could write it as

00:01:03.373 --> 00:01:08.826
subtracting a negative one times that,

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:11.391
and negative one, we
know, is the same thing

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.497
as i squared, so we can rewrite this

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:18.130
whole thing as 6a to the fourth, squared.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.910
And then we have this minus
right over here, minus.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.177
And so this is i squared.

00:01:24.177 --> 00:01:25.356
Negative one is i squared.

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:30.162
So we can rewrite this
in this pink color as

00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:34.650
i times the square root of
two, times b to the third,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.514
all of that squared.

00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:38.673
Notice i squared is negative one.

00:01:38.673 --> 00:01:41.463
Square root of two squared, is two.

00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:45.817
B to the third, squared,
is b to the sixth power.

00:01:45.817 --> 00:01:46.851
If I raise something to an exponent,

00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:47.860
and then raise it to another exponent,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.894
I would multiply the two exponents.

00:01:49.894 --> 00:01:51.432
And so now I've expressed it as

00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:54.881
a difference of squares,
so we're ready to factor.

00:01:54.881 --> 00:02:00.107
This is going to be equal
to 6a to the fourth,

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:06.649
minus i times the square root of two,

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.193
times b to the third, times -

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.335
and let me get myself space here,

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:24.369
times 6a to the fourth,
plus all of this business,

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.139
i times the square root of 2,

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.461
times b to the third
power, and we are done.
