00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.790
To recap, over the course of this lesson we've discussed

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
a bunch of the basic skills required to do data wrangling

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.860
or data munching. So we've discussed some of the formats

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.670
that data might come in. Such as CSV, [UNKNOWN], and xml.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.720
We've also talked about how to get this data from

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.820
a variety of sources. Such as SQL like databases, flat files,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.090
and API's. We've also talked about how to look at the

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.460
data, see if things look all right, and if they don't,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.880
some of the methods to mitigate these problems, such

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.410
as data imputation. Over the course of doing these

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.190
basic acquisition and cleaning tasks, you'll usually discover some

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.640
basic things about your data. But you might also want

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.460
to do some more sophisticated analysis to learn some

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.210
more subtle things about your data set. That's what

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.150
we'll learn in the next lesson, and then we'll

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.320
apply those insights to the New York City subway data.
