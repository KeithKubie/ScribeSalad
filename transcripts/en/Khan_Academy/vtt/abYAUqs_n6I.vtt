00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.820
Let's say I have this matrix
B, here, and I want to know

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.330
what the null space of B is.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.720
And we've done this multiple
times but just as a review,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.000
the null space of B
is just all of the

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.570
x's that are a member.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.640
It's all the vector x's that
are member of what?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.410
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 that are members
of r to the fifth, where B, my

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.540
matrix B, times any of these
vector x's, is equal to 0.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.000
That's the definition
of the null space.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.500
I'm just trying to find the
solution set to this equation

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.100
right here.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.030
And we've seen before, that the
null set of the reduced

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.830
row echelon form of B is equal
to the null set of B.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.180
So what's the reduced row
echelon form of B?

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.340
And this is actually almost
trivially easy.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.460
Let me just take a couple of
steps right here-- to get a 0

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.940
here, let's just replace row
2 with row 2 minus row 1

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.760
So what do we get?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.280
Row 2 minus row 1.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.500
Row 1 doesn't change, it's
just 1, 1, 2, 3, 2.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.800
And then row 2 minus row 1.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.110
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050
1 minus 1 is 0.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.670
3 minus 2 is 1.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.080
1 minus 3 is minus 2.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.580
4 minus is 2 is 2.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.230
We're almost there.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.250
Let's see, so this is a free
variable right here.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.780
This is a pivot variable
right here.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.130
We have a 1.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.740
So let me get rid of that
guy right there.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.060
And I can get rid of that guy
right there, by replacing row

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.170
1 with row 1 minus
2 times row 2.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.390
So now row 2 is going
to be the same.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.010
0, 0, 1 minus 2, 2.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.550
And let me replace row 1 with
row 1 minus 2 times row 2.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.450
So 1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.510
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.800
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.870
3 minus 2 times minus 2.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.850
So that's 3 plus
4 is 7, right?

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.380
2 times this is minus 4 and
we're subtracting it.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.230
And then 2 minus 2 times
2-- that's 2 minus

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.150
4-- it's minus 2.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.270
So this is the reduced row
echelon form of B is equal to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.370
that right there.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.240
And then if I wanted to figure
out its null space, I have x1,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.180
x2, x3, x4, and x5 equaling--
I'm going to have two 0's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.050
right here.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.770
Now I can just write this
as just a set of

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.290
or a system of equations.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.750
So let me do that.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.725
I get x1.

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:54.020
I'm going to write my pivot
variables in a green color.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.670
x1 plus 1 times x2, so plus
x2, plus 0 times x3.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.460
Plus 7 times x4.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.610
Minus 2 times x5 is equal
to that 0 right there.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.350
And then I get my--
this is x3, right?

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.250
0 times x1 plus 0 times
x2 plus 1 times x3.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:35.080
So I get x3 minus 2 times x4
plus 2 times x5 is equal to

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.220
that 0 right there.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.860
And then if we solve for our
pivot variables, right?

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.790
These are our free variables.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.570
We can set them equal
to anything.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.440
If we solve for our pivot
variables what do we get?

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.960
We get x1 is equal to-- I
should do that in green.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.760
The color coding helps.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:03.790
I get x1 is equal to minus x2
minus 7x4 plus 2x5, just

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.390
subtracted these from both
sides of the equation.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.690
And I get x3 is equal to--
we've done this multiple

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.770
times-- 2x4 minus 2x5.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.410
And so if I wanted to write
the solution set in vector

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.320
form, I could write my solution
set or my null space,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.570
really, is-- or all
the possible x's.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.220
x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.970
This is my vector
x, that's in r5.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.460
It is equal to a linear
combination of these.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.770
So let me write it out.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.900
The free variables are x2 times
some vector right there.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.750
Plus x-- is x3, no x3 is
not a free variable.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.130
Plus x4, that's my next free
variable, times some factor.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.290
Plus x5 times some vector.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.350
I've run out of space.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.180
Plus x5 times some vector.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.570
And what are those vectors?

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.630
Let's see.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.960
I don't want to make this too
dirty, so let me see if I can

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.680
maybe move-- nope that's not
what I wanted to do.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.430
Let me just rewrite this.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.980
I haven't mastered this pen
tool yet, so let me

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.690
rewrite this here.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.390
So x3 is equal to
2x4 minus 2x5.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.650
Let me delete this right
over here so I

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:34.900
get some extra space.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.065
Cross that out.

00:05:39.065 --> 00:05:40.910
I think that's good enough.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.050
So I can go back to what
I was doing before.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.590
x5 times some vector
right here.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.440
And now what are
those vectors?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.650
We just have to look
at these formulas.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.470
x1 is equal to minus
1 times x2.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.020
So minus 1 times x2.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.980
Minus 7 times x4.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.370
Plus 2 times x5.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.300
Fair enough.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.292
And what is x3 equal to?

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:05.510
x3 is equal to 2x4.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.910
2x4, right?

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.200
It had nothing to do with x2
right here, so it's equal to

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.540
2x4 minus 2x5.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.830
And then 0 times x2, right?

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.960
Because it had no x2
term right here.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.950
And then what is x2 equal to?

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.390
Well x2 is just equal
to 1 times x2.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.540
And so all of these terms
are 0 right there.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.300
And I want you to pay
attention to that.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.280
I'll write it right here.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.850
x2 is a free variable, so it's
just equal to itself, right?

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.300
1 and you write a 0 and a 0.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.510
x4 is a free variable.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.360
And this is the important
point of this exercise.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.920
So it's just equal to
1 times itself.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.400
You don't have to throw in any
of the other free variables.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.940
And x5 is a free variable.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.870
So it just equals 1 times itself
and none of the other

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.050
free variables.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.420
So right here we now say that
all of the solutions of our

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.120
equation Bx equals 0, or the
reduced row echelon form of B

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.080
times x is equal to 0,
will take this form.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.090
Or they are linear combinations
of these vectors.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.890
Let's call this v1,
v2, and v3.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.530
These are just random
real numbers.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.665
I can pick any combination here
to create this solution

00:07:26.665 --> 00:07:29.120
set, or to create
our null space.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:35.230
So the null space of A, which is
of course equal to the null

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.810
space of the reduced row echelon
form of A, is equal to

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.900
all the possible linear
combinations of these 3

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:53.340
vectors, is equal to the span
of my vector v1, v2, and v3.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.490
Just like that.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.730
Now, the whole reason I went
through this exercise--

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.690
because we've done this multiple
times already-- is to

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.560
think about whether these guys
form a linear independent set.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.090
So my question is are these
guys linearly independent?

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.670
And the reason why I care is
because if they are linearly

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.290
independent then they
form a basis for

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.490
the null space, right?

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.860
That we know that they span the
null space, but if they're

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.020
linearly independent,
then that's the 2

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.010
constraints for a basis.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.970
You have to span the subspace,
and you have to be linearly

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:27.900
independent.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.210
So let's just inspect these
guys right here.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.480
This v1, he has a
1 right here.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.460
He has a 1 in the second term
because he corresponds to the

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.620
free variable x2, which is
the second entry, so we

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.780
just throw a 1 here.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.960
And we have a 0 everywhere
else in all of the other

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.210
vectors in our spanning set.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.180
And that's because for the other
free variables we always

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.815
wanted to multiply them
times a 0, right?

00:08:54.815 --> 00:08:57.060
And this is going to
be true of any null

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.960
space problem we do.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.670
For any free variable, if this
free variable represents a

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.100
second entry, we're going
to have a 1 in the

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.150
second entry here.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.060
And then a 0 for the second
entry for all of the other

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.900
vectors associated with the
other free variables.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.330
So can this guy ever be
represented as a linear

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.890
combination of this
guy and that guy?

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.730
Well there's nothing that I can
multiply this 0 by and add

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.240
to something that I multiply
this 0 by to get a 1 here.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.670
It's just going to get 0's.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.330
So this guy can't be
representated as a linear

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.880
combination of these guys.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.880
Likewise, this vector
right here has a 1

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880
in the fourth position.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.940
Why is it a fourth position?

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.570
Because the fourth position
corresponds to its

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.410
corresponding free
variable, x4.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.750
So this guy's a 1 here.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.190
These other guys
will definitely

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.410
always have a 0 here.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.020
So you can't take any linear
combination of

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.710
them to get this guy.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.590
So this guy can't be represented
as a linear

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.860
combination of those guys.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.640
And last, this x5 guy, right
here, has a 1 here.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.610
And these guys have 0's here.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.000
So no linear combination of
these 0's can equal this 1.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.500
So all of these guys are
linearly independent.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.790
You can't construct any of
these vectors with some

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.180
combination of the other.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.950
So they are linearly
independent.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:19.390
So v1, the set v1, v2, and v3
is actually a basis for the

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:23.770
null space, for the null space
of-- Oh, you know what, I have

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.480
to be very careful.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.330
For the null space of B.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.940
Just for variety, I defined my
initial matrix as matrix B, so

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.970
let me be very careful here.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.930
So the null space of B was equal
to the null space of the

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.700
reduced row echelon form of B.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.910
It's good to switch things up
every once in a while, you

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.280
start thinking that
every matrix is

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.420
named A if you don't.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.540
And that's equal to the
span of these vectors.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.550
So these vectors, and we just
said that they're linearly

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.980
independent.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.470
We just showed that because
there's no way to get that one

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.780
from these guys, that one from
these guys, or that one from

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.820
these guys.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.420
These guys form a basis for
the null space of B.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.300
Now this raises an interesting
question.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.090
In the last video, I defined
what dimensionality is.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.550
And maybe you missed
it because that

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.080
video was kind of proofy.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:14.730
But the dimensionality, the
dimension, of a subspace--

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:25.760
I'll redefine it here-- is the
number of elements in a basis

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.220
for the subspace.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.830
And in the last video I took
great pains to show that all

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.030
bases for any given subspace
will have the

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.190
same number of elements.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:38.740
So this is well defined.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:44.760
So my question to you now is:
what is the dimension of my

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.560
null space of B?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.630
What is that the dimension
of my null space of B?

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.200
Well, the dimension is just
the number of vectors in a

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.420
basis set for B.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.280
Well this is a basis set
for B right there.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.880
And how many vectors
do I have in it?

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.000
I have 1, 2 3 vectors.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.670
So the dimension of the
null space of B is 3.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.760
Or another way to think about
it-- or another name for the

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.510
dimension of the null space
of B-- is the nullity, the

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:14.970
nullity of B.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.410
And that is also equal to 3.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.870
And let's think about
it, you know I went

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.010
through all this exercise.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.480
But what is the nullity of any
matrix going to be equal to?

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.520
It's the dimension of
the null space.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.520
Well the dimension of the null
space-- you're always going to

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.360
have as many factors here as
you have free variables.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:41.680
So in general, the nullity of
any matrix of any matrix--

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:49.160
let's say matrix A-- is equal
to the number of I guess you

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.110
could call it free variable
columns or the number free

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:59.950
variables in, well, I guess we
call it in the reduced row

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.790
echelon form, or I guess we
could say the number of

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.290
non-pivot columns.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:14.700
The number of non-pivot columns
in the reduced row

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:15.730
echelon form of A.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.665
Because that's essentially the
number of free variables-- all

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:21.780
of those free variables have
an associated, linearly

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.880
independent vector with
each of them, right?

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.970
So the number of variables is
the number of vectors you're

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.450
going to have in your basis
for your null space.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.650
And the number of free variables
is essentially the

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.970
number of non-pivot columns
in your reduced row

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.870
echelon form, right?

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.520
This was a non-pivot column,
that's a non-pivot column,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.870
that's a non-pivot column.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.370
And they're associated
with the free

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.510
variables x2, x4, and x5.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.710
So the nullity of a matrix is
essentially the number of

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.910
non-pivot columns in the reduced
row echelon form of

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.940
that matrix.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.110
Anyway, hopefully you found
that vaguely useful.
