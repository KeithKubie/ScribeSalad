[Vsauce 2]

00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:06.888
The MV Blue Marlin is
a semi-submersible heavy lift ship

00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:11.717
designed to transport giant things,
like drilling rigs and destroyers.

00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:15.339
Here's the ship carrying
a ship full of ships.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.615
What the FAK?

00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:20.982
The Facts and Knowledge
on Really Big Machines.

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:24.790
Bucket wheel excavators are used
in surface mining

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.019
as a continuous digging machine.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.639
The massive wheel consists
of buckets used to scoop material as it turns

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:34.761
in large-scale open pit mining operations.

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:41.352
The Bagger 293
is the largest terrestrial vehicle in human history.

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:44.179
The largest single-bucket digging machine
ever created

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.179
was the Big Muskie.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:50.192
The coal mining drag line
weighed 13,000 metric tons

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:52.584
and was 22 stories tall.

00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:56.671
The bucket could hold
two Greyhound buses side by side,

00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.757
and it took over 200,000 man hours
to construct.

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:04.101
Excavators are capable
of some ridiculous maneuvers,

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.119
like using one
to undress a woman

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.602
or like this Liebherr excavator
climbing to the top

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:12.642
of a specially-designed platform.

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:15.359
This is super!

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.585
[♪ music ♪]

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:23.496
Liebherr's T282C
diesel electric mining trucks are gigantic.

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:27.606
They can transport
363 metric tons

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:30.648
and have a top speed
of 40 miles per hour.

00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:33.477
The NEESgrid is a network
of earthquake researchers

00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:36.612
that use equipment
like these giant centrifuges.

00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:39.932
This one is located
at Renselaer Polytechnic Institute

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.788
and is able to generate
200 Gs,

00:01:42.788 --> 00:01:45.342
or 200 times
the earth's gravitation,

00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:49.099
and can spin a sample
weighing up to one and a half tons.

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.600
To dig through the Earth,
tunnel boring machines are used,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.549
like this one,
planning to dig below London

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.549
over the next three years.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.318
The 150-meter-long machines
weigh nearly a thousand tons

00:02:01.318 --> 00:02:05.985
and operate 24 hours a day,
digging about 100 meters per week.

00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:10.025
Staying underground is the largest machine
ever built.

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:12.825
CERN's large hadron collider—
it's located

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:16.842
574 feet
below the Franco-Swiss border

00:02:16.842 --> 00:02:19.949
in a tunnel 17 miles
in circumference.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.826
The gargantuan high-energy particle accelerator
is being used

00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:26.473
to test different theories
of particle physics

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:28.473
and high energy physics.

00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:31.024
Accelerating up
to three miles per hour

00:02:31.024 --> 00:02:35.529
is the self-propelled modular transporter,
a multi-axle trailer

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.801
designed to transport extremely large
and heavy cargo.

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:44.793
This video shows it transporting
two 510-ton steam generators.

00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:47.835
It has hydraulic drive power
and steering

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:50.110
and 208 wheels.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.267
If you're moving spacecraft,
you might want a crawler-transporter.

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:57.215
These huge vehicles
have eight tracks,

00:02:57.215 --> 00:03:00.367
weigh 2,721 tons,

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.797
and use a laser-guided system
to keep

00:03:02.797 --> 00:03:06.927
the mobile launcher platform level
within ten minutes of arc,

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:11.176
an angular measurement
equal to 1/60 of one degree.

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:15.216
For the largest movable,
technical, industrial machines

00:03:15.216 --> 00:03:20.789
in the world, look no further
than the Overburden Conveyor Bridge F60.

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:24.713
This thing is used to transport
the overburden over the coal seam,

00:03:24.713 --> 00:03:28.056
which is basically the rocks
and soil that are on top,

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:31.307
and this image shows its scale
with the Eiffel Tower.

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:35.254
The Falkirk Wheel is
a rotating boat lift in Scotland.

00:03:35.254 --> 00:03:38.969
It connects the Forth and Clyde Canal
with the Union Canal

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:41.686
and is open to the public,
if you want to hop on a boat

00:03:41.686 --> 00:03:44.263
and spin around
this awesome steel wheel.

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:47.909
Finally, the Midnight Rider
is the world's heaviest limousine.

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.181
At 50,560 pounds,
it has a bar,

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:55.640
three different lounges,
and holds 40 passengers.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.869
I'm going to leave you
with this thing—

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:00.052
what is it,
and what does it do?

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:02.606
Before we go,
here's last video's winner.
