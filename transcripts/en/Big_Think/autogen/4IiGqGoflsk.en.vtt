before the first birthday this has

unanticipated benefits you can measure

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660
unanticipated benefits you can measure
 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.120
unanticipated benefits you can measure
them in the laboratory so when you bring

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130
them in the laboratory so when you bring
 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.700
them in the laboratory so when you bring
these babies in they are better able to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
these babies in they are better able to
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160
these babies in they are better able to
for instance resolve conflict cues they

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
for instance resolve conflict cues they
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.839
for instance resolve conflict cues they
are better able to unlearn a rule that

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
are better able to unlearn a rule that
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.980
are better able to unlearn a rule that
they learn so for instance if they

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
they learn so for instance if they
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.779
they learn so for instance if they
learned that pulling on a string leads

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
learned that pulling on a string leads
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.490
learned that pulling on a string leads
to a mobile moving or something else

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
to a mobile moving or something else
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.140
to a mobile moving or something else
that they like if the rule suddenly

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
that they like if the rule suddenly
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.359
that they like if the rule suddenly
changes they're more rapidly able to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
changes they're more rapidly able to
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.279
changes they're more rapidly able to
resolve that conflict and learn the new

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
resolve that conflict and learn the new
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.779
resolve that conflict and learn the new
rule and so one thing that's interesting

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789
rule and so one thing that's interesting
 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.550
rule and so one thing that's interesting
is that there seem to be ancillary

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
is that there seem to be ancillary
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.230
is that there seem to be ancillary
benefits that come from learning a

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
benefits that come from learning a
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.880
benefits that come from learning a
second language that don't seem to have

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
second language that don't seem to have
 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.590
second language that don't seem to have
anything to do with the learning of the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
anything to do with the learning of the
 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660
anything to do with the learning of the
language itself a relatively advanced

version of this is something that

version of this is something that

show you the letter the word red except
it's written in green ink and you have

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
it's written in green ink and you have
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.630
it's written in green ink and you have
to say well what color is that in and it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
to say well what color is that in and it
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.580
to say well what color is that in and it
says red and you have to resist the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
says red and you have to resist the
 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.350
says red and you have to resist the
impulse to say red and you say it's in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
impulse to say red and you say it's in

green ink children who are bilingual are

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
green ink children who are bilingual are
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.310
green ink children who are bilingual are
better at the Stroop task they're better

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
better at the Stroop task they're better
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590
better at the Stroop task they're better
at resolving those kinds of cues there

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600
at resolving those kinds of cues there
 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.549
at resolving those kinds of cues there
are other benefits that come from

are other benefits that come from
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.709
are other benefits that come from
learning a second language as well one

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
learning a second language as well one

benefit that comes out of it that you
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.099
benefit that comes out of it that you
might not expect is that children who

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
might not expect is that children who
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049
might not expect is that children who
know two languages are better what is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
know two languages are better what is

you're looking at the door and you're

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
you're looking at the door and you're
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.429
you're looking at the door and you're
thinking about who's behind the door or

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
thinking about who's behind the door or
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.140
thinking about who's behind the door or
you're thinking about lunch or whatever

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
you're thinking about lunch or whatever
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060
you're thinking about lunch or whatever
it might be if I have a good model of

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
it might be if I have a good model of
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.649
it might be if I have a good model of
what you're thinking about that's the

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
what you're thinking about that's the
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.270

general capacity called theory of mind

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280
general capacity called theory of mind
 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.340
general capacity called theory of mind
and bilingual children have been

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
and bilingual children have been
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.870
and bilingual children have been
demonstrated to have a little bit better

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880
demonstrated to have a little bit better
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399
demonstrated to have a little bit better
theory of mind and that's interesting

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
theory of mind and that's interesting
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590
theory of mind and that's interesting
because theory of mine has itself many

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
because theory of mine has itself many
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569
because theory of mine has itself many
ancillary benefits like having empathy

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
ancillary benefits like having empathy
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.980
ancillary benefits like having empathy
for other people it's even been

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
for other people it's even been
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.960
for other people it's even been
demonstrated that dementia the loss of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
demonstrated that dementia the loss of
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.550
demonstrated that dementia the loss of
cognitive function as we get older is

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
cognitive function as we get older is
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.069
cognitive function as we get older is
delayed by an average of about four

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
delayed by an average of about four
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.300
delayed by an average of about four
years and people who are bilingual

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
years and people who are bilingual
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670
years and people who are bilingual
compared with people who do not speak a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
compared with people who do not speak a
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.499
compared with people who do not speak a
second language and so you get lots of

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
second language and so you get lots of
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.690
second language and so you get lots of
lots of benefits from being bilingual

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
lots of benefits from being bilingual
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550
lots of benefits from being bilingual
and this persists throughout life it's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
and this persists throughout life it's
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440
and this persists throughout life it's
even been demonstrated that that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
even been demonstrated that that
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.120
even been demonstrated that that
whatever demands being bilingual makes

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
whatever demands being bilingual makes
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920
whatever demands being bilingual makes
on our brains continue all the way

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
on our brains continue all the way
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.060
on our brains continue all the way
through life

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
