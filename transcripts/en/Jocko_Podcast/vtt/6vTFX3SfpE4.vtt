The Path, the war path,

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.240
path of war,

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.140
moving toward a battle,

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.370
fight towards

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.440
the actual war against our nation's enemies. Yes.

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.270
The war against my own weaknesses.

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.213
Preparing

8
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.490
and sharpening my sword and homie my skills and maintaining [inaudible] on

9
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.390
mitigated daily discipline. Flint

10
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.820
in all things.

11
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.170
Where does it lead?

12
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.343
<v 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.050
<v 0>you can blog too. It's fun fact,</v>

14
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.423
<v 1>uh,</v>

15
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.253
<v 0>ready</v>

16
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.540
because the warpath is a,

17
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.020
it's so, it leads to strength.

18
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.560
It's a war against ignorance,

19
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.560
leads to knowledge.

20
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.090
[inaudible] movers

21
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.020
don't war path to

22
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.653
ownership.

23
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.300
And that is the war path.

24
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.893
The path

25
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.180
versus the path of blood. And the sweat in of suffering

26
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.650
is the preeminent path of distance, which is why

27
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.500
and beyond that,

28
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.530
<v 2>oh.</v>
