00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:03.489
- It is truly a genius of a creation.

00:00:04.498 --> 00:00:07.165
I'm going to take my first bite.

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:16.518
Wow, that rice, it's
like a combination of a

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:17.851
rice and omelet.

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:26.035
What's up everyone, it's Mark Wiens with

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:29.572
migrationology.com in Jakarta, Indonesia.

00:00:29.572 --> 00:00:32.815
It is mid morning and Ying
and I are walking over

00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:36.148
to Glodok, which is Jakarta's Chinatown.

00:00:37.126 --> 00:00:39.072
And actually, we don't
really have any plans

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.213
of what we're gonna do there, not really,

00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:44.353
but we're just gonna walk around, explore,

00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:46.507
probably find some street food.

00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:49.739
There's a lot of traffic,
as usual, on this road,

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.848
so that's why we are walking.

00:00:51.848 --> 00:00:53.694
We're going to beat the traffic and we're

00:00:53.694 --> 00:00:56.527
gonna explore Jakarta's Chinatown.

00:01:13.864 --> 00:01:16.591
We took the back way to get to Chinatown,

00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:17.674
through the back streets,

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:20.207
but we are definitely in Chinatown now.

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:22.289
The whole, it's still Jakarta, but you can

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.230
definitely feel that it's Chinatown.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.236
We passed a couple of
Chinese temples already,

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:31.450
and you can see some of
the old Chinese buildings

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.466
that are evidence that
we are in Chinatown,

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.360
as well as, I think
we're gonna walk through

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.529
a market soon, I've seen some
people carrying lots of bags.

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:42.835
And also, in Chinatown, they
also have bicycle rickshaws

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.085
which are available for transportation.

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:57.662
We have gotten to the
market section of Glodok.

00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:01.280
There is a lot of beautiful
looking fruits and vegetables.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.491
And actually, this Chinatown
kinda reminds me of

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:08.148
Bangkok's Chinatown, Yaowarat,
very, a lot of similarities.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:10.600
And it's a very tight, and busy place.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.509
A lot of business and commerce and

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.842
markets everywhere you look.

00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:41.334
We just took a turn down a side alley,

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:43.716
this is just a walking alley,

00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:47.790
and we are in route to
a famous coffee shop.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.557
I think it's somewhere down
here and maybe to the right.

00:02:51.557 --> 00:02:54.217
The market street is a
really great atmosphere,

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:56.997
but then when you get down
on these even side alleys,

00:02:56.997 --> 00:03:00.046
it's really quiet back
here and really nice.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.535
A lot of people are very friendly,

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:05.050
and there are lots of
random things for sale.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.300
Just look at this quantity of avocados.

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:48.525
We're just walking through the alley,

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:50.467
we haven't made it to the coffee shop yet,

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:54.634
but I saw a guy selling
siomay from his motorbike.

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:58.941
He had a variety of different
things in his steamer,

00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:00.813
and we kind of just chose a
number of different things.

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:02.800
I think these are the actual
siomay and then there's

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.543
some tofu and then he also
had one with bitter melon.

00:04:05.543 --> 00:04:08.213
I think pork stuffed into bitter melon so

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:09.544
I got one of those.

00:04:09.544 --> 00:04:12.955
And then this is definitely
a Chinese style of a dish,

00:04:12.955 --> 00:04:16.042
but what really makes it
Indonesian is that they

00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:18.081
serve it with peanut sauce.

00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:19.879
So, after he finished slicing them all up,

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:22.579
he put a big scoop of
peanut sauce and then

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.375
he squeezed on some kecap
manis which is sweet soy sauce.

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:29.478
And I think that's kind of a
chili sauce on the side there.

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:32.289
So, I'm gonna try one of these first.

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.706
Dip it into the peanut sauce.

00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:44.521
Wow, that has a very
squishy kind of texture.

00:04:46.706 --> 00:04:50.623
Almost like mochi glutinous
rice texture to it.

00:04:54.428 --> 00:04:57.782
And then at the tail end of my bite,

00:04:57.782 --> 00:04:59.970
then I can taste some sesame oil and maybe

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.303
a little bit of minced pork.

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:09.031
That's just a straight
up piece of tofu with the

00:05:09.031 --> 00:05:12.004
sweet peanut sauce and a little bit of

00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:13.921
chili in there as well.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.502
I really love bitter melon, it has such a

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:21.850
wonderful bitter flavor.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.093
And then it's juicy and has a,

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:26.760
like a cucumber crispness to it.

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:38.535
(inaudible)

00:05:42.426 --> 00:05:44.220
As I was eating that plate of siomay I was

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.328
standing right across the street from a

00:05:46.328 --> 00:05:50.112
vegetarian restaurant and
the owner here is really nice

00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:52.095
and he invited us to try some of his all

00:05:52.095 --> 00:05:54.085
vegetarian Indonesian food.

00:05:54.085 --> 00:05:55.857
And what I really want to taste,

00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:57.241
I think I'm just going
to get a small taste,

00:05:57.241 --> 00:05:59.824
because we might have a lot of,

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:04.673
So, he has a whole spread of
different Indonesian dishes

00:06:04.673 --> 00:06:09.243
all vegetarian and the one
that I really want to taste

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:12.018
is rendang which is one of
the most famous Indonesian

00:06:12.018 --> 00:06:14.153
dishes and it happens to
be a favorite of mine,

00:06:14.153 --> 00:06:17.448
as well, but I have never had
a vegetarian version of it.

00:06:17.448 --> 00:06:19.875
I didn't want to order a
whole plate of food with rice

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:21.738
because I think we
still have a lot to eat,

00:06:21.738 --> 00:06:25.139
so I just got some of
the rendang to taste it.

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:26.594
This is the rendang vegetarian.

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.274
What is in the rendang?

00:06:29.274 --> 00:06:33.949
- Mushroom, we make it out
of mushroom, black mushroom.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:35.959
- I could have a mistaken it for chunks

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.542
of meat definitely.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.885
Even on the inside it
looks kind of like meat.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:45.468
That looks like a big meatball.

00:06:52.552 --> 00:06:54.802
That's really good, oh wow.

00:06:56.278 --> 00:06:59.952
It's like meat but it's more tender.

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:03.148
It almost tastes like pulled beef,

00:07:03.148 --> 00:07:05.682
but that is all mushroom.

00:07:05.682 --> 00:07:07.827
That rendang is delicious actually.

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:11.018
It's a little bit spicy,
you can taste the coconut,

00:07:11.018 --> 00:07:13.020
and these are some kind
of spring roll types of

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.436
things and he said it might taste a

00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:17.353
little bit like shrimp.

00:07:23.267 --> 00:07:25.350
I think that's bean curd.

00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:37.001
That's awesome.

00:07:37.855 --> 00:07:41.195
That is my kind of
vegetarian bite right there,

00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:45.331
just solid mushrooms, it's
like compressed mushrooms.

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:48.275
That was impressively good,
especially that rendang.

00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:51.362
And, so, if you're looking
for all vegetarian food

00:07:51.362 --> 00:07:55.445
in Jakarta in Chinatown,
it's right in this lane.

00:07:56.954 --> 00:07:58.269
And I'm not sure the name of this lane,

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:01.686
but that was really good vegetarian food.

00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:26.943
We finally made it to the
famous, legendary coffee shop.

00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:29.844
This place is called Kopi Es Tak Kie.

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:34.011
It is an old school Chinese
Indonesian coffee shop.

00:08:35.064 --> 00:08:36.610
And it has a lot of history to it,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.604
if you look around you
can see a lot of photos

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:42.203
on the wall and a lot of
famous people, I believe,

00:08:42.203 --> 00:08:44.234
have come here for coffee.

00:08:44.234 --> 00:08:47.962
It's really humid and I
decided it would be a good

00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:50.212
idea to order a hot coffee.

00:08:56.216 --> 00:08:58.679
Oh, that is a good black cup of coffee.

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.679
The coffee is so smooth.

00:09:01.947 --> 00:09:03.498
And I get it sugarless, so it's just

00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:06.512
straight up black coffee,
but really smooth.

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:10.195
It doesn't have much acid,
and just a good, clean

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:11.991
chocolatey flavor.

00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:15.824
And this an indoor coffee
shop and they have a

00:09:16.988 --> 00:09:19.715
number of different street
food stalls that set up

00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:21.816
right outside the door of this shop,

00:09:21.816 --> 00:09:24.343
and so you can order street food and then

00:09:24.343 --> 00:09:25.792
they will deliver it inside so you can sit

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:29.041
down at the table as long
as you're ordering drinks

00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:31.052
and eat the street food from outside.

00:09:31.052 --> 00:09:32.486
And one of the options
right outside the door

00:09:32.486 --> 00:09:35.542
is Nasi campur and Nasi campur is actually

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:39.301
just means rice and mixed everything.

00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.069
There's some crispy pork
belly, I think that's gizzard.

00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:43.420
This is like boiled chicken.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.642
There's a tiny sliver of an egg.

00:09:46.642 --> 00:09:50.504
I think this is the char
siu, the roast pork,

00:09:50.504 --> 00:09:52.671
the roasted barbecue pork.

00:09:57.691 --> 00:10:00.894
That's a lot more
flavorful than it looked.

00:10:00.894 --> 00:10:02.420
That rice is really good.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.803
And then that pork is very lean and

00:10:04.803 --> 00:10:06.565
it's actually quite tender.

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:07.836
But I think it would be
improved with some of this

00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:11.086
chili sauce, let me add that over here.

00:10:12.682 --> 00:10:14.599
And that's a little piece of pork belly.

00:10:14.599 --> 00:10:18.599
And I think that is
gizzard, looks like gizzard.

00:10:24.005 --> 00:10:27.558
That's like a sour, salty chili sauce.

00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:29.251
And then that's definitely gizzard,

00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:32.646
it has a very crisp texture to it.

00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:34.839
And then actually I don't
think that was pork belly,

00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:36.555
I think it might have been chicken,

00:10:36.555 --> 00:10:39.235
maybe with a roasted skin.

00:10:39.235 --> 00:10:42.084
Chase that with some of this soup,

00:10:42.084 --> 00:10:45.251
and there's a vegetable in it as well.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.241
It's a very plain, but very salty soup.

00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:56.494
And that vegetable is a
little bit sour, vinegary,

00:10:56.494 --> 00:10:58.630
so I think it's a pickled mustard green or

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.157
something like that.

00:11:00.157 --> 00:11:03.657
Dip it into the sauce, that's like sausage

00:11:07.785 --> 00:11:10.657
wrapped around the skewer.

00:11:10.657 --> 00:11:11.878
Okay, it's pretty sweet.

00:11:11.878 --> 00:11:14.132
That was a good coffee break stop and

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:17.372
another plate of food and
now we are just walking

00:11:17.372 --> 00:11:18.844
back down the alley.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.150
There are so many different
choices of foods to

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.983
eat within this alley.

00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:48.922
We took a little walk down the road

00:11:48.922 --> 00:11:51.234
and they have a lot of street food carts

00:11:51.234 --> 00:11:54.406
and so I spotted a snack
that I wanted to try.

00:11:54.406 --> 00:11:57.216
It is, there are a lot
of different variations

00:11:57.216 --> 00:11:59.293
of this that I've seen
all over Southeast Asia.

00:11:59.293 --> 00:12:02.226
It's very similar in
cooking style method to a

00:12:02.226 --> 00:12:05.134
Sri Lankan hopper, but
it's cooked in a little

00:12:05.134 --> 00:12:08.391
personalized rounded
skillet and what he does,

00:12:08.391 --> 00:12:09.515
the batter is green.

00:12:09.515 --> 00:12:11.503
What he does is, he scoops in some batter,

00:12:11.503 --> 00:12:15.325
kinda sloshes it around and then it cooks.

00:12:15.325 --> 00:12:17.363
He puts the lid on and
then it cooks so that

00:12:17.363 --> 00:12:20.112
the edges are crispy
and then in the center

00:12:20.112 --> 00:12:24.195
it's kind of fluffy and
kind of like waffle-like.

00:12:32.098 --> 00:12:34.514
The edges are crispy all the way.

00:12:34.514 --> 00:12:37.490
And then the inside is
kind of sticky, gooey.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.444
It's sweet and I'm not
sure but I think the

00:12:40.444 --> 00:12:44.313
fragrance might be pandan
because of that greeness.

00:12:44.313 --> 00:12:48.480
And it sort of has a very
light, vanilla-y essence.

00:12:51.254 --> 00:12:55.421
That's a very simple, but kind
of tasty sweet pancake snack.

00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:23.634
One of the most common
types of street food

00:13:23.634 --> 00:13:27.433
that you'll find in Jakarta
are deep fried items.

00:13:27.433 --> 00:13:30.565
And, so, all over the street
you'll find carts with a big

00:13:30.565 --> 00:13:32.804
wok full of oil deep frying,

00:13:32.804 --> 00:13:35.819
an assortment of different
things and so for our next

00:13:35.819 --> 00:13:38.141
street food snack I
just ordered a couple of

00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:39.523
deep fried items.

00:13:39.523 --> 00:13:42.543
The first thing I got is
a pisang goreng which is

00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:44.435
a deep fried banana.

00:13:44.435 --> 00:13:46.729
He took the banana and
he kind of sliced it,

00:13:46.729 --> 00:13:49.043
but then kept the banana
all together and kind of

00:13:49.043 --> 00:13:52.488
made it into a finger/hand shape.

00:13:52.488 --> 00:13:54.468
It's almost like a little glove mitt.

00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:58.176
How he cut it like this,
in strips but keeping

00:13:58.176 --> 00:14:00.022
the whole thing together, it
gives it more surface area

00:14:00.022 --> 00:14:01.571
for more crunchy batter and I think it's a

00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:05.738
pretty cool way to cut a
banana for deep frying it.

00:14:12.677 --> 00:14:14.892
That is quite a lot of batter.

00:14:14.892 --> 00:14:18.878
And it's very crispy
and then there's kind of

00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:21.851
a lot of batter to banana ratio,

00:14:21.851 --> 00:14:25.184
but then on the inside is the very sweet

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.630
and kinda custard-y banana.

00:14:32.836 --> 00:14:34.477
It's like a little banana sandwich.

00:14:34.477 --> 00:14:36.980
For many of my growing up
years, I lived in Africa,

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.470
in central Africa.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.458
And when my family was
living in the Democratic

00:14:40.458 --> 00:14:45.309
Republic of Congo, I used to
eat breadfruit all the time.

00:14:45.309 --> 00:14:47.592
But then, since I was
a child I haven't had

00:14:47.592 --> 00:14:49.427
breadfruit very often
and even where I live

00:14:49.427 --> 00:14:51.575
in Thailand, in Bangkok, breadfruit is

00:14:51.575 --> 00:14:53.367
not very common at all, actually.

00:14:53.367 --> 00:14:54.702
You can see sometimes
on the tree, but it's

00:14:54.702 --> 00:14:56.202
very rarely eaten.

00:14:57.069 --> 00:15:00.793
So, I was happy to see he
has deep fried breadfruit.

00:15:00.793 --> 00:15:04.960
This is just a big slice
of breadfruit deep fried.

00:15:13.257 --> 00:15:15.594
That brings back some great memories.

00:15:15.594 --> 00:15:17.279
Breadfruit is awesome.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:20.285
This is just a natural
phenomena of a fruit.

00:15:20.285 --> 00:15:24.825
It is really like a very
starchy, starchy bread.

00:15:24.825 --> 00:15:27.543
Kinda like a cross
between bread and potato.

00:15:27.543 --> 00:15:28.917
Actually kinda like cassava.

00:15:28.917 --> 00:15:31.301
It has that really dry starchiness to it

00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:34.639
and then this one is just
really nicely salted, as well.

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:38.472
So, it's like a salty,
silky, bread-y, potato.

00:15:41.924 --> 00:15:44.198
And then it does have a little
bit of a fruity taste to it.

00:15:44.198 --> 00:15:46.198
But that's really heavy.

00:15:51.588 --> 00:15:53.114
I think partly why I like
this so much is because

00:15:53.114 --> 00:15:56.235
I grew up, when I was a kid, eating this

00:15:56.235 --> 00:15:59.194
and I have so many memories of breadfruit.

00:15:59.194 --> 00:16:03.434
That is such a starchy,
it's delicious actually.

00:16:03.434 --> 00:16:04.267
I really like it.

00:16:04.267 --> 00:16:06.126
It's very heavy and dry.

00:16:06.126 --> 00:16:08.898
Chinatown's around the
world in different cities

00:16:08.898 --> 00:16:11.432
are one of my favorite places to explore.

00:16:11.432 --> 00:16:14.022
And Chinatown here in
Jakarta has been great.

00:16:14.022 --> 00:16:17.703
There's a lot of food and a
lot of cool places to explore.

00:16:17.703 --> 00:16:20.692
If you just kind of wander
around these alleys.

00:16:20.692 --> 00:16:22.576
But Ying and I are gonna
start heading a little

00:16:22.576 --> 00:16:25.496
ways North to some of the other historical

00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:28.579
buildings not too far away from here.

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:44.865
Crossing the street in
this area is definitely

00:16:44.865 --> 00:16:48.396
not the easiest situation,
but we gotta cross now.

00:16:48.396 --> 00:16:52.605
We are in the old historical
heritage area of Jakarta now.

00:16:52.605 --> 00:16:56.688
And there is a lot of
traffic in every direction.

00:17:02.712 --> 00:17:05.852
We made it to the old area
of Jakarta which is called

00:17:05.852 --> 00:17:09.447
Fatahillah which is the
old Dutch colonial area.

00:17:09.447 --> 00:17:13.856
There are a lot of heritage
Dutch buildings in this area.

00:17:13.856 --> 00:17:15.547
We're now in the big square,
so we're just going to

00:17:15.547 --> 00:17:18.360
walk around here for a
little bit and just enjoy

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360
the scenery.

00:17:24.507 --> 00:17:26.882
Within this square, a
lot of people are renting

00:17:26.882 --> 00:17:30.168
very colorful neon bikes
and just riding around.

00:17:30.168 --> 00:17:32.021
And then there a lot of students,

00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:33.618
and we met up with a group of students,

00:17:33.618 --> 00:17:37.442
and they wanted to ask
some questions about

00:17:37.442 --> 00:17:38.932
why we are traveling to Indonesia

00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:40.887
and what we like about
traveling to Indonesia.

00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:43.005
And then one of the questions
they asked me was why

00:17:43.005 --> 00:17:45.191
did you guys come to Indonesia?

00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:48.521
And when I told them that
we came to Indonesia to eat,

00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:51.771
they all thought that was pretty funny.

00:18:32.191 --> 00:18:33.781
I wasn't sure if we were
gonna be able to find

00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:36.481
this one street food
snack that I really wanted

00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:38.648
to try called kerak telor.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.355
And we happened to find it so we got lucky

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:44.855
and he is making it right now.

00:19:07.609 --> 00:19:11.173
It was really genius watching him make it.

00:19:11.173 --> 00:19:13.543
What he does is, he
first takes some raw rice

00:19:13.543 --> 00:19:15.524
and then puts it into
the bottom of the wok.

00:19:15.524 --> 00:19:17.461
And then he really heats up the wok,

00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:19.555
heats up that fire, fans the flames.

00:19:19.555 --> 00:19:22.270
And then he added a bunch
of different seasonings

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.568
including, I know there's some coconut

00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:27.277
and probably some salt,
I'm not sure what else.

00:19:27.277 --> 00:19:30.365
And then after that he
cracked in egg and then mixed

00:19:30.365 --> 00:19:33.473
it all up until it was
like a slushy omelet rice

00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:35.110
mixture.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.669
And the true genius of
what he does after that is,

00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:40.470
he actually flips the wok over,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.594
so, you would think gravity would make the

00:19:43.594 --> 00:19:47.277
entire rice omelet mixture
just fall out of the wok,

00:19:47.277 --> 00:19:49.563
but somehow it stays on
the bottom of the wok

00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.011
even thought it's flipped upside down.

00:19:51.011 --> 00:19:53.935
And that's when he really
fans the flames strong

00:19:53.935 --> 00:19:56.589
so it's a big fire that
comes up to the bottom

00:19:56.589 --> 00:20:00.256
of the wok there and just
kind of scorches that

00:20:00.256 --> 00:20:02.506
rice and egg mixture.

00:20:02.506 --> 00:20:04.997
And then once it's ready,
he flips it back over,

00:20:04.997 --> 00:20:07.204
he scoops it out with a
spatula, adds on some more

00:20:07.204 --> 00:20:11.110
seasoning, including a
handful of crispy shallots,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:15.027
sticks it onto a piece
of paper and it's ready.

00:20:25.845 --> 00:20:27.147
This is a street food snack
that definitely has some

00:20:27.147 --> 00:20:29.531
history in Indonesia and
I know that it was very

00:20:29.531 --> 00:20:32.145
popular since the colonial Dutch times.

00:20:32.145 --> 00:20:35.395
And it is truly a genius of a creation.

00:20:37.195 --> 00:20:39.862
I'm going to take my first bite.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.854
Wow, that rice, it's like a combination of

00:20:51.854 --> 00:20:53.484
a rice and omelet.

00:20:53.484 --> 00:20:57.651
And then there is definitely
some coconut in there.

00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:02.868
But it's not sweet, just
natural coconut, I think.

00:21:02.868 --> 00:21:05.219
Like dried coconut,
it's a little bit crisp.

00:21:05.219 --> 00:21:08.410
But that basically just
tastes like a roasted

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.743
rice egg omelet.

00:21:15.455 --> 00:21:19.399
It tastes like the
bottom of clay pot rice.

00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:23.375
The crunchy, kind of
slightly burnt bottom.

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:26.098
So, it has that crispiness,
but then with egg

00:21:26.098 --> 00:21:27.535
mixed in and dried coconut.

00:21:27.535 --> 00:21:29.512
I'm really happy that we
had a chance to try that

00:21:29.512 --> 00:21:32.081
final Jakarta street food.

00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:34.613
It's kind of a simple combination,

00:21:34.613 --> 00:21:37.138
but I love the way he makes it.

00:21:37.138 --> 00:21:40.243
And part of street food and eating snacks

00:21:40.243 --> 00:21:43.273
is just enjoying the
atmosphere and watching

00:21:43.273 --> 00:21:45.376
them cook the food right before you.

00:21:45.376 --> 00:21:49.015
And that is just an absolute
genius of a street food snack.

00:21:49.015 --> 00:21:51.455
I think I enjoyed it
more watching the process

00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:54.344
of it being made than even eating it.

00:21:54.344 --> 00:21:57.784
I think that is gonna be
the end for today's video

00:21:57.784 --> 00:22:00.289
about Jakarta street food.

00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:03.037
It's been wonderful walking around.

00:22:03.037 --> 00:22:07.042
I am just drenched and hot
and sweaty to the core,

00:22:07.042 --> 00:22:08.768
so I think we're gonna
jump in a taxi and head

00:22:08.768 --> 00:22:10.576
back to our hotel now.

00:22:10.576 --> 00:22:12.708
Thank you all very much
for watching this video.

00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:14.446
