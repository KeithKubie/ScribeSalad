integrative oncology is that aspect of

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059
integrative oncology is that aspect of
 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.709
integrative oncology is that aspect of
oncology that is concerned with the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
oncology that is concerned with the
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.740
oncology that is concerned with the
totality of factors that are important

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
totality of factors that are important
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.990
totality of factors that are important
both in the prevention and the treatment

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
both in the prevention and the treatment
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.009
both in the prevention and the treatment
of cancer and those include conventional

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
of cancer and those include conventional
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.679
of cancer and those include conventional
forms of therapy everything from

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
forms of therapy everything from
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.279
forms of therapy everything from
chemotherapy to radiation therapy to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
chemotherapy to radiation therapy to
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.729
chemotherapy to radiation therapy to
bone marrow transplants to monoclonal

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739
bone marrow transplants to monoclonal
 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.040
bone marrow transplants to monoclonal
antibodies to targeted therapies all

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050
antibodies to targeted therapies all
 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.130
antibodies to targeted therapies all
those things it's also very concerned

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
those things it's also very concerned
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.180
those things it's also very concerned
with screening and early detection and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
with screening and early detection and
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.400
with screening and early detection and
it's also concerned with all the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
it's also concerned with all the
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.100
it's also concerned with all the
nutritional factors that we know are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
nutritional factors that we know are
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.680
nutritional factors that we know are
important not only for preventing cancer

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
important not only for preventing cancer
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.080
important not only for preventing cancer
and associated with risk reduction of

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
and associated with risk reduction of
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389
and associated with risk reduction of
cancer but also in the treatment of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
cancer but also in the treatment of
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.889
cancer but also in the treatment of
cancer and it's very important for

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
cancer and it's very important for
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.319
cancer and it's very important for
people to be concerned about their

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
people to be concerned about their
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479
people to be concerned about their
immune systems and their detoxification

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
immune systems and their detoxification
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.600
immune systems and their detoxification
systems so both those are part of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
systems so both those are part of
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.750
systems so both those are part of
integrative oncology as well and there

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
integrative oncology as well and there
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.350
integrative oncology as well and there
are two scientific branches that are

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
are two scientific branches that are
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.810
are two scientific branches that are
very important now to integrative

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
very important now to integrative
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.190
very important now to integrative
oncology one is called nutritional

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200
oncology one is called nutritional
 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.789
oncology one is called nutritional
genomics nutritional genomics is the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799
genomics nutritional genomics is the
 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.219
genomics nutritional genomics is the
interaction of nutrients with the genes

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
interaction of nutrients with the genes
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.190
interaction of nutrients with the genes
that can turn on or off cancer with the

genes that are responsible for the
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359
genes that are responsible for the
production of our detoxifying enzymes

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
production of our detoxifying enzymes
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910
production of our detoxifying enzymes
those are our first line of defense

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
those are our first line of defense
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.249
those are our first line of defense
against many of the environmental toxins

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
against many of the environmental toxins
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.770
against many of the environmental toxins
were all exposed to in the air and our

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
were all exposed to in the air and our
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.399
were all exposed to in the air and our
food and our water those type of things

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
food and our water those type of things
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.760
food and our water those type of things
and also there's a field called toxic Oh

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
and also there's a field called toxic Oh
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.940

for decades and fatty tissue many of
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.820
for decades and fatty tissue many of
these affect our DNA as well and so

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
these affect our DNA as well and so
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.350
these affect our DNA as well and so
they're almost competing

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
they're almost competing
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.900
they're almost competing
scientific realms where nutritional

part of integrative oncology is stress

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320
part of integrative oncology is stress
 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.760
part of integrative oncology is stress
reduction because we know there are two

really new fields that are incorporated
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.500
really new fields that are incorporated
into integrative oncology one is called

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510
into integrative oncology one is called
 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.300
into integrative oncology one is called
psychoneuroimmunology the other is

psychoneuroimmunology is the study of
 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.320
psychoneuroimmunology is the study of
how stress depression pessimism all

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330
how stress depression pessimism all
 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.780
how stress depression pessimism all
those negative emotions literally

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790
those negative emotions literally
 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.630
those negative emotions literally
depress every aspect of our immune

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640
depress every aspect of our immune
 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.199

system there was a fascinating study out

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209
system there was a fascinating study out
 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.300
system there was a fascinating study out
of Ohio State several years ago

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310
of Ohio State several years ago
 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.550

published in the Journal of the National
 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.100
published in the Journal of the National
Cancer Institute and what that study did

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110
Cancer Institute and what that study did
 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.350
Cancer Institute and what that study did
was look at women who are recovering

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360
was look at women who are recovering
 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.080
was look at women who are recovering
from breast cancer surgery they found

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090
from breast cancer surgery they found
 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.060
from breast cancer surgery they found
that women with the most depression and

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070
that women with the most depression and
 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.240
that women with the most depression and
stress had the most profound suppression

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250
stress had the most profound suppression
 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.850
stress had the most profound suppression
of the very part of their immune systems

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860
of the very part of their immune systems
 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.720
of the very part of their immune systems
that we know is very responsible for

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730
that we know is very responsible for
 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.720
that we know is very responsible for
preventing a recurrence of the cancer so

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730
preventing a recurrence of the cancer so
 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.530
preventing a recurrence of the cancer so
we know equally that positive emotions

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540
we know equally that positive emotions
 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.220
we know equally that positive emotions
optimism peacefulness those type of

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230
optimism peacefulness those type of
 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.970
optimism peacefulness those type of
emotions upregulate every aspect of the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980
emotions upregulate every aspect of the
 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.190
emotions upregulate every aspect of the
immune system so it's very important

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200
immune system so it's very important
 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.800
immune system so it's very important
both for prevention and even if you have

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810
both for prevention and even if you have
 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.350
both for prevention and even if you have
the disease to look at how stress

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360
the disease to look at how stress
 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.080
the disease to look at how stress
affects you how old traumas and patterns

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090
affects you how old traumas and patterns
 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.240
affects you how old traumas and patterns
affect you so that's a very very

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250
affect you so that's a very very
 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.509
affect you so that's a very very
important part of your own cardiology

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519
 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.429
the other point that I'll just get back

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439
the other point that I'll just get back
 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.800
the other point that I'll just get back
to that I mentioned is neuro cardiology

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810
to that I mentioned is neuro cardiology
 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.289
to that I mentioned is neuro cardiology
neuro cardiology is about the link

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299
neuro cardiology is about the link
 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.599
neuro cardiology is about the link
between the brain and the heart and

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609
between the brain and the heart and
 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.270
between the brain and the heart and
there's all these neurologic pathways

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280
there's all these neurologic pathways
 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.300
there's all these neurologic pathways
between our brains in our heart and the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310
between our brains in our heart and the
 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.969
between our brains in our heart and the
reason that's important is when we're

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979
reason that's important is when we're
 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.819
reason that's important is when we're
stressed one of the first things that

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829
stressed one of the first things that
 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.279
stressed one of the first things that
happens is our breathing changes it

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289
happens is our breathing changes it
 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.980
happens is our breathing changes it
becomes very shallow second thing that

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990
becomes very shallow second thing that
 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.040
becomes very shallow second thing that
happens as our heart rhythms in what's

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050
happens as our heart rhythms in what's
 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.589
happens as our heart rhythms in what's
known as heart rate variability so it's

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599
known as heart rate variability so it's
 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.629
known as heart rate variability so it's
not your heart rate per se but how much

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639
not your heart rate per se but how much
 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.029
not your heart rate per se but how much
your heart rate is changing second to

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039
your heart rate is changing second to
 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.219
your heart rate is changing second to
second minute to minute your heart rate

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229
second minute to minute your heart rate
 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.680
second minute to minute your heart rate
variability increases its high when

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690
variability increases its high when
 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.450
variability increases its high when
you're under stress so your breathing

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460
you're under stress so your breathing
 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.310
