which would be ad units ad clients

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
which would be ad units ad clients
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.190
which would be ad units ad clients
channels all of that information as well

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200
channels all of that information as well
 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.960
channels all of that information as well
as the ability to run reports on your

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970
as the ability to run reports on your
 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.840

so what is an API let's see an example

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329
so what is an API let's see an example
 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.480
so what is an API let's see an example
imagine you want to create a widget for

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490
imagine you want to create a widget for
 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.130
imagine you want to create a widget for
your smartphone that checks the weather

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140
your smartphone that checks the weather
 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.410
your smartphone that checks the weather
you'll need some way to fetch this

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
you'll need some way to fetch this
 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.450
you'll need some way to fetch this
information from in this example we

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460
information from in this example we
 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.190
information from in this example we
query this fake weather API where you

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200
query this fake weather API where you
 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.440
query this fake weather API where you
specify in a city in the query parameter

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450
specify in a city in the query parameter
 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.480
specify in a city in the query parameter
if we open that with a browser we get

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490
if we open that with a browser we get
 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.789
if we open that with a browser we get
something like this a response with a

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799
something like this a response with a
 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.010
something like this a response with a
non structure that we can easily pause

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020
non structure that we can easily pause
 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.550
non structure that we can easily pause
usually requests and responses use XML

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
usually requests and responses use XML
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.719
usually requests and responses use XML
or JSON as container formats so let's go

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729
or JSON as container formats so let's go
 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.020
or JSON as container formats so let's go
a real API now this is the API Explorer

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030
a real API now this is the API Explorer
 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.389
a real API now this is the API Explorer
which is an awesome tool for learning

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399
which is an awesome tool for learning
 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.059
which is an awesome tool for learning
how to use Google API s-- and also is

great for debugging problems in this
 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.529
great for debugging problems in this
case we're making a request against the

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539
case we're making a request against the
 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.440
case we're making a request against the
YouTube data API and we're using the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
YouTube data API and we're using the
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.199

looking for so of course what you've
 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.780
looking for so of course what you've
seen here so far is all raw requests

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790
seen here so far is all raw requests
 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.360
seen here so far is all raw requests
against the API now you don't have to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370
against the API now you don't have to
 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.100
against the API now you don't have to
code everything by hand

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110
code everything by hand
 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.110
code everything by hand
we actually have client libraries for a

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120
we actually have client libraries for a
 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.070
we actually have client libraries for a
number of different programming

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080
number of different programming
 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.410
number of different programming
languages that make your job a lot

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
languages that make your job a lot
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.210
languages that make your job a lot
easier by handling a lot of the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220
easier by handling a lot of the
 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.240
easier by handling a lot of the
boilerplate stuff such as authentication

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250
boilerplate stuff such as authentication
 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.440
boilerplate stuff such as authentication
discovering services since we have so

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450
discovering services since we have so
 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.560
discovering services since we have so
many api's we actually built a discovery

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570
many api's we actually built a discovery
 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.500
many api's we actually built a discovery
service that lists all of them and also

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510
service that lists all of them and also
 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.850
service that lists all of them and also
other things such as building the

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860
other things such as building the
 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.450
other things such as building the
requests parsing the responses etc so

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460
requests parsing the responses etc so
 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.580
requests parsing the responses etc so
here you can see examples for four

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590
here you can see examples for four
 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.640
here you can see examples for four
different languages as you can see it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650
different languages as you can see it
 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.310
different languages as you can see it
makes the requests much easier to use

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320
makes the requests much easier to use
 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.199
makes the requests much easier to use
that than coding everything by hand

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209
that than coding everything by hand
 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.940
that than coding everything by hand
especially handling things like

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950
especially handling things like
 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.270
especially handling things like
authentication the first example is Java

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
authentication the first example is Java
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.970
authentication the first example is Java
enlists the add clients of a knack of an

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980
enlists the add clients of a knack of an
 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.100
enlists the add clients of a knack of an
account in the second example you can

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110
account in the second example you can
 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.250
account in the second example you can
get I mean it's a Python example that

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260
get I mean it's a Python example that
 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.100
get I mean it's a Python example that
gets the ad units for a client ID the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110
gets the ad units for a client ID the
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.350
gets the ad units for a client ID the
PHP sample gets the custom channels

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360
PHP sample gets the custom channels
 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.910
PHP sample gets the custom channels
applied to an ad unit and the last

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920
applied to an ad unit and the last
 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.920
applied to an ad unit and the last
example defines how would you how you

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930
example defines how would you how you
 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.750
example defines how would you how you
would configure of reporting in c-sharp

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760
would configure of reporting in c-sharp
 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.550
would configure of reporting in c-sharp
so some of the important features the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560
so some of the important features the
 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.840
so some of the important features the
most important features actually when

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850
most important features actually when
 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.840
most important features actually when
you're doing reporting is the ability to

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850
you're doing reporting is the ability to
 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.030
you're doing reporting is the ability to
have your own channels and these

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040
have your own channels and these
 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.650
have your own channels and these
channels come in two types custom

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660
channels come in two types custom
 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.900
channels come in two types custom
channels and URL channels the first

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910
channels and URL channels the first
 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.270
channels and URL channels the first
custom channels are defined by you and

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280
custom channels are defined by you and
 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.540
custom channels are defined by you and
you can assign an ad unit or multiple ad

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550
you can assign an ad unit or multiple ad
 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.630
you can assign an ad unit or multiple ad
units to a channel and so this allows

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640
units to a channel and so this allows
 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.910
units to a channel and so this allows
you to give specific meanings two sets

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920
you to give specific meanings two sets
 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.199
you to give specific meanings two sets
of ad units you could have for example

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209
of ad units you could have for example
 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.210
of ad units you could have for example
set for all of the ad units that display

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220
set for all of the ad units that display
 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.400
set for all of the ad units that display
on the top where versus all of the ad
