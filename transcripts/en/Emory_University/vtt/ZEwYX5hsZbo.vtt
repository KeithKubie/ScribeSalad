00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:14.120
I met my first husband Jeff, we were
in a singing group in the Catholic Church. That was what we met.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.480
We fell in love and got married in a small christian church in Brooklyn.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.060
We married for about two years before I got pregnant with our first son Jonathan.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.300
My second son was born in November of 1985.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.920
I remember we had gone to New York. I
guess when he was about 5 or 6 months old.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.300
A friend of mine had, you know, contacted me that he was sick with HIV.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:54.820
So it was the first time that HIV had really hit close to me. I actually knew someone that had HIV.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.080
So that was really the first time that, you know, it came that close to me.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.420
I didn't know at the time hearing about his illness that it would even come closer.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:18.520
Our second son Joshua Paul was sick. He
was about, he was over a year old.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.140
He started getting sick, just lymph nodes
swelling and just runny nose.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.080
He was always kind of a sickly kid up until
that point.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.420
He was, he was not diagnosed with HIV, you know, when he was with his doctors.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.260
Let's put it this way he wasn't diagnosed with HIV while he was alive.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:46.880
I guess it was in July of 1987 that we decided to get him tested for HIV.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.500
I was pregnant at the time, with my third child.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:03.080
So anyway, sad to say that his disease process just got worse and worse and worse until he passed away.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.820
The phone rang and it was Joshua Paul's oncologist and she had some news for us about his HIV test.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.380
It had come back positive. I was like okay well, you know during his cancer treatment he had some blood transfusions.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.180
She says well you know they were screening the blood transfusions at that point.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.680
There's no way that he could have gotten it from a blood transfusion.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.380
The only way that he could have gotten it was from you.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:38.000
I was just like me, excuse me, you know I
had always been the wife of one person.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.960
I was faithful to my husband and I was, like you know, I'm not, I'm not a gay man.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.040
I'm not, what are you telling me, you think you got it from me I don't get HIV.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.560
I never had a blood transfusion. You know so I was like, already my mind was  working trying to figure out what happened.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.220
Where could this had come to our family?

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.140
We were advised through our my obstetrician, and just different doctors that we were in contact with,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.300
for all of us to get tested. So it was a very long drawn-out process back then.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.300
But we all got tested. Jeff had tested positive for HIV.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.120
I tested positive for HIV.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.800
The fate of our unborn child was unknown at that time.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.360
In December of 1987 my daughter, Anna Lisa, was born.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:35.660
She was sick from six weeks of age, and from six weeks of age they diagnosed her with full-blown AIDS.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.020
So that was really a hard pill to swallow.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.020
After Anna Lisa passed away and Jeff's health really started to fail, at that point we just were sort of holding out.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.060
We knew that there were a lot of things that scientists were working on to try to develop therapy for HIV.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:09.740
So I guess it was a little bit too late for him in 1996 when boosted Boosted PIs came out and combination therapy came out.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.920
But he was already in hospice care at that time.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.020
So we did try to put him on it. But, you know, because he couldn't eat

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.100
and couldn't swallow, whatever, it just never really worked for him.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.960
So he passed away in 1996. I felt like I was going to be next.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.520
We lost Joshua Paul. We lost Anna Lisa. I
lost Jeff.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:41.220
Jonathan was HIV negative, my oldest son. Then I felt like okay out of all of us I'm next.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.520
That's how I felt, because it was just watching everybody just wither away and die.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.780
Then you yourself having only 73 t-cells you just knew that you were the next one. There wasn't anything around.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:01.240
I guess it was like the end of 1995, I can't remember the dates to be honest with you.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.060
I went on combination therapy.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.500
I was on Combivir which was AZT and 3TC or AZT and lamivudine with Crixivan.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.260
I showed a remarkable recovery.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.480
I became undetectable and had my t-cells above 200

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.140
and right now, I don't know, they're in the 600 range.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.260
I've been undetectable ever since. So you
know it was just for me

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.840
the therapy that came out at that time was a literally a lifesaver.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.580
I was diagnosed in 1987 but I knew that
I had it in 1985 because that's when my son was born.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.680
So now here it is 10, 11 years later and you're saying,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.060
here's these drugs, you gotta live now, figure out your life.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.640
You know a lot of people had sold their insurance policies and things like that. I mean I didn't go ahead and do that.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.960
So what does life look like now. You know, what does living look like now.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.820
Part of living for me was always being involved in the church.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.780
Being a member of a church. I was a member of a church and I started teaching a Sunday School in a singles group.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.880
Everybody in my church, everybody in the singles group knew about my HIV.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.560
So I'm like, okay I'm not here for a man.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.760
I'm just here for friends, you know. But
there was a this guy, that I became friends with

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.060
in the singles group at church. We were just friends and

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.920
he kept like looking at me with these eyes,
like that didn't look like friendship eyes.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:45.300
I was like wait a minute, no back off, you know we're not, we're friends you know.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.360
So anyway was during that period of time

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.320
that Daryl Swanson entered my life, and
you know, started pursuing me in a romantic way

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.760
which felt so unusual to me. Because you know I hadn't done that for years.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.320
You know, and I was just like, you know I have HIV.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.720
He's like, yeah I know, so what.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.060
You know and it was like really, like so what, are you sure.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:16.520
He's like yea, so what, and finally we decided to get married.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:24.240
Lo and behold in June of 2000 we got married and we've been married every since.
