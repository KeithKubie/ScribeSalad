[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:42.500
PAUL SAXMAN: Hello and welcome
to a special pre-I/O episode

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.850
of Google Maps Developers
live.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.880
This week Brendan, Mano, and I
have been joined by a team,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.270
Instrument, who's working on a
map dive exhibit for Google

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.260
I/O. They're going to give
us a demo and introduce

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.340
themselves.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490
And then we'll talk a little
bit about the technology.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.290
So with that, Instrument team,
do you guys mind letting us

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.063
know what you're working
and who you are?

00:02:05.063 --> 00:02:06.450
MARTIN LINDE: I'm
Martin Linde.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.440
I'm the creative director on
the project at some of the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.910
labs groups here
at Instrument.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.917
BEN PURDY: And I'm Ben Purdy,
and I am a technical lead and

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:16.900
have been doing a bunch of the
development on this thing.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.600
MARTIN LINDE: So just a little
background about Instrument.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.950
We're a small, or medium
sized creative agency

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.060
in Portland, Oregon.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.700
And we actually started out as
basically purely a dev shop

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.340
with just a little bit
of design farmed out.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.350
And it's grown to about 80
people now doing everything

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.960
from website development to
motion graphic and content

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.420
production.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.405
And it's a cool opportunity to
be working on this project,

00:02:40.405 --> 00:02:43.290
particularly since that's what
the labs group within

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.460
Instrument was formed as.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.220
So we'd love to show you the
demo of the Map Diving.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.790
So Ben will go outside,
and I will try to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.400
narrate what he's doing.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.380
So what you're seeing right now
on the seven big screens

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.260
here are the attract mode.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.660
And Ben will raise his arms to
sort of attract Pegman to fly

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.160
towards him.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.120
And now he will raise his arms
so that the Kinect or the Asus

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.470
device will recognize him.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.990
It will do like a pirouette and
then fly over a countdown

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.510
above the clouds.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.660
And that's just to orient the
user as to what's going on.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.280
And let them get a
feel for flying.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.560
And now the level starts.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.930
So he's diving down towards
a zoomable Google Map.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.150
And the objective of
the game is to hit

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.070
gates and bonus stars.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.430
And the way that it works
is if you have your arms

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.300
stretched out, you're planing
out and can sort of move

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.920
vertically in the air--

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.560
or horizontally, sorry.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.830
And then when you move your
arms closer to your

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.800
body, you will dive.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.610
And so that's what he's
doing right here.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.560
And he does a little loop once
he hits a gate and a barrel

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.580
roll when he hits a star.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.180
And every so often, the map will
reload to get you closer

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.660
to the ground, so to speak.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.400
And it's super responsive and
fun to watch, even, and even

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.340
more fun to play.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.130
So we'll let just Ben
show his skill.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.670
And he purposefully missed
an object in space there.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.260
People at I/O will be able
to see the bonus

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.050
rounds there will be.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.900
There's 13 base maps that takes
on a normal Google Map.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900
And then there's about five
bonus modes that are just fun

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.780
takes, and more intense levels
that will give you bonus

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.650
multipliers and more points.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.960
So we look forward to
showcasing those.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.270
And so you see in the
distance there sort

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.720
of a pulsing graphic.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.210
And that's kind of
the drop zone.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.990
And so you're diving over 13
locations in the world.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.690
And right now we're over Statue
of Liberty in New York.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.820
And so he has just managed to
hit the drop zone, and we'll

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.380
initiate the celebration
sequence right here.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.100
And so that's kind of a
cinematic cut sequence.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.400
And he will circle the Statue of
Liberty, and after a couple

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.110
of seconds, he basically
will take off up

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.750
into the sky again.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.120
And that's the basic gameplay.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.900
You can miss, and then a
parachute will deploy.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.630
So to show you that you
weren't quite as good.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.340
And then quickly you can get
back to it and try again.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.730
And so, without further ado,
here is Ben describing the

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.412
magic behind this thing.

00:05:23.412 --> 00:05:25.030
BEN PURDY: All right.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.960
So as you can see, this is a
multi-screen experience.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.190
I'll just go through, really
quickly, what is driving the

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.090
actual display and game.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.900
So each one of these seven
monitors is being run off of a

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.460
separate PC.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.010
And every single one of those is
just an instance of Chrome

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.390
running in full screen.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.070
This whole thing is built
on JavaScript and web

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.690
technologies.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.530
All of the communication is
handled through WebSockets

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.940
just routing messages through
an instance of Node.js.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:01.030
So there's no native custom apps
running except for the

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.990
body tracking, which is an
openFrameworks app using

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.340
OpenNI and a 3D camera,
sort of like a Kinect.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.800
So that's what's driving
this thing.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.520
Each of the view ports is
basically just showing the

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.560
current game state.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.690
And then we have another PC that
is not connected to any

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.010
of the game displays.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.200
There's a podium that you can
see in the scene there that is

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.350
running the game logic.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.100
And then game state is sent
out to all seven of the

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.090
displays at about 60 hertz,
which is what we try to keep

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.790
the frame rate at.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.270
So it's pretty ambitious
for something running

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.060
completely in Chrome.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.620
But it's been a breeze
to work with.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.020
And the synchronization between
the displays has been

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.380
not much of a problem at all.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.380
So that's basically
what's driving it.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.160
We use the three.js WebGL
library to do all of the 3D

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.330
objects in the foreground.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.580
And the map plane is
actually an HTML

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.350
Google Map that's live.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.730
There's no trickery going on.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.500
It's just being transformed
using 3D CSS to stay in sync

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.640
with the WebGL camera.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.790
So what you're seeing is an
actual live Google Map.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.250
If I hadn't turned off the user
input, you could actually

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.240
drag and zoom and pan
on the thing.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.000
Even though that would distort
the game experience, it really

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.090
is there, really is running.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.894
MARTIN LINDE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:22.894 --> 00:07:25.900
BEN PURDY: Yeah.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.810
So that's been a fun experience
trying to marry the

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.711
3D CSS with WebGL.

00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:34.960
Additionally, we had to do some
interesting trickery to

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.850
get the view synchronized.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.410
So what we ended up doing is
having a dummy object in 3D

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.570
space that we attached the
actual camera to, and then we

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.430
just offset the rotation of that
camera depending on the

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.580
view index.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.790
And then as long as each
viewport is rendering the same

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.620
scene, and since they're all
synchronized over the network,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.980
the scene stays in sync.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.720
Then once you put the view
side by side, everything

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.880
stitches together.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.120
So what I was also going to talk
about a little bit was

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.990
the tools that we had to make
to build this thing.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.970
And what we ended up doing is
building the tool to create

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.510
levels using, again it
just runs in Chrome.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.990
And then we used Google
Maps extensively

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.360
to create this tool.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.270
The whole game space is actually
tied to real world

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.230
coordinates.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.910
And so we just have a
translation between actual

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.990
latitude and longitude
and our game space.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.470
And so that makes it really easy
to design these courses

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.240
which are laid out at various
points over the globe.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.480
So we actually have a Google
Map where we can just drop

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.483
items and kind of practice
courses and

00:08:39.483 --> 00:08:40.500
that sort of thing.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.330
And so I can walk through the
editor here a little bit.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:47.360
You're going to have to forgive
my sort of UX-less

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.290
developer console
styling here.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.400
And another caveat I must say
is that I designed this to

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.390
work on the touch
screen podium.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.300
And so these big fat buttons
are as a result

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.080
of my big fat fingers.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.760
So I'll just run through
this really quick.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.590
Again, this is the behind the
scenes, nobody should have to

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.330
see this poor UI.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.490
But what I have here is both
the admin console that runs

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.220
the game, and then the editor
actually runs on top of this.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.960
So you can switch into edit mode
at any time, and it sort

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.120
of takes over the game play.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.110
So I've got an instance of the
game running on my local

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.710
machine here.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.540
So you can see that my little
Pegman is not falling because

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.230
I'm in edit mode right now.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.610
And so that lets me fly around
magically so that I can

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.580
position items and see
the layout better.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:40.540
And so in this admin console,
I've got a map on the left,

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.440
which is the overview
of the game space.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.455
And I've got markers
for the player.

00:09:45.455 --> 00:09:48.030
And I've got markers for gates
and items you can pick up and

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.920
landmarks and that
sort of thing.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.790
There's a lot of pieces that
I've added to make building

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:55.405
levels easier.

00:09:55.405 --> 00:09:56.990
So I can center on items.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.980
You can select items from this
list that are all of the

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.650
entities in the world.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.690
Double-clicking on
one of those will

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.190
center it in the view.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.930
All of these items
are interactive.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.220
One kind of cool thing.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.530
At first, I was building all
the levels just using

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:13.680
this top down view.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.840
And that turned out to be really
cumbersome because it's

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.280
really easy to make a level
that's unbeatable if you're

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.060
just doing it from
a top down view.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.310
And so eventually I merged the
editor, like I said, into the

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:24.630
actual game engine.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.786
And so with this new system
I'm actually able to--

00:10:28.786 --> 00:10:31.390
try to get this on
the screen here.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.070
All of the changes that I'm
making are actually sent live

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.680
to the viewports.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.630
So I'm not sure how well the
frame rate will translate to

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.283
this screen share, but you can
see that as I'm dragging one

00:10:41.283 --> 00:10:44.850
of the objects in the map view,
the 3D object in the

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.270
game space is also picking
up those changes.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.760
And the same thing goes for
creating new entities and that

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.690
sort of thing.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.970
So it's been really great to not
have to code all of this

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.730
map drag and drop.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.900
I use things like checking
to see if a

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.530
location is within bounds.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.280
I have some other niceties
to make sure I don't make

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.530
unbeatable levels.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.370
If I drag the start point for
the map around, I get this

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.100
nice ring that shows me how
far the player needs to be

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.030
from the drop zone to be
able to hit it in time.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.920
So I don't end up starting
the player too

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.100
far away or too close.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.760
And then I'm even using
geocoding, so that when we're

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.620
designing a level, I can just
type in the name of the

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.390
location, and it'll prepopulate
some search

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.820
results text that we end up
putting on the screen.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.820
So it's been really great, like
I said, to not have to

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.380
reinvent all of these
tools to build an

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.280
application like this.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.370
We've been able to just focus
on things like the game play

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.474
and the graphics.

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:49.740
PAUL SAXMAN: Very cool.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.760
So you can actually run all
this on your laptop then?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.470
I mean you can actually play
the game and everything?

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.080
BEN PURDY: Yeah, oh yeah.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.420
I mean before we had the seven
displays that we had the game

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.790
up and running.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.700
I can set the viewport
dynamically through a little

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.500
config file.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.930
So I would just literally open
seven little, tiny, tall,

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.960
skinny instances of Chrome and
line them up across the top of

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.580
my larger desk monitor.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.650
And then I could simulate what
it would be like when the

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.370
monitors showed up.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.620
And then when they showed up, we
just got Chrome running on

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.050
them and fired it up.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:24.120
And it was basically painless
to get this thing working on

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.690
the actual distributed
installation versus just on a

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.340
single computer.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.420
PAUL SAXMAN: So it sounds like
it's pretty much built all on

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.232
open technologies.

00:12:33.232 --> 00:12:34.940
BEN PURDY: Like I said,
we're using--

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.880
so it's all running in Chrome.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.900
All of the game logic is
JavaScript running in Chrome.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.980
And then Node.js is running
the communications.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.610
And it literally is just a hub
so that the game logic can

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.380
broadcast the game messages
out to the

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.850
seven display clients.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.300
And then the node also handles
routing the control

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.770
information from the body
tracking software.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.360
Which is just a UDP connection
to the Node.js, which then

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.990
sends the body tracking.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.980
It's just basically the
angle of your torso

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.210
compared to the ground.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.450
And then each arm compared
to the torso.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.320
So we just get three angles
that are being sent to the

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.460
control node at as fast
of a frame rate as

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.460
the thing can capture.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.760
And so then the control
node integrates that.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.220
I've got a way of normalizing
input so I can play off of the

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.010
keyboard or the body tracking.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.480
Or I even have a way to simulate
body tracking using

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.430
the mouse cursor.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.220
But that's built on
openFrameworks using OpenNI to

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.130
do the body tracking.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.420
Which was pretty fun to
do some debugging and

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:39.180
playing with that.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.340
We had a lot of fun trying to
work out some of the kinks of

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.590
having multiple people
in the scene at once.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.220
We did a lot of running around
in circles with lots of people

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:47.660
in the view.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.930
MARTIN LINDE: We should
show that.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:49.782
BEN PURDY: Yeah.

00:13:49.782 --> 00:13:51.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.863
BEN PURDY: Play that back at
like five times speed with a

00:13:53.863 --> 00:13:55.560
funny soundtrack.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.990
MANO: The most important
question right now is really

00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:59.660
who's the best player
right now?

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.350
BEN PURDY: Oh gosh.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.670
I would not want to take on
our technical director.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.970
He's pretty competitive.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.540
And every time I would come
around the corner to try to

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.900
test out some change, I would
have to kick him off because

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.416
he'd be there trying
to get it perfect.

00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:16.110
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, I heard when
we were chatting with you

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.980
guys earlier, there's some
talk about having a

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.720
leaderboard?

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.680
That would be--

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.390
BEN PURDY: Yeah.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.560
We're working on adding
some capabilities to

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.880
do competitive play.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.930
Just in terms of ability of
levels and being able to

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.100
one-up your buddies.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:37.460
PAUL SAXMAN: If not for I/O,
then maybe for the open source

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.100
release that we're going
to potentially do.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:40.540
BRENDAN KENNY: So you guys--

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.780
so this is obviously going to
be at I/O. And you guys are

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.210
going to be at I/O so that you
can talk to people about this.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.310
So I'm sure a number of
developers are going to be

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.100
very interested in
the tech stack.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.140
But then afterwards, can you
talk a little bit about your

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.666
plans for this, afterwards?

00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:00.640
BEN PURDY: Well, the plan right
now is that we would

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.230
like to release the code.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.295
It's going to need
a little bit of

00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:06.020
cleanup before that happens.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.480
The code base right now is very
much tuned to some of the

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:14.510
challenges of working on
a distributed display.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.930
It does work on a
single machine.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:22.030
And I don't foresee a lot of
integration and refactoring

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:26.430
effort required to get this all
working within a single

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.900
instance of Chrome.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.340
All I need to do is pull out the
code that would be talking

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.870
to Node.js and just basically
have like a

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.480
dummy message router.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.920
There's nothing that would
stop it from being like a

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.380
single player in a
single browser

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.090
experience at this point.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:40.090
BRENDAN KENNY: Oh great.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.530
MARTIN LINDE: We're also hoping
that some of the tools

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.280
that we use for designing levels
that Ben created, also

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.490
like a tool that our other
developer, [INAUDIBLE], wrote

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.820
to allow us to design tricks for
little Pegman, like barrel

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.810
rolls and flips and
glides and things.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.900
They'll be the last things we
add, but we would like to show

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.440
that too in open
source as well.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.700
BEN PURDY: There have been a
lot of fun little tools and

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.450
tricks along the way.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.720
We actually have full body
motion capture that was

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.335
driving an articulated
Pegman at one point.

00:16:11.335 --> 00:16:14.790
We've got a lot of pretty neat
little things that we've had

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.060
to overcome and play
with for this.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.160
BRENDAN KENNY: So you're doing
from like the openFrameworks

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.960
to actual like motion capture
and mapping to Pegman?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.650
BEN PURDY: Yeah, because we
can get all of the actual

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.560
joint positions.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.120
And so for the game play, we're
just tracking your arms

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.740
and that sort of thing.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.260
But to create assets, rather
than hand animating, we were

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.810
going to do like full
body motion capture

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.960
of like little Pegmans.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.950
PAUL SAXMAN: That's awesome.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.640
Cool.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.670
We don't want to give too much
away because we'll probably

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.350
have some follow-up shows.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.140
Maybe after Google I/O we can do
a technical deep dive with

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.600
you guys to talk
a little more.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.710
Maybe look at--

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.160
BRENDAN KENNY: Specific APIs

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.530
MANO: Once it is released.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:59.260
PAUL SAXMAN: So for those of you
tuning in, if you're going

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.350
to be at I/O, we definitely hope
that you'll have a chance

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.920
to kind of play the Map Dive.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.579
And if not, if you're going to
be joining us actually via GDL

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.970
or I/O Extended, we're
definitely going to have some

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:11.569
more shows.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.390
And so hopefully you can
join us in spirit.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.400
So thanks for joining
us, Instrument team.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.990
This was really awesome.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.454
MANO: See you guys
in San Francisco.

00:17:20.454 --> 00:17:22.361
BEN PURDY: Sounds good.

00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:25.790
PAUL SAXMAN: And viewers,
thanks for joining us.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:27.440
And hope to see you soon.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.690
Buh-bye.

00:17:38.418 --> 00:18:47.815
