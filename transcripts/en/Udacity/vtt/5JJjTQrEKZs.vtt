00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Remember what we wanted to prove was that a^Ï†(n) is congruent to 1 mod n.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now you should understand what the totient function means here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
First we're going to look at a different theorem, which we've already used, that's very similar.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This is Fermat's Little Theorem, which is a^(n - 1) is congruent to 1 mod n

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as long as n is prime and a is not divisible by n.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We used this in the previous lecture when we talked about finding large primes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This was the basis of the primality test.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We didn't prove it, though, and it's actually fairly straightforward to prove.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So let's see if we can prove that Fermat was correct.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The question is what is the value of this set where we're taking a mod n,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
2a mod n, 3a mod n, 4a mod n, all the way up to (n - 1)a mod n.

00:00:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You have four choices.
