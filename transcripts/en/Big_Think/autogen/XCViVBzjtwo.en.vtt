00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069
prying into or trying to figure somebody
 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.860
prying into or trying to figure somebody
out you're just trying to clarify and

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870
out you're just trying to clarify and
 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.120
out you're just trying to clarify and
understand it's like giving someone

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
understand it's like giving someone
 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.650
understand it's like giving someone
psychological air or oxygen if you will

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660
psychological air or oxygen if you will
 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.979
psychological air or oxygen if you will
and when we take the time to do that we

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989
and when we take the time to do that we
 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.930
and when we take the time to do that we
actually start to resolve things much

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940
actually start to resolve things much
 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.819
actually start to resolve things much
quicker than if we jump in ahead of time

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829
quicker than if we jump in ahead of time
 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.500
quicker than if we jump in ahead of time
and try and resolve it without knowing

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510
and try and resolve it without knowing
 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.320
and try and resolve it without knowing
what's at the heart of the issue

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330
what's at the heart of the issue
 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.569
what's at the heart of the issue
