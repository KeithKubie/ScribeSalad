00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.020
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I'm really excited today
to introduce our speaker, Kevin Bleyer.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.279
I was calling him Kevin Blair and he told
me it was Bleyer and it rhymes with "liar."

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.960
So, I got it down.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.960
[laughter]

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.520
So, one of my favorite parts about hosting
these Tech Talks is obviously getting to come

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.789
here and do the intros, 'cause I get to try
my hand at comedy.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.029
I'm a little intimidated today because I'm
introducing Kevin, who's a writer for "The

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.029
Daily Show."

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.710
So, I'm not gonna try, but I did decide to
use a really quality intro on Kevin that I'd

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.740
read and I feel describes his work a little
better than I could.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.090
So, Emmy Award winner Kevin Bleyer is an Emmy
Award winning writer for "The Daily Show"

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.230
with Jon Stewart for which he has won multiple
Emmy Awards.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.880
Before re-writing the Constitution, Bleyer
co-authored the number one New York Times

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.220
best-seller "Earth: The Book" and negotiated
bipartisan consensus as a writer and producer

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.470
for "Politically Incorrect" with Bill Maher
and Dennis Miller.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.580
Since 2008, he's been a term member on the
Counsel of Foreign Relations and since 2009,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.699
has been a contributor to President Obama's
White House correspondence dinner addresses.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.750
So, he secretly runs the government already.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.820
Kevin lives here in New York City where he
regularly poses for portraits.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.030
Please join me in welcoming our guest, Mr.
Kevin Bleyer.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.030
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Wow.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.030
[applause]

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.030
That's some highlights.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.030
Wow.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.030
Thank you.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.030
No, please.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.030
Sit down.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.469
You're embarrassing me.

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:24.770
Stop that.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.869
[laughs] I am blushing.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.039
You've done it.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.119
Thank you so much.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.119
It is an honor to be here and heck, sure,
yeah.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.929
It's an honor for you to have me here.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:34.929
Why not?

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:35.929
I'll agree with you.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.319
That's sweet of you to say.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.509
Truly an honor to be here at Google and I
do feel like this is one of the few places

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.350
where I feel it might be more appropriate
for to tell you to turn on your cell phones.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.960
I'm sure you hear that a lot.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.969
My name is Kevin Bleyer.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.859
And to see so many people here and to know
that people are watching online, if it's possible

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.829
for someone who just rewrote the entire Constitution
of the United States to say he is humbled,

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.490
I guess I could say I'm humbled.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.520
I did in fact, as you have heard, somehow
single-handedly rewrote the entire Constitution

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.670
of the United States by myself, without any
help from any of you people.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.030
So, I don't know where you were.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.340
Frankly, I'm exhausted.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.440
Now, when I tell people that I rewrote the
Constitution, the question I often hear either

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.600
from their lips or just in my head is, "Well,
why did you do that?"

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.650
And there are a dozen very good answers that
are in the book.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.340
There are also a few very poor answers that
are also in the book.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.080
And I'll tell you a few of them right now.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.110
It would be perhaps too convenient, although
not altogether incorrect, to say well, I saw

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.970
everyone else rewriting the Constitution,
so why not me?

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.970
My turn.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.180
It seemed only fair.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.520
I could also say to you, you know what?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.850
Even if I rewrote the Constitution, knowing
what I know now about the Constitution, I'm

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.630
not so sure that anyone would have even noticed.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.520
And I'll tell you what I mean by this.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.490
Most Americans, and I would probably have
to say some of you probably in this room,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.810
too, don't even know exactly what's in the
Constitution.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.020
A few stats I'll throw at you.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.180
More American teenagers can name the Three
Stooges than can name the three branches of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.180
government.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.790
And by the way, that's the Three Stooges.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.680
It's not like it's Justin Bieber.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.681
American teenagers now can name the Three
Stooges more than they can name the three

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:24.430
branches of government.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.600
Nine in ten adults believe that "of the people,
by the people, for the people" is in the Constitution,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.370
even though it is of the Gettysburg Address
by President Abraham Lincoln and for crying

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.320
out loud, they probably learned that at some
point.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.780
Most agree this I say to you is that nearly
half of Americans--also true--think that "from

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.630
each according to his ability, to each according
to his needs" was written by James Madison,

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.630
not Karl Marx.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.310
And by the way, Karl Marx is not one of the
Three Stooges, for those teenagers who happen

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.310
to be tuning in.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.310
Nor is he actually a Marx brother.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.620
I mean, he is a Marx brother.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.240
He had brothers, but I don't think they were
known for being very funny.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:08.650
And so, I tell you when John Boehner himself,
in 2009, stood up his copy of a pocket Constitution

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.850
at a rally in Ohio and said "I stand here
with the Founders, with the framers, who wrote

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.530
in the Preamble of the Constitution, 'We hold
these truths to be self-evident that all men

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.270
are created equal,' and yet didn't realize
that's actually the second sentence in the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.930
Declaration of Independence, I thought, "You
know what?

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.159
There's an opportunity here.

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.300
Perhaps I can step up."

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.419
Now in fairness, and I've been careful to
point this out anywhere I've been, I begrudge

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.419
no one.

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.719
I denigrate him not at all, nor do I denigrate
anyone with these blind spots because I'm

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.970
sure my blind spots are just as large.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.729
They certainly were before I started this
project.

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.020
Had you asked me a few years ago, before I
started researching this book, how does the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.020
Constitution begin?

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.090
I may have said, "It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.090
[laughter]

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.090
Which, by the way, is not altogether untrue
if you think about what happened in 1787.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.550
But an even better answer to the question
of why I rewrote the Constitution is this.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:07.560
I had no choice, no less than Thomas Jefferson
himself told me I had to.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.180
Thomas Jefferson, who I think we can all agree,
is one of the more foundry of the Founding

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.889
Fathers and therefore someone we should probably
listen to, said to the world back then that

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:22.610
every Constitution on Earth naturally expires
at the end of 19 years.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.300
If it be enforced longer, it is an act of
force and not of right.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.300
Every Constitution.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.689
So, in other words, by his math, our Constitution
has been expired for over two centuries, dead,

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.830
kaput, an ex-parrot you might say.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.830
His words.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.300
And so, in his math, I should have written
this over 200 years ago.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.930
It should have been rewritten eleven times
by now.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.639
And frankly, I feel bad I'm just getting to
it now.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:47.909
I've been slacking for two centuries.

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.020
So, I owe all of you an apology.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.490
What's more, in my research, I also, even
though we see people cozy up to the Constitution,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.430
say they know what's in it, cite it, put it
on posters, often incorrectly.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.680
Even though it seems to be a weapon in the
debate, so to speak, and used as a weapon

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.210
unfortunately in the debate, I still feel
like it needs some good publicity these days.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.830
And I have some very significant statistics
also that suggest that.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.009
Twenty-five years ago, of the 170 countries
that then existed, a full 160 of them--and

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.020
keep in mind, some of these countries are
rather old.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.249
Of those countries, 160 actually based their
Constitutions, at least in part, on our Constitution.

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.950
In the last 25 years, when fledgling democracies
go shopping around for a constitution, what

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.639
percentage of them now do so?

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.219
Precisely zero, according to a study in the
Harvard Law Review, which I found quite rather

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.539
amusing or interesting or rather devastating,
too.

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:52.430
Not to mention that just a couple months ago,
no less than, justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.830
herself was in Egypt, and she told the Egyptians
if she were designing a democracy in 2012,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.330
she would actually not use the American Constitution
as a model.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.740
Now that was surprising to me because you
think of her as someone who is out to protect

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.999
every clause of the Constitution.

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.379
And if she's not going to blindingly, unthinkingly,
and ignorantly as I am doing, go out and cheer

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.639
lead for the Constitution, at least I can--even
though I'm totally unauthorized to do so--the

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.099
only time I wear a robe is at the spa.

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:23.669
Now, I will tell you that what these other
countries are doing is they're looking to

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:25.470
other country's Constitutions.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.460
More often now, they're looking to South Africa,
a fairly new Constitution, and to, and this

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.659
is especially galling to me, an American patriot,
they're looking to Canada.

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:41.770
[laughs] Apparently because those Constitutions,
in their estimation, care more about human

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.169
rights and something called the environment.

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:46.639
Environment.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:49.590
Oh, environment.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.009
That's what it is.

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:56.939
And finally, I suppose the most legitimate
reason that I rewrote the Constitution is

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:02.369
I figure, well, if Apple can rewrite their
iTunes service agreement every 19 minutes,

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:04.619
certainly I can rewrite the Constitution every
19 years.

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:05.749
It seems fair.

00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:10.680
And by the way, that brings up, I wanna give
due diligence and due credence to the people

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.620
here today and say that I owe you a thank
you as well because after suggesting all these

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.580
statistics, I want to read how Google actually
became a part of my research, or as I call

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.770
it, my me-search.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.770
Yes.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.770
That's right.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.900
I did win an Emmy for word play like that.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.900
Ridiculous.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.810
So, I'll read this section.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.169
It's early on.

00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:32.169
Oh, yeah.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.360
I'll read this section first.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.931
[reads from book]
"Is it any wonder, I ask you, that President

00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:43.240
George W Bush once called the Constitution,
and I quote, "a goddamned piece of paper?"

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.660
Not to me.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.110
Because unlike you, I googled that quote just
now.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.180
Apparently it is apocryphal, which I also
googled and learned it is another way of saying

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.630
'not true.'

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.630
Never happened.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.630
Bogus.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.940
Evidently, a few years ago, a left-wing muckraker
spread the rumor that one of the President's

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.709
aides advised him not to renew the Patriot
Act--on account of it being unconstitutional--and

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:06.810
the President supposedly said, quote 'Stop
throwing the Constitution in my face.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.529
It's just a goddamned piece of paper.'

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:12.470
Oh sure, there might be some truthiness to
that, but it is, nonetheless, a lie.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.470
Didn't happen.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.450
The 43rd President of the United States never
said that the Constitution he swore an oath

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.810
to uphold quote 'to the best of his ability
through rain or sleet or gloom of night.'

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.870
--note to self, Google 'presidential oath
of office-- was quote 'just a goddamned piece

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.870
of paper.'

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.470
After all, it couldn't possibly be a goddamned
piece of paper, not when our third President

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.209
had already and long ago declared it quote
'a mere thing of wax.'

00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:37.820
Thomas Jefferson, not long after the Constitution
was enforced, lamented aloud that the Justices

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.580
of the Supreme Court had already usurped the
right of quote 'exclusively explaining the

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.150
Constitution' and therefore could, as the
nation's first judicial activists, 'twist

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:54.139
and shape it' unquote into any form they please,
like so much revolutionary Play-Doh.

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:57.960
By calling dibs on the first constitutional
metaphor, Jefferson has beaten Bush to the

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.480
punch by two hundred years.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.580
It is no goddamned piece of paper, it is a
mere thing of wax.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.130
Now, to suggest that violating the Constitution,
as Thomas Jefferson admitted that he did in

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.070
the Louisiana Purchase, is somehow uncommon,
or unpresidential, or worse, un-American,

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.449
overlooks an inconvenient truth.

00:10:13.449 --> 00:10:17.920
Namely, yes, if not for that flagrant violation
of the Constitution, known as the Louisiana

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.230
Purchase, by none other then Thomas Jefferson
we'd hardly recognize the country we see on

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.660
so many elementary school maps.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.600
America wouldn't be America.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.210
If the third President of the United States
hadn't shrugged off the document he had sworn

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:36.170
to protect quote 'by hook or by crook' unquote--note
to self,seriously man, Google the presidential

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:40.310
oath of office already--and doubled the size
of the nation with the stroke of a pen, even

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.560
though the Constitution gave him no such authority,
the Western Coast of America would be on the

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.110
Eastern bank of the Mississippi.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.970
We would be crowning thy good with brotherhood
from sea to shining St. Louis.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.190
Jefferson knew this, too.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:57.610
In embarking on the most aggressive executive
action in history, he was quite aware he was

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.630
sticking his neck out too far.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.630
The Constitution might not approve.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.470
'The Executive,' he wrote, referring to himself,
'in seizing the fugitive occurrence which

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.960
so much advances the good of the country have
done an act beyond the Constitution.'

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.529
Jefferson rationalized his decision, telling
himself that his act of subversion was a vote

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:17.790
of confidence in the fledgeling nation.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.190
Quote 'I did this for your own good,' he wrote
plainly.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.790
His guilty conscience even spurred him to
devise an excuse if the pitchfork-wielding

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.300
guardians of the Constitution came knocking
at his door.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.170
Quote 'I thought of my duty to risk myself
for you.'

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.170
Unquote.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.250
It is a startling admission for any President
of the United States.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:43.519
His sworn assignment was--thank you Google--to
quote 'preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.'

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:47.290
His higher duty was to thwart it."

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.379
But now the question absolutely will remain,
why rewrite the Constitution?

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:58.490
Why do a comic, fraudulent, jeremiad take
down of every article, Amendment and the Preamble,

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.170
rather than just point at it and say, "Hey,
it's not so bad."

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:06.470
I actually begin the very beginning of the
book with an anecdote that explains specifically

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.019
why I decided to do this.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:11.630
And it goes a little bit like, by the way,
this is my bookmark.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.639
It's an occupational hazard.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:15.180
In fact, it's the exact same bookmark that
you see there.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.180
I posed with it.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.339
So, here's the anecdote that explains every
word in this book.

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:26.079
[reads from book]
"Their beloved bell was in jeopardy.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:30.470
It had hung dutifully for decades, pealing
hourly from its steeple above the Pennsylvania

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.470
State House, breaking the peace of the Philadelphia
streets, only to remind its citizens that

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.949
time had marched on and all was well.

00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:41.329
But these were no longer peaceful times.

00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:46.610
It was 1777, a year after America had declared
her independence from the British crown and

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.920
only days after her lion-hearted general,
George Washington, had suffered a withering

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.910
defeat at the Battle of Brandywine.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:13:00.650
All signs were that Philadelphia, the revolutionary
capitol, might well be the next to fall.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:04.690
Fearing that the king's men would melt any
metal they found into British cannons, a few

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:12.199
American patriots confiscated their own bell,
soon to be known appropriately as the 'Liberty

00:13:12.199 --> 00:13:19.730
Bell,' and hid it in the safest place they
could find--under a pile of horse manure.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.079
The gambit worked.

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:25.949
The marauding redcoats never got their British
hands on our American Liberty.

00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:30.180
The lesson learned back then rings as clear
today.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:35.500
Sometimes, in order to save and honor something
we cherish, we have to shit on it."

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.500
[laughter]

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:37.500
You're mad at me over there.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.500
I can tell.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.500
So, yes.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.089
That, I would think, justifies.

00:13:41.089 --> 00:13:44.089
It gives me the political cover to write this
book.

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:49.290
I was also amused, as you might have seen
just a few weeks ago, the maintenance crew

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.110
at Independence Hall in Philadelphia where
the Liberty Bell is.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:57.200
I had spent an entire day and a half adding
a protective shellac to the outside of the

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200
Liberty Bell.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.079
And I can't help but think, knowing as we
do now, where the Liberty Bell has been.

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:06.150
They're about 240 years too late.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:09.240
The Founders actually knew this.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.019
And most of them suspected at the end of that
time in Philadelphia that the Constitution

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:20.200
that they wrote by September is, as the kids
might say, a bit of a hot mess.

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.139
For starters, this venerated document doesn't
mention the word "slavery" or the word "democracy"

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:28.270
or even "Facebook."

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:32.620
It plays favorites among the states, giving
Wyoming as many Senators as New York.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.350
And I mean, come on.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:39.600
It has typos and misspellings and a smudge
that, and this is true, may or may not be

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.660
a comma empowering the government to seize
your house depending on which Constitutional

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.500
scholar you ask.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.620
It is, as we know, scrawled with the quill
of a goose on the skin of a goat.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:55.180
And its Preamble, its famous Preamble, its
most famous introductory passage was written

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.949
by delegate Gouverneur Morris, a man with
a peg-leg.

00:14:58.949 --> 00:15:01.129
They called him the Peg Leg Morris.

00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:06.759
And while his Preamble is notoriously beautiful,
it nonetheless, gives our sacred Constitution

00:15:06.759 --> 00:15:08.550
hardly a leg to stand on.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.550
People.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.550
OK.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.550
There we go.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.550
Groan if you must and you should.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:13.579
But the Founders knew this, too.

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:17.399
And in fact, by the way, just so you know,
New York is number one.

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:18.589
I should say this.

00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:24.389
I spent some time in Article 4, which the
Article 4 is actually supposed to referee

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:25.529
disputes among the states.

00:15:25.529 --> 00:15:27.610
And sometimes it doesn't do such a great job.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.870
So, I decided the only way to really solve
the problem is to go ahead and rank the states

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:32.870
already.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.720
Now, I ranked New York as number one, obviously.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:39.670
But depending how the rest of this afternoon
goes, I'm just saying, we could fall a few

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.670
spots.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.730
George Washington himself, George Washington
himself, the man who presided over the Constitutional

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:49.620
Convention, agrees with me about the flaws
in the Constitution.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.340
It was he who predicted that the flawed Constitution
would become controversial.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.040
"A child of fortune," he said.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.829
"To be fostered by some but buffeted by others."

00:15:56.829 --> 00:16:00.930
And when the Constitutional Convention was
over, he said explicitly, quote "I wished

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.580
it had been made more perfect."

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.810
Benjamin Franklin himself stomached it only
quote "with all its faults."

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.170
And in fact, on the very last day of the Constitutional
Convention, George Washington, excuse me,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.730
Benjamin Franklin gave a speech that I think
somewhat hilariously sums up what he really

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.860
probably thought about their handiwork that
day.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:22.660
It was in the same speech where he said that
he wished everyone would doubt their infallibility

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.830
and put their name to the measure.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.810
And he finished the speech by saying this,
and I think--.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.850
You just need to read in-between the lines
a little bit, see what he's really saying

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.329
to understand what he actually felt about
the four months of compromise that they had

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:36.329
just done.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:42.360
He says, quote "I confess that there are several
parts of this Constitution which I do not

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.180
at present approve.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.670
But I am not sure I shall never approve them.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:52.300
I doubt whether any other convention we can
obtain may be able to make a better Constitution.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:58.490
Thus, I consent to this Constitution because
I expect no better.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:04.659
And because I am not sure that it is not the
best," which you might say he sounds like

00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:06.860
a Republican endorsing Mitt Romney.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.860
[laughter]

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.860
Exactly.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.529
Damning with faint praise.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:15.410
Whereas, unlike my book, which I hope people
understand the true intent as Justice Scalia

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.410
did.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.010
And I'll talk about him a little bit later.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.020
That I'm hopefully praising with faint damnation.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.839
You'll see that I actually come back around.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.839
I don't want to spoil the ending.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.130
I don't want to tell you that the butler did
or didn't do it.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.860
But if anything, only the accomplice.

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.080
And I'll get to that a little bit, too.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:36.360
Because as these Founders knew, while we think
of the Constitution as yes, the painstakingly

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.620
designed blueprint drawn up by what Thomas
Jefferson called "an assembly of demigods,"

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.650
who laid the foundation for the sturdiest
republic ever created.

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.260
All true.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:51.730
By the end of that summer in Philadelphia,
the framers knew the truth that the Constitution

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.130
was not exactly a blueprint.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:58.250
They would have agreed that it was a bit of,
and I use this phrase as I wrote it a year

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.700
ago, a bit of an Etch-A-Sketch.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.630
A haphazard series of blunders.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:07.510
They admitted that they had to shake clean
and redraw dozens of times during a sweltering

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:13.520
summer of petty debates, drunken ramblings,
wild improvisation, and desperate compromise.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.520
You have to imagine it.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.470
They were, I mean, we had this last weekend
in New York, right?

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:17.610
It was miserably hot.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.980
And Philadelphia was even hotter.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.890
And they were there for four months in the
sweltering summer of Philadelphia wearing

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.230
powdered wigs, wool coats.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.230
They locked the doors.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.190
They shuttered the windows for privacy.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.220
There was no such thing as air-conditioning.

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.740
It was an unventilated room.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.919
There was a prison riot right across the street.

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:40.770
Butchers were throwing animal carcasses that
they were done with, truly, within feet of

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:42.279
the Pennsylvania State House.

00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:43.279
So, you can imagine.

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:45.130
it was pungent all over the place.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.570
Not to mention that they were, in fact, drinking
beer for breakfast.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.429
Now, the truth of the matter is, most people
drank beer for breakfast because it was cleaner

00:18:52.429 --> 00:18:53.429
than water.

00:18:53.429 --> 00:18:56.559
But nonetheless, the fact remains, they were
drinking beer for breakfast.

00:18:56.559 --> 00:19:00.950
And in fact, you don't actually have to--.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:07.210
I do a pretty lengthy explanation of what
actually transpired during those four months.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:13.750
And I conclude, and I explain how it all concluded
as well, if I can find the page because my

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.840
bookmark has disappeared.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.110
It's now over here somewhere.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:22.750
Ah, there we go.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.170
[pause]

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.580
Hmm.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.820
There we go.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:33.710
So again, after four months.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.480
Now we understand how it all happened.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.970
Or rather, almost didn't.

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:42.169
The Constitution wasn't only a miracle at
Philadelphia, written by an assembly of demigods.

00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:44.490
It was that, but it was also the contrary.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:49.610
What began as a measured, deliberate effort
to rescue a beleaguered country became a perpetual

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.800
unresolved motion machine--a maddening cycle
of non-binding votes by a parade of toothless

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.190
committees, marked by fits and starts, fights
and full-stops, conducted by a combative group

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:08.049
of exhausted, drunken, broke, petty, partisan,
scheming, squabbling, bloviating, back-stabbing,

00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:14.760
grandstanding, god-forsaken, posturing, restless,
cow-tipping, homesick, cloistered, claustrophobic,

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.350
sensory-deprived, under-oxygenated, fed up,
talked out, overheated delegates so distraught

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.760
and despairing they threatened violence, secession,
foreign allegiance and even prayer.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.580
As Benjamin Franklin said, "and concluded
for those who didn't abandon the proceedings

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.289
altogether, with as much pre-meditation and
forethought as a game of musical chairs.

00:20:32.289 --> 00:20:37.020
The last, least abhorrent, mutually somewhat
acceptable idea on the table when the music

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.039
stopped, or the heat became too unbearable,
or the liqueur too strong, or the rioting

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:45.870
too loud, or the pressure too intense, or
the company too loathsome, or the wigs too

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:52.410
uncomfortable, or the patience too thin, became
the law of the land" as much the product of

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:57.480
yes, an assembly of demigods as yes, some
might say a confederacy of what could be dunces

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.750
on occasion.

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.860
From page one, the Constitution is, by its
own admission, a great compromise.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.980
It is also what you get when you drink beer
for breakfast.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.850
Now, amusingly, they didn't just drink beer
for breakfast.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:15.610
I'm actually understating that because the
truth of the matter is they drank a lot of

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.010
beer at that time.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.070
They drank a lot of everything at that time.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.800
The statistics are astounding, but I'll just
point this out.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.330
When they finally decided what was gonna be
in the Constitution, and they knew they were

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.350
about to sign it, well, they threw a party,
'cause they knew that they'd finally be able

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.409
to bid adieu to each other.

00:21:32.409 --> 00:21:34.920
But this is what happened that night.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.080
They were about to add their signatures to
an extremely anticipated official document

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.190
that many of them had extremely mixed feelings
about.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.320
So the delegates did what anyone might do
under such pressure.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.520
They drank themselves silly.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.680
After they toasted the occasion, they drowned
their miseries.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.090
They had spent four months compromising some
of their values, perhaps they could drink

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.409
their guilt away.

00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:56.960
They certainly tried.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.799
In the span of just a few hours, the 55 men
who crowded City Tavern on Friday, September

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:07.010
14th, 1787, guzzled enough alcohol to fell
an Army Regiment.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.710
Sixty bottles of claret.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.520
Fifty-four bottles of Madeira.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.460
Fifty bottles of old stock.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:19.380
Vats of porter, cider, and beer, and what
has been described as "some" bowls of rum.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:21.320
They weren't just pledging their sacred honor.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.220
They were pledging a frat.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.630
So wild did the celebration get, the City
Tavern, a place quite familiar with drunkenness,

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:32.130
took the unusual step of sending along a bill
for quote unquote "breakage."

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.350
Pretty amusing to me.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:37.850
Honestly, the miracle at Philadelphia is that
the Constitution wasn't written on the back

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:38.850
of a bar napkin.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.210
That's a big question.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:44.740
Which actually brings me to my drinking companion,
as I had just mentioned.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:52.409
What are the more fortunate accidents really
in getting to research and write this book

00:22:52.409 --> 00:22:55.130
was getting to have lunch with Justice Scalia.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:01.510
Now, of course, as you can understand, I wanted
to meet with Justice Scalia because I thought

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:06.940
who on the face of the planet, let alone in
the country, would really be most amenable

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:10.840
to a page one rewrite of the Constitution?

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.149
And you gotta assume it's the man who's devoted
his entire life to protecting every phrase,

00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:17.809
clause, and punctuation in it.

00:23:17.809 --> 00:23:21.780
I was a little bit alarmed, or surprised,
I guess I should say, that he agreed to meet

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.780
with me.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.289
But of course, also thrilled that he would.

00:23:25.289 --> 00:23:28.529
I should also say, of course, the truth of
the matter is that he actually agrees with

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:29.529
Thomas Jefferson.

00:23:29.529 --> 00:23:31.990
Thomas Jefferson, who said the Constitution
be rewritten every 19 years.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:37.530
He doesn't agree with that part, but he agrees
with Jefferson that the Constitution is, and

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.899
this is his words, "dead."

00:23:39.899 --> 00:23:42.990
The difference is, between him and Thomas
Jefferson, is that Justice Scalia means dead

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.730
as a compliment, apparently.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.760
He means quit trying to revive it.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.519
He means honor it for what we know it was
and adore it for all of those merits.

00:23:51.519 --> 00:23:55.649
So, he agreed to meet.

00:23:55.649 --> 00:23:59.049
And we did, in fact, talk of a lot of things
in the Constitution.

00:23:59.049 --> 00:24:03.980
But I knew at some point that I would have
to turn our attentions to his bread and butter--the

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:09.020
Third Article, the judicial branch, where
of course he makes his living.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.929
And I had to, what I hope I do in this book
is address the actual issues that people have

00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:14.640
with the Articles and Amendments.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.909
My solutions are rather absurd.

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:19.429
But I do address the actual issues.

00:24:19.429 --> 00:24:24.070
And one of the issues that people have with
the Third Amendment, excuse me, the Third

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.990
Article, the Supreme Court, is this idea.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.770
And when I mention these words, you could
see what happened.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.490
I broached the subject and I said, "Well,
Justice, Your Honor, you know that some people

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.429
have a problem with lifetime ten--."

00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:38.809
And as soon as I got to ten--, he picked up
a fork, poked it at me and with a devilish

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:39.940
grin said, "Don't you dare.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:42.299
Don't you dare change lifetime tenure.

00:24:42.299 --> 00:24:46.049
And if you do, at least grandfather me in
because I like my job."

00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:47.080
Fair enough.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.419
But now here's the thing.

00:24:48.419 --> 00:24:54.090
The Constitution itself says nothing about
Supreme Court Justices having lifetime tenure.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.330
It merely says the Justices shall hold their
offices quote unquote "during good behavior."

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:05.010
Now, for a bunch of very good reasons, early
on, we decided to interpret that as lifetime

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.100
tenure because kings were removing judges
willy nilly from the bench.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.320
So, they thought, "Let's go the other way
with this."

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.049
But nonetheless, it doesn't actually say lifetime
tenure.

00:25:13.049 --> 00:25:15.670
It says merely during good behavior.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:21.580
And I felt it, my job, to say to him, "Well,
let's consider in 2012 whether or not we should

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.669
really still have lifetime tenure."

00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:27.220
And he put down the fork and agreed to listen
to me.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.640
And this is what transpired when that happened.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.919
[clears throat]

00:25:31.919 --> 00:25:38.559
[reads from book]
"I don't bother lecturing Justice Scalia on

00:25:38.559 --> 00:25:40.160
any of this.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.370
After decades of legal study and 25 years
of service as one of America's top Judges,

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.840
he's been fully briefed.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.019
Instead, I begin my cross-examination.

00:25:49.019 --> 00:25:51.350
'How about you?'

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.380
I ask.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.710
'How about me what?' he counters.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.620
'Can you imagine just walking away?'

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:58.620
I ask.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.330
'Of course I can,' he scoffs, with a couldn't
care less tone that implies he'd just as soon

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:08.410
leave today if only he hadn't signed a two-year
lease on his Supreme Court locker.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:09.950
'When?'

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.059
I ask.

00:26:12.059 --> 00:26:15.519
Like I've said before, he says, 'As soon as
I'm not firing on all eight cylinders, when

00:26:15.519 --> 00:26:18.649
I'm not doing the job as well as I used to,
it'll be time to go.

00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:22.929
'How will you know when that is?'

00:26:22.929 --> 00:26:24.779
He looks me straight in the eye.

00:26:24.779 --> 00:26:25.850
'I'll know.'

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:30.230
'So, you don't need some outside authority
limiting the term of your servi--?'

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.040
'I'm fairly aware of the requirements of the
position,' he interrupts me.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.429
'I'll know when I can no longer fulfill them.'

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:44.740
And yet, 'what if I told you, Your Honor,
that someone even more powerful than you says

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.980
your wrong about that?'

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.980
He looks at me.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.390
'And who is that?'

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.149
'Someone you know quite well.'

00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:56.110
He looks at me again, wondering if he should
ask.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.679
'Who?'

00:26:57.679 --> 00:27:01.659
If this were a case in some courtroom drama,
this is the moment when I would stand slowly,

00:27:01.659 --> 00:27:06.429
scan the jury, look back at the judge and
call on my surprise witness.

00:27:06.429 --> 00:27:12.549
May it please the Courts, I now call to the
stand, dramatic pause, the current Chief Justice

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:15.019
of the Supreme Court of the United States.

00:27:15.019 --> 00:27:18.250
If this were indeed a courtroom drama, the
double doors in the back of the courtroom

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:19.549
would fly open.

00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:22.289
The stenographer would record the reaction
of the gallery.

00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:23.830
Audible gasps.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:28.399
And Chief Justice John G Roberts, Jr. would
saunter up the aisle, hesitating only long

00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:32.400
enough to lock eyes with fellow Justice Scalia
and feel his glare.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.610
Et tu, Roberte?

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.710
Roberts would then explain to the ladies and
gentlemen of the jury that no matter what

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:43.110
he says or how he pleads for mercy, Justice
Antonin Scalia should have been kicked off

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.370
the court exactly ten years ago.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.529
Back in real life, I explain what the hell
I'm talking about.

00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:53.389
When he was a lawyer in the Reagan White House,
22 years before, he joined the Supremes.

00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:58.210
John Roberts argued on behalf of the 15-year
term limits for Supreme Court Justices.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.810
It was both a pragmatic proposal, as he saw
it.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:05.000
The Founders quote 'adopted life tenure at
a time when people simply did not live as

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.299
long as they do now' unquote.

00:28:07.299 --> 00:28:11.110
And a principled one for many of the reasons
I've tried out here at lunch.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:16.190
A judge insulated from the normal occurrence
of life for 25 or 30 years was a rarity then,

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.639
but is becoming commonplace today, he wrote
in a White House memo.

00:28:19.639 --> 00:28:24.350
Setting a term of, say, 15 years would ensure
that Federal Judges would not lose all touch

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:29.740
with quote reality through decades of Ivory
Tower existence unquote.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:35.070
It is an indictment of lifetime tenure, too
compelling to ignore.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:39.230
As I finished explaining, one thing becomes
clear.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.769
Scalia knew nothing of this.

00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:42.289
'Is that so?' he asks.

00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:44.920
'Has Roberts thought that?'

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.950
I have out-lawyered the longest serving Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.980
'Really?

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.029
He thought that?' he asks again.

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:58.870
'Yes,' I say, pausing a beat for dramatic
effect, 'yes he did.'

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.360
For a moment, Scalia seemed speechless.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.850
He can muster no defense, even though we're
sitting in the National Gallery, not the Supreme

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:11.010
Court, and eating lunch, not arguing case
law, I am tempted to shout, 'The prosecution

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:15.679
rests,' slam an imaginary briefcase and march
out triumphantly.

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:16.700
But I don't.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.019
But I don't.

00:29:18.019 --> 00:29:19.669
I stay.

00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:21.990
And Scalia's grin returns.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:26.950
'Well,' he says, 'I doubt he does any more.'

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.070
[laughs] He has a good point.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.200
Roberts doesn't think that anymore.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:37.080
When Roberts himself was asked about his previous
comments at his confirmation hearings in 2005,

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.080
he flip-flopped.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.720
Predictably, his perspective on the issue
had evolved.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.630
As the law professor Larry Sabato has eloquently
put it, 'On the issue of lifetime tenure,

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.760
where one stands depends on where one sits.'

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.789
Scalia's joke, nonetheless, seems to put him
back on offense.

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:57.559
'So,' he asks.

00:29:57.559 --> 00:30:02.049
'So, it was an argument that had stymied me
before.'

00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:03.929
'So what?'

00:30:03.929 --> 00:30:04.929
'So?

00:30:04.929 --> 00:30:08.309
Are you going to make me retire with your
new Constitution?

00:30:08.309 --> 00:30:11.769
I mean, I've been here longer than 15 years.'

00:30:11.769 --> 00:30:14.100
Oh, he's not on the attack.

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.320
He's throwing himself on the mercy of my courts.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.320
'No, sir.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.649
No, sir.'

00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:23.169
I'm not here to fire Justice Scalia, though
I appreciate his acknowledgment of my authority

00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:24.909
to do so.

00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:28.690
'So, what exactly do you propose?'

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.340
I thought he'd never ask.

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.059
'Simple,' I say.

00:30:32.059 --> 00:30:35.120
'Your new Article Three.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:39.340
The judicial power of the United States shalt
be vested in one Supreme Court and the Judges

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.120
shall hold their offices during good behavior.'

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.149
Scalia seems confused.

00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:47.480
'But that's what Article Three already says.'

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.549
'Not exactly,' I clarify.

00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:52.270
'I drop the u from behavior to make it more
American.'

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.340
[laughter]

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:58.470
'But otherwise, that's Article Three of the
Constitution.'

00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:59.470
'Indeed it is, Your Honor.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:00.840
Indeed it is.'

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.200
It was, I was certain, a remedy for Article
Three, that an originalist like Justice Scalia

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.100
could not help but support.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:08.790
We take it literally.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:12.830
We revive the original Article and we'll honor
it's original language.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:17.380
Judges shall hold their offices during good
behavior.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.210
I had him dead to rights.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:23.250
Surely he, a man who swore by the letter of
the law would swear by the letter of this

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:28.539
law, that is, save one letter, to which he
owed his entire career.

00:31:28.539 --> 00:31:33.809
I was proud of my judicial jujitsu."

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:34.809
Thank you.

00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:35.809
One person, right?

00:31:35.809 --> 00:31:36.809
Too much.

00:31:36.809 --> 00:31:41.510
"'But who,' he asks, 'determines good behavior?'

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:44.529
'Good behavior,' I correct him.

00:31:44.529 --> 00:31:45.529
[laughter]

00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:47.230
Thank you.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.109
He was pronouncing the "u," you're right.

00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:50.440
" 'That's what I said,' he says.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.940
'Who gets to decide?'

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.299
Well, I've anticipated this question.

00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:58.870
Scalia listens closely as I propose a judging
body composed of three people appointed by

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:03.639
the President, whose sole responsibility is
to determine whether the Justices are passing

00:32:03.639 --> 00:32:08.409
the good behavior test, as revived by my new
Constitution.

00:32:08.409 --> 00:32:10.210
He gets what I'm aiming at.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:15.179
'A Supreme Supreme Court,' he says with a
laugh.

00:32:15.179 --> 00:32:17.179
Scalia is evidently amused by the idea.

00:32:17.179 --> 00:32:20.269
I can tell he's not ruling it out.

00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:22.760
'Just one question,' he says.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.880
I raise my chin and allow it.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.679
'Yes, Your Honor?'

00:32:26.679 --> 00:32:29.950
'How long do they serve?'

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.190
I hadn't thought of that."

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:36.539
You can probably tell from this, I mean, first
of all, he trumped me at every turn, even

00:32:36.539 --> 00:32:37.720
when I tried to be funny, he was funnier.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.549
When I tried to out-lawyer him, of course
I knew I was in over my head.

00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:47.110
But when I say that Justice Scalia is funny,
it's not just me saying that.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:51.419
I can say to you right now, Justice Scalia
is officially funny.

00:32:51.419 --> 00:32:56.470
And in fact, he is officially the funniest
Supreme Court Justice on the bench.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:57.890
Now, how do we know this?

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.861
We know this because a few years ago, the
New York Times actually reported on this.

00:33:01.861 --> 00:33:05.409
I guess this was about six or seven years
ago.

00:33:05.409 --> 00:33:11.900
There was a St. Louis Law Review study that
someone had thought to finally, well, they

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.570
just released a big batch of Supreme Court
transcripts.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:19.649
And someone thought to count the number of
times laughter had been annotated by the stenographer

00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:21.789
after a Supreme Court Justice spoke.

00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:24.690
And by far, Scalia got the most laughs in
the chamber.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:29.490
In fact, he's twice as funny as Steven Breyer
you'll be happy to know.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:33.620
Nineteen times funnier than Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.760
[laughter]

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:41.260
Now, we don't know about Clarence Thomas because
Clarence Thomas, as you may or may not know,

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.720
has actually not spoken in the chamber for
seven years, something like that.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:50.130
So, it's possible and I think you at Google
can appreciate this, it's possible that mathematically

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.929
speaking, he is infinitely funny.

00:33:52.929 --> 00:33:53.929
[laughter]

00:33:53.929 --> 00:33:57.600
It's possible that every time he opens his
mouth, it's a killer laugh.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.240
He could be in fact the Patch Adams of the
Supreme Court.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.240
We don't know.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.399
We don't know.

00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:05.289
Now, people say, "OK, Kevin.

00:34:05.289 --> 00:34:09.369
But what do you really think about the Constitution?

00:34:09.369 --> 00:34:13.919
Are you actually suggesting through your comic
jeremiad here that the Constitution should

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:17.730
be scrapped and sold for parts and start it
over from scratch?"

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:20.099
And that's a fair question.

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:23.130
And as I said before, the butler, I don't
wanna spoil it too much, but I will say the

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:24.520
butler didn't do it entirely.

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.050
Perhaps, it was an accomplice.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:27.770
And I'll read to you the final section of
the book.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.220
It's not, I'm not spoiling it for you.

00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.560
So, you can still pick up a copy later and
enjoy the interior part.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.629
But this is essentially how I wrap up that
I think you'll enjoy.

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:40.120
Keeping in mind the story about the Liberty
Bell.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.639
So, this is a bit of a book end.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:46.579
[reads from book]
"Their beloved stamp was in jeopardy.

00:34:46.579 --> 00:34:51.620
It had been designed carefully and artfully,
graced not only with a stately visage of an

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:57.149
adored and enduring national icon, but also
with the denomination chosen to reflect just

00:34:57.149 --> 00:34:59.160
how long it would last.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:01.790
Nay, how long it should last.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:02.790
Forever.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.640
A forever stamp.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.500
It was 2011, 125 years after the statue it
featured had been dedicated as a gift from

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.440
France as a memorial to independence.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.089
Liberty enlightening the world.

00:35:16.089 --> 00:35:20.780
And to honor her long journey across seas
and centuries, three billion stamps had been

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.750
printed by the Patriots at the United States
Postal Service.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.190
Two billion had already been issued.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:31.800
Countless licked or peeled and stuck and sent
far across town, across the country, and around

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.430
the globe to enlighten the world one envelope
at a time.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:39.200
Alas, forever wouldn't last forever.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.490
One eagle-eyed philatelist, armed only with
a jeweler's loupe, a rabid obsession with

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:49.160
detail, and way too much time on his hands
made a shocking discovery.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.250
The lady on the stamp wasn't the 305 foot
copper and iron neoclassical figure standing

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:56.730
sentry on an island in New York Harbor.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.330
No, sir.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:03.810
The lady on the stamp was the pint-sized knock-off
on the Las Vegas strip, overlooking not New

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:08.060
York, New York, but the New York, New York
casino.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:12.040
She hadn't welcomed the huddled masses yearning
to breathe free in the New World.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.109
She welcomed obsessive gamblers yearning to
sidle up to the three 99 All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.

00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:21.690
Less the stuff of immigrants' hopes and dreams--a
real-life Lady Liberty--more the stuff of

00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:25.750
fiberglass and Styrofoam, a replica Lady Luck.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:30.130
In other words, are you telling me we've got
three billion of these?

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:35.420
Now, a small discolored rectangle that mars
her crown's most prominent center spike--after

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:40.119
all, the real Lady Liberty wouldn't be caught
dead with such a blemish--was the tall-tale

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:41.119
giveaway.

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:45.520
Someone, somewhere had merely raided a stock
photography service and thought, 'Yeah, that

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.640
seems about right.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.640
It must be her.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.410
And if it's not, I doubt anyone will notice.'

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:52.150
Someone noticed.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:57.950
Once alerted to its gaffe, the United States
Postal Service released an official statement,

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:02.020
but not of apology, of adoration.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:09.710
Quote 'We still love the stamp design and
would've selected the photograph anyway.'

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:13.710
They admitted no defeat, made no excuses,
announced no recall.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:18.200
They also--it must be said--made me proud
to be an American, where at least I know I'm

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.369
free to pretend I totally meant to do that.

00:37:22.369 --> 00:37:24.170
Even when I totally screwed up.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:27.050
After all, what was the Postal Service to
do?

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:30.660
Should it deny it made a mistake as original
author James Madison might have wished in

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.510
that summer of 1787?

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.770
And yes, as Antonin Scalia might still advise
today.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.829
Should it recall the stamp and continue living
in the past?

00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:44.170
That was the unfortunate choice Jonathan Dayton
made in his later years when he, the youngest

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:48.360
delegate at the Constitutional Convention,
stayed so fixated on his participation in

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.250
Philadelphia that he never once updated even
his manner of dress.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.370
The Last of the Cocked Hats, they called him.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:57.599
A walking example of arrested development.

00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:03.550
Or should it make a bold, wholesale makeover
in a staggering miraculous flurry of glorious

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:08.770
inspiration as I, Kevin Bleyer, your hero
and humble servant have done in these pages?

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:12.500
Well, even if it should, it didn't.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:17.390
Instead of promising a more perfect stamp,
the Postal Service insisted the stamp was

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:23.010
a more perfect stamp, one that, despite injuries
and usurpations brought on by a sloppy postal

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:27.940
researcher, still secures the blessings of
the Liberty as we know her--life-size and

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:28.940
in full.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:33.730
It interpreted the advice of Thomas Jefferson--that
we not look at stamps, or anything really,

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:37.870
with sanctimonious reverence and deem them
like the ark of the covenant.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:43.490
And of James Madison, too, that we not suffer
a blind veneration for antiquity, as something

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:47.740
slightly different--that we should just get
over ourselves, stick with the program, and

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.820
meet at the craps table.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.180
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:55.910
The lesson shines forth as bright and unmistakable
as the flame in Lady Liberty's outstretched

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:56.910
hand.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:01.180
Sometimes, in order to honor an icon that
defines us as a nation, whether it be a giant

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.819
green woman holding a torch, or a Constitution
of the United States of America, we should

00:39:05.819 --> 00:39:09.220
just roll with what we've got because it's
still pretty damn awesome."

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:17.450
So, I would say, now that I've justified this
book's existence, my new Constitution's existence,

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:22.280
to Justice Scalia, of course to you here at
Google and around the world, I'll just conclude

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:27.300
with this thought before I answer a couple
of your, what I hope will be, softball questions.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.500
And you're probably asking yourself, "Kevin,
alright.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:34.770
But does the world really need yet another
book about a guy who single-handedly rewrote

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:35.770
the Constitution by himself?"

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.790
And I would say yes.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.839
Yes, it does because, ladies and gentlemen,
the Constitution, I don't need to tell you,

00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:42.900
is hot.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.900
Like Hunger Games hot.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.650
Like 50 Shades of Gray hot.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.839
In fact, Jon Stewart called my book "Fifty
Shades of Red, White, and Blue."

00:39:48.839 --> 00:39:50.089
I'm very thankful.

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:51.410
Here's why.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.060
People are quoting it, even though they haven't
read it.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.010
People are hiding behind it, even though they're
not quite sure what it says.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.190
And as a piece of literature, the only thing
that would make the Constitution hotter I

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.970
tell you, was if James Madison were a vampire.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:08.869
It is so popular that right now, somewhere
in America, yes, a thousand Tea Partiers are

00:40:08.869 --> 00:40:10.359
misquoting it.

00:40:10.359 --> 00:40:13.930
It's so amazing that somewhere yes, Kanye
West is interrupting an acceptance speech

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.240
to insist that it should've won.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.569
It's so exciting that somewhere, oh boy, Anthony
Weiner is tweeting pics of himself having

00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:21.880
just read it.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.520
Which is why, on behalf of America, I have
paid every price for every burden and yes,

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.099
saved every receipt in my quest to assure
survival.

00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:30.470
"And why now?"

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:31.470
you ask.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:35.690
Well, at a time when Michelle Bachmann believes
that the Battles of Lexington and Concord

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:39.950
were fought in New Hampshire, at a time when
Sarah Palin believes Paul Revere made his

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:45.140
midnight ride to warn the British that we
were armed, and a time when yes, John Boehner

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.630
believes that we hold these truths to be self-evident
is his favorite part of the Constitution,

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:52.359
even though it's the Declaration of Independence,
it shouldn't be too hard to believe this,

00:40:52.359 --> 00:40:56.839
that I, Kevin Bleyer, having no qualifications,
am the most qualified man to rewrite the Constitution

00:40:56.839 --> 00:40:57.839
of the United States.

00:40:57.839 --> 00:40:59.220
I do hope, if you get it, you enjoy it.

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.089
And if you do, I hope you help me ratify it.

00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:02.089
Thank you very much.

00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:04.960
I'm happy to take a few questions if we have
anything, I think we have five or ten minutes

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.500
before we have to wrap up.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.869
So, thank you very much.

00:41:07.869 --> 00:41:09.450
Appreciate it.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:10.450
[applause]

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:11.809
Thank you.

00:41:11.809 --> 00:41:14.790
I guess there's a couple microphones even
in the aisle.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:15.970
Ah, here's.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:16.970
No?

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:17.970
No.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:18.970
OK.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:19.970
[laughs] Caught ya.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:21.310
Caught you, too.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:23.130
Saw that.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:24.640
Alright.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.230
Well, anyway, thank you very much.

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:29.309
It's been much appreciated.

00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:30.309
Oh, there we go.

00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:31.309
There we go.

00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:33.380
&gt;&gt;Male #1: What, I'm curious, I will get the
book.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.380
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.470
&gt;&gt;Male #1: But I was curious about your treatment
of the four limited times to secure their

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:39.470
works and--.

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:40.470
&gt;&gt;Kevin: I couldn't hear you.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:41.470
Sorry.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:42.470
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Copyright and clause.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:46.490
&gt;&gt;Kevin: I do address a little bit under the
free, in the First Amendment, a little bit.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.890
But I don't get into the nitty gritty the
way I'm sure the people at Google in here

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:50.890
would appreciate.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:52.680
But here's one, two thoughts I would say to
you.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:42:00.220
First of all, to be exhaustive to rewrite
every Preamble, every Article, and every Amendment,

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.240
I have to do a little bit of cherry-picking.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.500
But what I love is going through, be on this
book tour, especially getting people's suggestions

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.100
as to what should be in the paperback version.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.660
So, I actually could address that as well.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.790
And not to mention more broadly, I love this
because I don't pretend to know all the answers.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:16.750
I only pretend to know all the answers.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:20.020
So, I'm sure people at Google will probably
have some good suggestions for me as far as

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.860
how I should address copyright issues in the
next version, which I shall write in at least

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.599
19 years as Thomas Jefferson told me to.

00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:27.609
Yes, please.

00:42:27.609 --> 00:42:33.309
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So, the one question I have, I
have a bunch, but I think the things I'm most

00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:37.430
curious about are, what did you find most
surprising about reading the document?

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.670
What do you feel like is something that a
lot of Americans in general would be surprised

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:43.550
to know is in the Constitution?

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:48.160
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Just how, for lack of a better word,
dysfunctional, I guess is the regular word

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.960
the Constitutional Convention itself was.

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:53.730
I mean, it was a maddening cycle of compromise,
like I told you.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:58.430
We know of it as the Great Compromise, but
we don't know that they did not make any decisions

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.790
on what was going to be in the Constitution
until the very last minute.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.500
And that was merely because they were so sick
of each other.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.190
They kept trying and trying over again and
they didn't address the Executive Branch until

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:10.190
the middle of the summer.

00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.500
And even when they did, the famous phrase
is when they brought it up, a considerable

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.500
pause ensued.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.490
In other words, no one had any idea how to
design the Presidency.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:22.670
They literally started writing the Constitution
before they decided what was going to be in

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:23.670
it.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:27.630
They got so sick of each other that they established
an even smaller committee, "style and arrangement"

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:28.630
they called it.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.089
That was a group of, I forget, five or ten
people.

00:43:31.089 --> 00:43:34.010
But they would at night essentially say, "Well,
here's this.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.010
Let's give this a shot."

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.869
And then the next morning, they said, "How
does this look?

00:43:36.869 --> 00:43:37.869
Does it look good?"

00:43:37.869 --> 00:43:38.869
And they would actually vote on that.

00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:40.310
it's ultimately what they did.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.300
So, it's surprising to me that while we know,
of course, they were debating, we didn't know

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.579
that people like Luther Martin were getting
so drunk in the morning that he would give

00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:51.720
a six-hour speech and derail the Constitutional
Convention for two days.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:52.720
It's pretty astounding.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.880
That actual part of history was the most surprising
to me.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.040
I really enjoyed learning about it.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.670
And I think the joy in learning about it hopefully
is manifest on pages.

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.880
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thank you.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.130
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Thank you.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.130
Alright.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.931
Well, again, I really appreciate it.

00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:07.910
Thank you so much for coming out and sharing
your lunch hour with me.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:08.910
[applause]

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:09.910
Thanks a lot.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.914
Thank you very much.
