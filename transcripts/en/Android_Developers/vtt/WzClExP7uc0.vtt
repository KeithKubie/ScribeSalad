[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:06.720
MATTEO VALLONE: Hello everyone.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.170
My name is Matteo
Vallone, and I work

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.580
in the Google Play
apps and games

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.750
business development team.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.430
Welcome.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.420
In my day-to-day
job, I work with some

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.070
of the most successful
apps and games developers,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.570
and I always think
that there's lots

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.560
to be learned by apps
developers by looking

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.070
at how successful games
developers are built.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.910
What are the key things
that games developers care

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.910
about when they actually
build their games for success?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.560
In the next 30, 40
minutes I'll try

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.260
to answer that
question by showing you

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.240
some of the key metrics
that they look at

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.070
and how they go about
and optimize for them.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.490
I will also try to extrapolate
some rules that you,

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.790
as app developers, can
take in your day-to-day job

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.200
and hopefully use to optimize
your apps and also show you

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.850
some examples of how these
learnings have been applied

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.310
by app developers successfully.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.670
But before doing that, I
want to address the elephant

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.250
in the room right away.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.220
Apps and games are
not exactly the same.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.810
Actually, one key
difference is that it's

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.800
much harder to make money
on apps than it is on games.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.600
And for the purpose
of this talk,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.370
the main difference
here is that games

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.947
enjoy much more flexibility
when it comes to monetizing.

00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:18.530
That's because, if
you think about it,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.750
a game is a virtual world with
virtual currency and items.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.980
So basically there are
endless possibilities

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.760
in terms of what games
developers can put together

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.040
as monetization mechanics,
bundles, and price points,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.440
while app developers
have less flexibility.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.380
They're actually limited by
the services and the goods

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.090
that they are trying to sell
within their app, and so less

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.410
flexibility, less granularity.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.710
But there's also lots
of common ground,

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.410
and the main key thing in
common is the business model.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.410
For most apps and games,
the business model

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.920
is a freemium model.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.530
And if you share
that business model,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.330
the equation you see here on
the right should always be true.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.840
Your Cost Per Install,
your CPI, should always

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.430
be lower than the lifetime value
of the users that you bring in.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.370
And lifetime value is a function
of retention, engagement,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.060
and monetization.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.060
Now, in a world where there
is more competition for user

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.910
acquisition and
store visibility,

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.700
the CPI is actually
rising for everyone,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.080
for both apps and games.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.350
And that means to make
this equation work,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.830
you really need to focus
on the right side of it,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.540
the lifetime value, and
those key metrics that

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.270
drive the lifetime value.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.710
And among these, really, it
all starts with retention.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.150
Retention is king.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.900
These data from mobile
intelligence company Quettra

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.640
show you why.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.410
These are average
retention curves of apps,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.750
of games on the left
and apps on the right.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410
They are ranked by
daily active users.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.560
So you see the blue line
represents the top 10

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.410
apps in the world by
daily active users,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.810
the red line is top 50,
yellow line top 100,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.830
and green line is top 5,000.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.720
You see how better
retention always

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.440
drives better performance.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.690
And games developers
know this very well.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.340
They actually, before
even launching their game,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.500
before investing in
user acquisition,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.670
they spend a lot of
time and resources

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.730
optimizing their game
for this key metric.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.020
This process is
called soft launching.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.380
They launch an account
in a few test markets

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.040
or to a beta community,
and they really

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.210
spend time tracking how this
retention works for their game

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.230
and change their
games to the point

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.310
where they're comfortable with
the retention curves they see,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.000
when they think that this
retention can support

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.440
that lifetime value equation
that I showed you before,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.170
and so that they can
actually invest profitably

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.260
in user acquisition.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.350
This process is very
rigorous, and it

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.040
requires a lot of
attention, but it

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.500
ensures that the
resources are only

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.250
invested in the right products.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.810
As a matter of
fact, lots of games

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.560
get killed in this process.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.147
Also high-visibility ones,
so actually, some of them

00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:05.730
never see the light,
just because they

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.400
don't have good retention.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.640
If you want to
measure retention,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.700
you can do so with
Firebase Analytics.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.300
You have a retention
report that shows you

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.079
not only your retention
curve on the top, but also

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.720
your retention
stats by [? cores ?]

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.800
of users that installed
your app in a given day.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.790
So you can also track
how, as you release

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.790
newer versions of your app,
and people install them,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.770
how retention changed
and hopefully improves

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.650
as you optimize for retention.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.810
All right.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.940
So lots of common ground.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.290
Retention is king.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.340
But I want to share with
you three key rules that you

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.910
can take from games
developers and hopefully

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.840
use to optimize your apps.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.000
The first one is focusing
on the engagement cliff.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.630
What I mean by
engagement cliff is

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.060
shown by the same chart I
showed you before from Quettra,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.950
the retention curves here.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.610
They did the thing that
I didn't like before.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.170
If you look at, it's that
the biggest drop in retention

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.740
happens in the first seven days.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.030
No matter how
successful the app is,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.320
you see that that's
where retention really

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.310
drops dramatically.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.070
After that, all curves
tend to flatten.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.260
So really, the apps
that are doing a better

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.400
job in terms of
retention are doing

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.870
that in the first seven days.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.400
That's where you win.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.350
Now, depending on what
type of app you have,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.910
your day-seven average
retention can vary.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.010
You see here on the
right average retention,

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.040
day-seven retention, for
different categories of apps.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.390
So it varies between 40%
for news and magazines

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.810
to 15% for photography.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.990
But that means that between
60% and 85% of users

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.170
are lost in those
first seven days.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.940
So clearly, lots of impact in
addressing those first seven

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:01.980
days.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.750
And that's because users
download lots of apps,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.980
and they try them.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.700
And during those
first few experiences,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.210
they actually decide whether
they want to keep using them.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.940
Or otherwise they
forgot about them,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.640
so sometimes they
uninstall them.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.990
So really, addressing that
specific experience-- that is,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.990
between learning about your
app, being comfortable with it,

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.560
and deciding to
actually keep using it--

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.850
is the most important part.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.870
Games know this very well.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.100
They actually face a very
steep engagement cliff,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.710
which is you have to
learn how the game works.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.930
You have to learn new rules,
you have to learn new mechanics,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.260
you have to understand
why you should go

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.950
through all these challenges.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.530
You need to care about it also.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.410
And that part of the experience
is normally the tutorial.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.260
Games spend a lot of
resources and time

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.460
optimizing the tutorial, because
they know how critical it is.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.140
I want to play a video,
an except of a video,

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.890
that we shot with Pixelberry.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.790
It was a very successful
game developer,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.500
and it's particularly
good with their tutorials.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.860
They have more than
75% of users that

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.650
start one of their tutorials
actually complete them.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.624
So let me play the video here.

00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:17.290
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.410
-Players coming in, we hit
them with story right away,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.010
and we try and do
it in a way where

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.350
it's a little more natural.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.930
We are cognizant that a
lot of people playing games

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.100
on mobile phones may not
want to read too much text,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.575
so we try to ease
players into that.

00:07:33.575 --> 00:07:36.120
But by the time they
finish our tutorial,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.960
we're hoping that
they're already caught up

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.140
in the lives of
these characters,

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.940
and they want to learn more
about their backstories

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.080
and what's going on.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.440
-I think it is
important to give people

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.539
kind of that sense of
progression in a game,

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:48.080
especially in mobile
games, because I

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.460
think with a lot of games,
you can reach a certain point

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.336
where you're just
repeating the same actions,

00:07:53.336 --> 00:07:55.793
and you want to feel like you're
doing something different.

00:07:55.793 --> 00:07:57.950
And I think story is a
great way of differentiating

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.774
that and saying, oh, now you're
dealing with a new villain,

00:08:00.774 --> 00:08:02.940
or now you're dealing with
new issue that's come up.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.040
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.600
MATTEO VALLONE: So they
talk about two key things.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.220
One is the story.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.190
The story for their
game is the key element,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.730
the key value that
you should care

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.470
about when you play this game.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.650
And they want to
make sure that you

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.400
start experiencing the story
from the first experience.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.340
Why should the player
care about this game?

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.650
The second thing they
talk about is progression,

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.040
the sense of progression
that should always

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.950
be present in games.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.610
And if you think about it,
this goes beyond the tutorial.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.440
It's actually what a game is.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.679
It always presents you
with a new challenge.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.262
That challenge, though,
shouldn't be too challenging.

00:08:40.262 --> 00:08:42.470
Otherwise, you're frustrated,
and you leave the game.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.928
But also, it
shouldn't be too easy.

00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:47.040
Otherwise, you get bored,
and you also leave the game.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.840
And so games think
a lot about that,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.940
and this is an example
of how they look at it.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.430
Playdots, another
successful game developer,

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.530
built this chart for their
game called Two Dots.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.410
And the chart is lots of dots,
and those dots are actually

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.740
levels in the game.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.460
And those levels are
mapped along two variables.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.740
One is the revenue per player
in that specific level,

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.920
and the other one is the
lapse rate in that level.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.430
So how many people left
the game in that level?

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.330
This gives you an idea about
how frustrating and challenging

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.696
the level is and also
how actually engaging

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:24.070
and how much people
actually want

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.160
to spend money in that level.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.970
By optimizing the difficulty
level of the levels--

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.090
sorry for-- below the
red line, they actually

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.010
manage to improve
not only conversion,

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.320
but also average
revenue per paying user.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.780
So progression is
very important.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.600
But this is very
specific to games,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.700
so let's try to extrapolate
some learnings for apps.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.510
Climbing the
engagement cliff is all

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.830
about recognizing that
those first seven days are

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.930
very important and
also quite difficult

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.830
for a user to go through them.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.320
There's lots of
things happening,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.910
and really, the value of your
app is not clear to them yet.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.660
So the first thing
you should focus on

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.720
is finding that key feature
that, without much engagement,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.010
provides value to the user--
something that can give them

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.710
a wow effect, or something
that can convince them

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.590
that they should stick around.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.270
And it shouldn't require
too much for them

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.800
to actually unlock that.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.550
So present that straight away.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.970
The second thing is defining
those activation moments,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.530
those things, those steps
in that engagement cliff,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.670
that you need the
user to go through.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.910
It could be signing
in, uploading something

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.200
about themselves,
adding some friends.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.000
Whatever key action,
activation moment,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.430
you need them to do to fully
unlock the value of your app

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.080
and start using it to
its full potential.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.770
Those are the
activation moments.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.310
You should make
sure at that point

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:56.920
that those are
presented gradually,

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.680
with a gradual investment
from a user perspective,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.970
so that the user
is not overwhelmed.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.810
They feel the sense
of progression,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.940
they're going in
a direction, they

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.070
understand why you are asking
them to do these things,

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.860
and they're actually
gradually unlocking

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.530
the value of your app.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.260
As part of that-- for
example, if you're

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.930
requiring them to sign in-- you
should treat that as a service.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.120
You should show them
the value of doing that

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.530
before asking them to do it.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.490
This is, again, in that
sense of progression

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.470
of unlocking that value,
showing them the value

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.050
first, and then asking
them to do something.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.730
Also, if you have pay
walls, you should carefully

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.770
manage the appearance of them
in those first seven days.

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.270
Again, the user doesn't really
know exactly the full value

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.470
of your app yet.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.632
You probably don't want to
overwhelm them and ask them

00:11:47.632 --> 00:11:52.400
also about paying until they're
fully comfortable with the app,

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.030
and they've actually
unlocked the full value.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.240
You can optimize along
these lines using, again,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.920
Firebase Analytics.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.150
The final report
here can help you.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.820
In the final report, you
can create any custom event

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.760
that you want.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.320
It could be signing in,
uploading a photo, whatever

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.570
process, activation moment you
need the user to go through,

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.880
can be defined in
the final reports.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.940
And you can track how many
users start that process or task

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.190
and complete it.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.190
So you can also put
them in a sequence

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.980
and see, as a funnel,
where the user gets stuck.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:31.720
You can see how
many people started

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.210
one action, the second
action, the third action,

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.820
and identify those roadblocks
that stopped them from actually

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.050
going through all of them.

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.510
So a very powerful tool.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.820
And now I want to show
you a couple of examples

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.710
of apps that have implemented
this rule successfully

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.590
in their app.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.610
The first one is OkCupid.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:52.390
OkCupid is a dating app.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.570
Dating apps are a great
example of engagement cliff,

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.540
because before you can
actually use a dating app,

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.290
you have to do lots of things.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.200
You have to sign in, you have to
write something about yourself,

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.100
you have to upload
a photo of yourself,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.170
you have to answer some
questions in some cases,

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.350
like in OkCupid's case, and you
have to start liking people.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.200
So lots of things.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.010
And OkCupid recently redesigned
their whole onboarding

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.350
experience to make it more
gradual and step-by-step.

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.780
Also, they made each task
more enjoyable, skippable,

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.650
and they provided good
positive feedback to the user

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.740
as they went through these
tasks, again announcing

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.350
this sense of progression
that the user had

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.050
to feel to actually
complete these tasks.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:41.070
As a result, they got 21%
better day-seven retention.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:45.730
This means that after seven
days, they had 20% more users.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.490
Same cost per install,
after seven days

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.800
they had 20% more users.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.620
How they did this?

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.280
This is how it looked
before the redesign.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:58.390
So you see they're asking you to
write something about yourself,

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:01.710
to upload a photo, to
answer some questions.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.090
And this is all presented
in a series of modal windows

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.070
with no clear sequencing.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.360
Also, if you start one of
these activities-- for example,

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.240
answering the question--
you see here on the right,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.040
those are presented
all together.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.305
Doesn't look very fun
to go through them.

00:14:20.305 --> 00:14:22.820
It's quite actually
overwhelming.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.740
This is how it looks
after the redesign.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.620
The first and only
thing you need

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.980
to care about after
you sign in is

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.140
answering those five questions.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.540
You have to answer
one by one, and it's

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.040
easy and nice to go
through all of them.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.440
You swipe right to say yes,
you swipe left to say no.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.520
Once you have completed
this task, then, only then,

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.610
you're asked to upload a photo.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.140
You can do it or skip it,
but that's the only thing

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.860
you need to care about.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.150
And after that, you can
start enjoying the app.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.630
You can browse and start
getting familiar with it,

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.560
and you already have
done part of what

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.970
you need to do to actually
be able to use it.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.970
But also, they remind
you of the other things

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.880
that you should do in
order to fully unlock

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.070
the value-- in this
case, start liking

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.400
five people so that their
algorithm can better match you

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.941
with people that you might like.

00:15:13.941 --> 00:15:14.440
All right.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.450
That was in one example.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.200
The other example is Freeletics.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.730
Freeletics is a
fitness app, and I

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.810
think that's probably the best
example of an engagement cliff.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.450
When you download a
fitness app, you're

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.090
probably not doing fitness yet.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.890
So the fitness app needs to
convince you to go to the gym

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.160
and actually do fitness.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.900
It's not enough if you just
download the app, right?

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.640
So that's the first
key challenge.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.840
The second challenge is,
when you download the app,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.810
and you actually go to
the gym to use your app,

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.480
there might be some
time in between.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.610
And what do you do with the app?

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.160
And in those days that
you're not going to the gym,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.640
you might forget
about it, or you

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.540
might find another app, right?

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.170
So how do you keep users
engaged in that time frame?

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.620
And that's common
to other verticals,

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.630
but definitely fitness is
a good example of that.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.190
Freeletics addressed
these challenges

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.800
by making sure that their
onboarding experience felt

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.850
more personal from the
first minute you started.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.640
You're building some
key attainable goal

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.380
that is personalized
based on your input

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.810
and that you feel more empowered
to actually go and achieve.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.190
As a result, they obtained
47% better day-one retention,

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:31.555
so almost 50% more users,
after the first day,

00:16:31.555 --> 00:16:33.340
kept using the app.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.330
How they did that?

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.590
This is how it looked
before their redesign.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.220
So basically, you
download the app,

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.340
you get a few cards
of what the app does.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.400
And right after, you
are asked to sign in.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.940
And after signing
in, you're asked

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.610
to obtain their newsletter.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.770
After that, you're
considered a registered user,

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.980
and you can start
browsing the app,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.840
understanding what it does for
you, and taking next steps,

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.060
basically.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.800
What they did is
introducing this.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.760
After those first few
cards that I showed you,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.730
the photos about the app, the
thing they do is they ask you,

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.480
are you are a male or a female?

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.300
Let's start understanding
who you are.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.356
And once you answer
that first question,

00:17:15.356 --> 00:17:16.980
they start personalizing
the appearance

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.063
of the rest of the screen.

00:17:18.063 --> 00:17:19.926
So if you're a male,
you see a male picture.

00:17:19.926 --> 00:17:21.800
If you're a female, you
see a female picture.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.180
And then they ask you,
what's your fitness level?

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.550
They also tell you why
they're asking you this.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.480
It's because they're
starting to know you.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.330
They're starting
to learn about what

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.820
you care about so that they
can build your first workout

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.980
experience.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.720
Clear value, they're
treating this information

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.850
as a service for you,
and they're giving you

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.890
a sense of progression.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.370
Third step is what's your goal?

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.760
Do you want to lose weight?

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.550
Do you want to build muscles?

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.650
Why do you want to do fitness?

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.440
After that, only after that,
you are asked to sign in.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.820
Now you understand the
value of signing in.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.620
You're storing this
information, and you're

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.930
allowing them to build your
personal workout experience.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.910
Much different than
just asking people

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.970
to sign in without knowing
why I should sign in.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.360
Then they ask you if you want
to join their newsletter,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.990
but again, you
understand why now.

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:14.210
They are going to send you
personal recommendations, based

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.460
on your goals, to your inbox.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.720
After that, the
last thing you see

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.160
is a feedback screen
that tells you

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.610
that they're actually building
your first workout experience.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.220
So again, it's much
more compelling

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.330
to go through the first
experience of this app,

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.860
even if you're not at the
gym, because you are doing

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.960
something in that direction.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.680
There is a progression toward
that first gym experience.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.770
And also, after this, you
feel that you have some goal,

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.940
and probably you are more
motivated to actually go

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.450
to the gym in and do it.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.010
And actually, this can
be seen in the impact

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:54.977
that they had also on day-three
retention, which was 17% better

00:18:54.977 --> 00:18:56.060
than the previous version.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.630
So even after this
first experience,

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.629
people were actually
using the app more,

00:19:01.629 --> 00:19:03.170
and that's probably
because they were

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.720
more motivated to go to
the gym and actually do

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.610
what you do with a fitness
app, which is fitness.

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.520
All right.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.790
That was onboarding, and
hopefully at this point,

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.500
your users are
retained, onboarded,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.250
and they understand
the value of your app,

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.310
and you want to monetize them.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.750
The next two rules
are about that.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.530
The first one,
embracing your app's

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.850
multiple personality disorder.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.320
This is what I mean by that.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.990
This is an average
revenue distribution

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.690
curve for an average game.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.930
No matter how
successful a game is,

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.090
lots of people will
not spend a dime in it.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.460
And even among the
ones that spend,

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.960
there are very different amounts
that they're going to spend.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.850
A big segment might
spend very little;

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.640
a small segment might
spend lots of money.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.010
And then there are other
segments in between.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:00.720
Recognizing, understanding
what each user is going

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.860
to potentially
spend in your game;

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.280
and how they like to
spend; what is the value

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.290
perception that they have; what
is their propensity to spend;

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.430
and targeting them
based on what you

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.770
know about them with special,
custom, in-app purchase

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:19.630
offers-- that's the key to
achieve much better conversion

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.570
and revenue per user.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.550
This is an example of how a
game developer looks at this.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.800
This is Wooga, and it's
just one way to look at it.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.430
They segment their users
along two variables.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.830
One is progression in the
game and the other one

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.000
is spending level.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.505
So for each segment
you see in blue,

00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:42.050
they have a different
way to target them,

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.980
different offers that
they can trigger to

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.720
for that specific segment.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.540
For example, if
you're a new player,

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.720
they offer you a starter pack.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.490
Now, if you buy this, you
become an early spender.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.990
You're not just a
new player, you're

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.670
someone who spends early.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.000
And they try to upsell
with some other offer.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.324
If you buy that, then you
become an early heavy spender.

00:21:06.324 --> 00:21:07.740
You're in a different
segment now,

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.781
and they might target you
with a different offer.

00:21:09.781 --> 00:21:12.610
If you don't buy, you
might become a mid spender,

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.620
so later in the game, they
know which steps you took,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.710
and they will target you with
a different discounted offer

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.200
based on that segment.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.880
If you don't buy then, you
might become a late spender,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.210
so they will target later,
even later in the game,

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.170
with an even different offer.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.480
That's a very simple but very
effective way to look at.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.700
A more advanced and
complicated but very effective

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.120
way is this other
example from Space Ape.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.260
What they do is that they
analyze their players' behavior

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.170
in those first seven days, and
they predict the lifetime value

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.170
that those users will bring
to the game for the rest

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:49.690
of their life in the game.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.820
And they look at how they
spend, what they spend on,

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.390
and also how they like to spend.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.600
And then they target them
with different offers.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.760
By doing this, they achieve two
times better conversion then

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.200
having a one-size-fits-all
approach.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.600
This is how it works.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.290
Players play.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.230
For the first seven
days, Space Ape

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.980
analyzes their behavior,
their spending pattern.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.350
And based on their
lifetime-value models,

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:22.410
they predict how much value
each user will bring to the game

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.310
and how they like to spend.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.730
And they assign each user
to a separate segment.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.020
Here you see an example
of two segments, just

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.360
to give you an idea.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.650
The first segment has
medium lifetime value,

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.880
but they actually spent a lot.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.620
Only they spent in one
go, and they're not

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.070
very frequent buyers.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.090
They might not
spend again, or they

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:48.940
will spend, but at a later
stage, not very frequently.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.160
The second group, they spend
less in a single instance,

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.110
but they're more frequent.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.030
They're going to keep
coming and spending.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.380
So their lifetime
value is higher;

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.490
it's just that they like to
spend in a different way.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.330
These two segments will see
different offers in the game.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.940
The first one will
see a big bundle

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.150
with a very high price point.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.670
Lots of value in it,
but that's the way

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.410
to convert these people.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:20.850
They're not scared about
seeing a big price point,

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:24.110
but they also want more value,
because they're not probably

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.740
not going to come
back and spend later.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.300
And that's what you should
focus on as a developer.

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:35.110
Now, the second segment will
see a much smaller bundle,

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.550
and that will make
them comfortable,

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.830
and they will probably
convert with that.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.210
But also, the developer
knows that they will probably

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.690
come back and buy more.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:48.330
So overall, their lifetime
value will be higher.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.780
OK, let's generalize and
extrapolate some rules that you

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.060
can take as app developers.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.560
You need to recognize
that users will

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.360
have a very different value
perception of your app.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.410
And no matter how successful
you are, no matter how relevant

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.180
your app is, they will
have a different propensity

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.350
to spend and also a
different way to spend.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.175
If you can recognize that,
segment your user base based

00:24:13.175 --> 00:24:17.120
on this, and target them
with specific, custom in-app

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.100
purchase offers, then
you can definitely

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.260
achieve a much better
conversion and revenue per user.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.990
You can use again
Firebase to do that.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.300
First of all, you can
use Firebase Analytics

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.240
to build segments exactly like
the one I showed you before.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.790
Here we use it to build a high
lifetime value segment that

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.400
actually has a very
small single price

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.330
point but frequent
purchase behavior,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.230
and a medium lifetime
value segment

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:52.670
that has a high single
price point but not frequent

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.420
spend behavior.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.520
This is all done with
Firebase Analytics

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.890
using events and attributes
that the users have.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.170
And based on this, you can
track how they perform.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.200
Any chart in Firebase
Analytics will show you

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.570
these two different
segments and how they behave

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.119
so you can better study them.

00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:11.660
But now what you
can do, you can also

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.980
target them with different
offers using remote config

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.760
in Firebase.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.000
The way it works, for
example, let's say

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.630
you sell a subscription.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.130
You're a newspaper
or a fitness app,

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.050
and you sell a subscription.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:30.540
For the first segment, the one
with high single spend points

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.530
but not very frequent,
you can build a promotion

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.590
for your annual subscription.

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:38.890
These guys are comfortable
spending a lot,

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.364
but they don't want to
be bothered every month.

00:25:41.364 --> 00:25:43.280
They will buy an annual
subscription probably,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.020
so you can have a heavily
discounted annual subscription

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.240
for them.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.890
And for the other group
with a higher lifetime

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.010
value but single
price point lower,

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.080
you can have a discount
on a monthly subscription.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.290
So the price point
will be lower,

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.260
but they're more
comfortable doing that,

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.620
and you can target
them with this offer.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.480
Again, it's very easy to
do this with remote config.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.750
And you don't need to code.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.990
You just need to go
through the options,

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.410
and it will be very easy.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.000
This works on in-app
purchases for virtual goods.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.150
It also works for
physical goods.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:23.260
So if you have an
e-commerce app, for example,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:24.700
this example applies to you.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.380
This is Wish, a very
successful e-commerce app.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.049
And they basically,
in their screen,

00:26:31.049 --> 00:26:32.840
they show products to
users that they think

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.590
they might want to buy.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.500
And they also apply
the same concept.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.730
They show less expensive
items to users that

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.280
have shown less engagement.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.210
Maybe they haven't
bought anything yet,

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.168
they started using the
app, or they're just not

00:26:45.168 --> 00:26:46.300
that much engaged.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.460
And once they see that the
users are more engaged,

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.870
they spend maybe
a couple of times,

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.990
they start showing them
more expensive products.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:58.420
Again, this proves
that it works.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.605
As a result, they obtained
10% better conversion.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:03.950
All right.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:06.590
The last rule is
selling umbrellas

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.110
where and when it rains.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.010
It's basically not only about
what you sell, umbrellas,

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.420
but when and where
you sell them.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.640
So the best way to describe
them, to describe this example,

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.320
is showing you
what Playdots does.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.800
They recently redesigned their
old in-app purchase flow,

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.790
and as a result they
obtained 10% better revenue

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.570
per active user.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.140
So without changing
their user base,

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.980
they got 10% better revenues
just by redesigning along

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.500
these lines.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.630
And I'll show you
what I mean here.

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:46.040
So the first thing, when
you start a new level,

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.960
you see how many boosters
you have available for you.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.430
And they give you
one button that you

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.350
can use to purchase whatever
boxes or boosters you

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.760
need to finish that level.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.760
So you don't have to go
in the store in the game

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.910
and buy what you think you might
need; they prompt you to buy

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.760
before you start the level
exactly what you need, and they

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.710
show you what you already have.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.350
Similarly, when you die
in a level-- in this case,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.382
you're running out of
movess-- they show you

00:28:11.382 --> 00:28:13.340
another call to action
that says, why don't you

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.160
buy those extra five
moves that you need

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.880
to finish the game, the level.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.550
So you don't have
to quit the game,

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:23.030
go to the store in the
game, and buy what you need.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.670
You can buy it
now, without having

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:28.820
to quit the level that you're
actually trying to finish.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.700
By only doing this, they
got 6% more paying users

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.620
by just adding these
two calls to action.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.480
The other thing they did is
they moved some in-game items

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.180
that you can purchase right
into the UI of the game.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.970
So again, you don't
have to quit the game.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.270
You can buy them as
you play, whenever

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.070
you want, with one tap.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.180
They're always there.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.180
By doing that, they got
5% better average revenue

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.840
per user.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.150
So really, it's all about making
purchasing easy, accessible,

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.490
but also relevant-- positioning
those in-app purchases,

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:08.110
those products that you're
selling, exactly where you

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:10.460
think that the user
will need them,

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.600
and triggering
calls to action when

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.750
you think that those
are the most relevant

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.130
so that users are more
compelled to actually purchase.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:25.790
The best example to show
how this works in an app

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.180
environment is TomTom.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.140
Last year, they moved
from a premium model,

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.600
so you just had
to pay for the app

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.130
to use the app, to freemium.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:41.024
And in that transition, they
got 2.4 more paying users.

00:29:41.024 --> 00:29:42.940
And that's because they
thought very carefully

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.940
about their business
model, and they really

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.740
implemented very
well, especially

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:50.380
along the lines of the rule
that I described to you before.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.070
This is how it looks.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.530
It's very similar to the
game I showed you before.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.867
You have 75 kilometers
to use the app for free.

00:29:58.867 --> 00:30:00.200
After that, you have to upgrade.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.908
And upgrading means
that you're basically

00:30:01.908 --> 00:30:05.420
buying what they used to
sell before as a premium app.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.580
What they did is that they
positioned that Upgrade button

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.010
in the UI of the app,
and it's always there.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.670
No matter where you are,
it's always one tap away.

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:17.600
You also see the countdown
of those free kilometers

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.000
that you still have.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.930
So you also feel the urgency of
upgrading if you're running out

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.450
of kilometers.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.380
Very easy, very relevant.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.740
The other thing they did is they
introduced some calls to action

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.820
when they thought you would
need to upgrade the most.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.660
For example, you
start a new trip,

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.400
and they know that
you will run out

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.050
of kilometers during that trip.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:42.614
They tell you, why don't you
upgrade now instead of doing it

00:30:42.614 --> 00:30:43.530
while they're driving?

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:45.040
You might not have a connection.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.240
So really, when you
start an activity

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:52.080
that they know is more
likely to convert you,

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.974
they prompt you to do it.

00:30:53.974 --> 00:30:56.140
Second, of course, they
show you that call to action

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.765
when you're actually running out
of kilometers, or you ran out.

00:30:58.765 --> 00:31:01.420
So those little things
actually add up,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.980
and they're the ones
that really make

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.620
a freemium model successful.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.460
Another example,
a bit more simple

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.940
and maybe more
applicable in most cases,

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.595
is the subscription example.

00:31:14.595 --> 00:31:16.970
If you sell a subscription,
normally with a subscription,

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.830
you'll unlock different
features and content.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.462
And yes, you can offer
that in your app,

00:31:23.462 --> 00:31:25.170
and you can have a
list of all the things

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.830
that that subscription unlocks.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:29.810
But also, showing the
content and the feature

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:33.450
in the flow of the app
that are behind a pay wall,

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.140
and prompting the
user to upgrade

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.520
when they're actually
trying to access those,

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.780
is very impactful.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.800
This is what Busuu does.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.210
It is a language-learning
app, and their subscription

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.370
basically unlocks more
content and more languages.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.530
And they started putting these
calls to action with a button

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.000
to actually go into
the purchase flow

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.090
when you're trying to
access that content

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.530
and those languages that
are behind the pay wall.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.740
And you see the result
here-- 30% better conversion

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.740
with the premium content
and 83% better conversion

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.830
with the languages.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.490
So very impactful.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.310
All right, to wrap up, the
three rules we talked about

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:13.290
are climbing the
engagement cliff, which

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:18.180
is all about focusing
on those seven days

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.400
after the user has
installed the app,

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.660
understanding that those are the
key moments where the user is

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.220
still not comfortable
with your app,

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.180
defining the activation moments
you need them to go through,

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.840
and making sure that those
are presented gradually

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.936
in the experience in
the first seven days

00:32:32.936 --> 00:32:34.310
so that they are
not overwhelmed,

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.245
they feel a sense
of progression,

00:32:35.245 --> 00:32:37.500
they understand why they're
doing what they're doing,

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.708
and they hopefully fully
unlock the value of your app

00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:42.270
so that they might stick
around for much longer.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.050
The second rule is about
embracing your app's

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:46.780
multiple personality disorder.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.750
Freemium model is all
about lots of users

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:52.000
wanting different things
and having different value

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.860
perceptions.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:56.300
Being able to segment them,
understand what they want,

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.910
and target them based on their
segments will help you improve

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.450
your conversion in a much
more effective way than using

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.260
a one-size-fits-all approach.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.480
The third rule we
talked about is

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.065
selling umbrellas where
and when it rains,

00:33:11.065 --> 00:33:12.940
which means that it's
not only about what you

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.960
sell, but also how you sell it.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.730
And it makes a big
difference, making sure

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:21.340
that the in-app purchases
are presented in an easy way

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:25.150
to access them, always at
least one or two taps away

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:29.070
from purchasing, and also
triggering those calls

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:31.690
to action when you think
those in-app purchases are

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.000
most relevant for the user.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.210
So that was it.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.160
Thank you very much.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.260
