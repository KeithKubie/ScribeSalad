00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.928
 [MUSIC PLAY] 

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.090
 ANTHONY SULLIVAN: Mobile devices are extremely important to us 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.839
 by "The Guardian". 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:10.870
 That's why mobile devices are our future. 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.102
 Like many publishers, we see a huge transition 

00:00:13.102 --> 00:00:15.180
 heard from our mobile platforms. 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.480
 In fact, we see our program users 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.930
 Consume significantly more content than any of us 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.660
 other users. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.559
 Clearly, Android is a very large part of it. 

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:24.975
 TOM GRINSTED: We're not exaggerating 

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.960
 if we say program users, including our Android users, 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.310
 are our most valuable users across the portfolio. 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.350
 They read more about our content. 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.990
 They linger longer and spend more time with us. 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.000
 Program users are between 10 and 20 times 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.352
 more involved than the average web user. 

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:43.760
 Device-specific programs like our Android application provide features 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.310
 you can't find on the mobile web. 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.140
 And indeed, it is due to key issues 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.036
 like always being present. 

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:52.535
 The fact that once you are on the device, you are always there 

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.830
 and your device stays on - this gives us opportunities 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.550
 we never had before. 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.540
 For example, if you look at your Android web integration, 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.900
 in fact, it is about enabling people 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.260
 to "Guardian" notifications at a much more timely and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.800
 receive interesting way. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.870
 And then to read it or save it immediately 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.800
 until later when they see a story that is really important to them, 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.600
 but they are in a situation where they can't really read it. 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.040
 I'm really proud of the team here, 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.204
 and have a subscription acceptance rate of over 90%. 

00:01:18.204 --> 00:01:19.620
 So less than 10% of people choose 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.924
 not getting our notifications. 

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:22.465
 And it really speaks of the quality of 

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:25.330
 editorial choices we make about it. 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.760
 With such a great audience for our programs, 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.140
 personalization is becoming increasingly important. 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.084
 You can personalize your homepage. 

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:34.000
 And this is a very, very powerful feature. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.980
 This allows users to choose any kind of content 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.850
 from across the network. 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.946
 So it can be your favorite topic, 

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:42.320
 it can be your favorite author. 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.180
 And we want to make sure the content is relevant to them 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.550
 really prominent in their experience. 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.730
 ANTHONY SULLIVAN: Getting users involved is of the utmost importance. 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.070
 In fact, in many respects it is more important than simply being 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.861
 have a large number of users for "The Guardian". 

00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:56.610
 And to establish a habit is very important to us. 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.152
 So it doesn't just help us with monetization, 

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.830
 but also for that right, almost lifelong relationship, with the audience 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.020
 to build. 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.305
 TOM GRINSTED: As a business we believe with our whole heart 

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:06.471
 that is the only way to be confident about the products we have 

00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:09.240
 is going to launch is to test them, test them and test them again-- 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.060
 and exposing them to as many real readers as possible and real 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.960
 users. 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.890
 We do this through Google Play, by responding to reviews. 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.000
 We do this through the Android beta program. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.749
 The reason we do all these things, 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.970
 is because we really want to understand 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.600
 what they do with our products. 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.620
 And what they find difficult, 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.690
 and they love a lot. 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.470
 That kind of feedback helps us make strategic decisions 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.510
 about what is most important to our readers 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.800
 when they use the program. 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.484
 A good example is the new Search that we are currently releasing. 

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:36.900
 This is a direct response to feedback 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.540
 what we like about our beta program as well as on Google Play 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.680
 got it. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.260
 Mobile devices on Android have played a key role in us 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.340
 growth strategy in emerging markets 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.530
 as well as in established markets. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.200
 Looking at our new markets - 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.240
 India really a good example-- there 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.440
 people are going directly to mobile devices. 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.470
 And Android is a big part of it. 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.760
 Our work on Android is therefore part of our international growth.
