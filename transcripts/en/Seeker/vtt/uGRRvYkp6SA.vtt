00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.640
Sometimes it’s cold out.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.530
In fact, this 2017-18 winter is breaking RECORDS
for how cold it’s been!

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.590
The last year has seen over 10 and a half
thousand low temperature records broken.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.830
Prompting many to ask, is global warming even
real?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.830
I CAN SEE MY BREATH!

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.910
If you’re one of the many who question global
warming during the winter, you’re not alone.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.680
Remember when 
this happened?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.720
Snow?!

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.420
How can we have a warm globe and ALSO have
snow!?

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.850
The difference is… and let me speak plainly
here.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.820
WEATHER IS NOT CLIMATE.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.250
Or, put another way, weather is MOOD climate
is PERSONALITY.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.329
You could tweet your hashtag current mood,
but that’s not your overall personality,

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.329
right?

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.660
When you think of the climate this way, it
makes a lot more sense.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.660
Severe weather TODAY?

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.100
That’s a mood.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.460
MORE severe weather over years or decades?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.880
That’s Earth’s personality!

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.259
Citing severe winter as the reason there's
no such thing as global warming is like saying:

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.229
‘I’m happy today, so I don’t have depression,
bi-polar disorder, anxiety, or issues with

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.229
anger.’

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.429
No one can deny that fluctuation is just part
of having a personality.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:29.779
In this case, the personality of Mother Earth
TODAY, is changing from how she used to be.

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:30.779
And it’s troubling.

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:34.240
Now, if you’re one of those who deny Mother
Earth’s personality is changing, you’re

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.560
also not alone.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.899
There ARE scientists who aren’t sure if
humans are causing this climate personality

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:40.899
change.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.509
To that I say, picture Albuquerque.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.700
From 1991 to 2012 there were nearly 14,000
peer-reviewed published scientific papers

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.959
exploring climate science.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.139
24 of those dissented and didn’t blame humans.

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.460
To put those numbers in perspective, that's
like saying every single person in the United

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.899
States believes humans are causing climate
change, but the population of Albuquerque

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.899
doesn’t.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:02.899
That’s pretty astounding.

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.820
Would you believe Albuquerque, or literally
everyone else.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.319
Plus, even if YOU are just hearing about this
today, science has centuries of research on

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.150
weather, climate, and the atmosphere.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.379
In 1824 a scientist named Joseph Fourier realized
the Earth’s atmosphere is what traps the

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.819
sun’s heat -- like the glass in a greenhouse.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.780
Next in 1859, physicist John Tyndall put some
CO2 in a bottle and realized it trapped heat!

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.860
That was waaaay before accusations of a liberal
conspiracy hit the internet…

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.239
Then, in 1897, geologist Thomas Chamberlin
wrote that the “conditions for life” might

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.159
be subject to a delicate balance of CO2 in
the sea, earth and air!

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.870
And if we release the trapped CO2 from one
of these, we could upset that balance.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.500
And that’s what we’ve been doing.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.760
It’s been over 100 years and we’re forcing
Earth to change her personality -- to change

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.959
her climate.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.280
The planet’s PERSONALITY is shifting, and
that’s reflected in her MOOD swings.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.530
Since the 1950s, winter storms ARE getting
worse.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.819
The heaviest storms happen when the surface
temperature is between 32 and 28 degrees.

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.140
That’s still cold, Mr Snowball in Congress,
but it used to be much colder!

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.680
This warmer air can hold more moisture which
means more snow, more rain, and less freezing.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.969
So, even though winter exists and one part
of Earth might be cold right this second,

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.270
it’s still hotter everywhere on average.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.319
Record hot days are topping record cold days
three to one.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.920
And that’s because Fourier was wrong, the
atmosphere is not a sheet of glass.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.180
It’s a multilayered complex and ever-changing
system that we are still grasping an understanding

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.180
of.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.810
In the end, the trend of our climate will
continue, with stronger storms, wetter weather,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.579
and eventually higher average sea levels,
less ice and who knows what else.

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.079
Objective and documented observation says
that’s where this trail of moods leads.

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.879
As the personality of our climate changes,
we’re going to have to live with a Mother

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.859
Earth who is quick to anger, lashes out, and
is less kind to her human passengers.

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.720
But hey, at least we can still pack snowballs
and tweet denials.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.739

Let us know down in the comments.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.370
Obviously climate science is really really
complicated, and there's lots of other things

to consider here, but you know your opinion
is important.
