00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.770
The sprint is something
that you need to design and

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.980
it's the job of the sprint master or
you in this case, to plan the activities

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.490
that you're going to do before,
during and after the sprint.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.210
Let me give you an idea of what you
can expect in each of these periods.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.550
First, you should know that you're
going to do a lot of work up front.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.269
In general, you want to spend
about one day of planning for

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.750
each day of the design sprint.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.050
Now this will feel like a lot
of work and it should be.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.210
The good news is that good planning will
help you run a smooth design sprint and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.710
let you solve your design
challenge quickly.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.960
Before the design sprint,
you'll want to write a design brief.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.345
This will let you define
your design challenge and

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:41.918
then it will also let you set a timeline
for when you want to launch or when you

00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:46.220
want this deliverable, whatever it is
in the design sprint to be reviewed.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.052
Before the sprint, you'll also
want to invite team members or

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:50.090
talent to the sprint.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.459
Nadia will talk more
about this later and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:55.670
one of the key parts of a design
sprint is user testing.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.772
You need to schedule when users will
take a look at whatever you design from

00:00:58.772 --> 00:00:59.630
the design sprint.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.189
The user testing will keep you
accountable, validate product ideas and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.339
push you and perhaps your team
toward showing users something by

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:08.380
the end of the design sprint.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.040
Now this might now make a whole
lot of sense right now,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.060
but I guarantee you it will
by the end of this lesson.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.990
Finally, before the sprint, you'll also
want to schedule any lightning talks

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.820
more on this later and
you want to prep the slide deck

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.570
that you'll use in the sprint and
leave room for special materials.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.895
In the next video, I'll cover
the details of a design brief and

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:30.920
how you can appropriately
scope your design challenge.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.800
Here are the tasks that you'll
need to do during a design sprint.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.781
If you're working alone,
you won't need to do daily check ins and

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:40.137
daily summaries, instead you should
keep a master list of all the tasks you

00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:43.480
need to get done, so
that way you can stay organized.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.590
You should also write reflections after
each day, so you can look back on them

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.340
and get better at planning and designing
the sprints alone or with a team.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.350
One of the hardest parts about
conducting a design sprint

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.340
is facilitating conversation and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.460
resolving conflict among your
teammates should they arise.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.940
Now you won't really need to worry
about this if you're working alone, but

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.120
you will need to be the point person or

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.258
appoint someone else to resolve
any conflicts when they do arise.

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:13.930
After the design sprint, you should take
the lead to summarize the results and

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.000
plan next steps.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.843
If you worked with a team, you'll want
to send out a short survey to ask your

00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:22.880
teammates about how the design sprint
went and what could go better next time.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.011
If you're working solo, then you should
just reflect on what happened and

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.560
how you might improve in the future.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.220
And hopefully,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.420
you're already working towards
planning your next design sprint.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.210
All of this should feel like
a lot of work and well, it is.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.938
Thankfully, many other companies
have done design sprints before and

00:02:40.938 --> 00:02:43.859
there's tons of great resources and
documentation and

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.670
short articles about how
to conduct design sprints.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.078
Global Ventures, for example,

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:51.270
has put together this awesome
list of resources for you.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.497
They also have a great collection,
a library of resources that has short

00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:59.794
articles that will walk you through all
of the steps needed to schedule and

00:02:59.794 --> 00:03:01.960
conduct user research interviews.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.488
These are also the your
usability testing interviews

00:03:04.488 --> 00:03:06.630
that you'll do at the end
of a design sprint.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.599
All of these resources will be included
in a reading node at the end of this

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.130
lesson.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.380
They also have a great library
of additional resources.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.819
In this library, you'll find
a collection of short articles that will

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.604
walk you through all the steps needed to
schedule and conduct user research and

00:03:21.604 --> 00:03:25.503
usability interviews, The links to these
articles will be provided in a reading

00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:27.020
node at the end of this lesson.
