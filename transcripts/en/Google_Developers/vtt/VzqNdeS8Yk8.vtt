AMY WALGENBACH: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.400
My name is Amy Walgenbach, and
I am a product marketing

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.760
manager for Google+.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.730
And I'm really excited to be
here today to talk to you all

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.590
about how to grow your audience
with Google+.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.780
Just one housekeeping note is
that this is being recorded,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.870
so you don't need to take notes
or anything unless, of

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.630
course, you'd like to.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.770
So to get a little sense of
things, how many of you guys

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.320
have an app that you're
trying to grow?

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.790
And of those people that have
their hands up, how many of

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.190
you feel like you already have
an active presence on Google+?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.810
For those of you that are not
raising your hand, you are

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.420
making a mistake.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.040
So it's my goal to convince you
all why it's important to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.860
have an active presence and to
give you some practical advice

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.470
on how to use the platform
to grow your business.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.720
Let's get started.

00:01:06.285 --> 00:01:07.535
How do I turn it on?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.650
All right, so the agenda
is really simple.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.440
I'm just going to go into a
little bit of background about

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.170
Google+ and then spend the bulk
of the time talking to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.350
you about what you
should be doing.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.640
And then we'll save some time
for questions at the end.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.740
So what exactly is Google+?

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.130
We've been compared to social
networks, identity log ins,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.170
and even at an earlier talk
today I heard someone ask if

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.780
Google+ was trying to be
a blogging platform.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.080
So our approach is simple.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.110
Google+ is an effort to enhance
your Google experience

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.770
by adding your identity so we
know a little bit more about

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.210
you, the notion of your
relationships and sharing.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.850
So instead of trying to explain
to you what makes

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.700
Google+ so special, I thought
I'd start with a video about

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.440
some of the engagement
we've seen over the

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.540
past year on the platform.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.615
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:17.080
-We're the first ones that
are doing it like this.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.330
It's history!

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.340
-I have a new single that I
really want to premiere.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.300
-Google+, this is Houston.

-[SPEAKING JAPANESE].

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.497
-Because when you are talking to
a late night comedian, the

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:31.619
best thing to do is to probably
get his thoughts on

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:32.160
the colonization of
other planets.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.966
-Touchdown [INAUDIBLE].

-[SQUEALING].

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.603
-Hi everyone.

00:02:43.603 --> 00:02:44.086
It's Ellie.

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:46.492
I'm going to sign this
album right here.

00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:48.852
What would you like
me to write?

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:50.740
-Can I hug you?

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.510
-How does it feel
to go that fast?

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.470
-You're just gliding along.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.450
-What is it that drives you?

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.970
-I love track and field.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.530
The fame, the downfalls.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.780
For me the work is intense but
I want to be a legend.

00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:04.190
-That's the biggest thing
that you can do in life.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.200
You have to dream.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.380
-I'm going over.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.890
-Mr. President, welcome
to Google+.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.010
-Thanks everybody.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.090
-I couldn't be more excited to
bring you into my world.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.990
-I'm from Germany.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.580
-Chile.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.290
-Regards from [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.478
-Everybody say hi.

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:15.730
That's the whole world.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.980
-Hi.

00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:30.654
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:33.700
AMY WALGENBACH: So people all
over the world are using

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.090
Google+ to connect to people
they've never met before but

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.680
with whom they share a common
interest, a shared passion.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.760
Whether it be music, sports,
politics or even space travel,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.250
people are forging real
relationships and connecting

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.230
face to face on Google+.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.430
And this community is large,
and it continues to grow.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.090
What we've seen is over 390
million people are taking

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.770
social actions across Google.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.140
And that's things like +1ing
their favorite app in the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.250
Google Play store or writing
a review of their favorite

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.870
restaurant using their
real identity.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.959
And on Google+, we've seen this
active community be about

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.440
190 million 30-day active users
in the Google+ stream.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.760
These numbers were just
released yesterday.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.170
And our active users
are highly active.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.850
They're sharing with
friends, joining

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.880
Hangouts, uploading photos.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.260
Simply put, Google+ is huge.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.580
And it just continues to grow.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.450
So it's not an audience
that you can ignore.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.490
So now you're probably thinking,
OK, this is really

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.020
impressive.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.590
But how do I use this?

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.335
How do I take advantage of
all of this activity?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.010
And we've spent a lot of time
talking to developers and

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.740
companies just like you guys.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.770
And we've talked to those
that are most active

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.130
on Google+ and learned.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.860
And what we've heard is that
Google+ is enabling better

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.310
discoverability of your apps.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.280
It's creating a new breed of
more personal engagement, like

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.020
getting face to face in a
Hangout or connecting around

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.380
common interests.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.170
And third, it's helping extend
the value of Social to your

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.880
site and apps.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.170
So let's take a closer look
about each of these, starting

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.945
with how Google+ can help you
get discovered across Google.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.010
And the importance of great
content, whether you create it

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.620
yourself or you partner with a
content creator, is critical

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.210
for your marketing.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.960
With an active Google+ page,
Google can help you surface

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.710
your post content in many
ways across Google.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.540
And I'm going to show you a
couple ways where your content

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.530
can be discovered.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.090
And one of the most important
times we surface your content

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.180
is in Google Search.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.660
So what I'm going to do now is
show you the most amazing and

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.590
groundbreaking way you can
double the size of your

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.420
footprint in Google Search.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.330
Are you ready?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.980
So in this example, this is
SoundCloud's Google+ page.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.030
They're active.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.250
They're posting regularly.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.870
The page is verified.

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.100
And they're using Google+
Sign In to send

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.950
activities to Google.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.650
So let's take a look at what's
going on with them in Search.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.420
Before Google+, a search for
SoundCloud yielded a bunch of

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.670
blue links.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.570
But thanks to their active
Google+ presence, they have an

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.270
incredibly more compelling,
engaging and

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.060
relevant search presence.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.900
I mean, it's very visual.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.090
Your eye is just drawn towards
that right hand side.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.180
And you can see on that right
hand side, there's their

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.750
Profile Icon.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.700
There's a Follow button so that
users can add them to

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.320
their Circles directly
from search.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.660
Below, because they're an active
page, real time content

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.590
is surfaced.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.890
So you can see their
most recent post.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.340
And also, you can see aggregate
and trending

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.280
activity from users, user
activity from within that app.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.760
So if you integrate Google+ Sign
In app activities, user

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.010
activity from your app
can be seen from

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.880
branded search queries.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.370
And these links deep link
into your content.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.180
So this is an incredible amount
of real estate they're

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.700
getting because they have an
active presence on Google+.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.340
And it doesn't cost
them any money.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.090
They don't need to
pay for this.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.100
And it's seen to every Google
user, not just those that are

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.820
following them.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.080
It's pretty powerful.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.820
So this is great, when someone
is specifically looking for

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.720
your brand.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.370
But what about when someone's
searching for a generic,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.870
non-branded term?

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.310
So here's a search for a summer
cocktail, something I'm

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.270
looking forward to
after this talk.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.650
And something that you wouldn't
normally tend to see

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.210
branded content appear.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.790
But Martha Stewart, the Food
Network and Marie Claire

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.420
content shows up because I
follow them in Google+.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.350
So this is a prime example
of how Google+ can drive

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.870
discovery of some of
your best content.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.890
And it shapes brand
awareness and

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.800
consideration sets in the process.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.780
So if you've ever pondered
the value of a

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.480
follower, this is it.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.490
This is your answer.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.159
You can reach more people who
follow you on Google+ with

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.500
your content in ways that
you couldn't before.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.900
So their content wouldn't have
appeared for me in the Search

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.900
Results if I hadn't been
following them in Google+.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:53.580
And I wouldn't have clicked on
that link for a margarita.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.630
So your followers will see your
content in Search across

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:02.010
a variety of topics, re-engaging
them back to you.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:07.770
So the more followers you have,
the more people you have

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.320
a chance to reach with
your content.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.690
And another great example of
this is seen in Search Ads.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.410
How many of you use AdWords?

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.490
OK, a couple.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.240
So this will be relevant
for you guys.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.790
So with a Google+ page, an
active page, and with Social

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.010
Annotations enabled in AdWords,
Google surfaces

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.410
follower count.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.480
And on average, Search Ads with
these annotations perform

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.990
about 5% to 10% higher.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:45.720
So this means that your Search
then gets more efficient and

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.580
you get more traffic.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.270
And not only are social
recommendations sending you

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.900
more traffic, but they're also
getting you better, more

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.740
qualified traffic.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.950
They're driving conversions
and can ultimately have a

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.270
significant effect on
your bottom line.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.390
And the best part is, is that
if you have an Enhanced

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.840
Campaign in AdWords enabled
already, then you don't need

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.320
to do this.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.290
It's automatic.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.640
Pretty cool.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.620
And it's not just about getting
your content into

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.390
Google Search.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.310
It's about getting your content
across all of Google.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:20.700
So here's an example.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.990
My friend Christian sent me
a post about an app that I

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.640
should check out.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.370
A couple weeks ago, some
members of the Google+

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.910
marketing team, we went
on a juice cleanse.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:34.625
And right before I/O was
probably not the best time for

00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:37.230
a juice cleanse, but
we made it through.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.960
And he recommended this app for
me to use if I was tired.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.290
And so when I went to the Google
Play store, I saw that

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.500
over 20 of my friends had +1ed
that app, creating powerful

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.750
social proof to download
the app.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.720
So this example is meant to show
that people who follow

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.170
your brand, they're more
likely to share it on

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.380
Google+ and +1 it.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.400
So having engaged followers
helps you get more +1's, which

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.650
helps you get discovered.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.940
And we've even begun to expand
this concept to other

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.970
properties like YouTube.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.120
So in this case, the only reason
this Ford video shows

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.760
up in my YouTube feed
is because I

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.770
follow them on Google+.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.670
And on a more personalized
level, the only reason this

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.540
Dodge RAM video shows up, is
because my friend Christian,

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.390
who I follow on Google+,
shared it.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:34.680
So if Ford, Dodge, and Christian
hadn't shared these

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.580
videos via Google+, I never
would have found them.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.990
The point is, sharing videos
in Google+ drives social

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.820
discoverability in YouTube.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.700
So if you have a page and you
share video content, the more

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.020
followers you have, the more
opportunity it is for your

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.480
video content to
appear to them.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.850
So now that we've heard some
ways on how you can get your

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.600
content to spread across Google+
and Google, let's talk

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.370
about how you can make
this happen.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:09.570
So building your presence
starts with a page.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.820
And you really want
to be posting

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.540
rich content regularly.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.590
And as I mentioned before, the
more followers you have, the

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.930
bigger opportunity for people
to discover your brand.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.450
And of course, in order to get
that great effect and to

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.580
increase your imprint in Google
Search, you want to

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.455
send app activities via
Google+ Sign In

00:12:31.455 --> 00:12:33.095
to Google as well.

00:12:33.095 --> 00:12:35.940
And I want to give you some
tips for posting great

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.620
content, because I think
it's so important.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.000
You want to create a posting
schedule, to post at least

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.430
once a day.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.010
You can ask questions or share
insight or content.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.890
Plus, mention your communities
so that they feel the love and

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.020
will reshare your
content as well.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.580
And don't just share
any photos.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.440
Share exclusive photos.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.890
And if you edit your photos in
Google+, we can automatically

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:05.060
turn them into an animated GIF,
which can really make

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.600
them pop out as well.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.810
And if you don't have the
resources to manage your

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.910
social presence yourself, we
work with several social media

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.610
management companies that can
help you do this, that have

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.220
integrated with our platform.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:21.090
Companies like Hearsay Social
or HootSuite or

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.030
even our own Wildfire.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.270
So Starbucks is one of the
most savvy social media

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.510
companies we can
all learn from.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.930
If you look at their last few
posts, they're getting between

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:41.260
500 to 1,000 +1's and about 50
to 100 comments per post.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.090
So I'm going to show you
some lessons that we've

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.230
learned from them.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.900
And just copy this.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.780
It's a playbook for
a successful page.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.420
So starting out, one of the
things that we've noticed

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.710
they've done is they have an
animated GIF as their cover

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.810
photo, which really
makes that pop.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:04.190
And their magic formula
is simple.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.390
They have one attractive and
simple photo per post.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.160
Sometimes it's a video, but
mostly it's a photo.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.250
They have, like, one line
of text and maybe

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.030
a hashtag or two.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:22.360
And the hashtags now appear at
the top of your post you

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.620
create, as well as
related hashtags.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.570
So they can be an important
way for your content to be

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.390
discovered as well.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.130
And they include offers
in their posts.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:35.030
It's kind of hard to tell from
this, but this is an offer.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.940
And you feel good about gifting
it to your loved ones

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.030
by resharing it.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:43.860
And you get material value
from the post as well.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.270
And they have authentic photos,
not stock photos.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.090
So it looks like they put more
thought into it rather than

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.870
just posting without thinking.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.920
And they're asking the
community questions.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.350
So it really creates
that interaction.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:05.480
And they're also posting
infographics, which can also

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.730
be superviral.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.970
And they have occasion
driven posts.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.310
So this is a post from the
Kentucky Derby that they did.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.830
They've also done some
for Mother's

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.670
Day and other occasions.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:21.990
But it really captures that
top of mind, feel good

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.490
sentiment the audience has.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.280
So you guys, one recommendation
is to have a

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.570
posting calendar that mirrors
special occasions or topical

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.890
news events related to your
brand and business.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:40.520
So cute and resharable posts
create virality.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.670
It's very clever thinking.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.340
Your first emotional response
is to want to share it.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.790
And one of the most effective
ways to grow your followers is

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.100
by adding the Google+
badge to your site.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.430
Hopefully we've all now learned

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.980
the value of a follower.

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:04.160
And it comes in a variety of
shapes and sizes, but at its

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.390
core, it lets people know that
you're on Google+ and add you

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.670
to their Circles directly.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.390
And you should add the badge,
not just to your website, but

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:22.420
to your emails, your blog, any
offline campaigns that you're

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.250
doing, or anything that you
have, in-store signage.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.790
In this example, Britney Spears
plastered it on her

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.000
homepage of her website.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.200
Your page should be part of
your business strategy.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.710
And you can also advertise, if
you'd like to also help gain

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:46.140
more followers, on our GDN or
in Google Search as well.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.710
And what we found is that top
publishers who installed the

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.570
badge grew their audience
by 38% on average.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.670
That's pretty amazing for
such minimal work.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.360
The badge is so easy to add.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.600
You should do it today.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.640
And you really want to give
people a reason to

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.380
come to your page.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.000
It's just a more natural way to
get more followers, is to

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.430
just drive them to some sort of
content or programming that

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.569
you're doing, like
with a Hangout.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.119
So it feels more natural to
tell them to come and join

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.060
your page if you have something
going on there.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.400
Which brings us to
our next point of

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.740
engagement and Hangouts.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.790
So now that we've learned what
you should be doing on Google+

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.790
to help get discovered, let's
shift to talk about how

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.440
Google+ is also enabling you
to create deeper and more

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.130
personal relationships
with your users.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.770
And because I'm in marketing and
love videos, I just want

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.230
to show you one more video of
how one brand, Cadbury, is

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.510
using Hangouts On Air to
create a more personal

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.760
engagement with their users.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.020
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.580
-Actually it's always been to
see what's different about

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:13.520
Google+ to other social
networks.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.190
The thing that's most different
is Hangouts.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:18.740
You can't really do it on
any other platform.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.260
We've done three Hangouts
so far.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.450
The first one we created a
chocolate version of our

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:22.670
Google+ page.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:26.110
Then we did a second one with
Rebecca Adlington, one of the

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.840
Olympians we're sponsoring
and supporting.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.720
And we've just met up with one
of our chocolate tasters and

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.597
gone for an informal
discussion on

00:18:31.597 --> 00:18:33.300
the basics of chcolate.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.770
We spent quite a long time
with our first Hangout,

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.050
thinking, what will we
do, when will we do.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.130
We made it complicated
in our head.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:39.820
And the reality was, it's as
easy as having a conversation

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.810
with someone face-toface.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:47.550
-I think it's really cool for a
company as big as Cadbury to

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.296
actually be communicating
with customers.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:54.400
-My favorite thing about
Hangouts On Air is the ability

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.229
to have as many close
connections-- this small group

00:18:56.229 --> 00:18:58.560
of people-- but do it in a
way that lets thousands

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.628
of people see it.

00:19:01.628 --> 00:19:06.488
-So Rebecca, how many laps
do you run in a day.

00:19:06.488 --> 00:19:09.404
-I do about 7,000 to 8,000
in a session and I do

00:19:09.404 --> 00:19:11.550
10 sessions a week.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.192
-There's something quite
powerful about sitting in

00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:14.580
front of someone, essentially
eye-to-eye, and having a chat.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.300
It's a new frontier, and it's
something that technology two

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.370
years wouldn't have
allowed us to do.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.435
-I really like like dark
chocolate with caramelized

00:19:20.435 --> 00:19:21.570
orange in it.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.770
-Hangout is a really amazing way
of building that personal

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.360
connection with fans,
So I would say,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.005
brands, give it a try.

00:19:28.005 --> 00:19:29.980
Think about new ways of
connecting with your consumers

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.010
and having a chat with them.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:37.730

AMY WALGENBACH: OK.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.220
So Cadbury's using Hangouts to
take social brand engagement

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.920
to a more personal level.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.670
And some ways that we've seen
Hangouts be used for other

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:56.180
companies is to debut exclusive
content or do a

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.460
behind the scenes look
at your company or

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.390
your office or something.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.300
You can also get feedback
from users.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.066
So we've also seen it used as
a customer service channel.

00:20:07.066 --> 00:20:10.120
And you really want to create
those moments that matter, to

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.340
drive deeper and more meaningful
relationships with

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.650
your followers.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.300
And another example by Cadbury,
to celebrate the fact

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:21.340
that they had surpassed 2.5
million followers and to debut

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.750
the new flavor of their Dairy
Milk chocolate bar, they

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.500
created a Google+ Event for
unveiling their new flavor and

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.350
sent some of their biggest fans
a sample of the chocolate

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.000
bar, where in a Hangout, they
all unveiled the bar together

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.090
and tried it for
the first time.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.480
And it was pretty cool.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.100
Because we saw friendships
form, relationships that

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.820
happened were--

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.930
they kept the conversation
going even after

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.170
the Hangout had ended.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.080
So it was pretty amazing.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.070
And if you're wondering, the
flavor was Bubbly Mint, which

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.800
I personally have not tried but,
from the Hangout, looked

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.820
pretty amazing.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:08.320
So this February, Topshop
reinvented its fashion show

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.460
and simultaneously democratized
the thrill of

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.720
London Fashion Week, something
notoriously exclusive.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.740
They partnered with us in a
groundbreaking series of

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.470
inventive online happenings,
that I really feel was an

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.950
amazing game changer
for fashion.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.130
And this was such an
exceptional, well executed

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.050
campaign, I could
go on and on.

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.540
But I really just want to focus
on two parts that I

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.360
think you guys will
be interested in.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.770
The first was the Be The Model
component afforded a rare

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.120
opportunity for fans to
get a model's eye

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.450
view of Fashion Week.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.710
There were Hangouts with
the top models.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.380
And at Topshop's flagship store,
fans could enter a

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.150
special Google+ booth where
they try on their favorite

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.910
look and take a picture, and
it would upload it to the

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:01.460
Google+ Event Page, which really
bridged that online and

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.350
offline gap.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:07.280
And Be the Buyer component saw
the launch of a Hangout app

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.150
where for the first time in
fashion history, users could

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.370
pick and choose their favorite
items and share them with

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.640
their friends in a Hangout.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:22.950
So Topshop rewarded its best
collection of outfits with a

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.300
Fabulously Free Shopping
Spree as well.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.990
And they promoted this Hangout
app exhaustively

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.300
on their home page.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.670
And there was a leader board of
the most shared items from

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.030
the Hangout app.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.120
So what they did with this data
is that Topshop used it

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.390
to help its buyers decide what
they're going to actually

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.680
bring to market.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.060
So what's really cool about this
is that Topshop fans get

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.400
to influence the buying
decision.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.460
And what they saw was that
there was about 300,000

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.480
followers to their page because
of this event in the

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.160
two weeks leading up to it.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.180
And they had about 300% increase
in metrics like +1's

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.010
and reshares and comments
per post.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:11.850
And they had really good
engagement in their Hangout

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.940
app as well.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.360
So when we look to the future
of social experience online,

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.760
it's our goal to give you the
tools to make any experience

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.425
more social, personal
and meaningful.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:31.160
So a Page lets you talk
to your fans.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:34.020
And a Community lets
your users talk to

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.181
each other about you.

00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:38.190
So Google+ Communities
are about

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.860
connecting people and passions.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.810
They're a place for individuals,
organizations and

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:48.585
businesses to meet and share
based on a common interest.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.120
And one way we've seen this work
is to build a community

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.960
based on a topic that's
related to your brand.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.880
So in this case, this is
Lowe's Community Page.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.160
They built this Geek Your Home
community, where users can get

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.250
together and share tips on
how to geek out your pad.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.120
And what's great is that
Lowe's is part of that

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.370
conversation.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.940
And one of the other ways we've
seen Communities work is

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.130
that you can listen to what
your customers are saying,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.950
both about your brand or topics
that are relevant to

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.200
your business.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:37.260
So you should really create a
lasting impression by getting

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.570
face to face with your
users in Hangouts.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.330
So that's sort of like one of
the ways we recommend you to

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.120
grow your audience
with engagement.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.880
And then also create a more
social branded experience by

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.810
creating a Hangout app.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.900
And then we recommend
participating in creating

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.350
Communities as well, which
is another great way.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.720
And you can also listen to your
fans that way and hear

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.970
what they have to say.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.880
So Google+ can also help you
achieve deeper engagement with

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.450
your users, both on
your site and app.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.680
So this is where the Google+
platform comes in.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.950
And I'm not going to go too
deep into the platform,

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.050
because there's been a lot
of sessions about it.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.800
I just want to briefly touch
on a couple of points here.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.980
One example that we launched
on Monday is content

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.510
recommendations for your
mobile website.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:35.500
So when you help someone find a
great article on your site,

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:38.190
you're not only making them
happier, you're inspiring

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.930
deeper engagement and loyalty.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.190
So if you have a mobile website,
you should add this.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:48.730
And this is an example from
Forbes, where visitors to

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.370
their mobile website can
now easily discover

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.100
other content on Forbes.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:58.525
And this is an example, when you
integrate Google+ Sign In

00:25:58.525 --> 00:26:02.940
into your site, there's an
authentication dialog

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.490
box that pops up.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.480
And one of the scopes that you
can have is with our YouTube

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.460
API, so that when you sign in to
a site, you can also follow

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.150
their YouTube channel
at the same time.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.890
So it's kind of connecting
your presence.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.160
They can follow your page later
on, but when you sign

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.100
in, it's a great way to get more
followers to your YouTube

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.350
channel as well.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:36.130
One of the most impressive
features of Google+ Sign In is

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.500
something we call Over
The Air Installs.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:44.230
So when a user signs in on the
web, they can automatically

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.550
choose to download your app to
their mobile phone without

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:53.720
them ever leaving your site or
touching their device, which

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:54.970
is pretty cool.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.130
And interactive posts allow
users to bring others they

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.300
care about into your app.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.930
Users can send posts asking
people to sign up, write a

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.120
review, register, buy something
or whatever

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.010
your app calls for.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:19.100
In this example, Seth wants to
send a menu to Ardon and

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:19.890
shared it on Google+.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:23.650
And then you see what the share
looks like for Ardon in

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:24.850
the stream.

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.620
And you see a View
Menu button?

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:29.530
That's the really powerful
piece, is that there's a

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.940
clickable call to action
embedded directly

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.850
in a Google+ post.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:38.830
So this new call to action
allows you to not only share

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.010
your content to a growing
audience but to also direct

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.010
users what they should be
doing next in your app.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.930
Give them a reason to go
there and do something.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.680
So if it isn't already clear by
all of the Google+ Sign In

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.280
talks at I/O, it's important.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.560
And it is the way to integrate
Google+ into your apps.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.860
And right after this talk, Danny
Bernstein is moderating

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.090
a panel with a bunch
of our partners.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.860
So if you want to hear directly
from partners, you

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:12.730
should go to that talk.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.070
It's in Room 8 after this.

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.930
And you should go talk to the
companies in our Sandbox on

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.510
how they're integrating
Google+ Sign In.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.050
We have a ton of companies
there, and perhaps it can

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:25.320
spark some ideas for you.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.340
So here's really the
three things you

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.260
should be doing on Google+.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:38.590
Your presence starts
with a page.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.770
So creating an active page
is really important.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.670
And engage with your audience.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:49.350
It's about making a lasting
impression with them.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.085
If a user participates in a
Hangout or joins a Community

00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:56.090
you manage, they can feel more
connected to you, and it

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.650
inspires deeper engagement
and loyalty.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:03.050
And this can turn a fan
into a brand advocate.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:08.010
And last but not least, is
Google+ Sign In, which is

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:12.030
critical to using Google+ to
create more engagement and

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.480
drive more qualified traffic
to your app.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.880
So these are the three things
you should be doing today.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.760
So to sum it up, it's about
getting discovered across

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.730
Google, engaging with your
audience, and making Google+

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.330
work for you.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.630
I said at the beginning it was
my goal to try and convince

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.870
you all why it was important to
have a presence on Google+.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.780
And I hope I've done that.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.770
So if I have, here are some
resources for you guys on ways

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.380
to get started.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.630
Thank you very much.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.300
And now we can take
some questions.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.800
So if you have any questions,
there's two mics right here,

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.950
if you just want to go there.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:59.500
And I have a special guest who
might help me out with some

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:02.800
questions as well,
Mr. Marvin Chow.

00:30:05.428 --> 00:30:08.750
AUDIENCE: John Blossoms,
Shore Communications.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.760
On the Sign In, it's great
because it helps people get to

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.240
your site and get
engaged more.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.670
And you've shown a lot of the
tools for brand engagement.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:22.220
But traditional editorial
sources may or may not feel

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.530
limited by the amount of
information they get from the

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:27.740
Sign In to be able to serve up
the right sort of content.

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:30.170
What are the sort of strategies
that help people

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:33.780
use Google+ to have the right
experience for them when they

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.930
come to visit your site?

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.740
AMY WALGENBACH: Yeah, I think
one really important thing

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.680
that we've seen is, with
the mobile content

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.600
recommendations, it's really
great for those publishers who

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.860
are able to see more
recommendations for content

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:53.760
and share that activity
right into their app.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.110
Sorry.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.270
We're just micing up here.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.460
Everyone, this is Marvin Chow.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.350
He's the global director of
marketing for Google+.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:02.661
He's here to help
me out as well.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.716
I don't know if that answered
your question.

00:31:11.716 --> 00:31:12.430
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.860
Hi.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.770
I'm Spencer Richardson
from FanBridge.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:21.060
The question is about the role
and potential mash up between

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:24.850
YouTube subscribers and Google+
followers, because we

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.450
work with a lot of video
creators both in the brand

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:32.310
space, SMB, as well as
MCNs, all those guys.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.770
And as we convinced them about
the amazing things that

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.340
Google+ Brand Pages and so forth
has to offer, we get the

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:42.010
question of, do they have to
reinvent their understanding

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.945
of subscribers within Google?

00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:46.890
AMY WALGENBACH: Yeah, and I
think we've done a lot to

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.660
bridge those two together.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:54.190
You're seeing a lot of
activation between YouTube and

00:31:54.190 --> 00:32:00.550
Google+, where now you can have
your channel, direct it

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:05.250
and combine it with your page,
so that you really only need

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.940
one presence on Google
if you're a brand.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.430
And that's part of, it's the
same channel, the same page,

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.690
so that a user knows where to
go to follow you across both

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.550
of those platforms.

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.040
I think we have some
work to do.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.930
But a lot of people have
invested time into their

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.060
YouTube presence.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.906
So we know that's also an
important channel for people.

00:32:26.906 --> 00:32:28.580
MARVIN CHOW: And I'll
add a little bit.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.140
I think we all see the
tremendous opportunity between

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.130
YouTube and Google+ .

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.320
And I think, as you've seen
from Larry, this bringing

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.350
together Google is a priority
longer term.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.950
And I think the first phase is
this merging of identity.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.180
Google+ is about identity.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.760
So if you're Company X on
YouTube and you're Company X

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.550
on Google+, we want to
know you're the same

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:45.930
person and who you are.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.640
Once we can verify that,
with the merge, we'll

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.680
start to mix the graph.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.800
So unintentionally, but if a
page is sharing something on

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.790
Google+ and they're following
you on YouTube or not, we'll

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.350
have an idea of what type of
content to begin to surface in

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.140
what Amy showed.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.310
Now, longer and longer term, you
can obviously see that we

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.890
want to coalesce to one action
that we want a user to take as

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.370
it relates to an
entity, whether

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.480
it's follow or subscribe.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.710
And how do those things
come together?

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.490
And we're working that out.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.590
I think because YouTube does
not have verification, they

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:16.350
don't have an idea
of identity.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.920
It's very hard, because some
brands have 100 YouTube

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.960
channels but they only have
one Google+ page.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.990
So we're working through a lot
of the complexity of small

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:25.770
businesses, app developers,
large brands.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.310
But we want to get to the point
where you as a developer

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.940
or brand have a single presence
across Google that

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.880
you can do different things
with your audience with.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.630
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.932
Thank you.

00:33:35.932 --> 00:33:36.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.320
With the search results, where
you've got your brand up

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.570
there, is there any way to
influence that, to kind of

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.460
modify what's going
to be shown on the

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:48.891
Search Results page?

00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:50.560
AMY WALGENBACH: Well, there
are certain things

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.580
that you could do.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.190
Like if you have an active page,
it surfaces your most

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:56.400
recent posts.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.380
So for your branded search
query, it'll

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.810
show what you're posting.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.900
So that would be one way.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:09.380
And also, you can decide
what activities

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.500
you're writing to Google.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.530
So that's the aggregated data
that we're using to surface

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.210
those activities in Google, in
the right hand side of the

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:18.530
search results.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:19.980
So there's that way as well.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.040
So you can tell Google, send
this activity every time

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.920
someone watches a trailer
or buys something.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.480
So that's the activity that
could potentially be shown.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:37.730
We've just started with apps in
the music and movie space.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:39.449
But we will be expanding
to others.

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:39.960
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:45.080
Because right now it shows
your logo, the ability to

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.800
follow, and then some
recent posts.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.615
But no, maybe, posts that I'm
especially proud of, or stuff

00:34:52.615 --> 00:34:56.639
that I think is a better example
of the kind of content

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.090
that we provide.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:57.910
MARVIN CHOW: Yeah.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.360
I think, the most recent posts,
and when you search for

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.790
an app or a brand, we want to
show the most recent activity.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.140
I think that's one big thing.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.470
The profile photo is your
profile photo from Google+.

00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:09.280
You have some flexibility
there.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.920
I think we walk that fine line
of you pinning some kind of

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.320
thing at the top versus what
we feel is recent.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.400
We encourage to get
the most optimal.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.020
On the recent posts, it's every
three days we think you

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.280
should post, because it's
the most relevant.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.630
The other tip is, the About
section on your

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.085
Google+ page is SEO.

00:35:26.085 --> 00:35:29.235
So the more robust that
description about your company

00:35:29.235 --> 00:35:31.590
or app is, it discovers more.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.230
It fires more.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.440
Some of that content
gets brought in.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.470
But we haven't quite, with the
advent of interactive posts, I

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.850
think we are toying with the
idea, well what could you pin

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.030
in there when that real estate,
and what does it look

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.860
like on mobile.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:44.130
And so it's something
we're talking about.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.510
But today, there's no way to
actually say, hey, I really

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.470
want to make sure that
people get to this.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.050
But we definitely see it with a
lot of brands, whether it's

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.630
an Event or a Hangout or an
app download, that it's

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:54.450
something that we've
asked for.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.880
And I think with the app stuff
you've seen, to be able to

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.990
download apps right there,
that's the first step.

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.900
Where our goal is to say, when
you search for that query,

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.880
what is the intent the
person wants to take?

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.010
And are we delivering that?

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think if
there's some big Event that's

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.400
coming up, that you're going
to be running, it would be

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.235
great to be able to make people
aware that that's the

00:36:13.235 --> 00:36:13.640
thing that's going
to be happening.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.540
MARVIN CHOW: Exactly.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.520
And with interactive posts, that
may be easier, based on

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.250
query data and the
type of posts.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.150
I think this is the thing,
this is the next step.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.900
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.076
AMY WALGENBACH: Yeah, we're
really just getting started.

00:36:22.076 --> 00:36:24.040
Yes, in the back.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.860
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.345
Syra from the Veterans
United Network.

00:36:26.345 --> 00:36:29.290
I have a question about
YouTube Admin

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.820
Accounts and Hangouts.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:35.900
So as a brand, we hire freelance
individuals in order

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.770
to drive our Hangouts, to
produce our Hangouts.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:41.230
That also means you have to give
over your user name and

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.200
password to your YouTube
account.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.850
In the future, might it be
possible to consider Admin

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.190
Accounts for those individuals
who are driving your Hangouts

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.020
so you don't have to give
over the keys to

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.105
your YouTube account.

00:36:56.105 --> 00:36:57.360
MARVIN CHOW: So I think--

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.125
AMY WALGENBACH: We do
have page managers.

00:36:59.125 --> 00:36:59.830
MARVIN CHOW: We do.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.530
And I can follow up with
you separately on this.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:04.340
I do believe, and I have to
check, if your pages are

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.430
merged, so if you've merged your
Google+ profile and the

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:10.910
account, you're giving them your
YouTube admin rights for,

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:12.920
because the upload should happen
automatically, so why

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.230
are you giving them YouTube
admin rights?

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:20.660
AUDIENCE: In order to launch the
Hangout On Air, you have

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.764
to give them your
YouTube login.

00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:27.360
Because it streams on YouTube.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.080
MARVIN CHOW: I think there
should be a better way to do

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.700
that, because we've seen in,
and if I can follow up with

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.085
you afterwards?

00:37:31.085 --> 00:37:32.070
AUDIENCE: You betcha.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:32.342
MARVIN CHOW: Yes.

00:37:32.342 --> 00:37:35.140
Let's come on up and I'll try
to answer that question.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.390
AMY WALGENBACH: Yes, sir?

00:37:40.083 --> 00:37:42.490
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
there was any thought to

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:45.710
having the possibility of people
adding themselves to

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.900
your Circles, from a business
perspective?

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.630
Because one of the things that
a lot of us like to do is we

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.780
like to, when we post our
content, we know it's not

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.950
particularly interesting
to everybody.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:58.660
Not everything is.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.640
Some of it is, but
some of it's only

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.180
interesting to some people.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.680
For an example, I do
legal information

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.080
online with my business.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.520
And we put up case opinions
for various

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.590
courts around the country.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:13.730
And some people are only
interested in the cases from

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:14.460
their court.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.840
It would be nice if they could
add themselves to my circles.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.790
We can create a circle for each
state, for example, and

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.770
say, California and say,
add yourself to

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:25.910
my California circle.

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:29.880
So that when I post California
case content, it goes to you.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.215
But you don't have to just get
the general bulk feed of

00:38:33.215 --> 00:38:34.720
everything.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.850
AMY WALGENBACH: Yeah, we've
heard this request.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:37.500
MARVIN CHOW: I think--

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.120
AMY WALGENBACH: Quite
a bit, actually.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.800
MARVIN CHOW: It's a fantastic
question.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.860
I think it really opens a
broader conversation of what

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.410
would be social CRM, is really,
you want to use

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.250
Google+ to how do you
build relationships

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.350
in niche ways across.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:50.360
And we think it's an amazing
opportunity.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.650
We haven't built the product
yet to do that.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:54.550
And I think we're just
scratching the surface of this

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.580
idea of Circles and
how you share.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.420
I think with some of the things
with Aspen and Sign In

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.880
and NFC, you could almost
imagine where, if you tap in,

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.430
that you just get automatically
added to a

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:05.570
Circle at an Event.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:07.260
Or if you took an action
on a third party

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.200
website, we could do it.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.990
So I think it's possible.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.910
I think we haven't quite figured
out what is the right

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.910
model that the user would
understand and that was

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.940
actually useful for the
content creator.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.440
But I think with a lot of brands
and app developers,

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.000
that idea that you have 10
million followers but you

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.960
don't want to send one thing
to 10 million people.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.170
You do want to say, in a
particular state or maybe

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:28.960
someone who's purchased a
particular thing, you want to

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.310
send them something specific.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.070
So it's something we've been
talking actively about.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.210
We don't have the answer yet.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:37.820
But we do see that social CRM
going down that road one day.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.383
So maybe next year
at I/O, we'll

00:39:39.383 --> 00:39:39.925
try to get you something.

00:39:39.925 --> 00:39:40.372
AMY WALGENBACH: Yes, sir.

00:39:40.372 --> 00:39:42.400
In the back.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.740
My name Yusef.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.430
I'm from Animoca.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:48.180
We are a game developer
in Hong Kong.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:53.260
So most of the content on
Google+ is around the web and

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.410
mobile web.

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:58.000
But game developers, when
they're looking at content,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.290
their user base, they basically

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:02.970
want them to be in-app.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:07.290
So the question I have is,
growing our followers.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.300
It's very easy for us to put a
Follow button in our game.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.710
But currently, there is no
programmatic way to basically

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.250
add a follower.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.810
And we don't want to throw the
gamer out of the game, into

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.910
the website, into the browser.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.170
Then he'll never come
back again.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:28.180
And the other question is, does
Google have policy on

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.530
incentivize use of social
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:35.370
Can I say, get five virtual
coins if you follow me, two

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:37.140
coins if you basically
post something

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.130
about it on the Community?

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.736
Is there any policy
around that?

00:40:42.736 --> 00:40:46.290
AMY WALGENBACH: So to
your first question.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:50.230
You're saying that you want
people to follow you, add you,

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.900
add them to your Circles?

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.790
AUDIENCE: My game will
have a Google+ page.

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:58.100
Within my game, I want my users
to follow the page so I

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.420
can basically message them of
upcoming events, upcoming

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:01.885
promotions.

00:41:01.885 --> 00:41:04.260
AMY WALGENBACH: They can, if
you have the Google+ badge,

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:08.210
they can add you directly to
their circles from your page

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:09.610
without them having to
leave your game.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:11.940
MARVIN CHOW: I think it's, but
you're saying from within a

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.560
native app.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.160
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.850
MARVIN CHOW: It's a really
good question.

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.190
I don't think we do it now, but
it's something I think we

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.170
can definitely look into.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:19.730
AUDIENCE: Mobile game

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.210
developers don't have websites.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:23.140
They typically don't.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.840
MARVIN CHOW: Yeah, I think it's
a great request, and I

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.130
think we can definitely
look into it with

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.520
the platform team.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.640
AUDIENCE: Now, what about the
policy with incentivize, use

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.080
of social [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.590
MARVIN CHOW: That, I don't think
we have a policy against

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:36.200
that right now.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.420
So I think it's something that
is definitely possible, as

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.260
long as it's using, obviously,
the native API calls and the

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.525
human posting algorithms.

00:41:42.525 --> 00:41:43.790
AMY WALGENBACH: Yeah,
it's fine.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:45.390
We don't have a policy
against it.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:46.640
But--

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.266
We do.

00:41:50.266 --> 00:41:51.555
We do have a policy.

00:41:51.555 --> 00:41:52.640
MARVIN CHOW: We do,
apparently.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.558
AMY WALGENBACH: Do not do it.

00:41:55.558 --> 00:41:56.830
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.760
So, a quick thing about
incentivization.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.510
To incentivize a user to do
something that's spammy is

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:04.850
generally against our terms.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.460
But to do something
that's meaningful.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.310
Like if we all sign up for
this service, we get

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.120
something out of it.

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:11.550
Right?

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.740
Versus sending this to all your
friends, so they actually

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.620
click back to the app.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.325
So.

00:42:15.325 --> 00:42:16.090
AMY WALGENBACH: All right.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:17.630
Sorry, we're out of time.

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:19.720
We'll be up here if you have
any other questions though.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.970
Thank you.
