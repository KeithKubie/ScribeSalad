00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It turns out this actually another method to charge by induction.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This method, just like the first method, also uses two spheres

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
but here, one of those spheres is actually the earth.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's say you have your conducting sphere and it's attached to the ground by a conducting rod.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's also add a bunch of wires that extend into the ground

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and then let's hold a positive charge over our conducting sphere.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What's going to happen is that we're going to actually draw electrons from the earth.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If we then detached this sphere, we can even remove the positive charge

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and now here we have it, a negatively charged sphere.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And this negative charges somehow came from the ground.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, of course, this must mean that throughout the earth,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
there must be a few extra positive charges lingering around.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
They've lost their electrons.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It seems like if we were to do this experiment over and over and over,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
well, eventually we'd have a positively charged earth and that might be a problem.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It turns out that this is a non-issue and I want you to tell me

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
why you think this works and why it's a non-issue?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Maybe you think the earth is somehow able to create electrons

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
create this negative charges, so that actually there's no residual positive charge leftover.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the earth is huge.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Maybe that has something to do with the reason why this never becomes a problem

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where we actually wind up charging the earth with some noticeable amount.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Or maybe you think the earth is an insulator, something in which charges cannot move

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and that this somehow saves us and allows this whole process to work.

00:01:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check what you think is the best answer.
