1
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.580
Two one. Boom. Miss Pat. We're live. What's up? How are Ya? Hey,

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.100
great to see you again. Glad to be back, man.

3
00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:12.920
This studio is better than my house. Crap.

4
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.920
I'm gonna go home and tell moms we need to move in Joe Rogan studio.

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.870
There's not a lot of room for extra people. I know, I know. I know.

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.490
I was just fantasizing. Are you still in Indianapolis? Unfortunately.

7
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.780
You don't like it there. Hey, hell no. I like my fans,

8
00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:34.781
but I'm black and you know as snow and snow and weave don't go together and you

9
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:36.920
know, I just don't like it.

10
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:41.770
It's the same or everybody at Applebee's and golden corral. I need culture,

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.670
culture coach Chicago. I'm cool. I want to go back to Atlanta. Atlanta.

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.330
That's where I want to be. I want to be in Atlanta. I love Atlanta. Yes man.

13
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:52.750
The food, the people. Oh, I just,

14
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.650
I want to walk out my door and smell Mexican, Indian, all type of spices.

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.100
I'll ask them. Male in my communities, duck shit and take ticket torches

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.980
and dry cause why women do the laundry? Dryer sheets.

17
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.410
I need some culture. I need to walk outside and see all types of people.

18
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.950
It isn't a weird how places just never develop a lot of culture.

19
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.720
Some places just the spots just never get any more. Interesting. Yeah,

20
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.260
it's just, it's so boring. Everybody go to church, nobody curse.

21
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.140
And when I come on my door and if I'm talking to a neighbor and I use

22
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.970
professional, oh my God, I said,

23
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:32.570
I'm not going to change my language because you decided to walk your dog today

24
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:36.770
and stop and talk to me and you've tried to talk to me and everybody picked up

25
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.790
big dog shit in my community and well from, hey,

26
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:41.930
that was fertilizer.

27
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.420
You see your name on a big old pile of dog crap in his hand. I'm like, dude, no,

28
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.390
no. I don't think it works as fertilizers. My dog pisses and shits on the lawn.

29
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.750
It just leaves these big old like yellow spots.

30
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.140
If you live long enough and it rains on and they just go into the grave.

31
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.370
That's true. They don't kill the gray. Don't kill the grass. I did the pistols.

32
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.520
The piss seems to kill the grass. Well, I don't know. We didn't have no grades.

33
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.480
Everybody walked through the grass. I just didn't care about it.

34
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.930
Loans until I bought came became a homeowner. Yeah. Homeowners care about lawns.

35
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.770
Homeowners care about a lot of crap. You have to, yeah,

36
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.160
I have a rental property in Atlanta. If I can get rid of that, I would never,

37
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.320
ever black people come up with some of the strangest things.

38
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.300
Why they ain't got they rent like as opposed to care. I tell them,

39
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:30.050
Bank of America don't care that your Mama that y'all do your grandchild had a

40
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:33.920
seizure. I need my rent money. Put a spoon in his mouth.

41
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.460
Tell him about secret. Yeah, I mean I've had some,

42
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.180
oh, I just gotta be so glad when I can get rid of this property.

43
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.880
So you own a place in Atlanta? Yes.

44
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.120
Would you live there at the place that you own? Hell No. No, no.

45
00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:54.170
I wouldn't live there. I'm a little too boozy for that bullshit.

46
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.310
No, not too much to says I'm a little booze. You did a little backward,

47
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.800
but I rented out. I ran the nice place.

48
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:05.710
But you would live in Atlanta somewhere else? Oh yeah.

49
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:10.360
I want to go to Peachtree city. Kennesaw. Yeah. I want to live in Atlanta.

50
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.330
I love Atlanta. Why don't you make your way down there? What's,

51
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.930
what's holding you and, and then the Apple's healthcare jail. Health care.

52
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.070
My husband has a really good job that we paid nothing. His knee just went out.

53
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:25.620
His hands on going out and I can't pay for them. Types of things. What?

54
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.360
Damn. He tore his ACL running to the cafeteria at work. Oh yeah. I've done a,

55
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.240
I've done a tour. Both of them. You probably were exercising.

56
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:35.410
He was going to get food.

57
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.680
Don't watch this episode of Joe Rogan Baby. I'm sorry.

58
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.830
That's a rough one. Recover from it. Take six months.

59
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.070
He was six months and then he got a Coppertone in his hands.

60
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.550
So he's getting ready to have hand surgery type. What does he, uh,

61
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.280
he builds the Alison transmission for Alison for General Motors and she's

62
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.350
constantly moving things with his hands. So his hand is all a bitch.

63
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.380
My mom got that. That's a rough one. Well,

64
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.810
I'll never had a job where I did that much repetition. You know,

65
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:12.790
I sold drugs and far a few checks, but it wasn't an everyday thing.

66
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:17.080
I had to do so many checks. You'd have to forge for your carpal tunnel. Oh yeah.

67
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:21.490
A lot. So once you burned 32 you don't have any mo to burn.

68
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:23.410
You gotta wait to somebody steal the next book.

69
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.490
Plus I was really young back in the day. Yeah. Damn.

70
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.970
So that's what's keeping you in. Annapolis husband had a good job.

71
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.890
I needed a TV show so I can get some really good health care.

72
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.630
And when your podcast is launched now it is.

73
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.250
It's called the pat down the pat down. And I have my own song too. Oh yes.

74
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:43.680
We're talking about Ari. Yes.

75
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.530
Are Getting in trouble for putting other people's songs on his podcast and the

76
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.510
de monetizes podcast. Yeah, my nephew, Riverdale shout,

77
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.700
it made me my own little pat down son. Oh, nice. So yeah.

78
00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:58.570
So somebody made a song for you that's, yeah, yeah.

79
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:00.250
I was just trying to do something different.

80
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:05.170
There's only 30 minutes of me talking crap about whatever's going on in my life.

81
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.320
You heard, you hear my kids in the background getting cussed out,

82
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.700
you hear the creditor calling me and my cohost is a little white boy named Chris

83
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.230
who don't know nothing about black America.

84
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.880
And then I got my friend who just ah, AH, he ready to go march if you,

85
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:25.330
if you need him to. So I got, I got this libertarian,

86
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.020
this crazy ass Democrat together and I'm down the middle and say, hey,

87
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.680
we can all get along. And they hated each other. They first,

88
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.320
how'd you get them together? Because they hated each other.

89
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.830
She did it on purpose. Yeah. My black friend thought Chris was racist.

90
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.720
I was like, no, I know racist. He's not racist. He just not eve to the fat.

91
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.700
And so I put it on the EAD. You've not tell him what I'm trying to say. Naive.

92
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.970
Oh, naive. Naive. Yeah. You gotta translate, you know, Adam and eve

93
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.920
trying to go with this. It was not easy, but it sounded like Adam and eve,

94
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.440
so it, he just didn't understand.

95
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.310
So we get them together and we have these conversation about race and uh,

96
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.240
we did an episode about abortion and Chris was like, he's really Christian.

97
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.411
And he was like, I was like,

98
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.360
do you believe a woman should have a right to have an abortion?

99
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:15.500
He just put a pattern all around. So Chris just say yes, a fucking no,

100
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.520
and finally said, I don't believe a woman should have an abortion. I said, well,

101
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.311
that's fine,

102
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:23.000
but this is my vagina and I can do what I want to do with if I want to stick

103
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.260
firecrackers crackers in my vagina and turn it into the 4th of July. Joe Rogan,

104
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.460
this is my vagina. As long as I don't get no vagina juice on you.

105
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.390
That make sense? Yeah. Atlanta's got a problem now with that. Right?

106
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.090
There's nothing. Georgia just passed a new abortion law.

107
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.330
I don't think it's passed yet, but she just canceled her shows. Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.110
She's canceled her shows in Atlanta because I think it passed.

109
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.550
I think that was the idea.

110
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.330
That's why she canceled it and I don't think it passed Joe because the TV people

111
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:55.070
haven't pulled out yet. Oh, there would if it passed. I think they would.

112
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.640
I really think they got money. I've got them in there because of tax money.

113
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.210
Yeah. And I think they are leaving. A lot of people lose their jobs.

114
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.250
I don't think they're going to leave.

115
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.760
I don't think the water should be telling us what to do with our bodies.

116
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.800
I don't think so either. Yeah. That means that you know,

117
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.350
I've been shot in the t that my want them messed up.

118
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.080
So that's like you trying to tell me I should get my TD fixed.

119
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.290
If I don't want my titty fix, it's my prerogative.

120
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.270
I shouldn't have to have my teddy fix. Right. Joe,

121
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.610
how do you feel about late term abortions? That's where people get scared. They,

122
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.740
I don't think, yeah, I don't think you should be killing,

123
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:28.890
don't have an abortion and no,

124
00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:32.480
six and eight months now and I don't think it should be recreation either cause

125
00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:36.410
I had an abortion just doing it for fun. Recreation.

126
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:40.130
I like how you translate. Oh, I've had a few friends.

127
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.760
What are you going to do today? I was thinking about riding a roller coaster,

128
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:44.960
but fuck it, I'll get an abortion.

129
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.740
I've had a few friends that had quite a few of boys since then.

130
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.870
I've had one myself. I mean my, in my situation,

131
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:54.350
I think everybody's situation is different. My situation, I was,

132
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.030
I already had my first baby at 14 my second child at 15 and it was by a married

133
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.890
man. Well I got pregnant by this mayor man again. And I just looked at myself,

134
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.380
I said, here I am 16 pregnant with my third child.

135
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.260
I cannot take care of the two hour gap. And you know,

136
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:12.200
it wasn't all of this stuff like what they tell you about birth control and safe

137
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:14.900
sex that wasn't going on in the eighties you know, people, Shit. And they,

138
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.790
those and talking wouldn't even talk about it.

139
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.940
Especially when you were a little kid. You know, when you're,

140
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.630
I'm 14 so I was a kid. So when I got pregnant with my third child,

141
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.780
I w I became a massive pain in minor in divorce.

142
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:31.781
My mom and I went and got an abortion because I knew he wasn't helping me with

143
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:34.310
the first two. That's so crazy.

144
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:38.510
So I take it on the first part because still to this day,

145
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:41.090
sometimes I'll be doing something and I'll just think about your story in the

146
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:41.924
scope.

147
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.060
Sound drugs as a teenager,

148
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:52.061
pregnant with two kids by the time you're 16 by mayor raised crazy in jail.

149
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:55.470
I mean I dropped out of school in eighth grade, you know, all of this stuff.

150
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:56.040
And I just say, I

151
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.310
<v 2>said I don't want my kids to, and I'm like me. So I was like,</v>

152
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.140
I can't keep having these babies and I,

153
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.690
and after that I got on birth control and I just prayed. I said, Lord,

154
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.720
I don't want no more kids by his bone and I never got pregnant so I got married.

155
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.760
Well that's good. Yeah. So now I have those two. You know,

156
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.740
I used to tell a bit about,

157
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:16.710
I got a set of Medicaid kids on the set of blue cross blue shield kids.

158
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.800
So I'll wait until they got older. And I mean, I got older and I, I became,

159
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.010
I started to learn about life. He taught me a lot.

160
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.230
And so I hit those last two and I tied my tunes. Very, very good move. Yeah,

161
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.640
I'm close enough. Four is more than, that's a good number. But you know, Joe,

162
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.360
I'm black so my family smoked crack so they keep giving me their kids.

163
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:43.050
So I had to tie my tubes to make room for the crack baby.

164
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:47.820
They keep coming in and not my house. I'm raising for rent now. Yeah,

165
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:50.030
I have my niece, my niece, um, my,

166
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.330
I picked up my niece like five years ago to help her out. Oh,

167
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.520
she had a baby that was two weeks old and I have this thing like, oh,

168
00:09:56.521 --> 00:10:00.930
kids deserve off solid foundation because I didn't have one. So I picked,

169
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:03.840
this is my third set of kids I've raised and I'm just 47.

170
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.920
So I picked my niece up maybe two weeks old and she got three other kids.

171
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.670
I said, okay, I got this big house in Indianapolis, come live with me.

172
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:14.430
I got three, four extra bedroom. Well,

173
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.020
this bitch ran off and left me with them kids. Now I have a five or eight.

174
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.200
Yeah,

175
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.200
on a 10 and 11 year old and I've had these kids for six years and I literally

176
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:29.760
have not seen my niece in almost four years. No phone call,

177
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.140
no nothing. And you know, I'm trying to build a career.

178
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.730
So I have a daughter who, my whole, my, all my,

179
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.530
my kids who was at the house and they had to make a major sacrifice.

180
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.860
Like my daughter couldn't go off to college because she didn't want to leave my

181
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:48.180
husband with these four kids. So she went to college in Indianapolis,

182
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.640
but she stay, she went mostly from, you know, home.

183
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.840
My son couldn't go off to college because they at home helping raise the four

184
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.700
kids that I called my crack babies,

185
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.390
but at home raising my crack babies because you don't want to leave.

186
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:04.950
My husband would all afford these crack babies by they sales. So you know,

187
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.130
where's the mother? You want to hear some crazy,

188
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.990
the bitch blocked me on Facebook joke.

189
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.060
She won't even let me be afraid of Facebook. You taking care of her children?

190
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.990
Yeah. She blocked you on Facebook. Why don't you block you? Cause I kept saying,

191
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:19.830
I'm a kill you bitch.

192
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.990
I was ready to live my best life. I was like, Oh, I'm making some money.

193
00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:30.660
Me and my husband go to Hawaii. You get naked float in the water,

194
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.660
Bam for crack babies. You can't do that when you can't.

195
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.400
You know how much you taking the how, why you call.

196
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:39.090
I can't take no crap with me. Oh my God,

197
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.610
I love that phrase. Yeah. So I mean it changed. It's changed everything.

198
00:11:44.611 --> 00:11:47.720
And then you know my, when she left and she didn't even give me custody,

199
00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:51.390
I had to go and hire this lawyer and go and get custody because she just ran off

200
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.280
and I asked the, you know, the welfare

201
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.760
<v 1>system, it ended Annapolis. I said, can y'all just give me childcare?</v>

202
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.230
Because childcare was going to be like $800 a week because my kids was in high

203
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:05.530
school when she left and they was like, no, we can't give you that,

204
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:10.240
but we will give you medicaid and $300 they get, they didn't,

205
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.060
they didn't give me shit. Jesus Christ. So I just,

206
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.070
I just made away my stuff and I said, you know what,

207
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.320
I've had this baby since she was two weeks old.

208
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.230
How do you drop a baby that you've had since she was two weeks old?

209
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.860
Your baby now? Yeah. You can't, I can't give up.

210
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:28.570
I love you so fucking crazy.

211
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:32.860
The mother blocked you. Oh No. Oh my God. No.

212
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:36.940
But we did make a secret account, right? Of a nice fine man like yourself,

213
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.630
Joe Rogan. Nice fine black man. And we, we, we friended her.

214
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:43.990
So she accepted a friend. So she don't know that that's us.

215
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.890
And she only Sneed your podcast so I can tell. So we follow her like that.

216
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.870
So she's on the other side of town getting high. Never hit me up.

217
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.790
Never talk about the kid. You know, I don't get a dime from nobody.

218
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.630
Nobody. And I don't ask for nothing. I mean I'm just at this point,

219
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.150
I'm thankful that I can even take care of these kids.

220
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.000
Cause my sister was on drugs and I took care of her keys.

221
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:08.380
My niece who's on drugs now,

222
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.640
I took care of them for 10 years with my husband and she's on drugs now.

223
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:13.750
The daughter is on drugs.

224
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:17.280
When my sister got them back and got them all on drugs like her, Jesus Christ.

225
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.920
So I made sure that these kids can't go back to that situation.

226
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.990
Now I call them my Bougie crack babies.

227
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:25.150
They won't even eat McDonald's only Chick-Filet

228
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.960
they're like, oh we don't eat McDonald's. We eat Chick-Filet. And I was like,

229
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.060
I remember when y'all ass in eat at all babies.

230
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.810
They give me great material, but it's not easy. But you didn't know.

231
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:45.850
You call them crack babies. No they don't.

232
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.620
They stop calling them kids crack crack baby.

233
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.210
They don't know. I call them crack.

234
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.680
Only American know that I call them crack babies,

235
00:13:59.681 --> 00:14:04.330
but y'all can't call them crack babies. Call Mark. God, did they call your mom?

236
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.980
Uh, they do and his count on record.

237
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.030
So they just started calling me mom out of nowhere and I'm like,

238
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.980
don't come in fucking Mama my auntie. And, but then now just let them go. Oh,

239
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.020
it's beautiful. Well, they go to school and they see all the, you know,

240
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:19.960
I live in this white community. They see all these kids want a mom and Daddy.

241
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.700
And was like, well, why don't we have,

242
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.200
and they just started calling me mom and so were mom and my daughter who um,

243
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.100
she just graduated from college, but she, they got two moms and my dad,

244
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:35.050
my husband is their daddy. Yeah. I love the, well, thank you. Thank you.

245
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.200
That's a beautiful thing you're doing. It really is. Even though the ladies

246
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:44.260
in the black commune, she's a bitch. That's what she, those kids got lucky.

247
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.070
They got lucky. They really did. I took them on a Disney cruise last year,

248
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.970
Joe and Oh my God, they had the time or they lives and look at my Craig baby.

249
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.360
They don't know what, I don't say them from the crowd. Oh my God,

250
00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.670
what'd you saved this from? And they're on a Disney cruise.

251
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.570
Craig baby on the Disney cruise with matching outfits.

252
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.340
But I love him. I mean, amazing that you're doing that. It really is. I mean,

253
00:15:10.341 --> 00:15:13.580
I know it's hard, but it's amazing that you're doing that. Well, you know,

254
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:14.870
like I said earlier, every,

255
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:19.910
every child deserves a solid foundation to start off. Unfortunately for me,

256
00:15:19.911 --> 00:15:21.350
I didn't have that solid foundation.

257
00:15:21.351 --> 00:15:25.310
I didn't have nobody to step in my life and you know, snatch me from my mom.

258
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.480
But you know, whenever I see a child in need, especially a family member,

259
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.170
I always try to step in because I know,

260
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.070
I know when you don't have that solid foundation where you can end up in some

261
00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:40.070
kids in or you know, fucked them even with a solid foundation.

262
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.640
But if you can give them a good start, at least give them a good start.

263
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.480
And that's all I ever wanted to do. That's beautiful. Yeah.

264
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:49.370
And seven's learning center is killing me.

265
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.780
I put the black crack babies in this white community.

266
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.160
Kids been reading since they were two.

267
00:15:55.161 --> 00:16:00.080
They were whooping my black baby as Joe Joe Rogan, the tutors. I'm like,

268
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.210
fuck. They got all got along. I'm like, whoa.

269
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:05.540
I be glad when you crack babies catch up. I'll be glad when y'all catch up.

270
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.580
We gotta get this podcast take off. Yes, yes, yes.

271
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.070
Normally the TV show these days, you don't just need that podcast to keep going.

272
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.430
I know. And I'm enjoying it too. I didn't hit perfect for it.

273
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.210
Like that's what we were talking about the comedy store last time I saw it,

274
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.390
four o'clock in the morning. I was like, you've got to, you have to. You right.

275
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:26.860
You right. And I really like it too. I knew you. I was like,

276
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.320
this doesn't make any sense that you don't have one. Yep. And I mean,

277
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:33.140
I'm enjoying it. 30 minutes they'd be like, Oh, Ms peg, give me more. I'm like,

278
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:37.570
excuse me, I'm sitting here with no wig on. No Bra, no bag.

279
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.470
And Chris might be smelling me after 35 minutes. This is all you going to get.

280
00:16:42.471 --> 00:16:43.101
Plus, you know,

281
00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:47.090
he come over at four three o'clock and then my baby's coming in the door at four

282
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:49.640
o'clock so I'm gonna sit down, I'm screaming and hollering.

283
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.870
I got to go fix food and I got a life. I'm married. I can't sit down for,

284
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.280
you know, 30 minutes is fine. And I like it. As long as you're consistent,

285
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.920
that's the whole thing is like be consistent. Don't take weeks off. Like when,

286
00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:05.750
when people take like four weeks off, five weeks up, people forget.

287
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.630
And then they're not interested in your podcast anymore. But if you,

288
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.020
if you just consistent and just keep doing it, people get,

289
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.400
it becomes a part of their routine and then they tell people you've got to

290
00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:18.360
listen to miss path podcast. And next thing you know by word of mouth,

291
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.430
it just spreads. Yeah. I mean we have so many episodes in the bank.

292
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.990
How many of you have, I think we got probably 20 anybody fall? Yeah,

293
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:29.840
they wasn't as good as the ones that I put out regular. But you know,

294
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:34.210
when I first started I was kind of shy and I'm like, oh, I'm subbed.

295
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.920
And you know how, look I'm at a times you have to say,

296
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:41.770
what the fuck did you just say back? You're not shy. I was shocked.

297
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:46.610
That's the last word I would ever use for you fight. But I'm kinda shy Joe.

298
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.473
I mean, you know,

299
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.600
because I'm country and people are like the book that she was like I did.

300
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.710
I actually talked about you on my first one. So when I first did your podcast,

301
00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.920
it was a story out that Joe Rogan is a bad ass and he choked on a mountain lion.

302
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.680
And I was like, I don't want to go talk to no white man.

303
00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.630
I've got a fucking mountain line that's a made up story know.

304
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.000
But I didn't know at first and I was so scared.

305
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.010
Joe and I guess a mountain lion killer.

306
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.010
I'm used to black people doing dry by them.

307
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:19.110
I used to white people just chucking out a mountain lie.

308
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.910
So I'm trying to figure out how to fucking get up on a mountain line. And

309
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:29.070
how do weapons sneak up on a mountain lion from behind and took the shit out of

310
00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:30.930
him. He gotta be strong as fuck.

311
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.970
So I kept digging and I realized the store wasn't Raja.

312
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.900
I didn't want to talk no white dude a choke that started,

313
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.630
you know, I see you with that big old weight and shit.

314
00:18:42.631 --> 00:18:45.720
That'd be gonna Hoyas Hey was, I know he killed that fucking mountain line.

315
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:49.470
It took a while for me to realize that it took about two,

316
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.420
about a month before I realized the store wasn't very well.

317
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.240
Sister didn't think of my own sister. Thought it was real, really texted me.

318
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.970
She goes, you really choked her out. Fuck is wrong with you.

319
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.640
You bad as you. I mean only you can sneak up on a mountain.

320
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:07.020
Lion choked the shit out of it.

321
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.100
<v 3>I've run with a knife. When I run, I, I carry a knife with me just in case.</v>

322
00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.970
Cause there's mountain lions in my community. Really? Yeah. They've seen him.

323
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.200
Yeah. And I run with my dog and the mountain lion tries to Jack me or my dog.

324
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.370
I want to have something on me.

325
00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.210
<v 1>So you, you, if he jack your dog, you're going to stab him. Fuck yeah. You know,</v>

326
00:19:25.211 --> 00:19:27.700
I was just telling the story about my, you know, I'm from the south, right?

327
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.660
So back in the day and don't get offended people but you know dog fighting is

328
00:19:31.661 --> 00:19:34.960
big in itself so we didn't fight like no dangerous shit.

329
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.690
We just put some down ladies on the ground who have a dog get the best they

330
00:19:37.691 --> 00:19:41.040
went. And Now lady, when my dog was named pup pup now or later,

331
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:46.050
you mean like candy now and laters the candy candy have the dogs fight over

332
00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:49.340
candy? Yeah, we should showed them.

333
00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.030
Me and my dog used to split the candy or whatever.

334
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.970
So I get some candy. Black dogs used to eat anything back then,

335
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.460
collard green peak feet, whatever. Black boots.

336
00:20:00.461 --> 00:20:02.920
Black people didn't buy dog food. So we will, we will,

337
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.400
me and my dog will fight a lot but if you got the best of my dog I would jump in

338
00:20:06.401 --> 00:20:08.210
and whip your dog gas goes out.

339
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.880
You wasn't to with my old last German shepherd and then I'll be calling him and

340
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:15.220
talking about I'm abusing the dog cause on our own. No fucking dogs.

341
00:20:15.221 --> 00:20:17.550
I got full crack babies and I don't have an anathema.

342
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.860
This was back in the day and I was a little girl, but that's what we used to do.

343
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.373
It is a

344
00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.790
<v 3>big thing in the south period.</v>

345
00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:28.740
I knew a guy who had 30 pit bulls in his backyard. He had these uh,

346
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.660
boxes like that. He would,

347
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.410
the dogs lived in these little dog houses and they were chained to a post and

348
00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:38.010
they were in his yard and I didn't see it. My friend was telling me about it,

349
00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:42.150
but I knew the guy and he lived down. I lived in Kentucky.

350
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.230
Yeah, we lived in Kentucky and um, they fought dogs.

351
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.060
<v 1>Well we, we only did it with just kids. We only like, well the,</v>

352
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.090
I bet who have a dog get the best who have a dog. They w that's the winter now.

353
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.150
Right. So if I thought pop, but we're about to get, go down on his back.

354
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.780
I jump in and put your dog in a choke hold. Cause I like wrestling.

355
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.740
I will fix it. Yeah, I will fit, fold the shit out of your dog.

356
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.860
I was not losing them. Now Lady Joe, we didn't eat a lot.

357
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.450
I can lose my only meal that day. Your only meal was an hour later.

358
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.910
Some days it may pop up. Was It on the side? Why? Like we whipped his head,

359
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:16.750
they will pop up and we'll split the now later. Wow.

360
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.080
There's a lot of people right now listen, like as this lady for real.

361
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.920
And I can assure you, assure them that you are. I'm for real young,

362
00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.050
kinda crazy fucking life, you know?

363
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.720
I mean there's so many people that are insulated from the kind of life that

364
00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:31.180
you've had. They don't know anybody like you. You know?

365
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.260
So I'm realizing that Chris, my producer, I scare the shit out him. He's like,

366
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:38.440
why are you yelling at me? I'm like, Chris, I'm not yelling.

367
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.990
You'll know in a black woman the yellow, she got a twist and holiday,

368
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.880

369
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.020
I'm just talking about voice. I have a deep voice in this. It carries, uh,

370
00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.110
you know what's crazy? Cause, like I said,

371
00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:57.070
he's a little white kid from Indianapolis and so I'm talking to on a podcast and

372
00:21:57.071 --> 00:21:59.860
I'm teaching them about Black Pussy incense. You ever heard of that?

373
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.750
Black Pussy incense? Yeah.

374
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.060
You know that you burned the black people use a button in the house.

375
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.540
I know about incense, but if nobody called Pussy, he slow me down.

376
00:22:08.541 --> 00:22:10.790
It wasn't real. So we put out the podcast, everybody's like,

377
00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:15.290
my mama say black pussy is, it was the best sin out there Joe. Okay.

378

You look like, what did it smell like? I like incense. Yeah, I know the name of.

379
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.590
And I told Joe, I told him about him. He like, what are you talking about?

380
00:22:31.591 --> 00:22:32.010
I'm like,

every week I'm teaching them something that he has never heard of.

386
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.020
What do you think about all this art, Kelly Shit.

387
00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.490
Um, I think you did it Joe. I mean people just look, if people just looked away,

388
00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.650

391
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.120
My first kid father couldn't read when they ain't got no side teeth and they can

392
00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:22.210
read, they got the best six cause they practice all the time.

393
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.990
Black men who can't read, don't,

394
00:23:25.991 --> 00:23:30.730
don't have safe like black men who got a nine to five who can read the sex is

395
00:23:30.731 --> 00:23:35.320
totally different because they're not tired because they practice audit doing

396
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:38.440
practice on women. But you got my husband got to go to work, Joey,

446
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:40.600
I'm just chill. So she had just the remote,

447
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.980
my wig, everything. Soon

448
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:50.990
as I get my TV show home, buy me a magic. Pull those back. The fucking Gal.

449
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.640
Yeah, I didn't like that. Sleep number bed. I tried the thing.

450
00:26:56.641 --> 00:27:00.900
I was too confusing. I didn't like it. Oh he loves the Joe.

451
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.180
Every time I come home he got his feet in the air.

452
00:27:03.181 --> 00:27:08.130
Like he had a gynecologist visit one of those. Yeah. He thought, I'm like,

453
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.310
this measure is only good for heating your balls or we could've got you a blow

454
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:14.160
dry. You heating your balls up.

455
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.540
They sell mattresses now that cooled you mark system was, yeah.

456
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.690
I'm wanting to get one that seems awesome.

457
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.570
[inaudible] was just telling me about that. I'm going through menopause.

458
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:28.590
I might need to get that through. I'll be heating up. Joe. He, oh my tea.

459
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:28.921
I'm like,

460
00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:31.890
I'm having a hot flash now and I don't want to drop my titties on your table,

461
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.640
but boy ass in here. I don't feel it, Joe,

462
00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:39.990
when you get turn the AC AC can't stop. No high flash. It's like five minutes.

463
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:45.000
I'm heating up now. But yeah, it goes away. What does that cause?

464
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.400
But I don't know. You gotta ask Mary.

465
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.430
I don't know what Mary did in the beginning. It was married with Jesus.

466
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.910
No Mirror with Jesus. When did Jesus Momma only the Bible.

467
00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:57.430
What do you mean Mary? Mary who but who do you mean when you're saying marriage?

468
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.470
No, I'm sorry. I'm talking about eve. Who Stopped? Who started here yet?

469
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.280
I'm sorry. I get that. Oh Damn Bitch. She fucked everything up. Yeah.

470
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.060
Every time I got talking snake. Yeah, that talk is Nate. I mean,

471
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.720
I'm cramps ain't no joke and now I'm having high feds y'all because this bitch

472
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.510
better apple. God, can you get me an opportunity to buy the apple?

473
00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:17.160
I won't bite the Apple. Take the half.

474
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.160
I'd be on a plane with to heat up and wipe me and next to me don't understand

475
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:24.450
why I got my TV and my lap

476
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.220
fairing yourself off. Yes, yes.

477
00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:34.260
It comes and goes like last five minutes and then the last few minutes and then

478
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.570
they go back to mom and like I'm cooling down now.

479
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.090
So like out of nowhere you just get hot. Yeah.

480
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.440
And they hit you in different places.

481
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:43.680
Like Mies is good between my titties on my neck,

482
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.410
some people's up under their arms, you know,

483
00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:51.000
so a spot like one smile hit me right here and my titties, my titties heat up.

484
00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:52.950
Like if you touched them that about 95 degrees,

485
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.650
don't touch him because you married.

486
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:58.120
But I'm just saying I don't want you to burn your fingers. Here it goes.

487
00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.010
More than two thirds of North American women who are headed into menopause have

488
00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:02.820
hot flashes.

489
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.720
They also affect women who start menopause after chemotherapy or surgery to move

490
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.630
their over it. It doesn't say anything. I'm why it's North American.

491
00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:12.000
That's what I was wondering. It says, what is a hot flash?

492
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.600
It's a sudden feeling of heat. Sometimes a red flushed face and sweating.

493
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.880
We don't know exactly what causes them,

494
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.830
but there may be related to changes in circulation.

495
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.430
I guarantee you if they happen to men, they know exactly what caused them. Oh,

496
00:29:23.431 --> 00:29:26.690
they'll fix that shit. They figured out. Oh yeah, they'll fix that joke if they,

497
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.780
if they can fix a soft penis. Yeah, they'll fix a man Dick.

498
00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:32.350
But then we can't do nothing with all body.

499
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:37.350
Stop fixing soft dicks and everything else to be solved. No,

500
00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.990
I don't think that would work. They're already fix

501
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:46.210
<v 4>that. So they can't say stop fixing it up to like unlearn.</v>

502
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.280
They'd have to unlearn Viagara look, just let the man dig. Do what it do.

503
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.880
When it dilated that, then that's,

504
00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.670
that's the point where the lady need the notes.

505
00:29:54.671 --> 00:29:57.600
You need to put some cocoa butter up on the hip is loud across it back.

506
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.713
<v 0>Okay.</v>

507
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:06.540
<v 4>I don't think that's going to help either one is always over right, I guess.</v>

508
00:30:06.541 --> 00:30:07.980
Yeah. Yeah. People,

509
00:30:07.981 --> 00:30:12.480
I think that they would be happy when it's over like good. Finally,

510
00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.720
women are happened when they peers don't come on my walk and me and be happy

511
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:16.703
when a penis don't work.

512
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.640
Cause for men like your Dick not working as a sign of you don't,

513
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.450
you're not a man. Yeah, for sure. Ooh. Yeah.

514
00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:27.090
You feel like you're not a man anymore. Oh really? Yeah.

515
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.930
So I don't feel like I'm not a woman. I'm old. My peers, Scott, we'd be happy.

516
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.350
Yeah. But it's different. If you pussy dried up and became useless,

517
00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:35.184
like sealed up

518
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.670
like nothing. You know, like maybe you meet a man,

519
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.940
maybe you and your husband get divorced. You met a man, he's beautiful.

520
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.840
Can read. So he's got good Dick and he going to put it in.

521
00:30:48.841 --> 00:30:53.600
It's like just a mess down there. Oh yeah, yeah. No,

522
00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.790
I'm black. It grow real thick. So it's always a mess down there.

523
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.800
Yeah. I call it nappy grill. We've got a Jackson five and fro

524
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.583
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

525
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.330
<v 4>well, I mean for some women it matters.</v>

526
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:16.030
But I guess because I started really early, I don't want no dick.

527
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:20.080
I want health care. Oh No. D you ain't gotta do that to me.

528
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:24.460
Just take you on a trip. I put for men though. It's like a sign of weakness.

529
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.370
It's a weakness then. Yeah. Yeah. You don't feel like a man anymore.

530
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:29.770
What if you love that person? I think you ready?

531
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.200
Are you willing to deal with the softness? Yeah.

532
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.960
Especially if you don't want any dick. Yeah.

533
00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.920
If you want Dick and his duplex ice cream, ice cream sticks around it.

534
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:47.170
Oh, like a brace. Like someone, a broken leg.

535
00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.620
You break your leg in the forest and they want to fucking strap it to some twigs

536
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.800
. What else do they was doing before by came along?

537
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.350
I don't know what they were doing. Let's just get them in the freezer.

538
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.160
Do it too. Out. That's what, that's why they kill rhinos. You know Rhino Horn,

539
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.400
they think rhino horn gets your dick hard. Really? It doesn't do shit.

540
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.360
Do you eat it? They, I guess they make a tea out of it. Oh really?

541
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.194
It doesn't even work.

542
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:15.040
But guys who've been taken Rhino Horn forever to try and get their dick hard and

543
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:19.300
so much so that now that it's forbidden and it's expensive because it's

544
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:21.580
forbidden. It's like a sign of luxury,

545
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.420
like you're drinking rhino horn t it's a big thing.

546
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.240
And apparently some Asian countries like with like really wealthy people.

547
00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:32.860
Then we have Dickson Asian, they go home. I mean I heard they was small.

548
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.490
You're heard. Well I have a girlfriend. Yes.

549
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.980
Six Asian babies right here. But she don't

550
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.400
<v 1>have any scratch Mars. Well, and I was just telling babies, you know,</v>

551
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:46.400
most women get stretch marks. Right. But I don't think that has to do with Dick.

552
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.400
But I'm saying Asian means make small babies.

553
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:53.520
So I'm just assuming. Well what happened? It's like go,

554
00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.220
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

555
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:59.380
I missed the basketball player was the the the giant dude. Yeah. Yeah man.

556
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.220
What about that guy? Even if he has a normal size, he too tall.

557
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.240
He ain't got no Dickies. Two, two,

558
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.900
two tigers guarantee you he pissed on top of his pants.

559
00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:16.130
It's a, it's a way a man, bro. James is tall too. He got a lot of Dick.

560
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.210
I saw that nick on TV that day. I bet. Oh my God. When he went to go scratch.

561
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:24.780
I was like, I'm not into young Dick like that. But that was nice and I said,

562
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.750
I tell you somebody else who got a nice, oh, Nicki Minaj ex boyfriend safari.

563
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.170
He broke the Internet with it. He broke down and that was, oh my God.

564
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.830
Here the curve. Any Joe fucking lip you can ask.

565
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.290
It could probably live a weight in this fucking weight room right here.

566
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.610
It was so big he couldn't even fit on the iPhone. It was only iPad action.

567
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.660
I was sending this to everybody. Bitch, look, you blessed today.

568
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.450
You blessed and he made a little five minute video.

569
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:59.270
That thing was swinging like the American flag on top of a building.

570
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.890
It was nice for my stomach done. Once I finish losing weight, don't do it.

571
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.770
Don't why I want my titties lifted. You don't know my tennis

I would like to get my stomach done so I can see my vagina.

594
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:22.520
It's been a long time. We'd been disconnected for a long time.

595
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.990
Have you ever gone on a diet? Yeah. Didn't like it.

596
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:36.090
I lost a hundred pounds and it just stopped, so I caught it. Not Bad.

597
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.750
It's like it stopped. He was like, Oh, you gotta go to the gym? I'm like, no.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.590
literally went on a diet joke.

616
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:46.880
He read everything. He just go to the gym. He was fat as fuck. That's kitties.

617
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.150
His titties gone. His stomach flat every different day. What does he do?

618
00:36:51.151 --> 00:36:53.990
What kind of exercise? I don't know. I can call him his name. June bug.

619
00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:58.180
June bug. Yeah. Not his real name. He's, that's his nickname. Nickname.

620
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:03.450

624
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.060
A video of you at the gym would be just you complaining and talking Shit.

625
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.780
When somebody gets you to workout, be God damn hilarious. Juma,

626
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:27.360
we're going to do a podcast, but he gonna try to kill me jail.

627
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.140
But if you just listened to him and did it and did a video,

628
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.010
I guarantee you that would get a shit load of views. Okay,

You're gonna move here. I'm gonna move here for a little bit. For how long?

632

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.170
so I'd be here doing the shoot and then I'm gonna go back home.

634
00:37:49.171 --> 00:37:51.150
I can't take all these nice titties running around,

635
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:56.790
so I'm going to bring junebug out with me trying to start fresh to start filming

636
00:37:56.791 --> 00:38:00.960
video you all to seemed like he had big titties. Like mines. They're gone.

637
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:04.380
Beautiful. I love it. I love stories like that. He just did it.

638
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:08.790
I know what it was. He couldn't get laid. Well that'll be a motivator. Yeah.

639

645
00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.880
in the room when these conversations are happening. I said,

646
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:35.290

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.150
He told me all stopped up Joe. But my cycle came. I'm like,

654
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:10.870

656
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.420
Yeah. He just reads a lot about fitness and health. He's, I'm telling you, Joe,

660
00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.860

He was like, it's better Mama. It's bad.

670
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:17.380
When you're fat, your Dick gets smaller.

671
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.580
Your naval become your Dick when you real fat Joe.

Oh my God, you should do that. Oh look, I talked you into doing a podcast.

673
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:33.580
I'm going to talk you into doing this. You have to, okay.

674
00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.570
Junebug I know you're going to see this meal

675
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:40.210
<v 3>bug please. You and your mom at the gym. It'd be gigantic. I'll help you.</v>

676
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.900
I'll promote it. I'll put it up on Twitter and Instagram. Please do this.

677
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.900
<v 1>Joe Egon. Kiyomi. Okay, you go, I got to go in there with a d P in. Oh wait,</v>

678
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.420
if he gets you in crazy shape, imagine if you get to like bikini shape.

679
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.150
Seriously. I ain't been like that since the third grade

680
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:05.710
bikinis shaped. I'm telling you, Joe, you could do that though. He does that.

681
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:06.730
Joe,

682
00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.700
you don't know how happy I would be if I could just look straight down and see

683
00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:10.730
shit. At

684
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.770
<v 3>times. The food that you crave is the food that you eat,</v>

685
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.810
so if you eat food that's not healthy for it,

686
00:41:15.811 --> 00:41:18.240
that's where you're craving all the time and your stomach gets used to it.

687
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.740
The what they call your gut biome. Your stomach bacteria wants sugar,

688
00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.580
bread and pasta. As soon as you start eating healthy food,

689
00:41:26.581 --> 00:41:28.350
your body starts craving healthy food.

690
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.910
Your body will start craving salads and lean meat and chicken and fish.

691
00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:34.283
I don't know what else

692
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.910
<v 2>he started. We don't drink water but I do now. He makes me drink.</v>

693
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:41.090
Well he literally call me Mama cause I can do one liter a day.

694
00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:44.300
I'm up to one liter. That's no cause. What do you drink besides water?

695
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.120
I drink coffee in the morning and then after that, no more coffee.

696
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:51.770
I have to have one cup. Coffee is fine. Yeah I do put sugar and cream in.

697
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.460
I got full Craig Baby. I need something to call my to him. So I told him my son,

698
00:41:55.461 --> 00:41:56.930
I can't give up my call for right now.

699
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.950
So I drink coffee only in the morning and then I drink water all day.

700
00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:05.840
I work on a liter of water and he literally go through the House and tell us

701
00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:06.890
what we can and can't eat,

702
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:11.210
which is I'd be want to punch him in the face but I am losing a few panels with

703
00:42:11.211 --> 00:42:12.290
him. Like you know I got,

704
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.530
I got the back wheel arms like Grand Mama and he was like, mom,

705
00:42:15.531 --> 00:42:17.830
I'm gonna get all of that off with you. Cause he was,

706
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.640
he had fed arms too and big titties.

707
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.350
I mean he lost all of it and I'm so good you could do it too.

708
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.550
Yeah cause I was told them, I said,

709
00:42:25.551 --> 00:42:29.720
look you 19 you're on the insurance at 26 they would give you weight loss

710
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:31.940
surgery. And he's like, I don't want that. I said, son,

711
00:42:31.941 --> 00:42:32.880
go get the weight loss surgery.

712
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.800
Then I get your titties taken off and your stomach took. He's like, mom,

713
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:37.460
that don't sound like no manly thing.

714
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:41.740
<v 1>I heard it all played out.</v>

715
00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:46.120
<v 2>Tommy took his titties cut off and y'all don't get them weight loss surgeon and</v>

716
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.030
my fat daughter, she fat and I said, I'm gonna get your Tommy Toe.

717
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.300
I'm going to get your stomach cut and then I'm gonna buy you a ne it's cause she

718
00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.660
had no ass. So, and then I told my husband he don't have no ass.

719
00:42:55.661 --> 00:42:56.600
I was going by him, my ass.

720
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:57.580
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

721
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:05.060
Everybody asks us [inaudible] people are getting cancer from that as is that

722
00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:08.260
when they take the fat from, you know, not only to take the fat,

723
00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:11.650
they getting a lot of fat. They getting cancer from the implants. What?

724
00:43:11.651 --> 00:43:15.510
Titties ass implants. Oh, I ain't gonna do no, I asked him to do that.

725
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.870
I got bigger. You do. There's no issue. But some people who get asked implants,

726
00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:24.340
they're starting to get cancer. I'll ask him. Plants are only a few years old.

727
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:27.100
<v 2>And you know what? I don't understand. I'm from the inner city of Atlanta.</v>

728
00:43:27.101 --> 00:43:29.470
When we was coming up, Joe, if you want it titties and ass,

729
00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.560
and they had this thing going around and I did a podcast on it. I said,

730
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.470
we didn't people, black people didn't know what plastic surgery was.

731
00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:39.490
So the deal was you take that government butter and you rub it on your titties

732
00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:43.960
and your ass and they said it'll make it grow. Yeah, I'm not lying to you.

733
00:43:43.961 --> 00:43:48.780
That's what we used to do back in the day. Watch up. Look at me. Yeah, but look,

734
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:52.820
look at me. Don't think it's from the butter. Ah, ever. Ever been.

735
00:43:52.821 --> 00:43:53.690
I Know Rob Butler.

736
00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:01.690
<v 1>You don't know that government [inaudible] I want a job.</v>

737
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:09.250
They said to the ghetto to kill everybody. Joe.

738
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.020
I got say these stories at once. I was in the tub and [inaudible] was like,

739
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.500
just put the butter on your TDA, your ass. We put the bottle all on my Mama.

740
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.140
Wait, cause she's like, no, you bitches. They got my bottle on Ya.

741
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:22.650
You know that shit. Gotta last me Tornado. Mo Day she took this,

742
00:44:22.651 --> 00:44:25.470
did you call it? And she hit. Doesn't that motherfucker stuck in that bottle?

743
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.390
She gave us one woman who she say sprayed my shit off you bitches.

744
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:33.730
We're not hot bar all of us. She put that, she making a frigerator.

745
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:36.330
She beat the shit out of. Oh my God.

746
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:39.960
She scraped a butter off your tits and put it back in the fridge.

747
00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.790
We will pull, we can waste on that good bottle of Joe. Oh my God.

748
00:44:44.791 --> 00:44:45.840
That is hilarious.

749
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:50.190
She beat this year I was playing and her butter magic butter really did that.

750
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.790
All you had to do to get big tits and a big ass. Just even butter.

751
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:57.740
I have him t this is the fourth grade. So that's when I did it.

752
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.820
Like you just have good genetics. Now tell my Mama didn't have no titties. Yeah,

753
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:05.400
but sometimes it doesn't get your mom but it goes to,

754
00:45:05.401 --> 00:45:09.840
you know I'm trying to kill the government. Don't do that.

755
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:13.230
Education and shit. Joe, go break it all the way down for the lady.

756
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:16.220
Let them try to butter they phone. They try to pause it. Okay,

757
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.070
so go out and get you some good old government Butler that won't mail and just

758
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:24.480
sit on it like a, like, like a fucking bird trying to hit your eat.

759
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.100
Just sit right. Yeah. Just rub it on your booty and stuff.

760
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.740
Just have a seat on it and hopefully it'll make your booties and tds. Girl,

761
00:45:31.741 --> 00:45:34.320
your brother for me, if it didn't work, imagine if that works.

762
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.820
There's a lot of questions on Yahoo people asking that does make your butt

763
00:45:38.821 --> 00:45:42.270
bigger and then I found a product called buck butter

764
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.560
cream for smoother, fuller, and firmer skin. I don't know if that's what I had.

765
00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:53.870
Yeah,

766
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:56.810
<v 3>natural but enhanced. We cream for women and men.</v>

767
00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:01.990
Plump booty enhancer lotion but firming and tightening cream sexy but was it?

768
00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.220
Hold on. Sorry. Sexy Butt lifter cream button. Larger Green.

769
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:08.490
This is horse shit.

770
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.620
<v 1>There's most likely it's got four stars.</v>

771
00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.480
[inaudible] bunch of people that are assholes that work for the company.

772
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:20.610
They're reviewing it 364 customer reviews. Hold on,

773
00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:21.444
click there.

774
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.430
<v 3>I used to read this one or a bad one.</v>

775
00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:30.700
The good ones adding to my flat booty.

776
00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.210
My family and I and my family,

777
00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:37.810
I inherited flat Butt Syndrome. It's embarrassing.

778
00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.550
It's embarrassing.

779
00:46:39.551 --> 00:46:44.551
Have your butt hurt because you have no padding when you sit and have no pants

780
00:46:45.521 --> 00:46:49.330
fall, have your pants fall because there's nothing in the back to hold them up.

781
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:53.950
After a week I def notice something extra in the back. I'll keep using.

782
00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.600
That's the people that you want to buy your butt cream cause they're morons.

783
00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.350
That's like people that give money to preachers that fly on private jet.

784
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:06.070
<v 1>Yeah. I think that's crazy. That don't work. But I, I'm telling you,</v>

785
00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.980
gum and butter work, Joe, I'm telling you. Let's look at this.

786
00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.680
Who would've known it works faster on your breasts and on your butt,

787
00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.570
but it's work. [inaudible] this is not real. It is real. Looking at me.

788
00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:17.893
I'm my forties

789
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:25.390
I can't see shit

790
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.460
when you yell with those giant glasses on. So funny God.

791
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:36.550
<v 3>But listen to these fucking, the people that are writing these reviews,</v>

792
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.500
not only does it works, that's it works. Not only does it works,

793
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.480
it increased my breast size.

794
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.990
They probably should change the name to breast and button hands, pant, butter.

795
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.580
I know it for the butt. I know it for the buck. So I figured, let me see,

796
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:55.960
will it do anything for my breast since it's in quotes, all natural.

797
00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:00.010
So I did. So within a week,

798
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.580
my breast was fuller. Last time I seen them.

799
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:07.540
This size was right before it was time to breastfeed and my baby is now nine

800
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:08.374
years old.

801
00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:14.400
<v 1>Oh, so imagine that what we was doing in the ghetto,</v>

802
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.910
I'm telling you that thick as butter does work.

803
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.680
Watch, I made it. People who knows what I'm talking about from the south.

804
00:48:22.681 --> 00:48:25.510
Say Joe, we did that and it worked out.

805
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.950
So my routine is we should have done it on one titty.

806
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:34.070
Did it just to see no John wanting to be here. I know,

807
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.830
but it is only one way to find out that actually works. One cheek, one tick.

808
00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.200
You bounce it out. Left cheek, right tip.

809
00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:43.210
I'm going to find that button button and rub it on my crack baby.

810
00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.190
One of her titties and see if they grow in their head.

811
00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:49.140
Just don't even tell them what you're doing. Just put it on one titty. I okay,

812
00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.170
I'm gonna have to get her to do it. I don't think I feel appropriate.

813
00:48:52.171 --> 00:48:56.820
How old is she now? She's not. It's too late. No, no. She's uh, no. At Four.

814
00:48:56.821 --> 00:48:59.440
You can do it. You have a five year. I can test it out.

815
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.430
She already got a big gaze booty. Oh yeah.

816
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:04.750
Then I'm going to come and get some of that and see if it works.

817
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:10.050
My husband would kill me. I don't know if it's true but I don't think it is.

818
00:49:10.051 --> 00:49:12.090
It doesn't make sense. But then again, I'm not a scientist.

819
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.330
I'm telling you it's like that peanut butter that they used to send to the

820
00:49:15.331 --> 00:49:16.770
ghetto to choke negros out.

821
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:27.150
I love you too. What did they do?

822
00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:29.280
That peanut butter that they used to send to the gut.

823
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.720
The government used to give black people,

824
00:49:30.721 --> 00:49:33.980
peanut buddy Joe come out cause they didn't want to talk about that thick peanut

825
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.330
butter. You had to heat in the might.

826
00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.080
You want a microwave to heat it on the stove.

827
00:49:37.081 --> 00:49:39.660
Like you better cook up scrambled egg for now.

828
00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.060
So he get sprayed it on the sandwich. Really?

829
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.080
Then they find out later on they were gonna kill us. It was like,

830
00:49:46.260 --> 00:49:50.990
it was thick as fuck. It came in a cane. The Goldman peanut butter.

831
00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:51.923
Good googling.

832
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.510
<v 3>There was some dude on Instagram who was in school,</v>

833
00:49:54.511 --> 00:49:56.880
some kid in school and they were there. They, you know,

834
00:49:56.881 --> 00:50:00.300
they feed them cheese sandwiches for lunch and he was lighting the cheese

835
00:50:00.301 --> 00:50:02.790
sandwich. He was like, look at this cheese, look at this shit.

836
00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:05.220
And he's lighting. He's got a lighter to, it would not melt.

837
00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.310
It was just turning black. It was just getting black from the smoke,

838
00:50:08.311 --> 00:50:10.520
from the lighter. It was not melting. It wasn't,

839
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.450
what the fuck kind of cheese is this.

840
00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.110
<v 1>Yeah. And it wasn't real cheese.</v>

841
00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.870
There's this parts of America that the government ignores, right? Yeah,

842
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:25.730
man. Yeah. You got through. I got through.

843
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:29.030
He made it through the net. But, but didn't they only come to you when they,

844
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:33.170
when they need your vote? They only come to the, like black pastors.

845
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.470
They like black pastors, you know? That's why I don't go to church.

846
00:50:36.471 --> 00:50:38.930
I tell them all the time. I taught at churches, chicken,

847
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.850
you get more for your money. Churches. Chicken's better.

848
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:45.980
$2 Tuesday, get you two piece chicken in a biscuit.

849
00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:51.700
Popeye's alone on Tuesday and go to churches. Yeah,

850
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:56.210
but did they have the spicy this Jannie got spices now. Yeah. Yeah.

851
00:50:56.330 --> 00:51:00.680
That's the thing. I'm like, I'm not giving no pastor my money. Good for you.

852
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:03.380
And ride not there. I mean, Hey, the Bob is free.

853
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:06.620
Then every hotel just did abide by the hotel like everybody else used to.

854
00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:08.300
I'm not going to give you my money.

855
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:11.900
Then you are here by buying jets and shit and I'm struggling.

856
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.350
Then you fucking holes in church. Rini sharing holes in church. No.

857
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.280
Nomo they're fucking hoes. Oh yeah, they beat so fuck you. I don't know.

858
00:51:19.281 --> 00:51:22.940
I don't go to church holes. Go to church with no underwhelm to get the pastor.

859
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.970
Oh fuck the first lady, they don't kick them back. The first lady

860
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:32.570
goes where? No underwear in church to lure the pastor. Really?

861
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.820
You ain't much. The pastors is sexy as fuck.

862
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:37.700
I remember back in the day when you might not remember cause you white,

863
00:51:37.701 --> 00:51:41.740
but begging and begging a date.

864
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:45.260
The pastor was ugly. Oh, the passable ugly. Like TD Jakes.

865
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.980
They was on fuckable but now they all sexy.

866
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:51.410
Then they all sexy me. Everybody want fun?

867
00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:52.120
<v 4>No,</v>

868
00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:55.390
that's what they said they made when they made Catholic Cheetah preachers become

869
00:51:55.391 --> 00:51:56.110
celibate.

870
00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:59.110
One of the reasons why the Mandan become syllabus because the Catholic preachers

871
00:51:59.111 --> 00:52:01.690
were banging all the ladies and they were like, damn,

872
00:52:01.691 --> 00:52:04.570
they were like rock stars because they were the ones who had the word of God.

873
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:08.680
And this is before anyone could read the Bible because it was all in Latin.

874
00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:13.030
So they did not read Latin. So they relied on these priests to read it.

875
00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:18.310
Look at Joel Osteen. Yes, he's fuckable. Oh yeah, I haven't. Don't imagine so.

876
00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:19.690
Yeah. Do you think he gets him?

877
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.920
<v 1>I give him song and not in Jesus' name.</v>

878
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.290
He's sexy shit.

879
00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:33.940
I don't even do white men Lauer do Joe Austin in the pool pit.

880
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:37.760
<v 4>Do you think he gets him? He got a wife. Yeah, but other than her,</v>

881
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:41.570
<v 1>hey bitch</v>

882
00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:50.220

883
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:57.210
and I let him call me that too. Yeah, you pay the bill. Get Him.

884
00:52:57.211 --> 00:53:00.210
He killed any age at,

885
00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:02.430
Oh look at that for here to hell.

886
00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:08.010
<v 4>He's 60 he won't give me his faithy. I bet he does have a six pack,</v>

887
00:53:08.011 --> 00:53:09.700
right? Yeah, you looks good.

888
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:12.840
Hey was that his wife and the upper right hand corner?

889
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.760
Go back 56 looks good for 57 for a white man. Look, go though.

890
00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:21.680
Is that his wife? She's hot. Yeah. She hasn't played with, they're called,

891
00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:25.920
let's say it's his wife. Kapow. Yeah, he could take that. Joel.

892
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:30.670
<v 1>Joel is good looking. It's got a god named Marina. Yeah, church has got they.</v>

893
00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.390
They are the new drug though. They're the new pimps.

894
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.880
Pimps had holes and they go on a cone and slept.

895
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.970
They hold and get their money or church like that. Now that's all it is.

896
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.270
<v 4>He does it in Vegas at the same arena where the UFC plays.</v>

897
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:47.130
I thought he was in Dallas. He goes all over the place. He goes on the road.

898
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:51.840
Sometimes they go on the wall and he's in Houston or Dallas somewhere in Texas.

899
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:53.880
Houston, so he does that,

900
00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:57.330
but he also does like giant arenas on the road like he does.

901
00:53:57.331 --> 00:54:00.120
He does the a t mobile center, whether UFC place.

902
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:04.200
Look at that as far as that place now you can keep that.

903
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.120
How many of those pitches in the audience have no underwear on?

904
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.220
Probably about 60%

905
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:19.043
<v 0>great.</v>

906
00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:26.280
Just stop going to church when they started charging for meals.

907
00:54:26.281 --> 00:54:31.170
I don't fuck with no junk. Oh my God. No, you ain't noticed that.

908
00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:34.170
I didn't know that they were banging on the churches mail. The front row.

909
00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.360
<v 4>Well is smell like an oyster card? Yeah.</v>

914
00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:59.400
You want that much money. You want private jets, you want big houses,

915
00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.680
you gotta want some extra posting.

916
00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:06.870
<v 1>Hell yeah. He go get tired of paying the same plastic face. White woman.</v>

922
00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.300

923
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:27.660
<v 0>Oh, slop.</v>

924
00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.360

925
00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.070

929
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:54.090
Oh yes. Some of the shit. Well mostly about the tragedies.

930
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.320
Mostly about your childhood.

931
00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:59.830
<v 1>It's funny now Joe, it's just that I took out, you know, I, I I see on stage,</v>

932
00:55:59.831 --> 00:56:02.560
I said, um, ah, when you, when you,

933
00:56:02.561 --> 00:56:05.650
when you can laugh at what you've been through, then you got control of it.

934
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.130
It is only reason why I can laugh about being shot. And I even,

935
00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:13.750
my husband hate this bit. I do. I do a bit about my first gay, his father,

936

<v 1>Fucking fleas. I mean, people get crabs, I get it.</v>

939
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:33.940
But when someone gives you fleas, like what the fuck? But back in those days,

940
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:36.370
the health department would come and pick you up and say, Hey,

Gonna run Fleece on some bitch report.

944
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.350
Everybody he was missing and I was always on the list. Oh Geez.

945
00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:51.810
How can you tell people they,

946
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.430
I think it's funny that they used to come get me and me and the health

947
00:56:54.431 --> 00:56:57.550
department man had a relationship. Now we weren't sleeping together.

948
00:56:57.551 --> 00:56:59.750
He just say, hey you, plus it was on the list again.

949
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:13.740
Like how can you tell people? It's fucking hilarious. I don't have a STD,

950
00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:18.490
but I was young. You know who's it was simple shit. Gunnery,

951
00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:22.690
you're going to shout in. Yeas. And I remember they came one time, Joe and um,

952
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.330
they knocked on the door and I said, oh my God, you here.

953
00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:27.250
I thought you was gonna let me borrow it up. And he's like,

954
00:57:27.251 --> 00:57:28.870
you put some on this, let me here to put it out

955
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:41.280
is on the list. Pretty much. Call it your pussy. He said,

956
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:46.240
you put the bit reported. Okay. So my kid,

957
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:49.200
his father was down. I was like, let's go together and get cured. He's on,

958
00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.720
I don't want to go. Somebody might see me. So this is what he told me. Say Look,

959
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.320
it was going to run when you have a gun already,

960
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:57.340
you need to get a shot or you take pills for seven days. So he said, look,

961
00:57:58.180 --> 00:57:59.950
go to the health department, but don't get the shot.

962
00:57:59.951 --> 00:58:03.310
Get the pills so we can split them. So I'm so stupid.

963
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.840
I come back and split the seven day pills with him and we still both got half of

964
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:11.410
it. Oh my God.

965
00:58:11.411 --> 00:58:15.030
We didn't take the medication all the way. So, oh my God, stupid.

966
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:19.930
I was like walking while you tell people that shit and everybody always think he

967
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:22.330
gave me Gunnar Room and shot me and beat me like,

968
00:58:22.331 --> 00:58:24.940
can you please tell the people I didn't do this shit to you?

969
00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:29.140
How does he deal with you having this act like when you go on stage and talk

970
00:58:29.141 --> 00:58:31.740
about all this shit, how does he handle it? Does he cover his ears? He,

971
00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:36.880
he never, he only seen me once. Wait, what? He won't come see me. Joe, come on.

972
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:39.220
He wouldn't, he came to see me with Kat Williams,

973
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:44.140
asked him when I was opening for Kat Williams and um, but that's the only time,

974
00:58:44.141 --> 00:58:48.040
but he's, he's gotta know. Oh he no funny as fuck.

975
00:58:48.041 --> 00:58:51.090
Like how did you not want to see that? He don't want to see Joe.

976
00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.320
We'll tell him to come to the comedy store tonight cause he going to be there

977
00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:57.080
for the 10 30 show. Hell yeah, I am. But he's an even now.

978
00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.830
Plus he'll watch your fucking podcast and tell my daughter, oh,

979
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:03.130
she was so fucking fun, but he's not going to direct it to say to me,

980
00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:06.560
he was so fucking funny. But he's my biggest cheerleader. I mean, he's support.

981
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:08.740
I mean, you know, I've been doing this 17 years.

982
00:59:08.741 --> 00:59:11.770
You know how many times I had to Max that man credit card out to go and do it.

983
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:17.050
So, you know, but he would not come see me. He's like, look, I live with you.

984
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.790
I hear this shit every day.

985
00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.580
<v 2>Well he gives me like, he's funny to me. Like I told you saying, not today.</v>

986

988
00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:37.310
he was only seen you do comedy once the one time out of 17 years.

989
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:40.280
It's a good one though to open for Kat Williams. He's still in touch with Kat.

990
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.000
No, but I love care about it.

Cause before he did that I was about to put my fucking daddy on potato sack and

1000
01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:12.470
stick him in the ground cause we had no money.

1001
01:00:12.471 --> 01:00:14.420
And I tried to do a fish fry in the black community.

1002
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:16.730
I mean the white neighborhood, they don't know nothing about no fucking fish.

1003
01:00:16.731 --> 01:00:20.570
Frown. No Tuesday and cat wouldn't gave me the money to bury them. That's hard.

1004
01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:23.610
Yeah. So can't nobody tell me shit about cat. Wait,

1005
01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:25.910
<v 3>he's crazy. But he's funny as fuck. He's,</v>

1006
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.610
he's one of my favorites all the time and he tell the fucking truth too.

1007
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.910
If you go to the bar, Go back to like the pimp chronicles is in his prime.

1008
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:36.200
That is, those are some of the best specials ever. Yes.

1009
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:40.950
He's a funny motherfucker and he's so original. That is him.

1010
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.100
You know what I mean? Like his delivery, his style, everything.

1011
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.590
<v 2>I love him. Can't nobody tell me shit about no kit. We call the Cat William.</v>

1012
01:00:48.591 --> 01:00:50.660
I was able to finish my basement after that tour.

1013
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:54.090
<v 3>He, uh, he gave me some, not gave me,</v>

1014
01:00:54.091 --> 01:00:57.450
but he gave some great advice once about comedy. One of the things he says,

1015
01:00:57.451 --> 01:01:00.750
don't eat before you go on stage. And I was like, yeah, why would you,

1016
01:01:00.751 --> 01:01:03.750
you don't eat before you fight. Why would you eat before you go on stage?

1017
01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:08.160
Because it causes your body that your body when you eat has to break down that

1018
01:01:08.161 --> 01:01:10.590
food. So it's, it's using up energy,

1019
01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:15.030
like some of the energy that you would have to do stand up is now breaking down

1020
01:01:15.031 --> 01:01:19.050
that food in your body. That's why I be about to fall asleep. Yes.

1021
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:23.700
Yes. Shit, I got to stop eating. Just don't eat right before you go onstage.

1022
01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:27.840
Just eat afterwards. Okay. Yeah, I mean I listen to him and I was like,

1023
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:28.800
that makes so much sense.

1024
01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:33.810
And also he has a playlist of music that he plays right before he goes on stage.

1025
01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:38.160
Like sets it up. Like it's like puts him in the mood to go onstage. Yeah,

1026
01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.640
I do that too. I do that. I do that too. I like a lot of 'em.

1027
01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:48.110
<v 2>Um, I, I don't want to say outcast, but that ain't what I'm going for.</v>

1028
01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:53.210
Who the fucking rap. I, let's call it beat. Oh, that little nasty thing.

1029
01:01:53.211 --> 01:01:57.020
That's what I would be if I had a body like that. Oh my God,

1030
01:01:57.021 --> 01:02:00.680
that girl got a tone that a drag afloat. She might,

1031
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.790
she that person in my head that I want to be. I listened to a lot of Carly B.

1032
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:05.624
I like her.

1033
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.760
<v 3>Maybe you can get that body. Ah, maybe,</v>

1034
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:12.330
maybe June bug kill you in that gym.

1035
01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.150
Get on that elliptical machine. Come on

1036
01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:18.630
<v 2>Zoomba we're going to need you to help your mom out and stop your mom from</v>

1037
01:02:18.631 --> 01:02:19.464
peeing. I say

1038
01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:25.700
<v 3>just just change up the Diet. I'm working. I swear God listen to your son.</v>

1039
01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:30.440
I'm gonna look like you if you don't do that. Did they go too hard?

1040
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.540
I tell you go to a different doctor. I'm lying.

1041
01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.400
But if you, if you did that,

1042
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:41.180
I'm telling you if you did a video with your son and your son getting you to the

1043
01:02:41.181 --> 01:02:43.930
gym and did that regularly on Youtube,

1044
01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.070
June bug and miss pat just do that. That shit would be hilarious.

1045
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.210
It'd be so funny cause I, cause you know I got lucky is out. I want,

1046
01:02:53.211 --> 01:02:54.590
especially when they're making you do shit,

1047
01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:58.100
you don't want to do like working out like doing sit ups and shit and squat.

1048
01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:02.130
<v 2>Yeah. Spread my legs wide. It ain't been never been used at a wasted day.</v>

1049
01:03:02.131 --> 01:03:06.570
Eighties. You bought it my butthole.

1050
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.650
<v 3>Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. We doing it. Do it, do it. Definitely do it.</v>

1051
01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:16.410
So, so you do you bring like, um, I bring like one of those, um, um, uh,

1052
01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:20.080
MP3, no. Uh, Bluetooth speaker things with me. You know,

1053
01:03:20.081 --> 01:03:21.910
I have like one of those JPL extremes.

1054
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.490
I bring that with me and I put it in the green room. Play music.

1055
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.390
I usually listen to music on my youtube, my before perform. Yeah.

1056
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.630
I listen to music on my phone. Yeah, but you get yourself in the mood. You do,

1057
01:03:33.631 --> 01:03:36.730
you have a drink before you go onstage? I don't drink alcohol at all.

1058
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:41.590
No nothing. What about weed? I don't do any way. You don't know nothing.

1059
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.880
I grew up in, up invite

1060
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:47.210
<v 2>me. As I say, I just don't, I mean, alcohol,</v>

1061
01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:51.830
alcohol does nothing for me. It makes me sleepy. And, um, I,

1062
01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:54.020
my mom was an alcoholic and I used to always say,

1063
01:03:54.021 --> 01:03:58.190
I'm going to be nothing like this bitch. And so, so

1064
01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.100
yeah. So I don't, I don't do at my,

1065
01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:06.260
my whole family drink and I just don't do it. I don't, I don't smoke weed.

1066
01:04:06.261 --> 01:04:08.030
I don't, you know, I was just telling them earlier,

1067
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:11.900
like junebug tried to smoke weed one time and with his white friends,

1068
01:04:11.901 --> 01:04:14.540
but they were so stupid, Joe, they didn't know how to roll the wheat.

1069
01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.400
So they got the, they got the, um,

1070
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:20.750
the copy of paper off the machine and roll the weed in there. Yeah.

1071
01:04:20.751 --> 01:04:24.170
And Tommy leading it just burned and all the wheat filling his chest.

1072
01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:27.790
And I beat the dog shit out of jumbo. And I told him,

1073
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:32.330
I don't grocery for you to create an appetite. You already fucking fat.

1074
01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:35.120
Oh my God. And I just told my kids when they was young, I said, look,

1075
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:37.010
I told my son, I kid, I said, look,

1076
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.820
I get food stamps and I don't get enough food stamps for your weed habits.

1077
01:04:40.821 --> 01:04:44.690
So we not gonna do drugs. We not going to join gangs, we not going to do drugs.

1078
01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:47.900
It's US motherfucker. So we not gonna do it. So,

1079
01:04:47.901 --> 01:04:51.200
but Junebug is the only kid I ever had that really tried to dab into weed.

1080
01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:56.280
That's a weird way to do it though. Copy paper. They was terrible.

1081
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:59.960
They would go to the ghetto and buy the weed out of the, out of where I live at.

1082
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:02.640
They would go over to the ghetto. So I said, Juma, how much you need?

1083
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:07.100
How much wheat you buy? 1.5 grams. What the hell is that? I don't know.

1084
01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:12.500
And I called the police on him. I said, what are you I did.

1085
01:05:12.501 --> 01:05:15.080
I called the police on the shake him up. Right. And I,

1086
01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:18.160
you know called the police. Yeah. But I said, hey black. So leave your guns

1087
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.700
<v 1>in the car. So come over here and shake my son up. Napolese get over there.</v>

1088
01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:24.800
The police and Junebug son go to school together. This man for,

1089
01:05:24.801 --> 01:05:27.940
come on and start crack. We love you. June. I said, holy cow,

1090
01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:29.320
you're a fucking crap.

1091
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:33.760
[inaudible] I was crying so that didn't help.

1092
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:38.140
But eventually I think he gonna stop smoking now he's going to stop or start.

1093
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:42.640
I think he stopped. I ran off all his friends. I told him, I said, look, yo,

1094
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:46.210
your white son just lost his only black friend. I'm a fucking white baby.

1095
01:05:46.211 --> 01:05:47.460
I bring him back over here with the weight

1096
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:54.700
and do more like everybody at my school say you a snitch. I said fuck them.

1097
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.020
I whooped him white boy, his ass.

1098
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:03.220
Cause I called, I called on a pair so I called all the parents. I was like damn.

1099
01:06:03.221 --> 01:06:06.250
Well smoking weed and looking at some little white girl puts it on the phone and

1100
01:06:06.251 --> 01:06:08.160
I said, Juma, you bless your momma standing there.

1101
01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:12.280
But his wife puts it floating on the phones. Oh look a girl from the school.

1102
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.310
Yes. So I put the, I put the,

1103
01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:18.870
I Chromecast the pitcher and I called out a Passat.

1104
01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.150
Who white baby puts these days. Yeah, you put it on the TV

1105
01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.300
off at me. Look, kick the bitches away from June bug Joe McGinn, Tim Grady,

1106
01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:32.410
Little Dick. It's real, real small redneck. I'm trying to kill my baby.

1107
01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:34.310
Trying to get my baby locked up for some white pussy.

1108
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:37.480
Don't fuck with white plus you ain't got no, Vicki ain't got no sense.

1109
01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.370
Oh my God. So,

1110
01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:43.730
so you had the parents come over and tell them who white man,

1111
01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:48.430
what the fuck did they say? I can't believe you did this.

1112
01:06:48.431 --> 01:06:51.440
What the fuck you mean? That was on the phone. Y'all started looking at it.

1113
01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:57.550
They stormed about it. They wouldn't speak to me and no, no.

1114
01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.580
Fuck. La County, no phrase. Oh my God.

1115
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.130
That's an old shoe ever in your life valley? No good.

1116
01:07:03.131 --> 01:07:06.770
She gave to one at a football player. He just passed it around everybody. Yeah.

1117
01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:09.550
And I told him, I said, jumbo, think about dude, you're supposed to Gary on him.

1118
01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.940
He's like, mom, Garren ain't getting naked at a deacon. Nobody see nothing.

1119
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:16.343
Yeah.

1120
01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.940
That's just the stuff I went through where he's the only one that ever really

1121
01:07:21.941 --> 01:07:25.480
tried me. Cause my other kids, you know, I tell like I tell my crack baby,

1122
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:28.630
I say, look, I'm going to take y'all out in public, but you got an option.

1123
01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:32.160
Do you want to get on mom or do you want the soccer mom and they don't like to

1124
01:07:32.161 --> 01:07:33.640
get on mom cause you get on.

1125
01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.450
Mama would knock the shit out of him in public and I give him option and we get

1126
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.300
in public and white people always coming to me like oh my God,

1127
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:42.520
your kids are so well disciplined. I said,

1128
01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:43.870
I told him I was going to fuck them up.

1129
01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.850
They say when you said they just look like what?

1130
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.380
I said you should fuck your kids up to tell them.

1131
01:07:53.381 --> 01:07:57.430
I said Hey, I said I will fuck you up. Don't play with me the I feed you.

1132
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.700
When we was coming back from the Disney cruise they was all playing with those

1133
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:02.470
little things that separate, you know when you're alive.

1134
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:05.930
So I told them like three full time stop isn't the my grand baby and there was

1135
01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:08.110
the full crack baby so they wouldn't stop Joe.

1136
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.000
I slept all of them at the same time.

1137
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:14.320
Why people like what the Fuck I say what you're looking at me for.

1138
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:15.190
You all saw him too.

1139
01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.280
<v 2>I asked him to stop by full time. Don't play with me, you know [inaudible] bad.</v>

1140
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.500
I'd been shot a couple of times. Yama. Fuck no, I'm crazy.

1141
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.280
And I just tell them that they good kids. The good kids now.

1142
01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.900
Oh they knew I fucked them up.

1143
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:32.540
I have a lot of bits about them because like [inaudible] like I do this bit

1144
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.210
about, I used to do this bit about the teacher school calling me all the time.

1145
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.770
White schools call you for anything and anything Joe. I mean just dumb shit.

1146
01:08:39.771 --> 01:08:41.240
Black schools. We tell them, look bitch,

1147
01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:44.620
that's your child to two 30 don't you wake me up. So one of the books I used,

1148
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:47.240
one of the beats I used to tell,

1149
01:08:47.241 --> 01:08:50.180
they call me by my niece Yolanda because she was sitting at the crayon table

1150
01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:52.310
with hello white friends and they're talking about their daddies.

1151
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:54.770
So Yolanda said, what? The next time I see my daddy,

1152
01:08:54.771 --> 01:08:58.490
I'm going to stab him in the neck and all the white kids started crying and they

1153
01:08:58.491 --> 01:09:01.370
asked me to come up there in an emergency to come up there to talk to them.

1154
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:04.280
I get up there, I'm like, ma'am, she can't stab a dead end in nick,

1155
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:06.470
the N***a in jail. Somebody else gonna stab him in the knee.

1156
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:09.680
Don't wake me up with, don't wake me up for this bullshit.

1157
01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:15.140
So they don't know how to handle or anything. And I had to set the school down.

1158
01:09:15.141 --> 01:09:16.730
I said, look, these kids are from the hood.

1159
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:20.330
They only talk and do what they know. You gotta give me time to help them grow.

1160
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.720
But then they wanted to put them on medication. I said, what? We will. Yeah,

1161
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:25.640
because they didn't know how to deal with them. They had this so,

1162
01:09:25.641 --> 01:09:29.600
so much like they momma was into horny daddy was in the drugs that they will be

1163
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:32.780
known the mom and they, they didn't know how to handle him and I said, look,

1164
01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:36.710
we're going to help him grow together. I said, well, what we not going to do,

1165
01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:38.540
we're not going to put these kids on medication.

1166
01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:43.700
What we gonna do is surround them with love. They so good now out of five years,

1167
01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:46.400
this baby just now passing the I step test,

1168
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:49.640
they took a minute to get there but he's finally there.

1169
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:52.510
I step those pumps,

1170
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:57.350
those standardized tests they give kids and the kids just wasn't ready and you

1171
01:09:57.351 --> 01:09:58.790
know I throw them in his neighborhood,

1172
01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:02.310
threw him in an environment that they wasn't used to and then you know they talk

1173
01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.630
they language. You see how country I am, what they talked straight streets.

1174
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.940
Cause sometimes like what the fuck are y'all talking about?

1175
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.840
We bout it about another fuck. You Ain't get better set up by bus.

1176
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:14.540
You Cross your head. We bowtie Bowtie yeah they ready to rumble.

1177
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:17.010
They ready to fight the little boy like I'm bout about,

1178
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:18.820
I said put your fucking finger down. Far Braking.

1179
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.550
But I had to retrain him because what he saw in the hood,

1180
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.380
it wasn't going at my nice little white school. No

1181
01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.350
they were they good now they're good. Now imagine all the kids that don't,

1182
01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:34.160
and you can imagine cause it was you when all the kids who don't have someone

1183
01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:36.860
like you, what my niece is her 20 years old,

1184
01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:40.940
21 and she had six kids and she in jail for 20 years for knocking on people

1185
01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.570
doing robbing them. So her kids is in a situation.

1186
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.630
So just imagine all the kids, I think about it all the time,

1187
01:10:47.631 --> 01:10:51.710
especially when it's my family member, but Joe, I had to realize this.

1188
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:54.080
I can't say the world. You can't save everybody.

1189
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:58.490
I try to save one at a time and that's all I can do. That's all you can do.

1190
01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.220
Yeah. That is all you can do. I can't say the world.

1191
01:11:01.221 --> 01:11:04.720
I mean I can't live if I keep trying to say the world. No, you won't.

1192
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:07.460
You won't be able to do what you're doing is helping people too.

1193
01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:08.970
One of the things you're doing,

1194
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:11.240
and it's helped me because you're making people laugh. Yeah,

1195
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.220
that helps a lot.

1196
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 4>Yeah, I do. People fucking need that. They need it so bad.</v>

1197
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.120
So many people right now with their headphones on in their cubicle laughing

1198
01:11:21.121 --> 01:11:24.720
their ass off right now. I hope so. Fuck yeah, they need it.

1199
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:28.770
[inaudible] pet down at the Joe wrote Little Cadet for sure.

1200
01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:32.100
They're gonna subscribe. I guarantee you. I hope so 100%.

1201
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:33.120
<v 2>Let me, you know,</v>

1202
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.840
I was dealing show last night at the verge of here in La and uh,

1203
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:40.260
a man came into me, said, man, my dog died today and I've been crying all day,

1204
01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:44.730
but I want to tell you how much you helped me fucking relieve I so I'm sorry

1205
01:11:44.731 --> 01:11:46.140
about your dog. Did you burn them up?

1206
01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:53.380
Turn them off. He actually started laughing, you know, after they die,

1207
01:11:53.381 --> 01:11:55.110
you got a barn about cremated cream in them.

1208
01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:57.510
Diags and let me actually started laughing, but I'm,

1209
01:11:57.511 --> 01:11:59.970
I mean I get that all the time and you know,

1210
01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.360
laughter is what he'll mean when I was able,

1211
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:08.040
when I was able to write my book and you know, started doing comedy,

1212
01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:12.960
especially like it was one story now about my mama boyfriend who molest me. And,

1213
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:17.730
um, I had never told this door over 30 something years. My husband didn't know,

1214
01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:19.920
only person knows me and my sister because he's all,

1215
01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:24.270
we happen to us at the same time with him. And uh, I never told this store.

1216
01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.540
And I remember when I was writing my book, the uh, lady who co-wrote my book,

1217
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:31.260
she was like, um, you gotta tell the store. And I said,

1218
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:34.200
well I got to ask my sister and I get my sister on the phone, Joe.

1219
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:37.140
And I was like, may pop. That was on, that's her name. I said,

1220
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.090
you ready to tell what Mr John did?

1221
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:43.800
And we both just boohoo eh, we cheat.

1222
01:12:43.801 --> 01:12:44.820
We told some of the store,

1223
01:12:44.821 --> 01:12:47.770
we got off the phone and it took for me to tell his story.

1224
01:12:47.771 --> 01:12:51.330
It took almost a week me in the right across so much cause I had,

1225
01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.250
I had all of that built up in me.

1226
01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.960
But I'm so happy I was able to tell that story now because that was the only

1227
01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:02.961
story I had never told public about how my Mama Boyfriend d it,

1228
01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:08.010
me and my sister from the age of probably six or eight till I was 11 years old,

1229
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:11.760
cause I started, my kids' father was 21 and I was 12 and I made him.

1230
01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.830
So I started having six eight 12. So when he started touching me, Mike,

1231
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.960
when I got a boyfriend, my Mama, my mama boyfriend left us alone.

1232
01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.950
Once you got a boyfriend? Yeah. Once I got a boyfriend, Jesus Christ.

1233
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:25.140
So that was the only story I had never told.

1234
01:13:25.141 --> 01:13:29.070
But when I told him I felt like I lost 20 I'm proud of a hundred pounds.

1235
01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.910
I felt like it, but it didn't go anywhere. Right. But I just felt oh, relief.

1236
01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:37.740
Yeah. So I know loud. I just know Lotta does a lot for me.

1237
01:13:37.741 --> 01:13:40.680
So I know it does the same for all the people. God Damn,

1238
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:45.320
you had a crazy fucking [inaudible] and I live it every inch of it too.

1239
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:50.040
<v 4>Well it's, that's the only way you can, I mean, what you've done is, I mean,</v>

1240
01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:54.440
you've done the ultimate take a negative and turn it into a positive. I try,

1241
01:13:54.441 --> 01:13:57.640
I try really hard. But you made me really happy cause your,

1242
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:59.860
your sense of humor is so fucked up,

1243
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:05.170
but it's because of your life that it's so fun. I mean, that's why it works.

1244
01:14:05.171 --> 01:14:07.960
If you had a cushy life and you were saying the shit that you say,

1245
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.240
it wouldn't be funny. So it wouldn't be no.

1246
01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.310
And that's of the things with my husband,

1247
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:15.340
<v 2>like when I was shared with, and like my kid's father shot me and beat me.</v>

1248
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:19.360
You know, most of your listeners in Canada, who I am, they know my background.

1249
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:22.180
And one of the things when I started sharing my life,

1250
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:26.890
my husband had that protective Mo. He didn't want me to, you know,

1251
01:14:26.891 --> 01:14:31.240
he knew how negative the world could be when I started to share these stories so

1252
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:34.360
I could see where he wanted to step in and protect me. Right. You know,

1253
01:14:34.361 --> 01:14:35.890
when people would judge me and you know,

1254
01:14:35.891 --> 01:14:38.170
like I dropped out of school in eighth grade when my husband went to the

1255
01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:41.800
military, went on off. He had a mom and Daddy, a way better life than me.

1256
01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:45.730
So he would always be there to like be that protector, like,

1257
01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:50.050
oh they think I'm stupid or [inaudible]. And I just, I just,

1258
01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.720
he helped me grow a backbone to know you'd say,

1259
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.270
fuck what people think about you. You mean?

1260
01:14:55.271 --> 01:14:58.050
Cause there was so much screwed up stuff in my head. Like, um,

1261
01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.000
one of the theme my Momma taught me about white people.

1262
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:02.740
I didn't deal with white people. I mean, let's be honest, I'm from [inaudible].

1263
01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.970
There was a police on the fucking on the case worker. My Mama told me, she said,

1264
01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:10.900
white people are better than you. Never look them in the fucking devil.

1265
01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:15.550
So my whole life, Joe Rogan, I was scared of white people. And when I,

1266
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:19.630
when I wrote the book and I told The lady this, when I was see white people,

1267
01:15:19.631 --> 01:15:22.570
I would immediately look down what else, what the slaves used to do.

1268
01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:26.080
And that's what the book lady told me. And I was like, I can't look them in eye.

1269
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.310
And then she was like, why?

1270
01:15:27.311 --> 01:15:30.460
And I told her the story and I told my husband his stories. He say, Pat,

1271
01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.150
he say we're all the same. Your fucking mommy is stupid.

1272
01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.293
<v 0>Hello.</v>

1273
01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.530
<v 2>I used to sell a bit. I said,</v>

1274
01:15:41.531 --> 01:15:44.380
the only thing between me and you white woman is my titties is bigger than

1275
01:15:44.381 --> 01:15:46.140
yours. But I was in,

1276
01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:49.760
I was in my late twenties when I learned it because you like I,

1277
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:52.720
when I moved to Indianapolis I couldn't talk to you. I fucking,

1278
01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:57.160
my words will stump and I will immediately say I'm stupid and I will look away.

1279
01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:01.060
And when I started doing coming in Indianapolis and my fan base turned white and

1280
01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:05.140
I was like, why the fuck y'all like me? Get away from me, the shit out of you.

1281
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:09.250
I say that to myself and my husband sent me down. I was like, Pat,

1282
01:16:09.251 --> 01:16:12.220
we all the same. Your fucking mom is stupid. I'm like, we are.

1283
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.290
And I was in my late twenties but I had never ever dealt with white people.

1284
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:18.580
Like I dealt with them when I moved into that community and I'm glad because it

1285
01:16:18.581 --> 01:16:21.250
taught me a lot as a young girl out of that,

1286
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:24.880
out of the inner city of Atlanta that we all the same. The problem was,

1287
01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:28.720
the problem with this country is we don't fucking talk. Yeah,

1288
01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.040
we don't communication.

1289
01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:33.100
<v 3>Well there's that. And then there's that.</v>

1290
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.700
These communities stay the way they are.

1291
01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.240
Like whether it's Baltimore where they had it set up or black people literally

1292
01:16:39.241 --> 01:16:44.241
weren't allowed to buy homes outside of certain areas or any inner city like you

1293
01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:45.260
know,

1294
01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:49.710
in inner city in Houston or New York or anywhere where the neighborhood stay the

1295
01:16:49.711 --> 01:16:54.480
same. They stay the same general state of war, crime, poverty,

1296
01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:56.370
all the drugs, everything stays.

1297
01:16:56.530 --> 01:17:00.320
<v 2>And I don't, you know, Joe, my kids and I, my,</v>

1298
01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:03.880
my kids up fucking, they blessed us and they don't realize how blessed they are.

1299
01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:08.320
And sometimes I get so pissed off at them like they go to this really nice high

1300
01:17:08.321 --> 01:17:10.490
school where I live in Indiana,

1301
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:15.620
they get they little laptops and you know they get new books every fucking year.

1302
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:16.131
Joe,

1303
01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:20.270
when I went to school it was so many niggles name wrote in that same book where

1304
01:17:20.271 --> 01:17:20.821
it hit done,

1305
01:17:20.821 --> 01:17:24.050
checked it out every year you had to flip a page and you just see Ramon,

1306
01:17:24.051 --> 01:17:27.270
Tyrone Tada, three pages of kids who had their books

1307
01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.570
and it pisses me off because you know I look at it and I was like well this is

1308
01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:37.220
the old curriculum where you know these my kids are getting a new curriculum

1309
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:42.200
every year and it's still like that in certain parts of America and it pisses me

1310
01:17:42.201 --> 01:17:44.570
off. I'm like, yeah, you guys don't realize how blessed you are.

1311
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.420
You come in through a fucking this fucking thousand dollars,

1312
01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:50.270
pay it on a float at this school and gave you take shift grants.

1313
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:54.650
Like my daughter will literally hold up the school bus because she wanted to

1314
01:17:54.651 --> 01:17:56.510
walk slow because she was fat.

1315
01:17:56.750 --> 01:18:01.010
So the lady called me was like Miss Pat Everyday I got to wait on Gary Ana to

1316
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:05.030
get on the bus and I've asked her several times to be at the bus stop when I get

1317
01:18:05.031 --> 01:18:07.040
there and I said, Ma'am lead that bitch

1318
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:13.010
lever you lead at motherfuckers. She'll get down on time but you know you,

1319
01:18:13.011 --> 01:18:15.020

1320
01:18:15.230 --> 01:18:19.130
I said don't you dare pepper my black ki lead that bitch cause I leave.

1321
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:22.070
You ain't not. You ain't in the car when I get in the cop bitch

1322
01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.570

1323
01:18:27.571 --> 01:18:29.450

1324
01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.990
I mean my daughter would come in the house one time and say I need you to take

1325
01:18:32.991 --> 01:18:36.680

1326
01:18:36.681 --> 01:18:39.380

1327
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:40.191

1340
01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:23.290
They understand that no one gave you anything like hell yeah, they get it.

1341
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:27.020
They get it. Yeah, they get it. But they like never. I don't want to hear y'all.

1342
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:31.840
Y'all poor stories. No, listen, that's not true days.

1343
01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.840
My my cable. Thank you. My cable got cut off one day. Right?

1344
01:19:35.841 --> 01:19:38.750
So I go in the House on my cable, cut off, and I tell him I was, I was like,

1346
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:44.870
Go turn the cable on before the kids get home. I was like, fuck these keys.

1347
01:19:44.871 --> 01:19:47.660
You know how many time I had to look at a and TV and thought it was snowing?

1348
01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.590

1349
01:19:51.591 --> 01:19:52.730
I don't care about the kids.

1350
01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.180
But he broke his neck to pay the cable bill because he don't want the kids to

1351
01:19:56.181 --> 01:19:59.350

Came back home, but he broke his neck. He came home and it all out. I don't,

1354
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:10.200

1355
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:14.620
but I tell you I don't love you like Jesus do. He loves you on condition.

1356
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.210
I was stabbed the shit out of you. I loaned my kids money.

1357
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:20.690
You gotta pay me back. My daughter called me. She said,

1358
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:23.310

1359
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:27.950

1360
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.730

1361
01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:33.450
I drive a little old last cruel that muckrack [inaudible] crack it. Knees left.

1362
01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:36.120
I bought for her. That's what I drive everyday. My Shit paid off.

1363
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:38.100
I'm not buying, you know, call. Well Bitch,

1364
01:20:38.101 --> 01:20:40.770

1365
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:44.550
So how are you gonna pay me back 3000 now? What did she say to that?

1366
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:47.580
I call you back. I said, I bet

1367
01:20:52.810 --> 01:20:55.110
this is my money. I wrote off it is money.

1368
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:58.020
I know you were dealt when I was selling Craig and 40 check,

1369
01:20:58.021 --> 01:21:00.690
but you had jaws and nice sheet. I don't know

1370
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:05.720
<v 3>that your life was hard, but if you had to live it over again,</v>

1371
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:11.450
then what? I mean it made you who you are. [inaudible]. Yeah,

1372
01:21:11.451 --> 01:21:12.290
that's what I was going to ask you.

1373
01:21:12.291 --> 01:21:15.530
But it's all fucked up thing to ask someone when they tell you they're molested

1374
01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:19.690
by your mom's boyfriend and that, you know, you had a,

1375
01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.960
a baby with this guy when you were 14 and he's married and another one.

1376
01:21:23.961 --> 01:21:28.150
And by the time you're 16, you're pregnant with a third. Yeah, no, no. Whatever.

1377
01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:31.130
Right. Selling crack and shot in the tet,

1378
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:34.260
no one would ever ask you to live that life again, but you,

1379
01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:35.180
you wouldn't change it.

1380
01:21:36.190 --> 01:21:40.450
<v 2>I don't know Joe. I mean it made me who I am, but I always,</v>

1381
01:21:40.451 --> 01:21:44.620
I look at life like this. Um, I think I would, you know,

1382
01:21:44.621 --> 01:21:47.320
everybody couldn't have dealt with the stuff that I dealt with it.

1383
01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.350
Like I dealt with it like some people commit suicide completely when people are

1384
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.930
always depressed, you know, I kinda feel like I was a chosen one.

1385
01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:00.340
God take you through something so it can, you know, to make other people see,

1386
01:22:00.341 --> 01:22:01.174
maybe I was poor,

1387
01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.720
maybe I took burden that everybody else was going through in life and now I was

1388
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:08.890
just chosen one. Then I bring it out and make it funny.

1389
01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:13.540
So I'm here to make people let, let people know it's okay. Yeah, it's okay.

1390
01:22:13.541 --> 01:22:16.270
It's not about how you start as about how you finish. Right.

1391
01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:20.350
I don't dwell on shit. I don't have control over. I can't change the pages.

1392
01:22:20.650 --> 01:22:25.420
But Liz left today and I tell people every night on stage when you can laugh

1393
01:22:25.421 --> 01:22:27.670
about it, you got control of it.

1394
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:32.110
That's a powerful thing to be able to look at your life like that and just take

1395
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:35.860
ownership. Yeah. You know, like my first kid's father, he hates me.

1396
01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:38.290
He fucking hates me. You know why?

1397
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.800
Because I'm not the little girl rabbit anymore that he had control of that he

1398
01:22:41.801 --> 01:22:43.150
beat any, you know,

1399
01:22:43.151 --> 01:22:47.260
I was a little girl searching for love in this whole situation.

1400
01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:51.550
I learned to love myself. Joe, you still in touch with him? Yeah. Talk to him.

1401
01:22:51.551 --> 01:22:54.470
He be cussing me out. He's like, he's not in jail. Yeah,

1402
01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:58.270
that's what I be telling the child. Molest a child molester.

1403
01:22:58.870 --> 01:23:02.980
I'm not a [inaudible]. I remember when I needed closure and, um, I was,

1404
01:23:02.981 --> 01:23:05.330
I was out here in La and I'm, I'll,

1405
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:08.530
I'm starting to tell these stories about my life and I just wanted him to

1406
01:23:08.531 --> 01:23:12.250
apologize for, you know, he shot him in the back of the head, fucking beat me

1407
01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.080
crazy. So I wanted him to apologize and my hope was like,

1408
01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:19.750
why do you need him to apologize? I just want to, he,

1409
01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.490
I just want to tell you rabbit, I'm sorry. So I call him up and I said, Daryl,

1410
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:29.160
we started talking. Oh Shit. I said his name. Oh, where are you going? Jail.

1411
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:36.550
So I call him and to apologize. And He, I said, I said,

1412
01:23:36.551 --> 01:23:39.250
how can you fuck a 12 year old and you grown and you mayor,

1413
01:23:39.310 --> 01:23:42.580
you know what he said? He said, your mind and body wasn't 12.

1414
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.070
And then she kicked me in my fucking chest,

1415
01:23:45.071 --> 01:23:49.210
like a horse and I boohoo and debt day Joe,

1416
01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:53.890
I decided I was no longer going to ask him to ask for him to, you know,

1417
01:23:53.891 --> 01:23:58.480
to ask me to forgive him. I decided to forgive him. I forgave my momma.

1418
01:23:58.570 --> 01:24:03.570
I forgave my mama boyfriend and everybody else that stepped on me and I said,

1419
01:24:03.611 --> 01:24:07.480
no longer am I'm ever going to want to come gonna come. I know.

1420
01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.530
I said from that day on, I'm never gonna ask Y'all for forget.

1421
01:24:12.531 --> 01:24:14.160
I'm never going to ask you again. Um,

1422
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.650
I decided to forgive you and I that day I forgave him,

1423
01:24:17.651 --> 01:24:21.790
my mom and her boyfriend and everybody else that ever violated me because there

1424
01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:25.690
was so many other people that I don't still don't talk about, but I forgave him.

1425
01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.200
That's a very powerful thing and I'm happy and very powerful things.

1426
01:24:29.201 --> 01:24:31.690
You can forgive people who've done terrible things to you and you haven't done

1427
01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:36.470
shit to them. Yeah. The people that want them to apologize, they chased them,

1428
01:24:36.610 --> 01:24:40.000
they checked back the, you're eating yourself up, you eating yourself.

1429
01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:43.840
And I was eating myself up cause I just wanted him to say I'm sorry, rabbit.

1430
01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:48.490
And he never said it. Well, once he told you that when you were 12, your mind,

1431
01:24:48.491 --> 01:24:51.040
your body weren't young. You got to realize you're talking to him.

1432
01:24:51.041 --> 01:24:54.730
Fucking idiot. Idiot. And I called my husband and I was crying. He was like,

1433
01:24:54.731 --> 01:24:57.940
pat, why you keep, I said, I just want him to ask me too.

1434
01:24:58.150 --> 01:25:01.720
I just want him to say he, sorry, this all I want him to say. And he was like,

1435
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.823
Pat, why?

1436
01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:06.700
And I remember hanging up the phone and I got on my knees and I rarely get on my

1437
01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:09.360
knees. Joe and I got vertical. So I don't get [inaudible]

1438
01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.770
if you know what I'm talking about. So I just asked for forgiveness. I mean,

1439
01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:19.180
I forgave him that day. I forgave him and my Mama because of him, my mom and,

1440
01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:20.170
and her boyfriend,

1441
01:25:20.171 --> 01:25:24.130
John is a three of the people that I hated the most because she didn't protect

1442
01:25:24.131 --> 01:25:28.210
me. And when we once tried to tell her that her boyfriend was doing it to us,

1443
01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.920
you know, he wouldn't listen.

1444
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:32.350
She wouldn't listen because this man was providing,

1445
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:36.760
it was the only time in my life that we didn't get evicted because he was

1446
01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:38.740
touching me and my sister. He was always saying, well,

1447
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:42.160
if you tell your Mama y'all gonna get put out, y'all ain't gonna have no food.

1448
01:25:42.161 --> 01:25:45.850
So we always thought we was happen. We always thought we was happened.

1449
01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:51.670
So you know what? I forgave him and you know they was, they was already dead,

1450
01:25:51.671 --> 01:25:54.010
but he's still alive. He's still,

1451
01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:56.800
my kid's father is still alive and you wanna know something crazy.

1452
01:25:56.801 --> 01:25:59.170
And I never told anybody this. So people, I was like,

1453
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.020
why you don't go to your Mama grave site? You know, a lot of people are like,

1454
01:26:02.021 --> 01:26:04.250
I don't like fucking with the dead. I figured they want to raise,

1455
01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:06.410
<v 1>leave him the fuck alone. They don't want to hear about the lovely,</v>

1456
01:26:06.810 --> 01:26:09.590
the lovely shit. I don't go to her grave y'all,

1457
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:12.350
because that motherfucker put herself next to her.

1458
01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:14.723
<v 4>Wow.</v>

1459
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:18.330
<v 1>Barrett himself next to my Mama. So I said, fuck both of you.</v>

1460
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:21.870

1461
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:23.620
<v 4>Wow.</v>

1462
01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:25.510
<v 1>Last time I was there before he died,</v>

1463
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:29.620
I was there cleaning off some ants on top of a gray. And you know, I'm young,

1464
01:26:29.621 --> 01:26:30.454
I'm probably,

1465
01:26:30.670 --> 01:26:34.840

1468
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:46.690

1469
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:52.420
<v 1>Oh my God, I haven't been back. Jealous.</v>

1470
01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:55.730
I haven't been back. No need to go back. I won't go back.

1471
01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:59.750
He's next to so he wanted their controls or you got it. Fuck them.

1472
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:00.890
I'm never going back.

1473
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:09.590
<v 4>God Damn. Ms Pat, everything. Every time I talked to you,</v>

1474
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:10.940
I think I've heard it all.

1475
01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:15.850
<v 1>Oh Shit. Joe, we needed, give me some oligos wine.</v>

1476
01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:20.610

1478
01:27:23.481 --> 01:27:26.620
I drink a glass a day and I tell you a million fucking stories.

1479
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:28.370
I was telling a story.

1480
01:27:28.371 --> 01:27:32.110
I just started writing a bit about how my mama uses was a crap shooter and

1481
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:33.261
propose she shoot the dice.

1482
01:27:33.261 --> 01:27:36.140
She would see a lot of four or five kids and she would rub them on our vagina

1483
01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.390
upon our tee. That was good. Look for her.

1484
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:46.160
She would rub the dice on your vagina probably dies or you pussy for good luck.

1485
01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:52.130
[inaudible] you probably fat. Oh my God.

1486
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:53.840
What the fuck?

1487
01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:58.230
I don't want to tell the whole story cause I just wrote a beat about it.

1488
01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.210
So y'all wake up is the fucking bitch. It's fucking hilarious.

1489
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:04.130
You're not going to do it tonight? No, I'm not going to do it at night.

1490
01:28:04.131 --> 01:28:05.860
It's not all the way down, but my boy,

1491
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:09.590
when I got my friends like pay you gotta be like I said, I called my brother.

1492
01:28:09.591 --> 01:28:12.170
I said both. That's my oldest brother. The biracial. Right?

1493
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:16.050
We say my mom say again, same day, but didn't mother got good hails so we know.

1494
01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:21.980
We know that they didn't know Jerry Carolyn. So I say, boy,

1495
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.520

<v 4>Oh my God, I can't breathe. Oh. Oh.</v>

1501
01:28:50.730 --> 01:28:55.200
Did I fuck up? Oh my God. I'm crying. I can't breathe.

1502
01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:57.040
Holy Shit.

1503
01:28:57.730 --> 01:29:01.470
God Damn is Pat [inaudible] and then now still laugh.

1504
01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.920

1505
01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.540
You make people laugh. You want the funniest people I've ever met. Wow.

1506
01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:11.700
Thank you Joan. To fact,

1507
01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:17.960
fuck what a life you had. God dammit. I been,

1508
01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:21.600
it's so hard to listen to as a person who has kids. You know?

1509
01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.530
It's so hard to think about you being a little girl having to go through that

1510
01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:26.750
and you know what? Yeah, it

1511
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:30.210
<v 2>used to people say, Oh, pay, you should get counseling. But honestly,</v>

1512
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.800
comedy has been my counseling because it is a form of counseling for sure.

1513
01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:38.190
I was able to share with shit that I had. I was anger about,

1514
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:42.180
I'm no longer angry and making people laugh naked. I'm fucking crying.

1515
01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.440
I'm literally crying. Yeah.

1516
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:53.040
And you know, then you meet so many people who can have a story like you people.

1517
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:55.980
I was like, oh, ms pet, you're telling my story. Thank you so much.

1518
01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.750
I had a black lady tell me one time, she was like,

1519
01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:01.580
I had my baby at 13 how can you talk about that? I said,

1520
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:06.770
cause bitch I'm happy and my child didn't have the life that I had you so I'm

1521
01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:10.310
happy. You know what I only thing I asked for my keys. I see.

1522
01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:14.190
I asked you college ain't for everybody so I'm not going to force college on

1523
01:30:14.191 --> 01:30:19.080
you, but what you do owe me is a high school diploma and you do owe me to prom

1524
01:30:19.081 --> 01:30:21.420
because I didn't have an opportunity to do none of that shit.

1525
01:30:21.660 --> 01:30:24.030
So all of them go to the per alum went to the prompt.

1526
01:30:24.090 --> 01:30:27.390
I pick that outfit and everyone of them graduated from high school.

1527
01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:30.780
You know my daughter was the first one in three generation that graduated high

1528
01:30:30.781 --> 01:30:33.720
school in the first one to ever go to college. Then she didn't finish.

1529
01:30:33.721 --> 01:30:37.740
But Hey man did my, my youngest daughter just finished criminal justice.

1530
01:30:37.741 --> 01:30:41.210
She have associate's degree and you know, every time they do what they like,

1531
01:30:41.250 --> 01:30:43.920
I'm going to the prom for you. They graduated high school,

1532
01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:46.660
they gave me the high school diploma. My daughter was like, oh,

1533
01:30:47.010 --> 01:30:49.560
well I just graduated from college. You hit go your degree.

1534
01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.230
I was like, Yo Colatti or what? On fucking ears.

1535
01:30:56.250 --> 01:31:00.080
You know what I'm talking about? Straight A's. Yes. Melodic. Yeah.

1536
01:31:00.081 --> 01:31:04.800
That's what she was. Um, she didn't, she didn't go to her graduation. She's,

1537
01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:08.020
she, she didn't want to go on to graduate. So she booked it. She,

1538
01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.980
she had two options. So she booked it on a day. I was out of town,

1539
01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.340
but she grew up, she's my first child. I graduated college and I look back,

1540
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:19.580
here I am with an eighth grade education or the GED and I was able to keep my

1541
01:31:19.681 --> 01:31:24.360
keys from going on the road that I went down. And you know, most, most,

1542
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:27.180
most kids try to make their parents proud.

1543
01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:32.490
I try to make my kids proud to let them know it's not about how you start,

1544
01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:34.710
it's about how you finish. You know, I had to,

1545
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:37.830
I had to meet to my oldest daughter and I said,

1546
01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:39.990
George Will Front House school and I, you know,

1547
01:31:39.991 --> 01:31:41.580
I had to wake her up at one time and I said,

1548
01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:46.500
I want to apologize for being such a horrible mom in the beginning,

1549
01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:51.690
but I was fucking 14 you know, she was in housing with a, his shoot at it.

1550
01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:56.430
She saw me sell drugs in front of her school as that made a lot of fucking

1551
01:31:56.431 --> 01:31:57.264
mistakes.

1552
01:31:57.330 --> 01:32:02.330
But I'm sorry because I did what everybody else was doing in my community trying

1553
01:32:03.371 --> 01:32:04.204
to survive.

1554
01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:08.140
And that was one of the hardest thing as a pair because a lot of parents hide,

1555
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:12.820
you know, their past when they kid. But I literally went to my daughter and I,

1556
01:32:12.821 --> 01:32:16.660
you know, cause she hated me, Jo. She fucking hated me. She's like,

1557
01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:19.050
why do you have to sell drawers in front of my school? I was like,

1558
01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.290
cause I was here first bitch.

1559
01:32:28.890 --> 01:32:33.310
But you know, I think, you know, we have, we have a relationship now,

1560
01:32:33.670 --> 01:32:37.720
you know, and then I went off to jail and I missed her going to kindergarten.

1561
01:32:37.721 --> 01:32:40.810
And then I grew up in a community where if you was gay,

1562
01:32:40.811 --> 01:32:43.200
something was wrong with you. And you know, my daughter, she gets fuck,

1563
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:47.920
he eat everything in Atlanta. She packed man with the Pussy.

1564
01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:55.120
So, you know, I had to,

1565
01:32:55.121 --> 01:32:58.330
I had to deal with that too because she ran off for awhile when she,

1566
01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.120
when she wouldn't, you know, when I, she didn't want to tell me she was gay.

1567
01:33:01.121 --> 01:33:03.880
Cause I mean I had this thing where if you gave with some roach,

1568
01:33:03.881 --> 01:33:07.510
I fucking hated gay women. And I, I used to say this on stage,

1569
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:12.160
when I say white men, when you, when you, when you hate N****s as a good chance,

1570
01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:14.980
your white daughter gonna come home with a big Dick Nagle

1571
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:19.230
and open your fucked.

1572
01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:23.410
My daughter came home and she was gay and it opened my fucking world to the gay

1573
01:33:23.411 --> 01:33:26.620
community. And now like I remember when my daughter came out and somebody,

1574
01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:29.470
I was like, you must be ashamed that your daughter's guessed on bitch,

1575
01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:30.310
your daughter as a whole.

1576
01:33:30.311 --> 01:33:32.530
So your daughter going to take way more dicks than my daughter do.

1577
01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:36.970
Then an immediate, I love my daughter,

1578
01:33:36.971 --> 01:33:40.780
I love all of my kids and [inaudible] and I told Ashley, that's her name.

1579
01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:44.740
I said, it's not about, I had to learn, it's not about your sexuality. Do what?

1580
01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:49.660
Make you happy and I will support you to the end as long as you happy because

1581
01:33:49.661 --> 01:33:53.290
you saw your daddy stop my face and shoot me and mistreat me.

1582
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.800
So if we were to do what makes you happy, just don't do drugs, bitch,

1583
01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.900
but do what? Make you happy. What, what made you not like gay women before that?

1584
01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:04.530
Cause I was raised in the black community. If you was gay, you know,

1585
01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:08.380
we're the biggest motherfucker, black people who would throw up a gay child,

1586
01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.410
I'll tell you something wrong, which we talked to hate, you know,

1587
01:34:11.411 --> 01:34:15.250
especially that old school, black community. That's why. So you know people,

1588
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:18.850
you know, I don't know Joe. That's just how we was raised.

1589
01:34:18.851 --> 01:34:22.960
The black church drilling in your head, you know, if you gay,

1590
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:24.041
you're going to hell.

1591
01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:27.730
And you know what happens with gay people in the black community,

1592
01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:30.970
a lot of them leave and never come back back in the day.

1593
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:35.500
A lot of them wait til eight you know, they fucking mental problems.

1594
01:34:35.501 --> 01:34:40.150
I don't know. Like I didn't, I don't remember gay uncle anybody.

1595
01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:44.800
So, but you know, I know we as a black community, you have to hide.

1596
01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:49.110
You had to hide back in those days. So I was taught if he was gay,

1597
01:34:49.410 --> 01:34:51.280
it w you was, it was something wrong with you.

1598
01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.980
And when my daughter came out to be gay,

1599
01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:56.920
it opened my fucking world up and I was like,

1600
01:34:56.930 --> 01:35:01.550
do I judge my daughter over sexuality or do I love my child because this is my

1601
01:35:01.551 --> 01:35:04.940
fucking child. And I remember not seeing her for three years.

1602
01:35:04.941 --> 01:35:06.610
She just ran and she had dropped out of college.

1603
01:35:06.630 --> 01:35:08.510
She has gone from state to state them, they're homeless.

1604
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:13.040
A lot of them be homeless. And I said, look Ashley. I said,

1605
01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:17.900
are you gay? I just want to hear it for myself. She was like, yes Ma'am as well.

1606
01:35:17.901 --> 01:35:19.540
Come on home you could eat puts in Atlanta. Yeah

1607
01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:23.720
<v 1>and my child came home</v>

1608
01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:26.650
<v 2>and we built a relationship and I hadn't,</v>

1609
01:35:26.651 --> 01:35:30.130
you know I was wrong out cause she heard how I talked about gay people and how

1610
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:32.470
it's almost like when you hear your boy, if you,

1611
01:35:32.471 --> 01:35:34.990
if you want to hear your parents, I was N***a, N***a, N***a, N***a, N***a.

1612
01:35:35.170 --> 01:35:38.770
Then you want to know wise are you talking about N***a you get curious and you

1613
01:35:38.771 --> 01:35:41.350
go outside and like they, it ain't what you think it is.

1614
01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:43.990
So when she came out and you know she,

1615
01:35:43.991 --> 01:35:46.840
when she came out he opened my world and I'm happy.

1616
01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:50.080
I'm happy for my baby and I tell her about my daughter would eat this shit,

1617
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:51.830
are you, she would dick you down. What's Grandpa?

1618
01:35:56.350 --> 01:36:00.220
But she happy Joe and this what is all about, you know, all you can ask this,

1619
01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:03.280
all I asked is that she get a bitch that treat her right.

1620
01:36:03.610 --> 01:36:07.930
That she's a whole rent now. But you know, new girl every six months.

1621
01:36:07.931 --> 01:36:10.450
What does new girl she got? She been sticking a little for a long while.

1622
01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:14.260
I liked the last girlfriend who you saw bigfoot, but she got rid of big foot,

1623
01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:17.700
big foot. If she was a boy, she would play professional baseball.

1624
01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.300
<v 1>How big are a few big old beach,</v>

1625

1626
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:28.280

You took a terrible beginning and turned it into an amazing present.

1631

But you're great at it. You know,

1639
01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:12.200
<v 3>it's not just that you had a hard life,</v>

1640
01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:16.220
you had a hard life and you worked hard to become a great comic.

1641
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:20.480
<v 2>Well, I had a hard life and I wanted to say my key is in the beginning,</v>

1642
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:24.140
I just didn't want my kids to go through what I went through.

1643
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:25.760
So that was the biggest fire. I was like,

I'm sorry y'all ain't gonna do that to my children.

1646
01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:34.580
Why do you not going to jail? You're not going to drop out. You know? I just,

1647
01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.580
I just wanted my kids to have shit that I never had,

1648
01:37:38.210 --> 01:37:41.360
which was a life, you know? And then, and then, you know,

1649
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:45.650
one thing in my book is about, Ah, I was searching for something.

1650
01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:50.210
I wanted a family. I never had a family. I never felt love. Like I feel today,

1651
01:37:50.690 --> 01:37:54.050
you know, I got a family. I go home to a husband and see me two times a week,

1652
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:56.910

1655

1658
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:19.800

1659
01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:21.120
but they had a fucking ball.

1660
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:24.420
It was 22 of us and we was dead as a family and that's all.

1661
01:38:24.421 --> 01:38:27.420
I don't care to go when I go take him to the lake or take him.

1662
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:31.320
I don't care to participate. I just want to know. I just look at them and say,

1663
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:35.640
Oh my God, I get what I fought for my whole fucking life.

Our family to be loved, and I'm loved Joe. That's beautiful.

1665
01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:44.100
Then that's all I ever wanted. I don't give a fuck about a fancy call.
