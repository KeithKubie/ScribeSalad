00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first thing we do is we notice it's a one-sided test--that is, if this drug was even better

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
than advertised we're not really that concerned, to be honest.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then we graph the binomial just like before.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here are the outcomes and here are the probabilities.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Obviously, 8 is the most likely outcome, assuming the null hypothesis is correct.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The critical region is not defined from the left side,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which is fewer people are healthy and the treatment doesn't work as well as advertised.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's add up until we reach 0.05, which is right over here.

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The sum happens to be 0.032, which is below 5%. So 5 is the correct answer over here.
