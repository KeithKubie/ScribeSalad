I'm concerned yes it's impossible to
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.429
I'm concerned yes it's impossible to
predict I mean if you think about it who

that doing Radio Astronomy would lead to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
that doing Radio Astronomy would lead to
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.360
that doing Radio Astronomy would lead to
an experiment that produced a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
an experiment that produced a
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299

interesting this is a puzzle let's just

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
interesting this is a puzzle let's just
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219
interesting this is a puzzle let's just
follow it and see where it leads and it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
follow it and see where it leads and it
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.730
follow it and see where it leads and it
leads to totally unexpected places by

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
leads to totally unexpected places by
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.780
leads to totally unexpected places by
and large and so I that's my science

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
and large and so I that's my science
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.600
and large and so I that's my science
that's what I see to being better at

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
that's what I see to being better at
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.550
that's what I see to being better at
than other things and I don't really

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
than other things and I don't really
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.800
than other things and I don't really
have a feeling other than to make some

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
have a feeling other than to make some
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.440
have a feeling other than to make some
small breakthrough which interests me

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
small breakthrough which interests me
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.520
small breakthrough which interests me
and so I'm not good at answering

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530
and so I'm not good at answering
 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.649
and so I'm not good at answering
foretelling the future but then not many

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
foretelling the future but then not many
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.910
foretelling the future but then not many
people are actually yeah okay after you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
people are actually yeah okay after you
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.340
people are actually yeah okay after you
you have the personal satisfaction of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
you have the personal satisfaction of
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.139
you have the personal satisfaction of
having won the Nobel Prize what do you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
having won the Nobel Prize what do you
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.850
having won the Nobel Prize what do you
think do you have any other personal

well the Nobel Prize is the big surprise

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360
well the Nobel Prize is the big surprise
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.709
well the Nobel Prize is the big surprise
to me I mean if someone had sent in 1984

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719
to me I mean if someone had sent in 1984
 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.050
to me I mean if someone had sent in 1984
before we discovered c60 then I was

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
before we discovered c60 then I was
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.700
before we discovered c60 then I was
going to win the Nobel Prize I said you

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
going to win the Nobel Prize I said you
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.770
going to win the Nobel Prize I said you
know pull the other one because I I know

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780
know pull the other one because I I know
 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.940

fantastically brilliant scientists but I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
fantastically brilliant scientists but I
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.550
fantastically brilliant scientists but I
I'm I'm good good at what I do and have

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
I'm I'm good good at what I do and have
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.870

been very fortunate to have chosen

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880
been very fortunate to have chosen
 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.180
been very fortunate to have chosen
unknowingly really some very nice topics

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
unknowingly really some very nice topics
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.400
unknowingly really some very nice topics
and the first thing I was satisfied with

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
and the first thing I was satisfied with
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.280
and the first thing I was satisfied with
and gave me most satisfaction in sight

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
and gave me most satisfaction in sight
 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.320
and gave me most satisfaction in sight
in fact more subtle in satisfaction than

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
in fact more subtle in satisfaction than
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.070
in fact more subtle in satisfaction than
c62 discovery of c60 was making the

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080
c62 discovery of c60 was making the
 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.809
c62 discovery of c60 was making the
first carbon phosphorus double bond we

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819
first carbon phosphorus double bond we
 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.520
first carbon phosphorus double bond we
made the phosphorous phosphorous all

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530
made the phosphorous phosphorous all
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.729
made the phosphorous phosphorous all
keynes and showed how phosphor alkynes

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739
keynes and showed how phosphor alkynes
 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.150
keynes and showed how phosphor alkynes
could be made and we did that too using

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160
could be made and we did that too using
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160
could be made and we did that too using
spectroscopic technique so a lot of

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
spectroscopic technique so a lot of
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.789
spectroscopic technique so a lot of
people are not really familiar with that

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799
people are not really familiar with that
 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.190
people are not really familiar with that
it was my group that was involved with

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
it was my group that was involved with
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.690
it was my group that was involved with
that together with John Nixon and a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
that together with John Nixon and a
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.960
that together with John Nixon and a
colleague at Sussex and then the radio

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
colleague at Sussex and then the radio
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.850

astronomy was really exciting I mean the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860
astronomy was really exciting I mean the
 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.559
astronomy was really exciting I mean the
most exciting day of my life and

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569
most exciting day of my life and
 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.020
most exciting day of my life and
societies was that is when we detected

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030
societies was that is when we detected
 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.289
societies was that is when we detected
hc7 and a seven carbon atom molecule on

the radio telescope in our Concord Park
 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.690
the radio telescope in our Concord Park
in Canada and of course c60 was

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
in Canada and of course c60 was
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.550
in Canada and of course c60 was
incredibly exciting after we knew

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560
incredibly exciting after we knew
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.539
incredibly exciting after we knew
realize what it might be then of course

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549
realize what it might be then of course
 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.110
realize what it might be then of course
it has such a paradigm shifting molecule

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120
it has such a paradigm shifting molecule
 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.509
it has such a paradigm shifting molecule
you know at the end of the 20th century

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519
you know at the end of the 20th century
 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.360
you know at the end of the 20th century
we discovered the third form of carbon

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
we discovered the third form of carbon
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.879
we discovered the third form of carbon
and molecule been around old since time

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889
and molecule been around old since time
 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.960
and molecule been around old since time
immemorial so that was very satisfying

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
immemorial so that was very satisfying
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.830
immemorial so that was very satisfying
of course then maybe would win the Nobel

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840
of course then maybe would win the Nobel
 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.129
of course then maybe would win the Nobel
Prize

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139
Prize
 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.410
Prize
that was seemed a possibility and of

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420
that was seemed a possibility and of
 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.349
that was seemed a possibility and of
course it's it's it's very nice to win

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359
course it's it's it's very nice to win
 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.720
course it's it's it's very nice to win
that award and that is satisfying - it's

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730
that award and that is satisfying - it's
 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.660
that award and that is satisfying - it's
a bit odd because I didn't go into

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670
a bit odd because I didn't go into
 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.599
a bit odd because I didn't go into
science to win any prizes it was for me

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609
science to win any prizes it was for me
 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.569
science to win any prizes it was for me
a job and my main passion to some extent

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579
a job and my main passion to some extent
 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.930

an emotion where I like as interesting

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940
an emotion where I like as interesting
 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.569
an emotion where I like as interesting
for me and it's graphic art and design

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579
for me and it's graphic art and design
 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.779
for me and it's graphic art and design
so in a sense I would like to do more of

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789
so in a sense I would like to do more of
 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.000
so in a sense I would like to do more of
that but the Nobel Prize has launched

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010
that but the Nobel Prize has launched
 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.480
that but the Nobel Prize has launched
me into other areas where I'm spending

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490
me into other areas where I'm spending
 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.450

time I'll shoot these questions and I do

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460
time I'll shoot these questions and I do
 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.450
time I'll shoot these questions and I do
a lot of that and I get questions from

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460
a lot of that and I get questions from
 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.570
a lot of that and I get questions from
people or every day from young people

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580
people or every day from young people
 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.880
people or every day from young people
which I respond to from one or two

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890
which I respond to from one or two
 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.550
which I respond to from one or two
people who and I do respond to them

it should be possible to produce a
 

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:45.680
it should be possible to produce a
molecular computer which maybe is 10 to

molecular computer which maybe is 10 to
 

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.840
molecular computer which maybe is 10 to
100 times smaller and one dimension may

100 times smaller and one dimension may

be 10,000 times smaller in two

be 10,000 times smaller in two
 

00:19:51.749 --> 00:19:53.180
be 10,000 times smaller in two
dimensions and a million times smaller

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:53.190
dimensions and a million times smaller
 

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:57.379
dimensions and a million times smaller
in three dimensions but we we don't know

00:19:57.379 --> 00:19:57.389
in three dimensions but we we don't know
 

00:19:57.389 --> 00:19:59.720
in three dimensions but we we don't know
how to do that yet but this should be

00:19:59.720 --> 00:19:59.730
how to do that yet but this should be
 

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.879
how to do that yet but this should be
possible and but even if we make the

00:20:04.879 --> 00:20:04.889
possible and but even if we make the
 

00:20:04.889 --> 00:20:07.759
possible and but even if we make the
major technical breakthrough in the

major technical breakthrough in the
 

00:20:07.769 --> 00:20:09.919

have to go through all the other aspects
 

00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:15.769
have to go through all the other aspects
which are involved so I say you make a

which are involved so I say you make a
 

00:20:15.779 --> 00:20:19.609

people and that's where the conflict
lies now there are some scientists who

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380
lies now there are some scientists who
 

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:55.070
lies now there are some scientists who
do believe in God that God and but

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080
do believe in God that God and but
 

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.270
do believe in God that God and but
they're very small number of good

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:56.280
they're very small number of good
 

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.840
they're very small number of good
scientists I mean it's less than 10% so

00:28:59.840 --> 00:28:59.850
scientists I mean it's less than 10% so
 

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.090
scientists I mean it's less than 10% so
if we're talking about statistics and I

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100
if we're talking about statistics and I
 

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.580
if we're talking about statistics and I
think that's the case and there is a

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:04.590
think that's the case and there is a
 

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.470
think that's the case and there is a
very small number and I don't know very

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480
very small number and I don't know very
 

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.260
very small number and I don't know very
many scientists actually I personally

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:09.270
many scientists actually I personally
 

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:11.540
many scientists actually I personally
know very few scientists who I mean they

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:11.550
know very few scientists who I mean they
 

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.870
know very few scientists who I mean they
do know some now that doesn't mean I

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880
do know some now that doesn't mean I
 

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.810
do know some now that doesn't mean I
don't I'm not aware of the value of

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820
don't I'm not aware of the value of
 

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.430
don't I'm not aware of the value of
religion to individual people in a

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440
religion to individual people in a
 

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.419
religion to individual people in a
personal level but the conflict is a

00:29:23.419 --> 00:29:23.429
personal level but the conflict is a
 

00:29:23.429 --> 00:29:27.020
personal level but the conflict is a
serious one in the ethical sense because

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:27.030
serious one in the ethical sense because
 

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.690
serious one in the ethical sense because
if you accept as I do my contention that

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:31.700
if you accept as I do my contention that
 

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.850
if you accept as I do my contention that
science is fundamentally this basically

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860
science is fundamentally this basically
 

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.400
science is fundamentally this basically
pare down level about how we determine

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:37.410
pare down level about how we determine
 

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.280
pare down level about how we determine
what is true then you see there's an

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:40.290
what is true then you see there's an
 

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:43.220
what is true then you see there's an
ethical issue in teaching schools and

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:43.230
ethical issue in teaching schools and
 

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.340
ethical issue in teaching schools and

everything else now for those scientists

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:49.830
everything else now for those scientists
 

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.460
everything else now for those scientists
who are religious and to say very few

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:52.470
who are religious and to say very few
 

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:56.240
who are religious and to say very few
good scientists and whatever that means

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.250
good scientists and whatever that means
 

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.070
good scientists and whatever that means
but they cut off the little money I

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080
but they cut off the little money I
 

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.150
but they cut off the little money I
think they have to have some sort of

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:01.160
think they have to have some sort of
 

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.710
think they have to have some sort of
intellectual schizophrenia where they

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720
intellectual schizophrenia where they
 

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.140
intellectual schizophrenia where they
cut off here this is where evidence base

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:06.150
cut off here this is where evidence base
 

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.290
cut off here this is where evidence base
and here's what I believe and I accept

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:09.300
and here's what I believe and I accept
 

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.270
and here's what I believe and I accept
this but the interesting thing is that

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:11.280
this but the interesting thing is that
 

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.220
this but the interesting thing is that
by and large of all but by and large

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:13.230
by and large of all but by and large
 

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.780
by and large of all but by and large
these people believe

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:14.790
these people believe
 

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.080
these people believe
in the Gulf they were brought up in well

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:18.090
in the Gulf they were brought up in well
 

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.180
in the Gulf they were brought up in well
they just had to rot up in this religion

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:20.190
they just had to rot up in this religion
 

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.570
they just had to rot up in this religion
or that religion and there's an

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580
or that religion and there's an
 

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.080
or that religion and there's an
irrationality which doesn't make sense

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:27.090
irrationality which doesn't make sense
 

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:30.740
irrationality which doesn't make sense
and but for many people it's not very

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:30.750
and but for many people it's not very
 

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:34.549
and but for many people it's not very
nice to believe that there is no god

00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559
nice to believe that there is no god
 

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:36.350
nice to believe that there is no god
there's no afterlife there's no mystical

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360
there's no afterlife there's no mystical
 

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.180
there's no afterlife there's no mystical
creator there's no Supreme Being

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:38.190
creator there's no Supreme Being
 

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.640
creator there's no Supreme Being
whatever that means after all you know

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:40.650
whatever that means after all you know
 

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.440
whatever that means after all you know
what is a Supreme Being I mean you know

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:42.450
what is a Supreme Being I mean you know
 

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.780
what is a Supreme Being I mean you know
I can't even define it so I can't be

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:44.790
I can't even define it so I can't be
 

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.940
I can't even define it so I can't be
agnostic about a Supreme Being that had

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:46.950
agnostic about a Supreme Being that had
 

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.400
agnostic about a Supreme Being that had
no idea how to define it's done the

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:49.410
no idea how to define it's done the
 

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.260

fluid not nothing you can say can make

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:51.270
fluid not nothing you can say can make
 

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.190
fluid not nothing you can say can make
sense on this issue and so I'm quite

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200
sense on this issue and so I'm quite
 

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.970
sense on this issue and so I'm quite
comfortable with this obviously I think

00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980
comfortable with this obviously I think
 

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:03.530

I've studied the interaction of

I've studied the interaction of

I've studied the interaction of
radiation with matter and by looking at

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920
radiation with matter and by looking at
 

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.690
radiation with matter and by looking at
the patterns in the spectrum and by

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:43.700
the patterns in the spectrum and by
 

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.630
the patterns in the spectrum and by
analyzing them we can gently come to a

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640
analyzing them we can gently come to a
 

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.660
analyzing them we can gently come to a
conclusion about the structure of the

molecule so that the bond lengths of
 

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.860
molecule so that the bond lengths of
this length and and I understand the

this length and and I understand the
 

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.340
this length and and I understand the
motion of these things and then but in a

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:57.350
motion of these things and then but in a
 

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.820
motion of these things and then but in a
sense it's a bit of an abstract world

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:00.830
sense it's a bit of an abstract world
 

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:06.030
sense it's a bit of an abstract world
and by looking at these spectra and

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040
and by looking at these spectra and
 

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.440
and by looking at these spectra and
analyzing the data and coming up with

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:08.450
analyzing the data and coming up with
 

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:12.070
analyzing the data and coming up with
bond lengths between atoms in molecules

sort of forget that it's a quantum

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920
sort of forget that it's a quantum
 

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.440
sort of forget that it's a quantum

picture and that you you think of it in
 

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:29.800
picture and that you you think of it in
terms of a physical object but you know

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:29.810
terms of a physical object but you know
 

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.540
terms of a physical object but you know
that it's oscillating and it has these

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:31.550
that it's oscillating and it has these
 

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:36.190
that it's oscillating and it has these
models so somehow you are locked into a

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200
models so somehow you are locked into a
 

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:42.780
models so somehow you are locked into a
classical picture of the molecular world

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:51.270
 
which is a little bit suspect I think

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280
which is a little bit suspect I think
 

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.500
which is a little bit suspect I think
because that molecular picture doesn't

because that molecular picture doesn't
 

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.080

questions I'm asked this probably
 

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.160

works and so anything that you do that

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:05.550
works and so anything that you do that
 

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:12.230
works and so anything that you do that
you see something that no one else's

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240
you see something that no one else's
 

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.630
you see something that no one else's
looked at and there's something happens

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640
looked at and there's something happens
 

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:21.260

that you find puzzling and then you

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:21.270
that you find puzzling and then you
 

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:24.930

disbarred design some more experiments

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:24.940
disbarred design some more experiments

that's research and then you can go on

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:31.570
that's research and then you can go on
 

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.310
that's research and then you can go on
to research and development and say well

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320
to research and development and say well
 

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:39.350

how can that research have applications

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:39.360
how can that research have applications
 

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.560
how can that research have applications
so research is very much something

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:43.570
so research is very much something
 

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.910
so research is very much something

what I did one time I took a toy I got a
Christmas parcel it broke it and my

there's a bit of a tough going it was
 

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:22.370
there's a bit of a tough going it was
good and but it does require curiosity I

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380
good and but it does require curiosity I

think one problem today is that research
 

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:31.620
think one problem today is that research
is quite often very expensive and people

is quite often very expensive and people
 

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.280
is quite often very expensive and people
want to decide ahead of time whether the

want to decide ahead of time whether the
 

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:37.680
want to decide ahead of time whether the
research is worthwhile I mean you know

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:37.690
research is worthwhile I mean you know
 

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.840
research is worthwhile I mean you know
you have to write a research proposal

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:39.850
you have to write a research proposal
 

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.360
you have to write a research proposal
and some group of people as some who

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:53.250
funding and by and large they're wrong
probably most of the time because I

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:53.260
probably most of the time because I
 

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.980
probably most of the time because I
suspect the most important research is

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:55.990

is worth doing hasn't been done and
we'll uncover of the unexpected so I

we'll uncover of the unexpected so I

we'll uncover of the unexpected so I
don't know whether that's a definition

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:09.550
don't know whether that's a definition
 

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.550
don't know whether that's a definition
but there was there's a definition bound

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:11.560
but there was there's a definition bound
 

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.850
but there was there's a definition bound
