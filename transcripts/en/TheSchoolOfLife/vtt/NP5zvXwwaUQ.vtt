00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.220
Anyone seeking to lay claim to being a normal and good person

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.220
is nowadays expected to be very interested in equality, mutual respect, gentleness and consideration.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.340
That’s what makes it so surprising to stumble upon people who (either privately or within couples)

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:27.200
are really very curious about sexual activities that run directly counter to all civilised ideas of kindly and good behaviour.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.600
These activities might be grouped together under the term ‘defilement’,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:41.560
for they involve – to a greater or lesser degree, and with both genders taking part – an enthusiastic desire to denigrate and degrade another person.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.560
Those interested in defilement experience a deep erotic pleasure around things like

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.860
spitting on a partner’s genitals or face, ejaculating on their clothes,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.460
pulling their hair, scratching them roughly,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.760
insulting them using coarse language and, at an extreme, urinating over them.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.380
These activities can strike one as deeply upsetting, and indications of mental illness.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.320
If a partner suggested them, a lover might come to be terrified of whom they had inadvertently hooked up with.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.040
And if one were tempted by any of them oneself, there might be intense levels of shame and worries about one’s character.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.100
But the task of culture isn’t to take fright, rather to try to replace fear and shame with insight.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:33.060
We  would be wise to begin studying the issue through the lens of perhaps the greatest novel of the 20th century, Marcel Proust’s "In Search of Lost Time".

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.260
In the first volume, Swann’s Way, Proust’s unnamed narrator, then a young teenager,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.020
is taking a walk near his grandmother’s house in the French countryside.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.780
As he passes a building at the edge of the village, he notices, in an upper bedroom, a woman, Mademoiselle Vinteuil, making love to a female friend.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.900
He's mesmerized and climbs a little hill for a better view.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.780
There he sees something even more surprising unfolding: Mademoiselle Vinteuil has positioned a photograph of her father on the bedside table...

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.560
and is encouraging her lesbian lover to spit on the image as they have sex, this gesture proving extremely exciting to them both.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.900
Early readers of Proust’s novel were puzzled by and heavily critical of this scene of erotic defilement.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.200
What was this revolting episode doing in an otherwise gracious and beautiful love story,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.640
filled with tender evocation of river banks, trees and domestic life?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.120
Proust’s editor wanted to cut the scene;

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.800
but the novelist insisted on retaining it, asking the editor to understand its importance within an overarching philosophy of love.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.060
Proust tried hard to make sure his readers would not judge Mademoiselle Vinteuil harshly,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.660
going so far as to suggest that even the woman’s father wouldn’t ultimately have minded being spat on by her lover,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.620
so long as he understood what was really going on.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.440
As Proust wrote: "I've since reflected that if Monsieur Vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.340
he might still, and in spite of everything, have continued to believe in his daughter’s soundness of heart."

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.080
Proust’s argument is that defilement during sex isn’t what it seems.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.380
Ostensibly, it’s about violence, hatred, meanness and a lack of respect.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.400
But for Proust, it can symbolize a longing to be properly oneself in the presence of another human being...

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.340
and to be loved and accepted by them for one’s darkest sides rather than just for one’s politeness and good manners.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.840
Mademoiselle Vinteuil is, in her day-to-day behaviour, an extremely moral and kindly character,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.180
and yet this pressure to be always responsible and ‘good’ also seeks moments of release, which is what she finds during love making.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:44.440
Sex in which two people can express their defiling urges is, for Proust, at heart an indication of a longing for real acceptance.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.160
We know we can please others by being good, but – suggests Proust –

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.420
what we really want is also to be endorsed for our more peculiar and unrespectable impulses.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.280
Getting turned on during defiling sex is a kind of thrill at the idea that, contrary to all normal expectations,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.460
the other person does still like you, even though you are using appalling language, scratching them or offering to soak them in urine.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:14.480
For Proust, defilement therefore has meaning: it is a surprising way of trying to improve a relationship.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.520
It’s not an act of sabotage or a denial of love.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.620
It’s a deeply curious but, in its own way, very logical quest for closeness.
