00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.210
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everyone,
and thank you for being here.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.760
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of
the African/Mid-East division.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.740
And I'm really excited
about today's program.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.900
And I always say something about
our division before we start.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.630
Because people see
the programs online,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.300 position:56%
and so if they're watching online,
they probably want to know something

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.430
about who we are and what we do.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.210
So we are a division that's
made up of three sections.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.390
And those three sections
are the African section,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.820
the Hebraic section,
the Mid-East section.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.000
We're responsible for collections
from 78 different countries

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.150
and at least 30 languages.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.940
We're very active in acquiring
and developing collections

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.510
from sub-Saharan Africa,
North Africa, the Middle East,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.400
Central Asia, the Caucasus, and
we go as far as Afghanistan,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.170
sometimes into [inaudible]
Russia and China.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.990
And we brief visitors.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.150
We serve collections.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.770
We organize programs.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.150
And we also and we do
exhibits and displays.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:56.530 position:56%
We also invite scholars and experts
who have researched the collections,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.670
who have written books, who
have prepared research papers,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.430
based on our collections,
to come and talk to us.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.580
And so to help us all get a better
understanding of these collections

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.850
in other countries and societies
for which we are responsible.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.230
And so in that spirit, today
we have our own, our very own,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.220
in-house poets and scholars
and writers and thinkers,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.740 position:56%
who have put together for you a very
special program for Valentine's Day.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.780
I know it's gone, but, you know,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.780
Valentine's Day is a
permanent feature, okay,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.580
and it was only two days
ago that we celebrated it.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.890
And this program has been --

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.330
is under the able direction of
our grand maestro, Dr. Ann Brener,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.430
the Hebraic area specialist
in this division.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.550
She opined in a meeting,
in a divisional meeting,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.250
that it behooves our division to
celebrate the poetic traditions

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.930
of the Middle East that go
back thousands of years,

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:32.510
and that have had a major
impact on Western poetic forms.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.370
[inaudible] form of
poetry, of Southern France.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.770
Because Valentine's
Day was approaching,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.180
she suggested that we should have
love poems from the Middle East

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.500
in some of the major
languages of our collections.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.740
The Mid-East collections,
the Hebraic collections.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.220
The African section also has
its own series of poetry,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.340
which we call conversations
with African Poets and Writers.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.870
But the other two sections do
not necessarily have a series.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.220
So this is a way of
celebrating their collections.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.010
The idea was immediately
endorsed unanimously.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.640
And today we have a treat for you.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.080
With, from the Hebraic section,
Ann Brener and Sharon Horowitz,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.880
and an adopted member of our
division, Joseph Englesberg.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.820
And from the Near East section,
we have the head of the section

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.390
and also Turkish specialist,
Joan Weeks.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.840
We have Muhannad Salhi,
Arab World specialist.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.810
And Hirad Dinavari, the
Persian area specialist,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.610
who will read love poems, both
in the original languages,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.220
the languages that we
collect, and in translation

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.030
so that we can all understand and
fall in love with the love poems.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.510
And so we are going we'll let
the show begin with our master

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.210
of ceremonies, Levon Avdoyan,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.050
who is the Armenian-Georgian
specialist in the division.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.950
And now, Levon.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.670
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: Thank
you, Mary-Jane.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.140
I suspect I have been chosen
as I don't want to call master

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.250
of ceremonies, I suspect
I'm the leader

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.710
of the love caravan at the moment.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.940
I was chosen because after 70,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.440
it's just presumed you
don't have a valentine.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.350
And so I welcome you all.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.370
And rather than actually start
with a bit of Armenian poetry,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.930
I am going to recite one
of the shortest poems

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.500 position:56%
that has ever been penned, and in
my viewpoint, the greatest love poem

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.450
that has ever been created,
and that is the 85th Carmen

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.000
from Catullus' Carmina.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.470
And it is, [foreign language].

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.840
I think Freud actually
knew this poem.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.080
I hate and I love.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.020
Why do I do this, perhaps you ask?

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.770
I do not know.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.280
But I feel it happening
and I am greatly tormented.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.150
So what you are going to hear
is romantic love, partial hate,

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.460
a great deal of torment in
four languages of the Hebraic

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.200
and the Near East section.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:50.430
Now picture this as
being a wind swept desert

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.350
from seventh century Arabia.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.510
And I introduce our Arab world
specialist, Dr. Muhannad Salhi.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:06.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.340
&gt;&gt; Muhannad Salhi: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.060
Thank you all for coming.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.350
As the title says,
this was meant to be

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.020 position:56%
on Valentine's, it's two days later.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.690
And some of us are quite
a few dollars shorter.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.320
But that's all right,
that's all right.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.020
The poem that I have chosen for
you today is by Qais Al-Mulawah,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.070
whom you will probably
know as Majnun Layla.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.400
Majnun Layla, the story of
Majnun Layla, I should say,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.240
is probably the most famous
love story in Arabic literature

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.640
and has indeed influenced
the entire Middle East,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.950
if not saw the entire East.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:56.470
The story itself is known in Arabic
literature as [foreign language]

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.370
"The Virgin Love," for lack
of a better translation.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.880
And it takes on many
iterations throughout the region.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.130 position:56%
Once it is adopted by and adapted,
I should say, by Persian literature,

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.980
it goes on to acquire
a mystical dimension.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.890
And it's adopted by
Azeri literature.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.800
It's adopted by Indian literature.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.370
It's adopted by Ottoman literature.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.630
And goes on to have so
many different iterations

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.670
and explanations and takes on
entirely different characters.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.290
But the bare bones story really,
and we have the [inaudible]

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.930
and it is mentioned
in Kitab al-Aghani,

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:44.540
[inaudible] Kitab al-Aghani, and
Ibn Qutaybah's al-shir wal-shuara.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.920
Actually, the person
who should be speaking

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.730
about this is our own Dr. Tadras
[assumed spelling] who's done a lot

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.230
of research on this.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.420
But I'll try and do my best
since it's a short time

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.730
that I have to speak about this.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:01.250
The bare bones story is we have
the suth [phonetic] named Qais ibn

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.690
Al-Mulawah who is completely
infatuated

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.840
by a girl named Layla Al-Aamiriya.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.510
And he is writing this
love poetry about her

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.990
and he is completely
uninhibited in his love poetry.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.910
He writes and writes about her,
and he's getting bolder and bolder

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.390
in that he's mentioning her name.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.460
So there's no mistaking
who he's talking about.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.160
One thing I should mention, when
he talks about, for example,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.870
communion with Layla, he's talking
about communion through verse.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.690 position:56%
This is not a physical relationship.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:41.010
This is purely platonic
relationship, let's call it.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.310
It's love through verse.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.870
He is completely infatuated by her.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:50.540
The fact that he's uninhibited,
he's going overboard, let's say,

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.420 position:56%
in wooing her, and he's mentioning
her by name, scandalizes her family.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.460
I mean, the poetry
reaches her family.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.750
Her father is scandalized by this.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:05.360
He begins to deem him
a little bit unstable,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.060
not to say a little touched, and so
he decides to nip this in the bud

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.310
and marries her off to another man.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:17.250
The man we are told is
named Ward Althaqafi.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.320
And Ward in Arabic means rose,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.540
because apparently the
man has a rosy complexion.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:30.100
And so once she is married to
this Ward Althaqafi and takes off,

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.860
Qais is completely -- he loses it.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.490
He's completely lost.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.480
He takes to the desert.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.480
He's seen reciting his
poetry alone in the desert.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.670
And his family starts to leave
him food out in the wilderness

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.500
so he can get something to eat.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.870 position:56%
And he's completely lost to society.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:55.080
Meanwhile, Layla, having
lost any hope of communion

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.440
with her beloved Qais, falls ill,
she's completely heartbroken,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.980
falls ill and dies
shortly thereafter.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:08.060
Upon hearing this, Qais
roams around her grave.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.050 position:56%
And the last three verses attributed

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.760
to Qais ibn Al-Mulawah
are apparently engraved

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.370
on a stone right by her grave.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.930
So it is an entirely
tragic love story.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.550
Once it is, as I mentioned
earlier, adopted and adapted

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.100
by the Persian tradition, it
requires a more mystical nature.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.320
Love for the beloved becomes a
vehicle for love for the divine.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.830
So by losing yourself, in
completely losing yourself in love

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.980
for the beloved, it becomes a
stepping stone for losing yourself

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:50.020
in the divine, in another
words, beloved with a capital B.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.120
So it is a mystical exercise.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.700
And then again, there's so many
different reiterations of this,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.110
there's so many different versions.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.570
There's one version that I was
looking at, has them both in school

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.010 position:56%
and the schoolmaster is beating Qais

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.210
for not paying attention
to his school work.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.360
He's paying too much
attention to Layla.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.350
And when he beats Qais, Layla
is the one that gets the scars.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.340
The Indians take it in a
completely different direction.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.580
In fact, they have Qais --

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.130 position:56%
they believe the two lovers flee the
deserts of Arabia and they manage

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:28.170
to find their way back
to India, Rajasthan,

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.470
and their graves are there.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.400
And I'm told there's a fair in
India ever year where newlyweds

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.560
and lovers go pay homage
to the two lovers.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:43.240
But back to the deserts of Arabia
and to our pour forlorn Qais.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.830
I ask that you are
forgiving and kind,

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.880
I'm the one who did
this translation.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.150
And as we all know, doing poetic
translations is a patently

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.010
unforgiving and unthankful task.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.320
So I will do my best.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.510
I will first read the Arabic and
then I will read the translation.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:38.870
[ Foreign Language ]

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.630
Did you not promise me oh heart

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.470
that if I foreswore the love
of Layla, you would too.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.780
I have kept my vow.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.970
So why is it that whenever
she is mentioned, you melt.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.120
And why do you now long
for Layla, after you swore

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.960 position:56%
to that path you would never return.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.850
Indeed, you have returned
to her, my heart.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.540
And low, tears are shed
profusely pouring forth,

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.020
foretelling that passion
is a fire ignited.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.920
And beneath fires'
embers, the heart melts.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.720
Thank you.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.330
[ Applause ]

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:29.820
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: Well, I did
promise you love and torment.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:35.700
We now go to our second act,
which is a flowering courtyard

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.540
in Muslim Spain and
we have Ann Brener

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.790
and Sharon Horowitz
and their intern.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.810
&gt;&gt; Ann Brener: Thank you.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.800
Arabic poetry was born in
the desert, but the spread

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.140
of Islam soon swept it into palaces

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.360
and courtyards across
the Middle East.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.860
And it left its traces
wherever we look.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.590
Poetry was chiseled
into palace walls,

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.810
as we see here in the Alhambra.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.750
Poetry was woven into
royal garments and rugs,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.920
carved in marble and stone.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.370
Poetry was a prerogative of kings

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.000
and poets the ornament
of courtly society.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.960
And in Andalusia, in the tiny
kingdoms of southern Spain ruled

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.400
by Muslim kings and princes,
it was also eagerly adopted

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.400
by Jewish poets for Hebrew poetry.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.380
These Jewish poets who lived in
cities like Granada and Cordoba

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.080
in the tenth and eleventh
centuries, composed poetry based

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.610
on classical Arabic models.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:42.480
Only they wrote their poems in
Hebrew rather than in Arabic,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.310
and they used the treasures of the
Bible and not the Koran to do so.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.610
The Hebrew Love Song, which
we present to you today,

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:56.280 position:56%
is based on a model of Arabic poetry
that was unique to Muslim Spain.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.780
Unlike the classic
form of Arabic poetry

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.020
that features one running rhyme,
the kind performed by my colleague,

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.600
Dr. Salhi, just now,
and very beautifully,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.570
this new poetry has a far
more intricate rhyme scheme.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:15.070
In Arabic, this kind of
poem was called a muwashah,

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.230
or as we translated into
English, a girdle poem.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.870
A girdle or a medieval girdle
being an ornamental sash

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.920
or belt studded with jewels.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.210
And just as a girdle would
be wrapped around the body

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:32.460
of its princely wearer, so
would the girdle poem be studded

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.210
with intricate set of
rhymes weaving in and out

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.260 position:56%
of the poem and holding it together.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.670
And here I've made -- I know
you can't read the words,

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.590
but here I've made a
diagram of the colors,

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.620
so that you can see just
how intricate it is.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.180
The yellow, green,
and turquoise colors,

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.080
you see how they weave
through the poem?

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.320
Well, that would be the
muwashah, the girdle belt.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.290
Now, all this makes for a very --

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.520
all these rhymes make
for a very musical poem.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.250
And indeed, it was usually
performed by professional musicians

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.100
in courtly setting, a palace
or flowering courtyard.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:14.430 position:56%
Now, just like the classical Arabic
poems, the muwashah, or girdle poem,

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.590
is composed in the classical
language, that is the language

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.300
of the Koran, and spoken
in the male voice.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.350
Except that is for the last two
lines, and that is the kicker.

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.490
For in the muwashah, the
final two lines are written

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.850
in colloquial Arabic, the kind
of language you would hear

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:37.610
if you wandered out of the palace
into the bazar or marketplaces

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:39.730
or if you went down to the rivers

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.600
where the servant girls
were doing their laundry.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.550
And we have kings creating poems
to those very servant girls.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.850 position:56%
And since we are talking about
Muslim Spain, this colloquial Arabic

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:54.070
in these last two lines is often
mixed with words in Spanish

00:17:54.070 --> 00:18:00.010
and they are usually lifted
directly from popular songs.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.290 position:56%
These last two lines in muwashah
are known as the [foreign language],

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.790
an Arabic word meaning exit.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:10.360 position:56%
And as one literary critic described
the [foreign language], oh,

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.480
some 900 years ago, the [foreign
language] is, and I'm quoting,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.490
"the spice of the poem, its salt
and its sugar, its musk and amber."

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.470
This same critic also described the
very strict rules governing the use

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.770
of the [foreign language].

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.050
The transition from the body of
the poem to the [foreign language],

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:33.850
he writes, and again I quote,
"the transition should be affected

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:39.150
by a jump and by suddenly passing
from one subject to another.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.360
In addition, it should be spoken

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.260
by some other person,
animate or inanimate.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.480
The most common thing is to put it

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.060
into the now [inaudible]
Lucette girls or doves cooing

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.130
in the branches of the
trees, or drunkards."

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.200
The lines immediately preceding the
[foreign language] must contain an

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:04.230
expression like, he said, I said,
she said, she sang, etc, etc. Now,

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:08.210
a lovesick girl, a cooing
dove, a drunk, in other words,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.640
the [foreign language] must be
put into the mouth of someone

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.120
who doesn't usually have a voice
in classical Arabic poetry.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.880
And it is this play between
highbrow and lowbrow ,

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.640
etween the two very
different voices,

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.670
that give the poem
its salt and sugar.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:30.070
The love poem we now present
is one of these girdle poems.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.170
But while the [foreign language] is
in the colloquial mixture of Arabic

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.120
and Spanish, the body of
the poem is in Hebrew,

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.200
beautiful biblical Hebrew.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.960
This Hebrew poem follows the
rule of the Arabic girdle poems

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.600
to the letter and also presents
a virtual catalog of motifs

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.380
from the repertoire
of Arabic love poetry,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.610
including the tortured lover.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.890
Thus, we have a suffering
lover, a cruel mistress,

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.560
and a stern personified fate,
know in both Arabic and Hebrew

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.810
as [foreign language], or time,

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.350
a convention that goes
back to pre-Islamic poetry.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.170
Arabic poetic traditions demands

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.800
that the poet's mistress be
beautiful as well as cruel.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.350
And, as you will now see,

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:20.480
our heroine fits her job
description to perfection.

manna and thereby do me wrong

You'll see it's firm and strong.

What can Time do then,
if you to me belong?

then God, may I forget Thee!

It only makes it harder,
for me to kiss and hold!

The Rose of Sharon then replied
and sang out clear and bold:

want to wear a necklace, O Mama.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.470

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:52.040
My lord will see a neck
that's white and pure.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.550
He won't want jewelry!

with Hirad Dinavari doing the Shiraz
Palace fourteenth century Persia.

&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: To
continue, a wonderful tradition

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:38.040
that has its roots in Arabia by the
time Islam had come to the shores

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.900
of Persian lands, and by
the ninth, tenth century,

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.100
you have Persian poetry blossoming
using Arabic weight and scale

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.810
and rhythmic motifs
that you see that came

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:52.730
in through the Arabic language.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.290
The first few centuries, of course,
started with shanom [phonetic]

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.970
and panegyric and poetry
that was based on praise

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.650
of the king or storytelling.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.880
But by the eleventh, twelfth
century, we have a style

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:13.110 position:56%
of lyrical poetry, which essentially
is mystical, all the things

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.430
that Muhannad alluded to earlier.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.880
It's a divine love, a
talk about spiritual love.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.620 position:56%
And we have several great poets that
start to blossom in this period.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:32.240
The city of Shiraz is one of
the great cities known for many

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.570
of these wonderful poets that
came, two very noteworthy ones,

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.590
of course, are Saadi and Hafiz.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:41.470
You're looking at Hafiz's
mausoleum here.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.840
I've decided to recite
a famous mystical poem

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.350
from Hafiz for you for this event.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:53.470
And, of course, the good thing
about Hafiz is, today in Iran,

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.140
he has become an icon for lovers.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.990
Everyone once a year
gathers at the Hafiz here,

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.100
and essentially they read --

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.530
open the book, his book
off odes or ghazal.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.970
His love poetry are known
as [foreign language] art,

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.220
which in English, you could
roughly translate as ghazals.

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:19.960
And what we have is a series of
poems rhyming couplets following

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.970
that wonderful rhythmic style.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.940
And the end, with the
last two lines,

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:29.970
essentially referring
to the poet himself.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.980
And I'm going to read
you one of those

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.230
that I think you'll
find quite interesting.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:41.940 position:56%
For translation, I went ahead and
selected John Hindley's translation,

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.260
with a few modifications.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.530
He's an author from the
nineteenth century who wrote

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.540
in a more classical style.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.180
And I try to make it a
bit more contemporary.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.840
So I'll start with the Persian
and I will go into the English.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.210
But before that, I also wanted

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.360
to quickly give you a little
background on Hafiz himself.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.720
Hafiz was a great poet that started
a tradition that became renowned

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.890
in the Islamic- and, of
course, Persian-speaking world.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.250
Persian speakers today in
Afghanistan and Central Asia,

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:21.260
all the way to India, for centuries
have been using him as a role model

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:29.810
and have been, you know, writing in
his lyrical Sufi style essentially.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:37.920 position:56%
His poetry was so loved that even it
hit and came to Europe in the year

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:43.310 position:56%
of 17 -- I have it here somewhere --

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:49.520
in 1771, it was translated
into English by William Jones.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.480
And essentially it has
left its mark, his poetry,

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:59.010
on authors such as
[inaudible] Ralph Waldo Emerson,

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.590
who have been influenced
strongly by his style of poetry

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.330
in the eighteenth and
nineteenth century in Europe.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.810
So here is the poem.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:13.670 position:56%
It is Ghazal 270, or ode number 270.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.870
Roughly translated or given a
heading as a mysterious love.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:23.510
I read the Persian and I
will switch to English.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:28:12.040
[ Foreign Language ]

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.660
If you noticed, every
line of the couplet ends

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.890
with the word [foreign
language], ask me not.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.680
While in English it's
impossible to translate it

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.320
so that it gives the meaning.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.630
So this is an attempt at
getting close to that meaning.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.480
Again by John Hindley.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:37.320
I have born the anguish of love,
which ask me not to describe.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:48.160 position:56%
I have tasted the poison of
absence, which ask me not to relate.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.920
Far through the world have I roved,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:57.650 position:56%
and the length I have chosen a
sweet creature (a ravish of hearts),

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:01.270
whose names ask me not to disclose.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:07.570
The flowing of my tears
bedews her footsteps

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.830
in such a manner as
ask me not to utter.

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:17.330
Absent from thee, a beggar
and a sole tenant of my heart.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:27.770
I have endured such tortures,
as ask me not to enumerate.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:34.930
Thus am I, Hafiz, arrived
at extremity

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:40.620
in the ways of love, which, alas!

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:50.970
Ask me not to explain.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:56.810
Thank you.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:16.310
[ Applause ]

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.550
&gt;&gt; Levon Avdoyan: And from
the shaw's [phonetic] Palace,

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:24.660
we go to the court of
the Dolmabahce Palace,

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.810
nineteenth century
Istanbul with Joan Weeks.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.430
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Poetry, literature,
music, and art flourished

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.900
in the palaces of the
Ottoman sultans in Istanbul,

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.410
as well as infused the very
fabric of Ottoman culture.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.560
All sorts of everyday events
were expressed in poetry,

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.530
such as impassioned
pleas for favor and love.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:58.890
Poets could be funny, naughty,
insulting in their poems.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:03.070
Elite poets not only entertained
the Sultan, but participated

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:08.510
in the many festivities and major
events surrounding palace life.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:11.070
Ottoman poetry is highly developed

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.550
and poets built upon
a shared knowledge

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:15.730
of earlier themes and motives.

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:21.790 position:56%
Sexuality and spirituality merge and
evoke an intense passion for love.

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:27.080 position:56%
The basic unit is a couplet with
two equal half lines that follow one

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.020
of about a dozen rhyming patterns.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.650
Further, the Turkish
language, Vowel Harmony,

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.960
lends itself to rhythmic schemes.

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:40.100
Each couplet is self-contained
in grammar and theme and may

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.430
or may not have a direct
connection to other couplets

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.590
in the poetic composition.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:51.460
See if you can hear this rhyme
pattern in the poems that I read.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:55.850
Also, listen for the poet's name.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:32:00.430
They seem to be talking
to themselves in the poem.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:04.770
Translation of these Ottoman
poems is very difficult,

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:10.430
not only because of the old words
no longer used in modern Turkish,

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.170
and the cultural idiosyncrasies
of the Ottoman culture,

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.570
but because the sound of the
rhyming patterns in Turkish differ

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.480
so greatly from the
translated language.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.190
I tried to translate
these poems by Leyla Hanim

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:31.070 position:56%
that I'm presenting today, but right
away I saw that I could not begin

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.560
to capture the rhythmic patterns.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.650
So today I'm presenting
[inaudible] transliteration

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.660
from the Ottoman script
into modern Turkish,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:48.680
and then using Talat Halman's
translations into English.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.450
Leyla Hanim is one of the most
important Turkish female poets

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.180
of the nineteenth century.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.160
Her birthday can't be determined,

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.540
but she was known to
have died in 1848.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:08.040
Leyla Hanim, [inaudible] are among
the most important female poets

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.300
of the Ottoman lyric poetic form.

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.050
Leyla was born into a noble family.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:19.930
The daughter of Moralizade Hamid
Efendi from [inaudible] and Hadice.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.430
Her mother was the eldest daughter

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.990
of the famous statesman
and poet [inaudible].

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:31.280
Leyla received private
tutoring in poetic composition

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.260
from her grandfather
in the Palace court.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:39.350
She lived during the reign of
Sultans Mahmut and Abdulmecid

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:42.560
and had a close relationship
with palace women.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.000
It is said she could compose
poetry on the spur of the moment

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.830
and was well known in her
expression of women's feelings,

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:55.440
as well as quick wit satire
abounded in her poetry.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.860
She was well aware
of her gender role

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:03.360
and its predetermined marginality,
but she used it to her advantage.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.910
In today's world, we would
say she had attitude.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:12.000
And that's why I chose her
poetry for today's presentation.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:35:26.500

Night after night in dreams, the

and your fragrant dark amber hair.

put its feathers on my heart.

friends would reproach me today?

They will come around in the end.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.400
Let them say what they will.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:15.590
On judgment day, this disgraced
dark face of mine might turn white.

What on earth does it matter to
me if I get praised or blamed?

So long as friends are alive,
well, let them say what they will.

Leyla, offer your devotion
to that fair faced darling.

of your beloved's feet.

But the philosopher in me wants
to say that everyone who falls
