00:00:00.617 --> 00:00:02.201
- [Sal] Hello, everyone, this is Sal here,

00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.168
and I'm here with Jeffrey Rosen who's head

00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:06.728
of the National Constitution Center.

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:08.899
What are we going to
talk about today, Jeff?

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.017
- [Jeff] We're going to talk about

00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:11.816
the Preamble to the US Constitution.

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:13.489
- [Sal] That sounds very important.

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:14.633
- [Jeff] It is very important.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.609
The entire theory of popular sovereignty

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.648
is contained within these beautiful words,

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:19.809
so we've got a lot to talk about.

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:20.975
- [Sal] And before we even get into it,

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:22.424
what do you mean by the theory

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:24.480
of popular sovereignty?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.451
- [Jeff] So the preamble
begins with the famous words,

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:28.993
'We the people of the United States,'

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:31.017
and those signal that
in the United States,

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:34.457
power belongs to 'we the people.'

00:00:34.457 --> 00:00:37.532
It doesn't belong to our
representatives in Congress.

00:00:37.532 --> 00:00:41.322
It doesn't even belong
to the state governments.

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:43.475
And that was a huge shift because

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.307
an original draft of the Preamble read,

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:48.844
'We the people of the
States of New Hampshire,

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:51.875
Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut,' and so forth.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:55.192
But, James Wilson, who
was the main drafter

00:00:55.192 --> 00:00:57.832
of the Preamble changed those words,

00:00:57.832 --> 00:01:00.121
and at some point, the
Preamble was changed

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.208
to the famous words we know now,

00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:04.113
'We the people of the United States.'

00:01:04.113 --> 00:01:06.313
That meant that when some Southern states

00:01:06.313 --> 00:01:08.040
tried to secede from the Union,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.624
before the Civil War, arguing that they

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:12.352
were sovereign as state governments,

00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:13.944
President Lincoln resisted their

00:01:13.944 --> 00:01:15.673
Constitutional ability to secede,

00:01:15.673 --> 00:01:17.073
saying that since 'we the people

00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:18.369
of the United States' had created

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.090
the Constitution, a majority of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.915
'we the people of the United States'

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.025
would have to agree before any state

00:01:24.025 --> 00:01:25.169
could leave it.

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:27.504
So, that's why it was a huge shift

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:31.514
in a conception of power that James Wilson

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:32.846
embodied in these words.

00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:34.513
Before the Preamble, people believed

00:01:34.513 --> 00:01:36.202
that legislatures were sovereign.

00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:37.929
In Britain, the king in Parliament

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:38.867
was sovereign.

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:40.559
But, in America, thanks to Wilson

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:41.691
and his brilliant colleagues,

00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:43.444
'we the people of the United States'

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:45.247
as a whole became sovereign and

00:01:45.247 --> 00:01:47.699
that came to chart the entire course

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:49.491
of Constitutional history.

00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.820
But then we have all of these purposes

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.780
for which the Constitution was formed:

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.260
to form a more perfect
union, establish justice,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.380
domestic tranquility, common defense,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.500
general welfare, and secure the blessings

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.118
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:05.228
And then we're saying that's the reason

00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:07.948
we established the Constitution.

00:02:07.948 --> 00:02:09.467
There's lots to unpack there, but maybe

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:12.211
we should focus on those final words:

00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:13.492
'secure the blessings of liberty

00:02:13.492 --> 00:02:15.116
to ourselves and our posterity.'

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:16.822
The framers believed that our rights

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:19.221
come not from government,
but from God or nature,

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.276
that we're born with
them, and when we move

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:23.812
from the state of nature
into civil society

00:02:23.812 --> 00:02:25.363
to form a government, we surrender

00:02:25.363 --> 00:02:27.837
temporary control over
certain of those rights

00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:31.740
in order to secure the safety and security

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.669
of the rights we've retained.

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.981
So that means that certain
rights are unalienable,

00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:36.814
to use Jefferson's language

00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:37.647
in the Declaration.

00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:39.092
We can't alienate them to government

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:42.011
when we form government, and the purpose

00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:44.428
of alienating temporary control

00:02:44.428 --> 00:02:46.189
over certain rights, like
allowing the government

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.955
to punish murder, rather than, you know,

00:02:47.955 --> 00:02:50.091
having private violence, is to secure

00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:52.051
the blessings of liberty of the retained

00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:54.731
natural rights, the first of which

00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:56.754
the framers believed was complete

00:02:56.754 --> 00:02:58.196
freedom of conscience, the right

00:02:58.196 --> 00:02:59.842
to believe or not to believe according to

00:02:59.842 --> 00:03:02.425
the dictates of our conscience.

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:04.812
So, we really see that that idea

00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:06.051
of securing the blessings of liberty

00:03:06.051 --> 00:03:08.027
is implicit in the idea that our rights

00:03:08.027 --> 00:03:09.596
come from God and not government,

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:11.158
that government only has temporary control

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:13.308
of them, and reinforces, once again,

00:03:13.308 --> 00:03:15.836
that we should never confuse the actions

00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:17.758
of the government, laws that Congress

00:03:17.758 --> 00:03:19.220
or the state governments pass,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.291
with the will of the people.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:22.798
'We the people' are sovereign.

00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:25.107
The government is our servants.

00:03:25.107 --> 00:03:26.972
We are the principles,
and when there's a clash

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.579
between the will of the principles

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:29.883
represented by the Constitution

00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:31.012
and the will of the servants

00:03:31.012 --> 00:03:32.315
represented by the legislatures,

00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:35.044
we prefer the principle to the agent.

00:03:35.044 --> 00:03:37.219
That was what Hamilton
said in Federalist 78

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:38.643
in justifying the Supreme Court's power

00:03:38.643 --> 00:03:41.843
to strike down unconstitutional laws,

00:03:41.843 --> 00:03:44.028
because the Constitution
ratified in the name

00:03:44.028 --> 00:03:46.740
of 'we the people' represents our views

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.411
more profoundly than
those of ordinary laws.

00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:51.331
That's why judges have to prefer

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.293
the Constitution to ordinary laws.

00:03:53.293 --> 00:03:54.519
So, once again, we're seeing packed

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.147
into this Preamble so
much natural law theory

00:03:58.147 --> 00:04:01.731
and theory of popular sovereignty.

00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:04.429
There's one other really important notion

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.915
contained in those words
securing the blessings

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:07.531
of liberty in the name of 'we the people,'

00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:10.252
and that's that the Constitution itself

00:04:10.252 --> 00:04:12.102
didn't get to speak for 'we the people'

00:04:12.102 --> 00:04:13.580
when it was proposed.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.637
It wasn't until it was ratified

00:04:15.637 --> 00:04:17.284
by special conventions
that had been elected

00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:20.326
for that purpose that it
earned the right to speak

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:22.172
in the name of 'we the people' as a whole.

00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:24.035
James Wilson was very keen on the idea

00:04:24.035 --> 00:04:25.749
that it was the ratifying conventions

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:27.679
not the Constitutional
Convention in Philadelphia

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:30.172
that gave the document its status

00:04:30.172 --> 00:04:34.547
as supreme law and that
idea that only laws

00:04:34.547 --> 00:04:36.878
that go through a special procedure

00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:39.179
specified in the
Constitution in Article V,

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:40.355
which is the amendment procedure,

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:42.922
or by special Constitutional Conventions,

00:04:42.922 --> 00:04:44.706
get to speak in the
name of 'we the people,'

00:04:44.706 --> 00:04:46.614
is absolutely core to the whole theory

00:04:46.614 --> 00:04:48.618
of American Constitutionalism.

00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:51.331
- [Sal] Why were the
founding fathers so focused

00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.283
on this notion of popular sovereignty,

00:04:54.283 --> 00:04:56.763
of elected officials being servant

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.737
to the people, and making it so strongly

00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:03.596
embedded even here in the Preamble?

00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:05.573
- [Jeff] They just fought a revolution

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:07.810
based on the idea that
the tyrannical King George

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.247
had infringed the natural
rights of the people,

00:05:11.247 --> 00:05:13.902
had refused to grant basic
powers of representation,

00:05:13.902 --> 00:05:16.679
and had broken the social contract,

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:19.222
and therefore, had lost the right

00:05:19.222 --> 00:05:21.525
to govern people because he was governing

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:22.599
without consent.

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.438
One of the natural rights
that people believed

00:05:25.438 --> 00:05:28.118
were unalienable, retained by the people,

00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:30.350
was the right to alter
and abolish government

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.991
whenever it threatens the
retained natural rights

00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:33.840
of the people.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.786
That's in the Declaration
of Independence and,

00:05:35.786 --> 00:05:38.621
in the Constitution, it
can be found in Article V.

00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:41.513
So, that right of revolution
was part and parcel

00:05:41.513 --> 00:05:44.142
of the idea that our basic natural rights

00:05:44.142 --> 00:05:45.791
are retained.

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:48.146
And you have to remember
how revolutionary it was

00:05:48.146 --> 00:05:51.367
to be talking of popular
sovereignty in 1787.

00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:52.807
There were almost no democratic

00:05:52.807 --> 00:05:54.912
self-governments on earth then.

00:05:54.912 --> 00:05:57.157
There had been small-scale
democracies in Greek,

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:58.490
Greece and Rome.

00:06:00.431 --> 00:06:03.824
In Athens, Solon, or in Sparta, Lycurgus,

00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:06.137
had been lawgivers, but no people

00:06:06.137 --> 00:06:08.585
had ever, as the scholar Akhil Amar says,

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:11.409
voted on a written Constitution before,

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.637
deliberated it, and had
it ratified in their name.

00:06:14.637 --> 00:06:16.289
So, that's what was so radical about it,

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.804
that even the handful
of minor of the sort of

00:06:18.804 --> 00:06:20.770
partial democracies at the time, like the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.555
limited suffrage in the British Parliament

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:25.962
or the Swiss Cantons hadn't had

00:06:25.962 --> 00:06:28.691
a written Constitution that was ratified

00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:30.893
by popular deliberation.

00:06:30.893 --> 00:06:32.210
So, that's what made it radical

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.598
and that was Wilson's
distinct contribution

00:06:34.598 --> 00:06:38.584
to America's entire theory of democratic

00:06:38.584 --> 00:06:40.326
self-governments, and that's why

00:06:40.326 --> 00:06:41.708
if you had to talk about the essence

00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:44.886
of Constitutionalism
today, it's not populism.

00:06:44.886 --> 00:06:46.815
It's not a quick direct vote.

00:06:46.815 --> 00:06:47.950
It's not Brexit.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.399
It's not a referendum.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:51.066
It's long periods of deliberation,

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:53.578
so the text earns the right to speak

00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:55.295
in the name of 'we the people,'

00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:57.335
and it was the very reason for which

00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:01.339
the revolutionaries fought
the American Revolution.

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:02.723
- [Sal] Fascinating. Let's continue.

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.230
So, we say that we have 'We the People

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.135
of the United States,' it establishes

00:07:05.135 --> 00:07:06.959
the popular sovereignty, and then it says,

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.596
'in order to,' and it lists a bunch

00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:11.935
of reasons why we are,
what we are trying to do.

00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:13.926
We already did 'secure
the blessings of liberty

00:07:13.926 --> 00:07:15.540
to ourselves and our posterity.'

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.816
What are the other things
we want to talk about?

00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:20.667
- [Jeff] Let's go back in
order and the first purpose

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:23.091
is 'in order to form
a more perfect union.'

00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:25.940
Well, that was the central goal of the

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.373
Constitutional Convention.

00:07:27.373 --> 00:07:29.748
The previous union,
represented by the Articles

00:07:29.748 --> 00:07:32.917
of Confederation, had been imperfect.

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:35.331
That was sovereign states that were unable

00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:37.780
to achieve common purposes.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.947
They couldn't raise money
to support forces in war.

00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:46.100
They couldn't put down
rebellions by debtors

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.557
in Massachusetts, known
as Shay's Rebellion.

00:07:48.557 --> 00:07:50.443
They needed a unanimous
vote to achieve anything.

00:07:50.443 --> 00:07:52.495
And essentially, the
government didn't work.

00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:54.574
So, the framers came to Philadelphia

00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:56.298
in order to form a more perfect union

00:07:56.298 --> 00:07:58.616
by establishing a
Constitution strong enough

00:07:58.616 --> 00:08:01.624
to achieve common purposes,
but restrained enough

00:08:01.624 --> 00:08:05.045
to protect, retain natural rights.

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.015
That's what a perfect union is.

00:08:07.015 --> 00:08:08.709
It's not a consolidated government,

00:08:08.709 --> 00:08:11.580
because states retained powers

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.237
under the 10th Amendment.

00:08:13.237 --> 00:08:15.255
All powers not vested in
the United States as a whole

00:08:15.255 --> 00:08:18.188
are retained by the states or the people.

00:08:18.188 --> 00:08:19.900
And, ultimately, it's 'we the people'

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.684
who retain the ultimate power,

00:08:21.684 --> 00:08:22.544
because we're the ones who are sovereign.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.287
But we can parcel that power out

00:08:24.287 --> 00:08:25.448
either to state governments or

00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:27.175
to the federal government in order

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:29.712
to ensure the protections of liberty.

00:08:29.712 --> 00:08:31.280
So, that's what a more perfect union is

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.994
and that's why it was so appropriate

00:08:32.994 --> 00:08:35.729
that Lincoln, in defending the Union

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:38.560
during the Civil War,
resisted the authority

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.015
of the state governments
to secede on the grounds

00:08:41.015 --> 00:08:43.607
that 'we the people of
the United States' needed

00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:45.598
to consent before the Union could become

00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:47.487
less perfect.

00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:49.263
- [Sal] I just want to
double-click on that a little bit

00:08:49.263 --> 00:08:51.210
because the words, 'more' and 'perfect'

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.559
don't normally go together.

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:53.855
You're either perfect or you're not.

00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:56.286
And so, part of the narrative that

00:08:56.286 --> 00:08:57.441
I think I'm hearing is that we had

00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:00.463
the Articles of Confederation,
which were imperfect,

00:09:00.463 --> 00:09:02.359
and we want to get
closer to being perfect.

00:09:02.359 --> 00:09:04.063
That's one of the reasons here.

00:09:04.063 --> 00:09:05.680
Many reasons when I look at, 'to form

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.321
a more perfect union,'
it also, at least to me,

00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:11.810
kind of invokes this
notion of continuously

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.113
trying to get better, even
from the starting point.

00:09:15.113 --> 00:09:18.919
- [Jeff] You're right to parse it closely.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.243
We're trying continuously to get better,

00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:23.235
but perfection doesn't mean amalgamation.

00:09:23.235 --> 00:09:24.915
In other words, the most perfect union

00:09:24.915 --> 00:09:26.962
wouldn't be a total union in which

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:30.369
all power is united in
the federal government,

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:31.664
for example, and not parceled out

00:09:31.664 --> 00:09:33.315
between the federal
government and the states,

00:09:33.315 --> 00:09:34.682
and also not separated out

00:09:34.682 --> 00:09:37.593
so the various branches
can check each other.

00:09:37.593 --> 00:09:40.267
We want a union perfect enough to achieve

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:42.482
common purposes, but not so strong

00:09:42.482 --> 00:09:44.593
as to threaten liberty, and it was that

00:09:44.593 --> 00:09:46.113
delicate balance that was crucial

00:09:46.113 --> 00:09:49.377
to Madison's vision and that
led to most of the tensions

00:09:49.377 --> 00:09:51.960
in the Constitution Convention.

00:09:53.017 --> 00:09:56.904
- [Sal] And then, 'establish justice?'

00:09:56.904 --> 00:09:58.801
- [Jeff] Well, my goodness. There's a lot

00:09:58.801 --> 00:10:02.332
packed into that, and you might think

00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:04.953
that that mandate to establish justice

00:10:04.953 --> 00:10:08.748
gives judges the power to do justice,

00:10:08.748 --> 00:10:11.510
regardless of, let the heaven's fall,

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.861
to use the expression.

00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:15.446
But that's not what the
Supreme Court has held.

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:18.910
In a really interesting
case, the Supreme Court,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.117
it was called Jacobson vs Massachusetts.

00:10:21.117 --> 00:10:23.110
It came down in 1905.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.373
The Supreme Court rejected the claim

00:10:25.373 --> 00:10:27.664
that the Preamble to the Constitution

00:10:27.664 --> 00:10:31.232
conferred independent powers that could be

00:10:31.232 --> 00:10:33.545
enforced by judges.

00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:35.112
In other words, it
wasn't a general mandate

00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:37.837
that allowed judges to
do justice regardless.

00:10:37.837 --> 00:10:41.489
Instead, Justice Harlan
said in the Jacobson case,

00:10:41.489 --> 00:10:44.114
although the Preamble
indicates the general purposes

00:10:44.114 --> 00:10:46.009
for which the people
ordained and established

00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:47.915
the Constitution, it
has never been regarded

00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.273
as the source of any substantive power

00:10:50.273 --> 00:10:52.425
conferred on the government
of the United States

00:10:52.425 --> 00:10:53.712
or any of its departments.

00:10:53.712 --> 00:10:55.713
Such power is embraced
only those expressly

00:10:55.713 --> 00:10:58.240
granted in the body of the Constitution,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.678
or, and this is the final bit,

00:11:00.678 --> 00:11:04.255
and such as may be implied
from those so granted.

00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:05.624
So, 'establish justice' is a broad

00:11:05.624 --> 00:11:08.152
declaration of purposes.

00:11:08.152 --> 00:11:10.184
Many parts of the Constitution help

00:11:10.184 --> 00:11:11.786
the government to establish justice,

00:11:11.786 --> 00:11:13.753
including the Bill of
Rights, which requires

00:11:13.753 --> 00:11:15.519
that people can't be deprived of liberty

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:17.167
without due process of law.

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:18.375
If they are gonna have a criminal trial,

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:19.993
they have all sorts of rights:

00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:22.143
to confront witnesses,
to be tried by jury,

00:11:22.143 --> 00:11:23.335
and so forth.

00:11:23.335 --> 00:11:26.574
But, it's the specific
articulation of the rights

00:11:26.574 --> 00:11:29.018
that allow us to establish justice

00:11:29.018 --> 00:11:31.591
that are the ones the judges can enforce.

00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:33.793
The broad goal is the one set out

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:34.998
in the Preamble.

00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:37.320
- [Sal] And then we have
'insure domestic tranquility,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.272
provide for the common defense,

00:11:39.272 --> 00:11:41.279
promote the general welfare?'

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:42.944
- Yes, so domestic
tranquility is what some

00:11:42.944 --> 00:11:45.080
says of central concern to the framers.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.754
They're concerned about armed mobs

00:11:46.754 --> 00:11:48.903
like those I mentioned in Massachusetts

00:11:48.903 --> 00:11:51.798
in Shay's rebellion
where debtors and farmers

00:11:51.798 --> 00:11:53.280
in western Massachusetts are rebelling

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.568
against their creditors.

00:11:55.568 --> 00:11:57.858
So, they want to allow the government

00:11:57.858 --> 00:12:00.672
enough power to put down
these insurrections,

00:12:00.672 --> 00:12:01.977
but they don't want a government

00:12:01.977 --> 00:12:04.191
so strong that it will
create standing armies

00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:05.687
that can be permanent threats to liberty,

00:12:05.687 --> 00:12:08.147
the kind that King George's army was.

00:12:08.147 --> 00:12:10.677
So, that's why the 2nd Amendment

00:12:10.677 --> 00:12:14.085
to the Constitution wants to provide

00:12:14.085 --> 00:12:16.818
for well-regulated militias that can help

00:12:16.818 --> 00:12:19.682
ensure domestic tranquility,
but doesn't want

00:12:19.682 --> 00:12:22.698
to empower a permanent standing army,

00:12:22.698 --> 00:12:23.873
because it believes that, ultimately,

00:12:23.873 --> 00:12:25.522
the people do have to retain the ability

00:12:25.522 --> 00:12:27.817
to take up arms to
defend their own liberty

00:12:27.817 --> 00:12:29.387
if the government is
threatening it as part

00:12:29.387 --> 00:12:32.682
of their unalienable right to
alter and abolish government.

00:12:32.682 --> 00:12:34.393
So that's the domestic tranquility part.

00:12:34.393 --> 00:12:35.617
And then, the common defense, of course,

00:12:35.617 --> 00:12:37.753
is hugely important and
Congress has the power

00:12:37.753 --> 00:12:39.642
to declare war.

00:12:39.642 --> 00:12:42.010
The President is Commander-in-Chief.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.192
The President has the power
to repel sudden attacks,

00:12:44.192 --> 00:12:46.130
but otherwise it's supposed to be Congress

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.132
in theory at least, that authorizes

00:12:48.132 --> 00:12:50.799
the deployment of troops abroad,

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.581
and the parts of Article I for Congress

00:12:53.581 --> 00:12:55.838
and Article II for the President

00:12:55.838 --> 00:12:59.261
that give those two
branches war-making powers,

00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:01.406
help to ensure that the Constitution

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:04.430
provides for the common defense.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.857
The final clause, I
hestitated to introduce

00:13:06.857 --> 00:13:09.278
because it's so incredibly broad,

00:13:09.278 --> 00:13:11.022
'promote the general welfare,' wow.

00:13:11.022 --> 00:13:12.662
Well, I mean, that could be read

00:13:12.662 --> 00:13:15.238
as a kind of blank
check for the government

00:13:15.238 --> 00:13:17.190
to do whatever it thinks is necessary

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:19.486
to promote the general welfare.

00:13:19.486 --> 00:13:22.303
But, both the Supreme
Court and also the framers,

00:13:22.303 --> 00:13:23.521
in ratifying the Constitution,

00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:25.727
made clear that the general welfare clause

00:13:25.727 --> 00:13:27.853
was not a blank check.

00:13:27.853 --> 00:13:30.767
It was that Congress and
the President could only

00:13:30.767 --> 00:13:33.055
exercise the powers that were either

00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:35.381
explicitly granted by the Constitution

00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:37.919
or could be fairly implied by them.

00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:38.975
And yet, at the same time,

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:40.830
Chief Justice John Marshall and others

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.158
suggested that those powers have to be

00:13:43.158 --> 00:13:45.998
broadly construed enough
to achieve the purposes

00:13:45.998 --> 00:13:47.846
of the Constitution,
which include promoting

00:13:47.846 --> 00:13:49.167
the general welfare.

00:13:49.167 --> 00:13:52.160
So, you might say that
promoting the general welfare

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.975
is a different expression of the goal

00:13:53.975 --> 00:13:57.334
of promoting a more perfect union,

00:13:57.334 --> 00:13:59.630
except you could say
that there's a separate

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.005
goal of passing laws that
are in the general welfare,

00:14:03.005 --> 00:14:04.871
again, without threatening liberty,

00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:06.878
and that clause, once again, embodies this

00:14:06.878 --> 00:14:10.698
tectonic balance between
empowering government,

00:14:10.698 --> 00:14:13.306
but also protecting retained rights.

00:14:13.306 --> 00:14:14.563
- [Sal] So, just to make sure that we got

00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:17.465
all of the big points, we've learned that,

00:14:17.465 --> 00:14:20.306
although the Preamble itself isn't a basis

00:14:20.306 --> 00:14:22.977
for justice, like the
body of the Constitution,

00:14:22.977 --> 00:14:26.498
it establishes that 'we
the people' are the source

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:28.874
of political power in the United States.

00:14:28.874 --> 00:14:31.217
It explains that the
Constitution would form

00:14:31.217 --> 00:14:33.988
a more perfect union between the states

00:14:33.988 --> 00:14:35.954
and the federal government than the weak

00:14:35.954 --> 00:14:39.242
Articles of Confederation,
while ensuring that

00:14:39.242 --> 00:14:42.673
the people still retained
their natural rights.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:44.186
