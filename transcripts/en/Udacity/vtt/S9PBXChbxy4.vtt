00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.480
And identifying the purpose of a softer system means

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.980
defining the requirements for the system. And if you have

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.540
ever done anything like that, for example, we did

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.060
it for the first project in the previous mini course,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.720
you will know that it is an extremely hard

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.760
task. Identifying the purpose of the software and defining its

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
requirements is very, very hard. Why is it so hard?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.560
First of all, the purpose of most systems is inherently,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920
extremely complex, so this has to do with the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.330
sheer complexity of the purpose of the requirements. Just think

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.810
of how complex is the functionality provided by most systems.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.790
Second, it is hard, very hard to extract from humans

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.780
this purpose and make it explicit. So, paraphrasing a

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.130
famous quote from the late Steve Jobs, often people don't

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.475
know what they want until you show it to them.

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.490
It's hard to figure out what people really want. Third,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.260
requirements often change over time. Customers change their

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.490
mind. Designing and building a system raises new requirements.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.270
So for many reasons requirements tend not to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.760
be stable, tend to evolve. And that, of course,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.440
makes it harder to collect them. Finally, for

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.600
any realistic system, there are many stakeholders and they

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.990
often have conflicting goals and requirements. And it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.900
can be very hard to reconcile the possibly conflicting

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.630
requirements that might emerge in these cases. So for all these reasons,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.230
it is very, very difficult to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.930
perform requirements engineering in an effective way.
