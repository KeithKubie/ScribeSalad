00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.180
NARRATOR: This
picture is creepy.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.920
There's no other way to say it.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.190
One tattered doll missing
the top of its head

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.290
slumped up against the wall,
next to another doll wearing

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.350
a baby-sized gas mask.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.760
But it turns out this is just
the tip of the creepy iceberg.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.570
The place where this photo
was taken is full of scenes

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.290
just as nightmare-inducing
as this.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.640
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.664
The person responsible for this
haunting photo is this guy.

00:00:26.664 --> 00:00:28.330
TIM KNIFTON: Hi, my
name is Tim Knifton.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.540
I'm from South Wales
in the United Kingdom,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.680
and I'm an urban explorer.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.130
Photographs taken in one
of the many small nurseries

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.030
within the abandoned
city of Pripyat,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.520
which is part of the
Chernobyl exclusion zone.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.330
NARRATOR: On the morning
of April 26, 1986,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.490
the Chernobyl Nuclear
Power Plant in Ukraine

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.710
suffered a terrible accident,
resulting in explosions, fires,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.600
and the deaths of 28 people.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.490
It also sent harmful radiation
into the air, which forced

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.120
an evacuation of the area.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.140
And still to this
day, no one is allowed

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.380
to live within 30
kilometers of the site.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.360
This is the Chernobyl
exclusion zone,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.202
and it is still a very
dangerous place to go.

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:05.660
TIM KNIFTON: Being
urban explorers,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.750
we've all got our bucket
lists, or our wish

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.020
lists in terms of places
we'd like to go and visit.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.840
Chernobyl is one of the sort
of top places on my list

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.740
that I wanted to see, not just
for photographic opportunities

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.910
and to explore the
buildings, but also

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.070
from a historical perspective
because it's a place that's

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.230
obviously rich in history,
however bad the disaster was,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.560
and to also see it
with my own two eyes.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.000
NARRATOR: The city of Pripyat
sits in the exclusion zone,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.800
and is something of
a time capsule now.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.040
The sudden evacuation
left no time for people

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.370
to gather their things.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.320
Schools, amusement
parks, and homes

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.797
are just how people
left them 30 years ago.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:41.380
TIM KNIFTON: Just to see these
buildings before they fall down

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.300
forever, and just to see these
old relics, these old items

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.850
where people were
evacuated from their homes,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.900
and their businesses,
and their place of work,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.770
and just really seeing
how time has stood still

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.080
and just to see the
element of decay

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.020
and how the place
actually stood,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.701
and how it still stands today.

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:01.450
NARRATOR: And still,
between the radiation

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.270
in the air and the
crumbling buildings,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.130
it's a very dangerous
place to visit.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.574
But it was well
worth it for Tim.

00:02:07.574 --> 00:02:08.990
TIM KNIFTON: As
an urban explorer,

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.770
I wanted to see this
site for a long time.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.100
It's in the top 10
abandoned places to see.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.960
Just part of my
sort of wish list,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.610
I wanted to go and
see these places.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.360
Some people I work with call
me mad because, you know,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.130
go to a place like
that that's the subject

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.770
of nuclear disaster,
rather than go

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.550
on a beach holiday in
their eyes is pretty crazy.

00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:31.880
NARRATOR: If you
liked this video,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.580
check out this one
on dark tourism

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.580
destinations around the world.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.470
MAN: While following a
tour, the tour's idea

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.910
is to show the damages of the
deadliest Wenchuan earthquake

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.624
in recent history.

00:02:45.624 --> 00:02:47.290
NARRATOR: And don't
forget to subscribe.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.123
Thanks for watching.
