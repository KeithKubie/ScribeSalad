00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome back.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.050
Now let's do some more
mechanical advantage problems.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.410
And in this video, we'll focus
on pulleys, which is another

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.260
form of a simple machine.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.105
And we've done some pulley
problems in the past, but now

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:12.200
we'll actually understand what
the mechanical advantage

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.350
inherent in these
machines are.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.370
So let me start with a
very simple pulley.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.190
So this is the ceiling
up here.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.780
I don't know what they call
that part of the pulley.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.540
I should learn my actual
terminology.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.840
But let's say I have that little
disk where the rope

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.170
goes over and it rolls so that
the rope can go over it and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.120
move without having
a lot of friction.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.520
And let's say I have a rope
going over that pulley.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.610
That's my rope.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.740
And at this end, let's say I
have a weight, a 10-Newton

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.730
weight, and I'm going to pull
down on this end to make the

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.160
weight to go up.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.410
So my question to you is what is
the mechanical advantage of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.480
this system?

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.740
What is the force that I have to
pull down in order to lift

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.770
this weight, this 10-Newton
weight in order to produce 10

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.620
Newtons of force upwards?

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.985
Well, in any pulley situation--
and I don't know

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:17.380
if textbooks cover it this way,
but this is how I think

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.610
about it, because you don't
have to memorize formulas.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.920
I just think about, well,
what happens to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.150
the lengths of rope?

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.760
Or what is the total distance
that the object you're trying

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.000
to move travels?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.310
And if you know the distance
that it travels versus the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.040
distance that you have
to pull, you know

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.590
the mechanical advantage.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.880
So in this situation, if I were
to hold the rope at that

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.670
point, and if I were to pull
it down 10 feet or some

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.350
arbitrary distance, what
happens over here?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.300
Well, this weight is
going to move up

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.560
exactly the same amount.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.250
Whatever I pull, if I pull a
foot down here, this weight

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.360
will move up by a foot, so the
distance that I pull here is

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.130
equivalent to the distance
that it pulls up here.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.880
And since we know that the work
in has to equal the work

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.670
out, we know that the force I'm
pulling down has to be the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.080
same as the force or the tension
that the rope is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.530
pulling up here.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.920
And we could have done that when
we learned about tension,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.740
that the tension in the
rope is constant.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.850
I'm producing tension in the
rope when I pull here and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.480
that's the same pulling force of
the tension on the weight.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.180
So this isn't too interesting
of a machine.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.920
All it's doing is I pull down
with a force of 10 Newtons and

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.480
it will pull up with a force
of 10 Newtons, and so the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.550
mechanical advantage is 1, no
real mechanical advantage,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.940
although this could be useful.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.590
Maybe it's easier for
me to pull down than

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.880
for me to pull up.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.810
Or at some point, maybe I can't
reach up here, so it's

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.930
nice for me to pull down here
where I can reach and the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.260
object will keep going up
like in a flag pole or

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.160
something like that.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.820
So this could still be useful
even though its mechanical

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.220
advantage is only 1.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.270
So let's see if we can construct
a pulley situation

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.170
where the mechanical advantage
is more than 1.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.810
So let's say over here at the
top, I still have the same

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.080
pulley that's attached to the
ceiling, but I'm going to add

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.766
slight variation here.

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.700
I have another pulley here.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:32.315
And now let me do the other
pulley down here.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.470
And then let me see if I can
draw my rope in a good way.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.010
So my rope starts up going up
like that, then it comes back

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.820
down, comes around the second
pulley, and now this is

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.330
attached to the ceiling
up here.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.280
The second pulley is
actually where the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.660
weight is attached to.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.750
And let's just call it a
10-Newton weight again,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.610
although it doesn't really
matter what the weight is.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.030
Let's figure out what the
mechanical advantage is.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.430
So the same question.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.930
And this is really the question
you always have to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.850
ask yourself.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.150
If I were take a point on this
rope and if I were to pull it

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.399
2 feet down, so let's see I take
this point and I move it

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.970
2 feet down, what essentially
happens to the rope?

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.480
Well, every point on the
rope's going to move

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.720
2 feet to the right.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.640
I guess you can view it this way
if you view that motion is

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.330
to the right.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.780
But if this length of rope is
getting 2 feet shorter, what

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.740
is this length of
rope getting?

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.410
Well, this entire length of rope
is also going to get 2

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.530
feet shorter, this entire length
of rope right here.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.940
But this entire length of rope
is split between this side--

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.882
let me do it in different
color-- between this

00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:58.050
side and this side.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.420
So if I make this side of the
rope shorter-- I mean, the

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.660
rope goes through the whole
thing, but if I take this side

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.080
of the rope and I pull
down by 2 feet,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.080
what is going to happen?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.590
Well, this is going to
get 1 foot shorter.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.840
This rope is going to
get 1 foot shorter.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.960
This is going to go 1 foot
shorter and this length of the

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.590
rope is going to get
1 foot shorter.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.440
And how do I know that?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.070
Well, this is all
the same rope.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.070
And if this is getting 1 foot
shorter, and this is one

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.950
getting 1 foot shorter, it makes
sense this whole thing

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.510
is getting 2 feet shorter.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.520
But the important thing to
realize, if each of these are

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.200
getting 1 foot shorter,
then this weight is

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.110
only moving up 1 foot.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.440
So when I pull the rope down 2
feet here, this weight only

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.850
moves up 1 foot.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.320
So what is the work
that I'm doing?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.560
Well, the work in is the same
as the work out, and we know

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.960
what the work out is.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.100
The work out is going to
be the force that this

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.530
contraption or this machine is
pulling upwards with, and

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.070
that's 10 Newtons, so the
workout is equal to 10 Newtons

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.255
times the distance
that the force is

00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:05.730
pulling in, times 1 foot.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.750
Oh, why did I do feet?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.000
I should do meters.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.565
That's not a good thing
for me to do.

00:06:12.565 --> 00:06:15.170
That should be meters.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.360
I shouldn't mix English
and metric system.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.840
So 10 Newtons times 1 meter,
so it equals 10 joules.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.310
And this has to be the
work that I've put

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.330
into it, too, right?

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.350
So the work in also has
to be 10 joules.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.890
Well, I know the distance
that I pulled down.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.280
I know I pulled down 2 meters.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.100
So I pulled down 2 meters, so
this has to equal the force

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.890
times the distance.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.360
So the force, which I don't
know, times the distance,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.420
which is 2 meters, is
equal to 10 joules.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.090
So divide both sides by 2, so
the force that I pulled down

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.270
with is 5 Newtons.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.940
So I pulled down 5 Newtons for
2 meters, and it pulls up a

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.100
10-Newton weight for 1 meter.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.780
Force times distance is equal
to force times distance.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.800
So what was the input force?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.050
The input force is equal to 5
Newtons and the output force

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.280
of this machine is equal
to 10 Newtons.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.650
Mechanical advantage is the
output over the input, so the

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.110
mechanical advantage is equal
to the force output by the

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.400
force input, which equals
10/5, which equals 2.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.970
And that makes sense, because
I have to pull twice as much

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:32.280
for this thing to move up
half of that distance.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.520
Let's see if we can do another
mechanical advantage problem.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.410
Actually, let's do a really
simple one that we've really

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.690
been working with a long time.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.050
Let's say that I have a wedge.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.760
A wedge is actually considered
a machine, which it took me a

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.220
little while to get my
mind around that, but

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.940
a wedge is a machine.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.200
And why is a wedge a machine?

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.670
Because it gives you mechanical
advantage.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.770
So if I have this wedge here.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:05.580
And this is a 30-degree angle,
if this distance up here,

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.260
let's call this distance
D, what is this

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.630
distance going to be?

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.530
Well, it's going to
be D sine of 30.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.540
And we know that the sine of 30
degrees, hopefully by this

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.520
point, is 1/2, so this
is going to be 1/2D.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.190
You might want to review the
trigonometry a little bit if

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.800
that doesn't completely
ring a bell for you.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.020
So if I take an object, if I
take a box-- and let's assume

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.280
it has no friction.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.970
We're not going to go into
the whole normal

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.240
force and all that.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.200
If I take a box, and I push it
with some force all the way up

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.200
here, what is the mechanical
advantage of this system?

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.670
Well, when the box is up
here, we know what its

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.220
potential energy is.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.820
Its potential energy is going
to be the weight of the box.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.510
So let's say this is
a 10-Newton box.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.790
The potential energy at this
point is going to be 10

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.750
Newtons times its height.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.540
So potential energy at this
point has to equal 10 Newtons

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.870
times the height, which is
going to be 5 joules.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:11.380
And that's also the amount of
work one has to put into the

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.530
system in order to get it into
this state, in order to get it

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.380
this high in the air.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.090
So we know that we would have
to put 5 joules of work in

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.260
order to get the box
up to this point.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.490
So what is the force that
we had to apply?

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.490
Well, it's that force, that
input force, times this

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.310
distance has to equal
5 joules.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.810
So this input force-- oh, sorry,
this is going to be--

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.610
sorry, this isn't 5 joules.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.700
It's 10 times 1/2 times
the distance.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.820
It's 5D joules.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.480
This isn't some kind of units.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.720
It's 10 Newtons times the
distance that we're up, and

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.610
that's 1/2D, so it's
5D joules.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.860
Sorry for confusing you.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.030
And so the force I'm pushing
here times this distance has

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.220
to also equal to 5D joules.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.500
I just remembered, I
just used D as a

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.820
variable the whole time.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.710
Dividing both sides by
D, what do I get?

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:14.780
The input force had to be
equal to 5 Newtons.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.370
I'm dividing both sides
by D meters.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.650
So I inputted 5 Newtons of force
and I was able to lift

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:24.370
essentially a 10-Newton
object.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.410
So what is the mechanical
advantage?

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.390
Well, it's the force output,
10 Newtons, divided by the

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.195
force input, 5 Newtons.

00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:34.120
The mechanical advantage is 2.
