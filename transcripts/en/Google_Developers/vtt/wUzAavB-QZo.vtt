00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:07.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.660
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is I/O Live.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.360
You just saw the keynote where
Sundar and team brought you

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.790
through the latest product
and platform innovations

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.720
from Google.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.270
They covered Google News,
Android, Google Assistant,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.880
Google Maps, Waymo, and more.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.790
We now have a few special guests
joining us to recap just a few

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.920
of the announcements
for developers.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.710
Hi Wayne, thanks for
joining us on I/O '18 Live.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.312
Let's talk about
Google Assistant.

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:33.520
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Hi, Timothy.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.440
Today, we heard about
how the Google Assistant

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.470
is becoming more naturally
conversational and visually

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.455
assistive.

00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:41.830
There's new voices you can
choose from to make the Google

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.880
Assistant your own.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.220
We have continued
conversation for more natural

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.050
back-and-forth conversation.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.780
We have multiple actions so
you can ask for multiple things

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.560
at once.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.920
And we are pretty pleased with
which the Assistant understands

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.260
and responds to
polite conversation

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.220
with positive reinforcement.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.250
These improvements
really help everyone

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.490
have a more natural conversation
with their Assistant.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.690
Also, we unveiled a new visual
canvas for the Assistant

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.640
across screens, which brings
the simplicity of voice

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.950
together with a rich
visual experience.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.380
I really love the live
demos of this one.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.360
And more importantly
for developers,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.880
Google Assistant is now
on 500 million devices.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.474
It's really easy to build
with Actions on Google.

00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:23.890
So if you've been
trying to decide

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.290
if you should build Actions
for the Google Assistant,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.640
now's the time.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Wayne.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.010
All right, let's
talk about Android.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.370
Dan, there was a lot.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.824
Can you try and
summarize for us?

00:01:36.824 --> 00:01:37.990
DAN GALPIN: I'll do my best.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.282
It's great to see us taking
advantage on-device machine

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:42.740
learning at the OS level to
improve battery life and system

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.330
health.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.788
Whether that's
anticipating the way

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:46.420
apps are used with
adaptive battery,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.586
we're looking at the way
the brightness sliders used

00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:50.820
to help anticipate screen
brightness preferences.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.364
But most importantly
for developers,

00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:54.280
you can take advantage
of Android's prediction

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.620
by implementing App
Actions, allowing your app

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.604
to be surfaced in places
like the Launcher,

00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:00.520
smart tech selection in
the Play Store search,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.050
and the Google Assistant.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.210
Slices are something I've
been closely following.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.160
They allow developers to
create an interactive snippet

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.368
of their app that can be
searched in different places

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:10.144
in the OS using templatized UI.

00:02:10.144 --> 00:02:12.310
For developers who want to
leverage machine learning

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.802
within their apps,
we have ML Kit,

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:15.760
which is across platform,
hardware accelerated,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.150
Firebase API that supports text
recognition, face detection,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.524
image labeling, and more.

00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:21.940
Users are going
to love what we've

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.070
done to simplify things and
help with their digital wellness

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.820
in Android.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.440
And developers are going to
love the way Android will

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.700
be surfacing their content.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.674
I'm looking forward
to your feedback.

00:02:30.674 --> 00:02:31.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Dan.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.510
Mike, what's going
on with Google Maps?

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.910
MIKE PEGG: Thanks, Timothy.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.310
So the mission for Google
Maps for the last 13 years

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.960
has been to help you
in the real world

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.150
and help people everywhere
in their everyday lives--

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.700
mapping every road, every
building, every business

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.170
because it matters.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.930
All the great new AI technology
you heard about in the keynote

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.450
is really helping us to
make vast improvements

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.910
to build on this mission
for our users, things

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.710
like automatically
adding addresses

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.180
from street view images.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.520
Think about rural places
in Africa or big cities

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.220
like Lagos or a dense
urban environment,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.260
places that haven't
been well mapped.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.450
Using this computer
vision technology,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.250
we can look at these
street view images

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.736
and literally put new
places on the map.

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:14.110
All this new data will help
developers in these countries

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.815
build new location-based
apps for their users.

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:18.940
I'm also really excited
about the new features that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.130
will let you know more
about trending places

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.915
based on interests and context.

00:03:22.915 --> 00:03:24.790
This is something I know
my wife and I always

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.470
struggle with when we're
trying to make decisions

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.553
on where to take our kids
for a family dinner out.

00:03:28.553 --> 00:03:29.740
Like, what just opened?

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.656
And based on our interests
and what we already

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:33.130
like, where should we go?

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.492
This will be great for
users and local businesses.

00:03:37.492 --> 00:03:38.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks, Mike.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.160

below for links to get started.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.430
