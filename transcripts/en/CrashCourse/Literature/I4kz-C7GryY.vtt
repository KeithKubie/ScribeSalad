00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course English Literature and THIS is Romeo and Juliet,

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.340
written in 1595 or 1596 and often called
the greatest love story of all time.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.500
Which, when you think about it, is a very strange
thing to say about a play that features, like,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.920
one off-stage sex scene
and like seven on-stage fatalities.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.760
I mean, let's quickly review the plot: Boy, Romeo,
goes to a party trying to get over a girl, with whom

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.520
he is completely obsessed, but then he meets another girl, Juliet, and becomes obsessed with her.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:38.200
Their families hate each other, but despite that or possibly because of it they fall madly in love and get married the next day whereupon immediately a family feud breaks out.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.630
No, Thought Bubble, not that kind of family feud.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.519
Yes, that kind. Several people get killed,
including Juliet's cousin, who is offed by Romeo.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.200
And that means Romeo has to flee. Juliet takes
a sleeping potion to avoid another marriage.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.040
And then Romeo comes back, finds her
sleeping, thinks she's dead, kills himself.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.880
And then, she wakes up and kills herself.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.680
And then the families end the feud. Yay.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.160
That we consider this romance says quite
a lot about humans.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.800
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, but they love
each other so much, you know?

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.489
It's like his life literally
isn't worth living without her.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:11.360
Yes, Me from the Past, her being a woman that
he's known for, like, a few hundred...hours.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.500
And yet, every year, thousands of people write to
Juliet care of her hometown of Verona, Italy,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.409
and the citizens of Verona write back.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.080
You, in fact, when you're in college, will go to Verona
and visit all the touristy Romeo and Juliet sites,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.800
and that very night you will be at a Veronese night club and you will meet a girl named Antonia,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.500
and you will believe that you really love her and
that it is the kind of love that can last a lifetime.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.720
I'm gonna hook up with her?

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.609
No, at the end of the night,
you lean in to kiss her like...and no.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:47.460
[Theme Music]

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.060
So Shakespeare didn't invent the story of Romeo and Juliet, but he made really important changes to it.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.439
His immediate source material was
a 3,000 line narrative poem called

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.539
The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and
Juliet, written by Arthur Brooke in 1562,

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.199
which itself borrowed from a tradition of tragic romances dating back at least to Ovid's Metamorphosis.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.479
So Shakespeare obviously changed some
of the names but more importantly, he

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.370
introduced a lot of narrative complexity.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.020
I mean, for Brooke, the story of
Romeus and Juliet was a cautionary tale.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.200
He calls them: "A couple of unfortunate lovers,
thralling themselves to unhonest desire,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.400
neglecting the authority and advice of parents
and friends..., attempting  all adventures

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.640
of peril for the attaining of their wished lust...
abusing the honourable name of lawful marriage."

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.040
So, Brooke's poem is just an ordinary story about naughty teenagers who receive the standard punishment for their naughtiness, which is, of course, death.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.550
And, of course, as you know from
watching contemporary horror movies:

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.140
if you're a woman and you wanna live
til the end, you better be a virgin.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.620
But Shakespeare offers a much more
compassionate portrait of Romeo &amp; Juliet

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.620
and encourages us to empathize with them.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.620
I mean, Romeo and Juliet are obviously hot for
each other, but they're also kind of polite about it.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.990
I mean, witness the physical distance
between them in their most amorous scene.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.320
I mean, their most amorous on-stage scene.
I mean, obviously, they d-- they do do it.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.360
And they use the kind of sacred metaphors

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.340
that etiquette experts in Shakespeare's
day recommended for courtship.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.900
I mean, Romeo calls Juliet a "holy shrine;" and
then Juliet welcomes the flirtation by calling him a
"good pilgrim."

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.720
Also, Shakespeare's Juliet is much younger:
She's 16 or 18 in other versions of the story,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.200
but in Shakespeare, she's only 13, and so it's
hard to see her as, like, a dishonest floozy.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.660
I mean, even in a profoundly misogynistic age, it's
hard to see a 13-year-old stab herself and be like,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.820
"Yeah! She got what was coming to her."

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.140
So, Shakespeare was also likely influenced by the love poems of Petrarch, who the character Mercutio mentions.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.280
Petrarch's work is much more approving
of intense adoration than Brooke's is.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.400
For instance,
he believed in of love at first sight.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.920
And he had to because all of his poems were written
to a woman he never met, and only saw once.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.120
But then the play also isn't, like, a YOLO endorsement
of following your heart because following your heart

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.700
does get Romeo and Juliet dead.
All right, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.700
So Shakespeare sets the play in Verona, Italy, which isn't a surprise, since the source material sets it there as well,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.310
and also because Shakespeare set most
of his plays away from England.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.150
If you're going to talk about morality and values -- like individuals responsibilities to their own interests versus

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.280
their responsibilities to their families and the larger
social order, for instance -- it's much safer to set it in faraway Italy.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.600
Romeo and Juliet is a love story,
but it's also a political story:

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.020
The Montagues and Capulets consistently ignore the
proclamations of the Prince of Verona, and arguably

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.980
Romeo's biggest hurdle to marrying Juliet is that the Prince exiles him and promises to execute him should

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.940
he return to the city. Should you be loyal
first to your own feelings? Or to your family?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.200
Or to your faith? Or to your prince?

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.120
These are not just questions of
Will That Hot Girl Go Out With Me; they

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.700
are in fact questions that were central to Elizabethan England, and as the critic Northrup Frye pointed out,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.389
whenever Shakespeare wanted to write
about the problems of feuding nobles,

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.220
he either set his plays in the distant
past or in a land far, far away.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.800
But when it comes to the actual romance, it's all very hot-blooded and Mediterranean and Catholic.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:08.630
It's no coincidence that in Protestant England, much of Romeo and Juliet's tragedy is facilitated by a slippery Catholic friar.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.659
The stereotype of Italians as passionate
and impulsive goes back a long way,

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:16.219
to well before Shakespeare, and that
helps explain Romeo and Juliet's actions.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.840
I mean, would English lovers
act like this? Probably not.

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.909
They'd be too busy being pale
and avoiding the rain

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.870
and eating shepherd's pie and whatnot, but
this is just what those Italians would do.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.780
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Okay, let's turn briefly
to the play's structure.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.759
Romeo and Juliet, you'll be
surprised to learn, is a tragedy.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.119
And Shakespeare's tragedies follow the same
structure first described by Aristotle in the 5th century BCE

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.480
Tragedy occurs when a mostly good character or
characters of noble extraction (here, Romeo and Juliet)

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.460
make an error (getting married so quickly, ignoring
the family feud) and are brought low (double suicide).

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.300
Shakespeare wouldn't have read Aristotle, but he probably would have been familiar with Latin
criticism of the Poetics.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.500
Now I don't want to generalize about Aristotle and I know that he has a vocal group of supporters among

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.660
Crash Course commenters, but it is widely known
that Aristotle was 100% wrong 100% of the time.

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.610
If you watched our series on World History, for instance,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.310
you'll recall that Aristotle believed that
some people were just naturally slave-ey.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.340
But while this narrative of tragedy that
noble people suffer when they act badly

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.759
isn't actually reflected very often in the real
world, it remains a really powerful idea,

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.310
both in our fiction and in the
way we imagine the world around us.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:29.520
And it's a big part of why we're so fascinated when we
see the once-great suffer downfalls, whether it's Lance Armstrong

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.180
or Warren G. Harding or Marilyn Monroe or Lindsay Lohan or the entirety of The Jackson family.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.270
But what makes Shakespearean tragedy
so interesting is the complexity

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.180
he introduces to that Aristotelian structure. Complexity,
by the way, not seen in the downfall of Lindsay Lohan.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.360
I mean, at least by Elizabethan standards, Romeo
and Juliet both make mistakes, but they're mistakes

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.740
born of love, and it is because of their deaths as result of these mistakes that peace and harmony return to the streets of Verona.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.620
So you can read it as a mere Aristotelian tragedy, but
you can also read it as a narrative of tragic sacrifice,

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:04.110
or as a story about love
being worth the price of death.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.420
Oh, it's time for the open letter?

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.580
An Open Letter to Star-Crossed Lovers.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.260
But first, let's see what's in
The Secret Compartment today.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.539
Oh, it's Hazel and Augustus, noted star-crossed
lovers from my book, The Fault in Our Stars.

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.859
Hi, guys! Uh, I'm gonna leave you in there, but keep it PG.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.319
Dear Star-Crossed Lovers,
You go pretty much all the way back in literature.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.020
You're very helpful for thinking about,
like, fate and free will.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.760
But you're also kind of sexy.
So if you want to think about free will,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.260
but also give people high-quality entertainment,
you are the natural choice, star-crossed lovers.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.969
But I wonder if this constant exploration of star-crossed-lovers-ness also leads to a kind of celebration of it

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:45.820
and whether actual lovers who needn't be
star-crossed try to invent star-crossed-ness.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.160
Yeah, don't do that. It's unhealthy.
For Emily Dickinson's sake, just let yourself be happy.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.800
Best wishes,
John Green

00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:56.409
Okay, so let's turn to the actual writing.
Romeo and Juliet has both poetry and prose;

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:59.500
it's pretty easy to tell which is which by
looking at, you know, the line length.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.259
The lines of poetry are shorter and usually conform to the same metric structure, called iambic pentameter.

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:08.360
An iamb is a poetic foot consisting
of a stressed and unstressed syllable.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.620
And not, like, in the anxiety sense, but in the sense
of, you know, putting an emphasis on a syllable.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.220
And pentameter means that
there are five feet in a line.

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:18.339
This sounds very complicated, but it's
actually very easy. Let's try it on the prologue:

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:24.439
Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.060
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.500
Now my performance just then would not have
gotten my hired at Shakespeare's theater company.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.360
Ideally, you don't read iambs in that sing-song-y way,
but iambic pentameter pops up all over the place.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.920
John Keats' last will and testament
was a single line of iambic pentameter:

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.330
My chest of books divide among my friends.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.300
And much of our conversation
takes places within iambs.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.930
Like, that last sentence for instance.
I mean, this isn't genius stuff.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.500
My two-year-old son regularly
uses iambic pentameter,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.500
like every time he says,
"Daddy, I want to go to Steak N Shake."

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.160
Iambic pentameter is a way of reflecting

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.690
the natural rhythms of human speech
in English, while also heightening it.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.490
And it's worth paying attention to especially when Shakespeare messes around with the meter,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:10.520
as in that famous line,
"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?"

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:16.260
That line would be iambic pentameter but something
keeps messing it up -- specifically, Romeo's name.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.600
And it's his name, of course, that is the problem.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.820
Were he not named Romeo Montague, there'd
be no issue, in the line or in the play.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.960
And I know that when we first encounter
Shakespeare, the language can seem difficult.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.440
That's because unlike French or Italian,
English has evolved a lot since the 16th-century.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.840
Also, Shakespeare was constantly using words
in new ways, as in this play, for instance,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.380
when he became the first person ever
to describe a hot girl as an "angel."

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.620
But the difficulty and the slowness of the reading
allows you to pay attention to the genius of
Shakespeare's language.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:50.180
So, I know sometimes it feels more like translation than reading, but if you stick with it, you will find yourself in Shakespeare's world.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.440
Actually, it might help a little to imagine the
plays as they were originally staged

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.970
because the Elizabethan playhouse was
very different from theaters of today.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.740
There were a few indoor, private theaters and a
couple more in palaces and at the Inns of Court,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.240
but Shakespeare's company typically
performed in large theaters like the Globe,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.340
partly open to the air and
partly covered by a thatched roof.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.220
Now, I don't know if these thatched roofs inspired Rock
Master Scott and the Dynamic Three to record their hit

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:20.280
song, "The Roof Is on Fire," however the roof was often
on fire, particularly when plays necessitated cannons.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.520
And as there was limited water and firefighting resources, it was sometimes necessary to let the William Faulkner burn.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.820
So, if you had the cash for it, you sat on tiered benches in the galleries with a good view of the stage.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.350
But if you had less money,
you stood in the pit.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:37.640
And you usually stood there for more than three hours.
These weren't short plays. Well, except for Macbeth.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.660
Ah!
I should have said "the Scottish play."

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.370
Romeo and Juliet wasn't performed at the Globe, but
probably at a theater called the Curtain, slightly older,

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.610
but otherwise very similar, although
on the good side of the river Thames.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.860
Shakespeare referred to it as
"the Wooden O."

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.800
It was rediscovered earlier this year
by archaeologists working in London.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.100
Theaters like the Globe and the Curtain were
dirty, they probably didn't smell very good,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.840
and while cellphones didn't go off in the
middle of plays, they were not quiet places.

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.980
Today, you go to the theater and everyone
gets quiet when the lights go down,

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.680
but there were no lights.
There also weren't any microphones.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.240
There was nothing to focus attention
on the stage except the play itself,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.800
so people drank and ate and jeered at the
actors if they thought the performances were bad.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.020
So Romeo and Juliet may be an amazing work of poetry, but it also pandered to the popular tastes of the time.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.680
I mean, Renaissance theater wasn't,
like, high art.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.750
So, yes, nobles went to the theater,
but it wasn't considered classy.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.570
I mean, a lot of times people
were literally choosing between

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.990
seeing this play and watching a chained
bear try to fight off a bunch of dogs.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.110
So this wasn't highbrow entertainment,

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.510
and I hope it doesn't feel highbrow to
you just because of the fancy language.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.080
Shakespeare knew how to navigate
between high and low culture.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.100
He knew how to amuse and entertain us
while also grappling with big questions

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.270
about honor and fate and duty
and human frailty.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.190
And the idea that something can be both
fun and smart still resonates today.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.900
I mean, isn't that why you watch
Crash Course? And yes, I went there.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.140
We are of Shakespearean quality.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.120
Next week we'll delve further into
the themes of Romeo and Juliet

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.120
and discuss whether it's really love or
lust at the heart of their relationship.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.200
Thanks for watching. I'll see you then.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.440
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.280
The associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by Alexis Soloski and myself.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.000
And our graphics team
is Thought Bubble.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.640
Every week, instead of cursing,
I use the names of writers I like.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.890
If you'd like to suggest writers,
you can do so in the comments

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.570
where you can also ask questions
about today's video

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.790
that will be answered by our team
of highly-trained English people.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.550
Thanks for watching Crash Course. And as we say
in my hometown, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
