00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.260
so Wi-Fi is a wireless way of getting
access to internet and as a result we're

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.580
bombarded by these radio waves. So can we use
them to say something about the environment?

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.950
because these signals interact with
objects so we have this very natural

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.169
question, how much can they tell us about
the environment? we basically wanted to see x-ray

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.790
vision with Wi-Fi.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.030
so imagine there is an area where walls
and behind those wars there's an object

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.340
lets say two robots move outside of the
area, one is transmitting a signal with a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.900
wifi card and the other is receiving it and
that transmission goes through the object in

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.489
in a sense we could say they leave a signature on
the signal and that signature is

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.559
what we're trying to use and from that
reception figure out something about the

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.630
object and the more measurements they
can collect they can do that imaging

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.840
better. That means being able to tell you
the location of objects, the geometry in

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.000
shape we've shown that you can actually
do this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.980
but we actually could do a little bit
more because what we extract also tells us

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.970
something about the material properties
and so what we hope is that in the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.880
future should be able to say something
more about what kind of object is there.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.200
An application could be search and rescue. So imagine Japan's tsunami in 2011, in
such a scenario, for instance, a nuclear spill

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.440
and is too dangerous for humans to go in
it would be great if we can have unmanned

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.500
vehicles that from outside can assess
the situation inside and figure out

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:59.759
what's going on inside behind and then
help guide humans to safe areas

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.130
