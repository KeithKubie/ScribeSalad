at South by Southwest I'll be speaking

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
at South by Southwest I'll be speaking
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.700
at South by Southwest I'll be speaking
on a panel about transit and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710
on a panel about transit and
 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.960
on a panel about transit and
accessibility there's a lot of work

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970
accessibility there's a lot of work
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.270
accessibility there's a lot of work
taking place to improve access to

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280
taking place to improve access to
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.369

transit for people with disabilities and

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379
transit for people with disabilities and
 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.540
transit for people with disabilities and
technology is making it more and more

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
technology is making it more and more
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.349

there's particularly a lot of work in

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
there's particularly a lot of work in
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.800
there's particularly a lot of work in
the space of universal design so can you

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
the space of universal design so can you
 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.009
the space of universal design so can you
make designs that privileged people who

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
make designs that privileged people who
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.589
make designs that privileged people who
have higher needs that the solutions

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599
have higher needs that the solutions
 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.990

interfaces so lots of people currently

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070
interfaces so lots of people currently
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069
interfaces so lots of people currently
use mobile phones to get transit

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
use mobile phones to get transit

them the information that they want and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
them the information that they want and
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.740

if you think about blind riders they

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
if you think about blind riders they
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.319
if you think about blind riders they
have to listen to all of the information

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
have to listen to all of the information
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.619

auditorally so giving people a reduced
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.400
auditorally so giving people a reduced
set that's almost always exactly what

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
set that's almost always exactly what
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680

disabilities who struggle more to sort

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
disabilities who struggle more to sort
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.010

of figure out what is the needed

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
of figure out what is the needed
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.539
of figure out what is the needed
information versus the unneeded

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549
