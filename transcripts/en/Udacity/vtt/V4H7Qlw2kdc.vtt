00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.770
So, I've opened up jsonlint.com
which will tell us whether or

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.100
not this JSON is in the right format.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.012
Go ahead and copy this object
in just using the curly braces.

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:12.880
I don't need to copy var education.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.716
Paste it in and click Validate.

00:00:16.716 --> 00:00:22.718
And scrolling down we can see that
this is, in face, a valid JSON.

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:24.215
&gt;&gt; What if there were errors?

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:27.732
Like what if we erase this comma,
right here?

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:31.112
&gt;&gt; Well, JSONLint would tell us where
the error is, which is a big help.

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:36.382
Let's see, I'll come over here, I'll
delete this comma, and click Validate.

00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:41.107
And we can see that there's an error
on Line 11 because we forgot the comma

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.534
that comes before it.

00:00:42.534 --> 00:00:46.763
The good news is that text editors like
Sublime Text also highlight errors and

00:00:46.763 --> 00:00:49.380
help us figure out where
our syntax went wrong.
