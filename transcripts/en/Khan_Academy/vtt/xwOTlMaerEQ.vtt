00:00:00.352 --> 00:00:02.407
Voiceover: In the last
video on taxing hamburgers,

00:00:02.407 --> 00:00:04.673
I did a somewhat artificial thing

00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:06.437
where I taxed hamburgers

00:00:06.437 --> 00:00:08.439
with an absolute dollar amount.

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.352
Typically, consumption
taxes are a percentage

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:13.852
of the actual price of the goods.

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:17.071
For example, sales taxes might be 8% or 9%

00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:18.871
of whatever you are buying.

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:21.187
Let's think about how the supply curve,

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.405
as perceived by the consumers, would look

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.852
if we had a percentage tax.

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:29.604
Now, our government, instead of taxing

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:32.938
$1 per hamburger, let's
say that their tax is,

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:36.870
and I'll make it big just to
make it a clear, so we can see

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.937
the result of it, let's say
their tax is 20% of the price.

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.603
20% of the price of the hamburger.

00:00:44.603 --> 00:00:46.186
Let's think what's going to happen.

00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:47.352
Just like we saw in the last video,

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:48.936
in order for producers to even think

00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:51.268
about producing that first hamburger,

00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:54.004
they need to get $2 per hamburger for it,

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:55.871
because that's their opportunity cost.

00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:59.340
Using those same inputs,
that same labor and resources

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.404
their other opportunity
would give them at least $2,

00:01:03.404 --> 00:01:05.669
so you have to give them at
least $2 in order to focus

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:07.002
on hamburgers.

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.007
Every incremental hamburger after that,

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:10.838
the opportunity cost goes more,

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:13.134
because now they'll be using
things that are slightly

00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:15.424
less suited for making
hamburgers and maybe slightly

00:01:15.424 --> 00:01:18.468
more suited for making other things.

00:01:18.468 --> 00:01:21.340
Now, that very first
hamburger, you need to get $2

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.133
for it from the supplier point of view,

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.257
but from the consumer point
of view, they can't just pay

00:01:26.257 --> 00:01:27.267
$2 for it.

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:31.600
They're going to have to
pay $2 plus 20% of the $2.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.163
20% of $2 is $0.40, so from
the consumer's point of view

00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:41.492
I'll do it in blue, they're
going to have to pay about $2.40.

00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:44.406
Right over here, if you
want to get the suppliers

00:01:44.406 --> 00:01:48.489
to produce about 2.5
million hamburgers per day,

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:50.406
they're going to have
to get, especially for

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:53.986
those incremental
hamburgers, in order to get

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:56.921
2.5 million hamburgers
produced, you're going to have

00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:59.320
to give $3 per hamburger for the supplier,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.552
but the consumer's not
going to be able to pay $3,

00:02:01.552 --> 00:02:04.217
they're going to have to pay $3 plus 20%,

00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:11.367
so that's $3.60, so that will
put us right about there.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:14.815
If you go further,
instead of $4, if you want

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:16.650
the producers to produce right

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.983
around 4 million hamburgers
per day, you'd have

00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:22.119
to pay them $4, but the
consumers would have to pay

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:24.150
20% more than that, so
they're going to have

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.452
to pay $4.80.

00:02:26.452 --> 00:02:28.519
What you're going to see
is, from the consumer's

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.982
point of view, the supply
curve, I should say,

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:33.565
is going to look something like this.

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:36.586
It's not going to shift a fixed amount up,

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:40.064
it's going to shift 20% up.

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:42.650
Let me do that ...

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.983
It's going to shift something like that.

00:02:44.983 --> 00:02:46.563
For lower values, it's going to shift

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:50.316
a less absolute amount,
because 20% of $2 is less

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:55.316
than $20 of $3, which
is less than 20% of $4,

00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:58.316
so as we have more
quantity and more price,

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:00.233
it'll shift up more and more,

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:05.784
because 20% will then become
a larger absolute amount

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:07.651
so the shift will look
something like this.

00:03:07.651 --> 00:03:15.523
At any given point, that is 20%.

00:03:15.523 --> 00:03:20.118
It's 20% higher than the
price that the suppliers

00:03:20.118 --> 00:03:22.650
and the producers would
see, so it's going to be 20%

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.733
than $6 there, so this is
going to be $1.20 higher,

00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:28.452
but you have the same exact phenomenon

00:03:28.452 --> 00:03:30.520
that we saw in the previous video.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.451
In the previous video, this
entire area was the surplus

00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:39.920
that both the consumers
and the producers share.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.918
Now, the equilibrium quantity is less.

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:48.526
It's going to move right
over there, because we have

00:03:48.526 --> 00:03:50.051
this new curve.

00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:52.206
Our new equilibrium quantity is over here,

00:03:52.206 --> 00:03:54.456
so neither the consumers,
nor the government,

00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:57.718
nor the producers are going
to be able to take advantage

00:03:57.718 --> 00:04:01.586
of this surplus, which was
there when you didn't have

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:02.872
the taxation.

00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:06.916
This is why taxation is
generally considered inefficient.

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:08.261
Obviously you have to do some of it,

00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:09.611
but it's generally inefficient.

00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.947
It reduces some level of
economic activity, at least

00:04:12.947 --> 00:04:15.861
if you make all the
assumptions in this model,

00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:17.789
and you have this dead weight loss.

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.989
This surplus that can't be had by anyone,

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.362
so you still have a dead weight loss.

00:04:27.362 --> 00:04:29.696
If you look at the revenue
that the government

00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:34.587
will now have, it will
still be this quantity.

00:04:34.587 --> 00:04:36.030
It looks like our equilibrium quantity

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.614
is now 3 million hamburgers per day,

00:04:38.614 --> 00:04:40.321
which is about what we
got in the last one.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.613
Obviously I'm not doing
this very precisely,

00:04:42.613 --> 00:04:46.921
and it's going to be $0.60,
so 20% times $3 is $0.60,

00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:49.195
so the height is going to be $0.60.

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:52.780
This height right over
here is $0.60 and the width

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.112
right over here is 3 million hamburgers.

00:04:55.112 --> 00:04:58.280
It's going to be $0.60 per hamburger,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.529
which is 20% of its price per hamburger

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:13.279
times 3 million hamburgers,
gives us $1.8 million per day

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.186
and just like the previous one,

00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:18.453
now the producer's surplus has shrunken.

00:05:18.453 --> 00:05:21.611
The producer's surplus
is now just going to be

00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:23.989
this area right over here.

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:25.945
The producer's surplus is
just going to be that area

00:05:25.945 --> 00:05:27.787
right over there and the consumer surplus

00:05:27.787 --> 00:05:29.455
has also been shrunken.

00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:33.633
It's been bitten into by the tax revenue

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:36.588
and the dead weight loss
takes from both the producer

00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:40.000
and consumer surplus.
