00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.290
concept of topology so I brought my
lunch and here you see it's a cinnamon

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300
lunch and here you see it's a cinnamon
 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.159
lunch and here you see it's a cinnamon
bun yeah here I have another thing I

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169
bun yeah here I have another thing I
 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.809
bun yeah here I have another thing I
have a bagel ok and here I have a

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819
have a bagel ok and here I have a
 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:33.439
have a bagel ok and here I have a
pretzel

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449
pretzel
 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.959
pretzel
- Swedish pretzel with two holes in it

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969
- Swedish pretzel with two holes in it
 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.909
- Swedish pretzel with two holes in it
now for us you know these things are

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919
now for us you know these things are
 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.559
now for us you know these things are
very different this is sweet this is

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569
very different this is sweet this is
 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.529
very different this is sweet this is
perhaps all the different shapes etc but

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539
perhaps all the different shapes etc but
 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.749
perhaps all the different shapes etc but
if you are a topologist you're it

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:04.900
transitions was a phase transition well
 

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:08.220
transitions was a phase transition well
how do you go from a gas to liquid to a

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:08.230
how do you go from a gas to liquid to a
 

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.590
how do you go from a gas to liquid to a
solid you do it that you know you know

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600
solid you do it that you know you know
 

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.880
solid you do it that you know you know
you lower the temperature now what is it

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:14.890
you lower the temperature now what is it
 

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.699
you lower the temperature now what is it
that really happens and these physicists

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:17.709
that really happens and these physicists
 

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:20.100
that really happens and these physicists
have started for a long time and it was

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.110
have started for a long time and it was
 

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.970
have started for a long time and it was
a good idea about how these transition

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:23.980
a good idea about how these transition
 

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.600
a good idea about how these transition
occurs and in particular people believed

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:27.610
occurs and in particular people believed
 

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.090
occurs and in particular people believed
that if you had these very thin layers

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:30.100
that if you had these very thin layers
 

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.579
that if you had these very thin layers
for instance a thin liquid layer of

00:10:32.579 --> 00:10:32.589
for instance a thin liquid layer of
 

00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:36.240
for instance a thin liquid layer of
helium you would never have such a phase

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.250
helium you would never have such a phase
 

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.400
helium you would never have such a phase
transition that had been proven

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:38.410
transition that had been proven
 

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.290
transition that had been proven
mathematically but yes when people prove

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:43.300
mathematically but yes when people prove
 

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.140
mathematically but yes when people prove
that something cannot happen it might be

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:46.150
that something cannot happen it might be
 

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.460
that something cannot happen it might be
that they haven't thought of everything

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:47.470
that they haven't thought of everything
 

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.800
that they haven't thought of everything
and the thing that they did not think of

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:49.810
and the thing that they did not think of
 

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.850
and the thing that they did not think of
in this case was this thing they did not

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:53.860
in this case was this thing they did not
 

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.360
in this case was this thing they did not
think of well not tornadoes but vortices

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:57.370
think of well not tornadoes but vortices
 

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.110
think of well not tornadoes but vortices
a tornado is like a big vortex and it's

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120
a tornado is like a big vortex and it's
 

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.880
a tornado is like a big vortex and it's
topologically in the sense you can have

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:02.890
topologically in the sense you can have
 

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.860
topologically in the sense you can have
one to lead with you're unlucky you have

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:04.870
one to lead with you're unlucky you have
 

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.650
one to lead with you're unlucky you have
two perhaps but you cannot have half a

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:07.660
two perhaps but you cannot have half a
 

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.740
two perhaps but you cannot have half a
tornado topological in the same way as

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:10.750
tornado topological in the same way as
 

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.100
tornado topological in the same way as
the

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:11.110
the
 

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.769
the
number of holes that's a big one here is

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:13.779
number of holes that's a big one here is
 

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:17.190
number of holes that's a big one here is
a small one this is the artist's renders

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200
a small one this is the artist's renders
 

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.300
a small one this is the artist's renders
rendering some layers of liquid helium

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:21.310
rendering some layers of liquid helium
 

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.970
rendering some layers of liquid helium
and you see there are small vortices

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:23.980
and you see there are small vortices
 

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.880
and you see there are small vortices
here here you have a blow-up you can see

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:26.890
here here you have a blow-up you can see
 

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.600
here here you have a blow-up you can see
the liquid is whirling around here now

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:30.610
the liquid is whirling around here now
 

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.670
the liquid is whirling around here now
at very low temperature these vortices

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680
at very low temperature these vortices
 

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.470
at very low temperature these vortices
always comes in pairs actually it's one

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480
always comes in pairs actually it's one
 

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.269
always comes in pairs actually it's one
wort X going in this direction and

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279
wort X going in this direction and
 

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:41.100
wort X going in this direction and
another one going in that direction it's

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.110
another one going in that direction it's
 

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.900
another one going in that direction it's
a pair of vortex and antiwar Tech's they

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:42.910
a pair of vortex and antiwar Tech's they
 

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:45.690
a pair of vortex and antiwar Tech's they
keep together then you raise the

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:45.700
keep together then you raise the
 

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.840
keep together then you raise the
temperature a little bit then what

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:48.850
temperature a little bit then what
 

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.240
temperature a little bit then what
happens is that these were tied pairs

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.250
happens is that these were tied pairs
 

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:55.560
happens is that these were tied pairs
now they will sail away and they become

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:55.570
now they will sail away and they become
 

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.400
now they will sail away and they become
free and that is a case transition a

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:58.410
free and that is a case transition a
 

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.410
free and that is a case transition a
completely new kind of phase transition

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:01.420
completely new kind of phase transition
 

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.009
completely new kind of phase transition
driven by topological effects and this

00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:05.019
driven by topological effects and this
 

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:08.579
driven by topological effects and this
was also something that you could apply

00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:08.589
was also something that you could apply
 

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:13.110
was also something that you could apply
in many places and the basic paper was

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120
in many places and the basic paper was
 

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.290
in many places and the basic paper was
written by coastal isn't ours who found

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:16.300
written by coastal isn't ours who found
 

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.509
written by coastal isn't ours who found
the phase transition and understood the

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519
the phase transition and understood the
 

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:21.600
the phase transition and understood the
vortex mechanism and in a later paper by

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:21.610
vortex mechanism and in a later paper by
 

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.259
vortex mechanism and in a later paper by
Michael Tao eco stirlitz he also worked

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:25.269
Michael Tao eco stirlitz he also worked
 

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:28.250
Michael Tao eco stirlitz he also worked
out the detailed mathematical theory and

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260
out the detailed mathematical theory and
 

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.810
out the detailed mathematical theory and
this is something that applies not only

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:30.820
this is something that applies not only
 

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.360
this is something that applies not only
to helium films but in lots of systems

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.370
to helium films but in lots of systems
 

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.430
to helium films but in lots of systems
and it's been very important for the

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440
and it's been very important for the
 

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.699
and it's been very important for the
following now that was very shortly what

00:12:38.699 --> 00:12:38.709
following now that was very shortly what
 

00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:42.569
following now that was very shortly what
is about now I will answer the question

00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:42.579
is about now I will answer the question
 

00:12:42.579 --> 00:12:45.420
is about now I will answer the question
that you are going to ask namely what's

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:45.430
that you are going to ask namely what's
 

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.319
that you are going to ask namely what's
it good for

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:46.329
it good for
 

00:12:46.329 --> 00:12:48.090
it good for
because I know you're going to ask that

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.100
because I know you're going to ask that
 

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.550
because I know you're going to ask that
but before I ask answer that question

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560
but before I ask answer that question
 

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.560
but before I ask answer that question
let me tell you something that I feel

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:52.570
let me tell you something that I feel
 

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.600
let me tell you something that I feel
deeply about the community feel deeply

yeah well the work my work with in the

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:22.899
yeah well the work my work with in the
 

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:26.430
yeah well the work my work with in the
in the late in in the late 80s and at

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440
in the late in in the late 80s and at
 

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.879
in the late in in the late 80s and at
the time it seemed very abstract and I

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:29.889
the time it seemed very abstract and I
 

00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:32.610
the time it seemed very abstract and I
wrote and wrote in my paper that the the

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:32.620
wrote and wrote in my paper that the the
 

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.650
wrote and wrote in my paper that the the
model I looked at was an interesting

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:34.660
model I looked at was an interesting
 

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.360
model I looked at was an interesting
time model and it was of something which

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:39.370
time model and it was of something which
 

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.430
time model and it was of something which
turned out to be quite like graphene is

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440
turned out to be quite like graphene is
 

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.530
turned out to be quite like graphene is
today and at the time I felt it was of

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540
today and at the time I felt it was of
 

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.150
today and at the time I felt it was of
scientific interest and mathematical

so what what is led to really is that is
taught us that quantum mechanics can

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:06.110
taught us that quantum mechanics can
 

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.260
taught us that quantum mechanics can

have guessed
 

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.410
have guessed
and we haven't understood all the

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:11.420
and we haven't understood all the
 

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.970
and we haven't understood all the
possibilities yet and what these

up really that we have a lot a long way

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.010
up really that we have a lot a long way
 

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.730
up really that we have a lot a long way
to go to disk discover what's possible

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:24.740
to go to disk discover what's possible
 

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.670
to go to disk discover what's possible
and a lot of these a lot of these things

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:27.680
and a lot of these a lot of these things
 

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.040
and a lot of these a lot of these things
were things that one would initially

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.050
were things that one would initially
 

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.670
were things that one would initially
have dreamed were possible and and so

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:33.680
have dreamed were possible and and so
 

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.190
have dreamed were possible and and so
and there's gone on in in in recent

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200
and there's gone on in in in recent
 

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.370
and there's gone on in in in recent
years in the last 10 years this these

years in the last 10 years this these
 

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.170
years in the last 10 years this these
ideas have been extended myth it turned

ideas have been extended myth it turned
 

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.890
ideas have been extended myth it turned
out that a lot of materials but people

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:44.900
out that a lot of materials but people
 

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.810
out that a lot of materials but people
had looked at but many years had

had looked at but many years had
 

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.580
had looked at but many years had
actually did have these topological

actually did have these topological
 

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.230
actually did have these topological

could be extended to two three
 

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.960
could be extended to two three
dimensional materials and just regular

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:16.970
dimensional materials and just regular
 

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.140
dimensional materials and just regular
crystals of things and now people are

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:20.150
crystals of things and now people are
 

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.480
crystals of things and now people are
just looking and they find and you can

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:22.490
just looking and they find and you can
 

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.120
just looking and they find and you can
find topological physics in many places

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:25.130
find topological physics in many places
 

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.100
find topological physics in many places
now and it was just something has been

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.110
now and it was just something has been
 

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.290
now and it was just something has been
completely overlooked because it

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:29.300
completely overlooked because it
 

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.150
completely overlooked because it
occurred on the surface of materials

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:31.160
occurred on the surface of materials
 

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.820
occurred on the surface of materials
rather than in the whole material itself

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:33.830
rather than in the whole material itself
 

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:41.050
rather than in the whole material itself
and and it's really it's I've been very

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:41.060
and and it's really it's I've been very
 

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.270
and and it's really it's I've been very
very surprised by all the recent

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280
very surprised by all the recent
 

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.490
very surprised by all the recent
unexpected discoveries and extensions of

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:45.500
unexpected discoveries and extensions of
 

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.350
unexpected discoveries and extensions of
this and and suddenly people are

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360
this and and suddenly people are
 

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.020
this and and suddenly people are
realizing that the topological effects

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.030
realizing that the topological effects
 

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.670
realizing that the topological effects
in quantum mechanics are just a

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:51.680
in quantum mechanics are just a
 

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.910
in quantum mechanics are just a
tremendously rich subject and tastic

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:54.920
tremendously rich subject and tastic
 

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.420
tremendously rich subject and tastic

the price thank you I would like to know
how you could come up with the idea in

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.050
how you could come up with the idea in
 

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.460
how you could come up with the idea in
the first place of this model well it

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:24.470
the first place of this model well it
 

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.420
the first place of this model well it
was it really was trying to kind of

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:28.430
was it really was trying to kind of
 

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.060
was it really was trying to kind of
crystallized tried trying to come up

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:31.070
crystallized tried trying to come up
 

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:37.870
crystallized tried trying to come up
with a a clear in fact trying to try to

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880
with a a clear in fact trying to try to
 

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.510
with a a clear in fact trying to try to
show something somehow something else

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520
show something somehow something else
 

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.380
show something somehow something else
was wrong

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:41.390
was wrong
 

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.360
was wrong
just to come up with a clear model to

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:43.370
just to come up with a clear model to
 

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.840
just to come up with a clear model to
show that you in principle you could you

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:46.850
show that you in principle you could you
 

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.740
show that you in principle you could you
could get the topological effect I was

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:49.750
could get the topological effect I was
 

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:55.030
could get the topological effect I was
looking for but really just to that the

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:55.040
looking for but really just to that the
 

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.270
looking for but really just to that the
key point was to show that this aspect

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280
key point was to show that this aspect
 

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.260
key point was to show that this aspect
that David's Palace had predicted but

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:02.270
that David's Palace had predicted but
 

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.290
that David's Palace had predicted but
found in in in the early 1980s in the

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:05.300
found in in in the early 1980s in the
 

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.300
found in in in the early 1980s in the
context the very strong magnetic field

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:07.310
context the very strong magnetic field
 

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.630
context the very strong magnetic field
this quantum Hall effect would actually

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640
this quantum Hall effect would actually
 

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.200
this quantum Hall effect would actually
occur in a more general just just when

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:14.210
occur in a more general just just when
 

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:17.050
occur in a more general just just when
you had some kind of magnetic materials

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:17.060
you had some kind of magnetic materials
 

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.510
you had some kind of magnetic materials
that had broken that that had broken

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520
that had broken that that had broken
 

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.550
that had broken that that had broken
time reversal invariant but didn't

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:21.560
time reversal invariant but didn't
 

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.280
time reversal invariant but didn't
require huge magnetic field and it was

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:24.290
require huge magnetic field and it was
 

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.180
require huge magnetic field and it was
really a it was really a just a toy

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:28.190
really a it was really a just a toy
 

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.080
really a it was really a just a toy
model demonstration of something and and

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.090
model demonstration of something and and
 

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.750
model demonstration of something and and
and then it then I realized it was a

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760
and then it then I realized it was a
 

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.630
and then it then I realized it was a
very neat model so I basically stumbled

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640
very neat model so I basically stumbled
 

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.230
very neat model so I basically stumbled
onto this really playing with the

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240
onto this really playing with the
 

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.200
onto this really playing with the
mathematics of some model and I think

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:43.210
mathematics of some model and I think
 

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:47.380
mathematics of some model and I think
similarly David's Alice's discovery he

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:47.390
similarly David's Alice's discovery he
 

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.450
similarly David's Alice's discovery he
didn't really realize it was topological

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:49.460
didn't really realize it was topological
 

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.120
didn't really realize it was topological
until he just found there was some

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:52.130
until he just found there was some
 

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.870
until he just found there was some
number that was stable and later on the

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880
number that was stable and later on the
 

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.170
number that was stable and later on the
mathematicians told us what the what the

00:21:59.170 --> 00:21:59.180
mathematicians told us what the what the
 

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.730
mathematicians told us what the what the
topological what the mathematical

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:00.740
topological what the mathematical
 

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.890
topological what the mathematical
theorems and the topological classes

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:02.900
theorems and the topological classes
 

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.410
theorems and the topological classes
that was this so we we basically like

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:05.420
that was this so we we basically like
 

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.220
that was this so we we basically like
like most discoveries you stumble on to

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:09.230
like most discoveries you stumble on to
 

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.210
like most discoveries you stumble on to
them and you you're you you just have to

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:13.220
them and you you're you you just have to
 

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.410
them and you you're you you just have to
realize there's something very

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:14.420
realize there's something very
 

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.730
realize there's something very
interesting there and when never

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:15.740
interesting there and when never
 

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.470
interesting there and when never
realizes the full implications

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480
realizes the full implications
 

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.320
realizes the full implications
the things until other people have

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:20.330
the things until other people have
 

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.850
the things until other people have
started thinking it's true and when

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:21.860
started thinking it's true and when
 

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.610
started thinking it's true and when
realizes the big picture but most of the

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:24.620
realizes the big picture but most of the
 

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.289
realizes the big picture but most of the
big discoveries are really that way I

00:22:26.289 --> 00:22:26.299
big discoveries are really that way I
 

00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:28.930
big discoveries are really that way I
think you at least in in theoretical

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:28.940
think you at least in in theoretical
 

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.659
think you at least in in theoretical
things you don't you never kind of set

00:22:31.659 --> 00:22:31.669
things you don't you never kind of set
 

00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:34.570
things you don't you never kind of set
out to discover something new you you

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:34.580
out to discover something new you you
 

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.490
out to discover something new you you
stumble on it and you have the luck to

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:36.500
stumble on it and you have the luck to
 

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.610
stumble on it and you have the luck to
recognize what you found it is something

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:39.620
recognize what you found it is something
 

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.560
recognize what you found it is something
very interesting and basically the

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:41.570
very interesting and basically the
 

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.140
very interesting and basically the
problem with was that with all these

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.150
problem with was that with all these
 

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.680
problem with was that with all these
things is that you you really need to if

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:47.690
things is that you you really need to if
 

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:52.240
things is that you you really need to if
you don't really can't if you can't

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:52.250
you don't really can't if you can't
 

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.340
you don't really can't if you can't
visualize what you're trying to do if

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:54.350
visualize what you're trying to do if
 

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:59.340
visualize what you're trying to do if
not if you don't really know what you

00:22:59.340 --> 00:22:59.350
not if you don't really know what you
 

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.100
not if you don't really know what you
you can't be yeah these things we just

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.110
you can't be yeah these things we just
 

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.470
you can't be yeah these things we just
saw which are so surprising it takes a

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480
saw which are so surprising it takes a
 

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.900
saw which are so surprising it takes a
while to do it but to see it but once

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:07.910
while to do it but to see it but once
 

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.320
while to do it but to see it but once
you see it you realize why didn't anyone

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:11.330
you see it you realize why didn't anyone
 

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.299
you see it you realize why didn't anyone
else think of that before and really one

00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:13.309
else think of that before and really one
 

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:16.060
else think of that before and really one
can't the barrier the barrier to most of

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.070
can't the barrier the barrier to most of
 

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.090
can't the barrier the barrier to most of
these things is that you you just don't

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:19.100
these things is that you you just don't
 

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.210
these things is that you you just don't
you don't realize what's out there and

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:21.220
you don't realize what's out there and
 

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.919
you don't realize what's out there and
until someone stumbles over it I think

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:23.929
until someone stumbles over it I think
 

00:23:23.929 --> 00:23:26.680
until someone stumbles over it I think
doesn't be thank you yeah are there more

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:26.690
doesn't be thank you yeah are there more
 

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.590
doesn't be thank you yeah are there more
questions here from journalists yes the

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600
questions here from journalists yes the
 

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.020
questions here from journalists yes the
lady over there congratulations on the

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:35.030
lady over there congratulations on the
 

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.150
lady over there congratulations on the
prize this is generally from people's

unorthodox ideas then and inspired me

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640
unorthodox ideas then and inspired me
 

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.960
unorthodox ideas then and inspired me
tremendously and now I think actually

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:43.970
tremendously and now I think actually
 

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.210
tremendously and now I think actually
that this whole topological quantum

member of the Nobel Committee for
 

00:30:53.529 --> 00:30:56.130
member of the Nobel Committee for
physics and you just presented an

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:56.140
physics and you just presented an
 

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.880
physics and you just presented an
about-face this year it is about exotic

00:30:59.880 --> 00:30:59.890
about-face this year it is about exotic
 

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.690
about-face this year it is about exotic
matter in the quantum world so my first

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:03.700
matter in the quantum world so my first
 

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:10.350
matter in the quantum world so my first
question would be exotic is not a

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360
question would be exotic is not a
 

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.519
question would be exotic is not a
precise scientific term exotic is

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:14.529
precise scientific term exotic is
 

00:31:14.529 --> 00:31:18.029
precise scientific term exotic is
something that expresses our wonder I'll

00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039
something that expresses our wonder I'll
 

00:31:18.039 --> 00:31:20.100
something that expresses our wonder I'll
wander in front of something that is

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:20.110
wander in front of something that is
 

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.490
wander in front of something that is
very unusual very hard to understand and

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:23.500
very unusual very hard to understand and
 

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.860
very unusual very hard to understand and
I think also that has to be seen

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:25.870
I think also that has to be seen
 

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.930
I think also that has to be seen
historically what is exciting exciting

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:27.940
historically what is exciting exciting
 

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.460
historically what is exciting exciting
for us now might not be so exotic in 20

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:32.470
for us now might not be so exotic in 20
 

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.860
for us now might not be so exotic in 20
or 30 years I guess you know electricity

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:34.870
or 30 years I guess you know electricity
 

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.080
or 30 years I guess you know electricity
was very exotic when it first came

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:37.090
was very exotic when it first came
 

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:40.169
was very exotic when it first came
around it's not so exotic any longer but

00:31:40.169 --> 00:31:40.179
around it's not so exotic any longer but
 

00:31:40.179 --> 00:31:44.700
around it's not so exotic any longer but
today the basis of matter I guess we

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:44.710
today the basis of matter I guess we
 

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.310
today the basis of matter I guess we
come to that that is at the basis of

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320
come to that that is at the basis of
 

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:54.330
come to that that is at the basis of
this year's price is really exotic world

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:54.340
this year's price is really exotic world
 

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:58.139
this year's price is really exotic world
so where is this quantum oil well the

00:31:58.139 --> 00:31:58.149
so where is this quantum oil well the
 

00:31:58.149 --> 00:32:01.710
so where is this quantum oil well the
quantum world is in a sense all around

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720
quantum world is in a sense all around
 

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.919
quantum world is in a sense all around
us but quantum effects are not always

00:32:04.919 --> 00:32:04.929
us but quantum effects are not always
 

00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:08.190
us but quantum effects are not always
very obvious to see but when you cool

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200
very obvious to see but when you cool
 

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.159
very obvious to see but when you cool
down materials to very low temperature

00:32:11.159 --> 00:32:11.169
down materials to very low temperature
 

00:32:11.169 --> 00:32:14.850
down materials to very low temperature
then in many cases quantum effects

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:14.860
then in many cases quantum effects
 

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:19.710
then in many cases quantum effects
becomes very much more visible more

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720
becomes very much more visible more
 

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.549
becomes very much more visible more
apparent then I have another exotic

00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559
apparent then I have another exotic
 

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:26.460
apparent then I have another exotic
question perhaps we have this bagel and

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:26.470
question perhaps we have this bagel and

with David powerless and - topological

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:20.650
with David powerless and - topological
 

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:23.609
with David powerless and - topological
phases he did this important work in

00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:23.619
phases he did this important work in
 

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:26.460

so David Thewlis has a share in both

00:38:30.539 --> 00:38:30.549
so David Thewlis has a share in both
 

00:38:30.549 --> 00:38:32.700
so David Thewlis has a share in both
these parts of the citation that's what
