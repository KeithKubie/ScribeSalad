talk about new Android features is
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.090
talk about new Android features is
important for games or at least that's

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
important for games or at least that's
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.790

talk but you know the truth is what I
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.679
talk but you know the truth is what I
realized is as I was coming up with this

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
realized is as I was coming up with this
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.009
realized is as I was coming up with this
talk that that most of you are not all

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

that interested in new Android features

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200
that interested in new Android features
 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.370
that interested in new Android features
because basically you're in targeting

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
because basically you're in targeting
 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.990
because basically you're in targeting
90% of the devices out there and you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000
90% of the devices out there and you
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.069
90% of the devices out there and you
know the new Android features are gonna

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
know the new Android features are gonna
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.650
know the new Android features are gonna
be on on a fairly small amount of them

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
be on on a fairly small amount of them
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.729
be on on a fairly small amount of them
so you know what I really should do is

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
so you know what I really should do is
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.130
so you know what I really should do is
come back to you in like a year and be

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
come back to you in like a year and be
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920
come back to you in like a year and be
like okay here are the new Android

months ago we announced that all apps

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
months ago we announced that all apps
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.359
months ago we announced that all apps
and games on Google Play will have to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
and games on Google Play will have to
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.969
and games on Google Play will have to
target the latest SDK version of about a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
target the latest SDK version of about a
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.280
target the latest SDK version of about a
year ago in order to in order to be able

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
year ago in order to in order to be able
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.539
year ago in order to in order to be able
to continue updating on Play and in all

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549

new titles have to actually target SDK

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090
new titles have to actually target SDK
 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.960
new titles have to actually target SDK
26 or higher as of August if they want

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
26 or higher as of August if they want
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.830
26 or higher as of August if they want
to be on play at all and you'll notice

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
to be on play at all and you'll notice
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.179
to be on play at all and you'll notice
if you upload something today you'll

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
if you upload something today you'll
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.380
if you upload something today you'll
actually get a warning that looks like

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
actually get a warning that looks like
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.209
actually get a warning that looks like
this that says exactly what I put here

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
this that says exactly what I put here
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.050
this that says exactly what I put here
so you don't have to read it so the real

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
so you don't have to read it so the real
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.429
so you don't have to read it so the real
question is like what does this actually

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
question is like what does this actually
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.789
question is like what does this actually
mean okay first of all let's let's go

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
mean okay first of all let's let's go
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.350
mean okay first of all let's let's go
over the real basics of what SDK

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
over the real basics of what SDK
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.510
over the real basics of what SDK
versions are the min SDK version is the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
versions are the min SDK version is the
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249
versions are the min SDK version is the
lowest version your your your office

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259
lowest version your your your office
 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.750
lowest version your your your office
willing to support and usually tie this

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
willing to support and usually tie this
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.520
willing to support and usually tie this
into you know this grid of

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
into you know this grid of
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.830
into you know this grid of
the latest devices platform

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
the latest devices platform
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.740
the latest devices platform
distributions like the compile SDK is

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
distributions like the compile SDK is
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.080
distributions like the compile SDK is
literally the headers and libraries that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
literally the headers and libraries that
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.030
literally the headers and libraries that
the app that the app links against and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
the app that the app links against and
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.920
the app that the app links against and
the target SDK version is this really

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
the target SDK version is this really
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.330
the target SDK version is this really
important one and this is the platform's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
important one and this is the platform's
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.920
important one and this is the platform's
way of ensuring backwards compatibility

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930
way of ensuring backwards compatibility
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.990
way of ensuring backwards compatibility
and this is this really says to the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
and this is this really says to the
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.070
and this is this really says to the
world I have tested my game on this

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080
world I have tested my game on this
 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.190
world I have tested my game on this
platform release and and and what

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
platform release and and and what
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.690
platform release and and and what
happens is the system only applies

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700
happens is the system only applies
 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.880
happens is the system only applies
certain kinds of behavior changes to

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
certain kinds of behavior changes to
 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.140
certain kinds of behavior changes to
target these specific SDK versions and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150
target these specific SDK versions and
 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.990
target these specific SDK versions and
so technically your compile SDK needs to

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
so technically your compile SDK needs to
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.120
so technically your compile SDK needs to
be at least as great as your target SDK

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130
be at least as great as your target SDK
 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.430
be at least as great as your target SDK
and min SDK but usually obviously you're

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440
and min SDK but usually obviously you're
 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.410
and min SDK but usually obviously you're
actually thinking about wanting to

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420
actually thinking about wanting to
 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.720
actually thinking about wanting to
target a very large swath of the use of

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
target a very large swath of the use of
 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.310
target a very large swath of the use of
ecosystems so you're actually going to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320
ecosystems so you're actually going to
 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.580
ecosystems so you're actually going to
make the compiled SDK equal to the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590
make the compiled SDK equal to the
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.960
make the compiled SDK equal to the
target SDK version which is going to be

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
target SDK version which is going to be
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.699
target SDK version which is going to be
much greater than the minimum SDK

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709
much greater than the minimum SDK
 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.260
much greater than the minimum SDK
version all right that was probably

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270
version all right that was probably
 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.470
version all right that was probably
confusing but and at a time it impacts a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
confusing but and at a time it impacts a
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.210
confusing but and at a time it impacts a
whole bunch of things if you haven't

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
whole bunch of things if you haven't
 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.470
whole bunch of things if you haven't
gone beyond let's say M you have to deal

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480
gone beyond let's say M you have to deal
 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.880
gone beyond let's say M you have to deal
with changes in runtime permissions

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890
with changes in runtime permissions

about Android API to a bunch of game
developers and well first of all there's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
developers and well first of all there's
 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.949
developers and well first of all there's
a possibility that you might have

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959
a possibility that you might have
 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.320
a possibility that you might have
something else beyond that in your app

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330
something else beyond that in your app
 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.440
something else beyond that in your app
and and these things might not be

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450
and and these things might not be
 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.890
and and these things might not be
compatible with the latest version of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
compatible with the latest version of
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.130
compatible with the latest version of
Android and so you have to look at all

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140
Android and so you have to look at all
 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.810
Android and so you have to look at all
of these plugins and what they do and

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820
of these plugins and what they do and
 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.039
of these plugins and what they do and
how they're impacting things and of

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049
how they're impacting things and of
 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.479
how they're impacting things and of
course it's very possible we also have

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489
course it's very possible we also have
 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.240
course it's very possible we also have
to update the version of the platform

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250
to update the version of the platform
 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.800
to update the version of the platform
for one of those two big things which

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
for one of those two big things which
 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.160
for one of those two big things which
can be a lot of work so let's talk a

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170
can be a lot of work so let's talk a
 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.960
can be a lot of work so let's talk a
little about runtime permissions if if

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
little about runtime permissions if if
 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.280
little about runtime permissions if if
you're still targeting L which hopefully

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
you're still targeting L which hopefully
 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.900
you're still targeting L which hopefully
most of you aren't this is something

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910
most of you aren't this is something
 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.670
most of you aren't this is something
you'll have to deal with and this this

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680
you'll have to deal with and this this
 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.110
you'll have to deal with and this this
is actually really good I think I think

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120
is actually really good I think I think
 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.220
is actually really good I think I think
runtime version is one of the best

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
runtime version is one of the best
 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.020
runtime version is one of the best
things we ever did because it allows you

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
things we ever did because it allows you
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.460
things we ever did because it allows you
to ask for sensitive permissions in

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470
to ask for sensitive permissions in
 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.219
to ask for sensitive permissions in
context and not on permissions or

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229
context and not on permissions or
 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.690
context and not on permissions or
runtime ones just this like really

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700
runtime ones just this like really
 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.659
runtime ones just this like really
simple and easy to remember list but the

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669
simple and easy to remember list but the
 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.860
simple and easy to remember list but the
good news is that is that that's not the

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870
good news is that is that that's not the
 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.270
good news is that is that that's not the
way the user sees it

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280
way the user sees it
 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.089
way the user sees it
we actually users actually see it like

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099
we actually users actually see it like
 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.760
we actually users actually see it like
this

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770
this
 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.800
this
so calendar phone camera sensors

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810
so calendar phone camera sensors
 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.180
so calendar phone camera sensors
contacts I mean none of you guys ever

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190
contacts I mean none of you guys ever
 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.659
contacts I mean none of you guys ever
need any of this stuff right and of

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669
need any of this stuff right and of
 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:34.830
need any of this stuff right and of
course you know just because your game

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840
course you know just because your game
 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.110
course you know just because your game
isn't yet turning em admittedly this is

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120
isn't yet turning em admittedly this is
 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.999
isn't yet turning em admittedly this is
you know not a game but it's an example

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009
you know not a game but it's an example
 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:40.700
you know not a game but it's an example
of something that doesn't yet target him

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710
of something that doesn't yet target him
 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.930
of something that doesn't yet target him
the user can still go on these devices

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940
the user can still go on these devices
 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.490
the user can still go on these devices
and they can show all that stuff off so

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500
and they can show all that stuff off so
 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.800
and they can show all that stuff off so
so it's still good to actually

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810
so it's still good to actually
 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.589
so it's still good to actually
understand how this works because and

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599
understand how this works because and
 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.059
understand how this works because and
you might be thinking all right well

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069
you might be thinking all right well
 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.110
you might be thinking all right well
this is easy what I'm gonna do is just

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120
this is easy what I'm gonna do is just
 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.879
this is easy what I'm gonna do is just
prompt all of these things right up

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889
prompt all of these things right up
 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.140
prompt all of these things right up
front right my game starts I'll have

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150
front right my game starts I'll have
 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.640
front right my game starts I'll have
like you know five permissions that I'm

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650
like you know five permissions that I'm
 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.800
like you know five permissions that I'm
going to go ask for and this is a really

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810
going to go ask for and this is a really
 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.990
going to go ask for and this is a really
good way to make someone never run your

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000
good way to make someone never run your
 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.450
good way to make someone never run your
game again okay why does it want to have

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460
game again okay why does it want to have
 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.700
game again okay why does it want to have
access to my contacts right now that

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710
access to my contacts right now that
 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.700
access to my contacts right now that
makes no sense that's really scary go

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710
makes no sense that's really scary go
 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.600
makes no sense that's really scary go
away so it's if it only needs the camera

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610
away so it's if it only needs the camera
 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.249
away so it's if it only needs the camera
permission when it's actually doing some

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259
permission when it's actually doing some
 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.469
permission when it's actually doing some
cool stuff with AR mode then ask for the

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479
cool stuff with AR mode then ask for the
 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.510
cool stuff with AR mode then ask for the
camera permission then okay it's it's

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520
camera permission then okay it's it's
 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.460
camera permission then okay it's it's
it's really really important it I know

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470
it's really really important it I know
 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.719
it's really really important it I know
is there some work involved here but

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729
is there some work involved here but
 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.360
is there some work involved here but
it's so it's so important when someone's

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370
it's so it's so important when someone's
 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.290
it's so it's so important when someone's
getting the first impression of your

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300
getting the first impression of your
 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.850
getting the first impression of your
game the first thing you see is like I

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860
game the first thing you see is like I
 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.050
game the first thing you see is like I
want to know all about you and

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060
want to know all about you and
 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.560
want to know all about you and
everything you do so another thing that

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570
everything you do so another thing that
 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.570
everything you do so another thing that
is going to change is alarms and alarms

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580
is going to change is alarms and alarms
 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.279
is going to change is alarms and alarms
are actually my favorite api's because

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289
are actually my favorite api's because
 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.100
are actually my favorite api's because
it's just hilarious now they take two

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110
it's just hilarious now they take two
 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.930
it's just hilarious now they take two
different forms they have literal arms

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940
different forms they have literal arms
 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.640
different forms they have literal arms
and we have schedulers for background

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650
and we have schedulers for background
 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.580
and we have schedulers for background
work and and and this was originally

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590
work and and and this was originally
 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.320
work and and and this was originally
really how you did background work on

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330
really how you did background work on
 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.209
really how you did background work on
Android in early versions of a you would

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219
Android in early versions of a you would
 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:49.620
Android in early versions of a you would
schedule an alarm and you would wake up

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630
schedule an alarm and you would wake up
 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.189
schedule an alarm and you would wake up
your app in the future and we decided

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199
your app in the future and we decided
 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.870
your app in the future and we decided
was that was a bad thing because a lot

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880
was that was a bad thing because a lot
 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.070
was that was a bad thing because a lot
of apps are all waking up at the same

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080
of apps are all waking up at the same
 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.050
of apps are all waking up at the same
time or even waking up at various times

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060
time or even waking up at various times
 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.820
time or even waking up at various times
and it wasn't allowing us to prioritize

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830
and it wasn't allowing us to prioritize
 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.740
and it wasn't allowing us to prioritize
system resource as well so back in

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750
system resource as well so back in
 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.390
system resource as well so back in
KitKat we decided okay we're not gonna

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400
KitKat we decided okay we're not gonna
 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.890
KitKat we decided okay we're not gonna
make we're gonna make it to the alarms

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900
make we're gonna make it to the alarms
 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.230
make we're gonna make it to the alarms
by default are not exact unless they're

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
by default are not exact unless they're
 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.670
by default are not exact unless they're
explicitly requested and this is all

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680
explicitly requested and this is all
 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.379
explicitly requested and this is all
stuff that only happens if your target

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389
stuff that only happens if your target
 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.020
stuff that only happens if your target
SDK version changes so so when we added

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030
SDK version changes so so when we added
 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.709
SDK version changes so so when we added
this thing called well set means that it

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719
this thing called well set means that it
 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:18.870
this thing called well set means that it
will happen around the time that you

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880
will happen around the time that you
 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.920
will happen around the time that you
said it would happen and then we have

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930
said it would happen and then we have
 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.959
said it would happen and then we have
set exact which means it's really gonna

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969
set exact which means it's really gonna
 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.999
set exact which means it's really gonna
happen at that time that you really said

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:24.009
happen at that time that you really said
 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:25.709
happen at that time that you really said
it what's going to happen this is how

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:25.719
it what's going to happen this is how
 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:29.370
it what's going to happen this is how
this how API is evolved and the thing is

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380
this how API is evolved and the thing is
 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.600
this how API is evolved and the thing is
that this is actually code from the

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610
that this is actually code from the
 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.520
that this is actually code from the
support library so if you're using this

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530
support library so if you're using this
 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.719
support library so if you're using this
port library and have to care about this

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729
port library and have to care about this
 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:35.490
port library and have to care about this
you call set exact on older versions of

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500
you call set exact on older versions of
 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.170
you call set exact on older versions of
call set on newer versions it costs that

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180
call set on newer versions it costs that
 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.379
call set on newer versions it costs that
exact and it works the same way

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389
exact and it works the same way
 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:45.330

now the alarmmanager then we had more

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340
now the alarmmanager then we had more
 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.600
now the alarmmanager then we had more
changes and we went to doze which which

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610

hadn't happened in android m along with
 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.649
hadn't happened in android m along with
ron time permissions and and we realized

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:52.659
ron time permissions and and we realized
 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.330
ron time permissions and and we realized
oh well now we've got this problem that

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340
oh well now we've got this problem that
 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.119
oh well now we've got this problem that
the device could be asleep and and we're

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129
the device could be asleep and and we're
 

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:58.649

only allowing apps to run during these

00:06:58.649 --> 00:06:58.659
only allowing apps to run during these
 

00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.689
only allowing apps to run during these
maintenance windows during that time so

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699
maintenance windows during that time so
 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.339
maintenance windows during that time so
he added we said well said exact isn't

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:02.349
he added we said well said exact isn't
 

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:03.659
he added we said well said exact isn't
good enough because that exact stat

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669
good enough because that exact stat
 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:04.559
good enough because that exact stat
losing in a fire during these

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:04.569
losing in a fire during these
 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:06.629
losing in a fire during these
maintenance windows and we now added set

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639
maintenance windows and we now added set
 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.999

really explicit we like long function

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110
really explicit we like long function
 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.100
really explicit we like long function
names it's very self documenting and

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.110
names it's very self documenting and
 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.749

these actually can wake the device from

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759
these actually can wake the device from
 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.850
these actually can wake the device from
doze and again here's what here's what

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:17.860
doze and again here's what here's what
 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.709

the compatibility story looks like here

00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:19.719
the compatibility story looks like here
 

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:22.469
the compatibility story looks like here
and once again there we are and it

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479
and once again there we are and it
 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:23.850

function we just showed you if you're on
older versions so very very very very

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840
older versions so very very very very
 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.110
older versions so very very very very
simple and and yes this allows you to

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120
simple and and yes this allows you to
 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.580

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:36.980
can be downloading new stuff from the
 

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.100
can be downloading new stuff from the
background this is what hopefully all of

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.110
background this is what hopefully all of
 

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.540
background this is what hopefully all of
your SDKs you're using that are doing

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:40.550
your SDKs you're using that are doing
 

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.670
your SDKs you're using that are doing
things like ads they're not using this

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680
things like ads they're not using this
 

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.410
things like ads they're not using this
if they're not gonna work really well

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:44.420
if they're not gonna work really well
 

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.390
if they're not gonna work really well
I'm going going when you go and target

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:46.400
I'm going going when you go and target
 

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.640
I'm going going when you go and target
Android oh and this is cool you can

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:48.650
Android oh and this is cool you can
 

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.890
Android oh and this is cool you can
actually set all sorts of information

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:50.900
actually set all sorts of information
 

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.600
actually set all sorts of information
about the network type for example here

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:52.610
about the network type for example here
 

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.310
about the network type for example here
so you can actually say hey I want to

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320
so you can actually say hey I want to
 

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.260
so you can actually say hey I want to
only have this running when I actually

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.270
only have this running when I actually
 

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.870
only have this running when I actually
have Network which is cool so you can it

00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880
have Network which is cool so you can it
 

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.520
have Network which is cool so you can it
can actually let you know that there is

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:00.530
can actually let you know that there is
 

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.560
can actually let you know that there is
a network available and more importantly

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:02.570
a network available and more importantly
 

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.170
a network available and more importantly
it can also say I only want to run an

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:05.180
it can also say I only want to run an
 

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.240
it can also say I only want to run an
unneutered networks which is which is

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.250
unneutered networks which is which is
 

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.100
unneutered networks which is which is
kind of a cool thing so you can say hey

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.110
kind of a cool thing so you can say hey
 

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.380
kind of a cool thing so you can say hey
and you can even do cool stuff like like

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:11.390
and you can even do cool stuff like like
 

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.590
and you can even do cool stuff like like
I want to run an unneutered networks but

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600
I want to run an unneutered networks but
 

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.790
I want to run an unneutered networks but
I want to have a watchdog that hangs

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800
I want to have a watchdog that hangs
 

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.930
I want to have a watchdog that hangs
around and says if it hasn't run it if

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:16.940
around and says if it hasn't run it if
 

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.640
around and says if it hasn't run it if
my job hasn't run within 24 hours let's

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:18.650
my job hasn't run within 24 hours let's
 

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.020
my job hasn't run within 24 hours let's
run it anyway it's that kind of thing so

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.030
run it anyway it's that kind of thing so
 

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.280
run it anyway it's that kind of thing so
you have a lot of you have a lot of

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:21.290
you have a lot of you have a lot of
 

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.060
you have a lot of you have a lot of
options here and and and if you do have

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.070
options here and and and if you do have
 

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.170
options here and and and if you do have
to use something for backwards

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:26.180
to use something for backwards
 

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.850
to use something for backwards
compatibility for an old version Android

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:27.860
compatibility for an old version Android
 

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.260
compatibility for an old version Android
like have some connectivity changed

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:29.270
like have some connectivity changed
 

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.240
like have some connectivity changed
thing you can one of things that's

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:31.250
thing you can one of things that's
 

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:32.350
thing you can one of things that's
really cool is you could actually leave

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360
really cool is you could actually leave
 

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.590
really cool is you could actually leave
it disabled by default which is which is

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600
it disabled by default which is which is
 

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.580
it disabled by default which is which is
cool I even know you could do this in

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:36.590
cool I even know you could do this in
 

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.570
cool I even know you could do this in
earlier versions of Android I'm like oh

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:37.580
earlier versions of Android I'm like oh
 

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.680
earlier versions of Android I'm like oh
that's awesome but it's been always

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:38.690
that's awesome but it's been always
 

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.150
that's awesome but it's been always
there and you can actually then turn it

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160
there and you can actually then turn it
 

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.160
there and you can actually then turn it
back on so you can say okay well now I'm

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.170
back on so you can say okay well now I'm
 

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.870
back on so you can say okay well now I'm
on this ancient version of Android let's

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880
on this ancient version of Android let's
 

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.430
on this ancient version of Android let's
turn this back on that'll allow me to

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440
turn this back on that'll allow me to
 

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:49.300
turn this back on that'll allow me to
still be launched on an old version and

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:49.310
still be launched on an old version and
 

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.810
still be launched on an old version and
still use the old api's another thing

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:52.820
still use the old api's another thing
 

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.920
still use the old api's another thing
that people want to know about is when

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:53.930
that people want to know about is when
 

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.120
that people want to know about is when
their package gets uninstalled and

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:55.130
their package gets uninstalled and
 

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.980
their package gets uninstalled and
reinstalled with the new version that's

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:56.990
reinstalled with the new version that's
 

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.570
reinstalled with the new version that's
actually kind of a useful thing and a

00:10:58.570 --> 00:10:58.580
actually kind of a useful thing and a
 

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.980
actually kind of a useful thing and a
lot of them would go and say let's look

00:10:59.980 --> 00:10:59.990
lot of them would go and say let's look
 

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.870
lot of them would go and say let's look
to see all of the packages on the system

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:01.880
to see all of the packages on the system
 

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.500
to see all of the packages on the system
and and when there

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:03.510
and and when there
 

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.879
and and when there
and when that happens and that's really

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:04.889
and when that happens and that's really
 

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:06.860
and when that happens and that's really
bad a lot of a lot of apps were actually

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:06.870
bad a lot of a lot of apps were actually
 

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.170
bad a lot of a lot of apps were actually
doing that and so you can no longer do

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180
doing that and so you can no longer do
 

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.699
doing that and so you can no longer do
that but you can actually used my

00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:10.709
that but you can actually used my
 

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:12.470
that but you can actually used my
package replace to find out when your

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480
package replace to find out when your
 

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.019
package replace to find out when your
own specific plac package gets replaced

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:15.029
own specific plac package gets replaced
 

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:16.939
own specific plac package gets replaced
which is good there's also actually an

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:16.949
which is good there's also actually an
 

00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:18.920
which is good there's also actually an
API if you do want to find out when

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:18.930
API if you do want to find out when
 

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.990
API if you do want to find out when
other packages are been replaced on a

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000
other packages are been replaced on a
 

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.490
other packages are been replaced on a
regular basis you can actually pull for

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500
regular basis you can actually pull for
 

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.050
regular basis you can actually pull for
them with a sequence number so you can

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060
them with a sequence number so you can
 

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.670
them with a sequence number so you can
say oh has anything happens to last time

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680
say oh has anything happens to last time
 

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.230
say oh has anything happens to last time
I run so if you're if you want to if you

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240
I run so if you're if you want to if you
 

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.639
I run so if you're if you want to if you
have other apps or either of their

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:28.649
have other apps or either of their
 

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:29.780
have other apps or either of their
you're trying to check to see that are

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:29.790
you're trying to check to see that are
 

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.000
you're trying to check to see that are
companions or to the one you have or

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.010
companions or to the one you have or
 

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.170
companions or to the one you have or
just want to check to see how many how

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180
just want to check to see how many how
 

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.340
just want to check to see how many how
that's going on in the system you can

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:34.350
that's going on in the system you can
 

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.139
that's going on in the system you can
still do that without actually having to

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:36.149
still do that without actually having to
 

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:37.610
still do that without actually having to
have your app wake up every time another

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620
have your app wake up every time another
 

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.340
have your app wake up every time another
app is installed it's much better okay

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:40.350
app is installed it's much better okay
 

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.259
app is installed it's much better okay
so let's talk about background limits as

00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:42.269
so let's talk about background limits as
 

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:44.750
so let's talk about background limits as
well this is also something that has

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760
well this is also something that has
 

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.970
well this is also something that has
that has changed with Android oh

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980
that has changed with Android oh
 

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.540
that has changed with Android oh
probably the biggest change is it lets

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:50.550
probably the biggest change is it lets
 

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.800
probably the biggest change is it lets
so is it when you're in the background

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:51.810
so is it when you're in the background
 

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.689
so is it when you're in the background
you can't do a whole bunch of things

00:11:53.689 --> 00:11:53.699
you can't do a whole bunch of things
 

00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:55.129
you can't do a whole bunch of things
like you can't launch services anymore

00:11:55.129 --> 00:11:55.139
like you can't launch services anymore
 

00:11:55.139 --> 00:11:56.689
like you can't launch services anymore
and this is a big change for a lot of

00:11:56.689 --> 00:11:56.699
and this is a big change for a lot of
 

00:11:56.699 --> 00:11:58.579
and this is a big change for a lot of
these SDKs it's just kind of a suit oh I

00:11:58.579 --> 00:11:58.589
these SDKs it's just kind of a suit oh I
 

00:11:58.589 --> 00:12:00.319
these SDKs it's just kind of a suit oh I
could always do this

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:00.329
could always do this
 

00:12:00.329 --> 00:12:01.910
could always do this
and so what does it really mean to be in

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920
and so what does it really mean to be in
 

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.259
and so what does it really mean to be in
the foreground well it means your app

00:12:03.259 --> 00:12:03.269
the foreground well it means your app
 

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:04.699
the foreground well it means your app
it's visible means that as a foreground

00:12:04.699 --> 00:12:04.709
it's visible means that as a foreground
 

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:05.930
it's visible means that as a foreground
service foreground service is that

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940
service foreground service is that
 

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:08.259
service foreground service is that
service that actually has an has a

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:08.269
service that actually has an has a
 

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:10.340
service that actually has an has a
notification of sociated with it all the

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:10.350
notification of sociated with it all the
 

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.780
notification of sociated with it all the
time so the user knows it's always

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:11.790
time so the user knows it's always
 

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.910
time so the user knows it's always
running sometimes they'd be kind of

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920
running sometimes they'd be kind of
 

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.590
running sometimes they'd be kind of
annoying they show up in as this thing

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600
annoying they show up in as this thing
 

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.790
annoying they show up in as this thing
that's running and you're in your

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800
that's running and you're in your
 

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.530
that's running and you're in your
notification list but it's really

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540
notification list but it's really
 

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.699
notification list but it's really
important that it's visible to the user

good thing we had a lot of apps that

good thing we had a lot of apps that
 

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:50.790
good thing we had a lot of apps that
were just hanging around all the time

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800
were just hanging around all the time
 

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.500

and keeping wakelocks open and wasting a
 

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.360
and keeping wakelocks open and wasting a
lot of battery and so this is actually

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:54.370
lot of battery and so this is actually
 

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.800
lot of battery and so this is actually
something that affects you on o

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:55.810

versions you can keep the service

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:00.640

running all the time and on oh you can't

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:04.210

and there's still a few cases where you

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:05.770
and there's still a few cases where you
 

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.050
and there's still a few cases where you
can actually run and you still watch

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.060
can actually run and you still watch
 

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.060
can actually run and you still watch
background services so you can actually

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.070
background services so you can actually
 

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.580
background services so you can actually
do this when your app is responding to a

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:11.590
do this when your app is responding to a
 

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.440
do this when your app is responding to a
notification that and the system even

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:13.450
notification that and the system even
 

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:14.970
notification that and the system even
still and still thinks if your app is

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:14.980
still and still thinks if your app is
 

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.170
still and still thinks if your app is
being foregrounded so that's kind of

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:16.180
being foregrounded so that's kind of
 

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.600
being foregrounded so that's kind of
good high priority firebase cloud

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:18.610

message also is considered being in the
 

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.220
message also is considered being in the

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.140

from doze so don't use it very often

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.150

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.840
from doze so don't use it very often
less you have to like really important

be that provider and then we also have

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:34.810
be that provider and then we also have
 

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.290
be that provider and then we also have
behavior changes and you know you might

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:37.300
behavior changes and you know you might
 

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.730
behavior changes and you know you might
not notice these yet depending on how

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:38.740
not notice these yet depending on how
 

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.220
not notice these yet depending on how
many of your users are actually running

background location so which are good
 

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.870
background location so which are good
this actually is important a lot of

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880
this actually is important a lot of
 

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.220
this actually is important a lot of
actors hanging around all the time like

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:50.230
actors hanging around all the time like
 

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.470
actors hanging around all the time like
where our users and so you can't do that

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480
where our users and so you can't do that
 

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.170
where our users and so you can't do that
anymore you can you get much less even

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:55.180
anymore you can you get much less even
 

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.270
anymore you can you get much less even
if you request tons and tons of location

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:57.280
if you request tons and tons of location
 

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.410
if you request tons and tons of location
updates if your app is running in the

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:58.420
updates if your app is running in the
 

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.760
updates if your app is running in the
background it just does not have a

00:14:59.760 --> 00:14:59.770
background it just does not have a
 

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.010
background it just does not have a
foreground service then you only get a

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:02.020
foreground service then you only get a
 

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.870
foreground service then you only get a
couple of results an hour by comparison

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880
couple of results an hour by comparison
 

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.400
couple of results an hour by comparison
it's actually a lot more than that but

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:05.410
it's actually a lot more than that but
 

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.400
it's actually a lot more than that but
it's a lot less than it was even Wi-Fi

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:08.410
it's a lot less than it was even Wi-Fi
 

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.350
it's a lot less than it was even Wi-Fi
scans are actually are actually cached

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360
scans are actually are actually cached
 

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.940
scans are actually are actually cached
so if you keep scanning Wi-Fi over and

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:11.950
so if you keep scanning Wi-Fi over and
 

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:12.960
so if you keep scanning Wi-Fi over and
over in the background it's only going

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:12.970
over in the background it's only going
 

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.900
over in the background it's only going
to give you a couple a few updates every

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:15.910
to give you a couple a few updates every
 

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.010
to give you a couple a few updates every
hour by comparison to what I was doing

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:17.020
hour by comparison to what I was doing
 

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.730
hour by comparison to what I was doing
before so you use things like geofencing

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740
before so you use things like geofencing
 

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.780
before so you use things like geofencing
for example if you need to know when the

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:21.790
for example if you need to know when the
 

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.120
for example if you need to know when the
user reaches a specific location you can

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.130
user reaches a specific location you can
 

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.740
user reaches a specific location you can
do things like you only have a hundred

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:25.750
do things like you only have a hundred
 

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.940
do things like you only have a hundred
of those you can use things like dynamic

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:26.950
of those you can use things like dynamic
 

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.350
of those you can use things like dynamic
geofencing with regions

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360
geofencing with regions
 

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.210
geofencing with regions
these are all really cool things you

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:31.220
these are all really cool things you
 

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.650
these are all really cool things you
want to do cool stuff with your game if

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:32.660
want to do cool stuff with your game if
 

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.780
want to do cool stuff with your game if
you want to have like hardware beacons

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:34.790
you want to have like hardware beacons
 

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.580
you want to have like hardware beacons
in places or that's pretty cool too

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:36.590
in places or that's pretty cool too
 

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.810
in places or that's pretty cool too
that's another way using the nearby

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:37.820
that's another way using the nearby
 

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.970
that's another way using the nearby
api's there's a lot of ways to get

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:39.980
api's there's a lot of ways to get
 

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.300
api's there's a lot of ways to get
around that use batching if you if you

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:43.310
around that use batching if you if you
 

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.620
around that use batching if you if you
want to attract people's location

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:44.630
want to attract people's location
 

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.000
want to attract people's location
hopefully a lot of games aren't doing

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.010
hopefully a lot of games aren't doing
 

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.200
hopefully a lot of games aren't doing
this but you know location-based games

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.210
this but you know location-based games
 

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.660
this but you know location-based games
are getting more popular all the time so

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:49.670
are getting more popular all the time so
 

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.340
are getting more popular all the time so
you can just check check this max wait

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:51.350
you can just check check this max wait
 

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.560
you can just check check this max wait
time here and that will allow you to

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:53.570
time here and that will allow you to
 

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.920
time here and that will allow you to
batch up location updates for you and

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:56.930
batch up location updates for you and
 

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.050
batch up location updates for you and
then you can also use passive locations

00:15:59.050 --> 00:15:59.060
then you can also use passive locations
 

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.820
then you can also use passive locations
this fastest interval here actually will

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:00.830
this fastest interval here actually will
 

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.440
this fastest interval here actually will
mean that okay yes I'm not requesting

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:02.450
mean that okay yes I'm not requesting
 

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:03.760
mean that okay yes I'm not requesting
getting updated all the time with

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:03.770
getting updated all the time with
 

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.740
getting updated all the time with
location but if someone else is using

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:05.750
location but if someone else is using
 

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.020
location but if someone else is using
Google Maps or there were Reno or using

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.030
Google Maps or there were Reno or using
 

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.000
Google Maps or there were Reno or using
you know acting activity tracking and

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:10.010
you know acting activity tracking and
 

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.830
you know acting activity tracking and
somehow for sports or something like

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:11.840
somehow for sports or something like
 

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.510
somehow for sports or something like
that that I still get those updates to

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:13.520
that that I still get those updates to
 

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.260
that that I still get those updates to
so it's kind of a cool way of doing that

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:16.270
so it's kind of a cool way of doing that
 

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.160
so it's kind of a cool way of doing that
so another thing I want to mention is

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.170
so another thing I want to mention is
 

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.570
so another thing I want to mention is
that Android keeps introducing battery

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:19.580
that Android keeps introducing battery
 

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.670
that Android keeps introducing battery
optimizations that are based on

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680
optimizations that are based on
 

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.410
optimizations that are based on
deferring restricting background tasks

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:23.420
deferring restricting background tasks
 

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.080
deferring restricting background tasks
so again we talked a little bit about

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:26.090
so again we talked a little bit about
 

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.420
so again we talked a little bit about
doze this this this limits app activity

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:28.430
doze this this this limits app activity
 

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.800
doze this this this limits app activity
to maintenance windows when things is

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:29.810
to maintenance windows when things is
 

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.020
to maintenance windows when things is
like our unplug or stationary that kind

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.030
like our unplug or stationary that kind
 

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.690
like our unplug or stationary that kind
of thing and and then we actually added

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:34.700
of thing and and then we actually added
 

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.700
of thing and and then we actually added
those on the go it's not really calling

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:36.710
those on the go it's not really calling
 

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.890
those on the go it's not really calling
it it's doze light but it's it's for

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:38.900
it it's doze light but it's it's for
 

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.810
it it's doze light but it's it's for
when it's for when it get it still

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:40.820
when it's for when it get it still
 

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.030
when it's for when it get it still
limits things to limits most things to

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040
limits things to limits most things to

maintenance windows when the device is

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.050
maintenance windows when the device is
 

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.480
maintenance windows when the device is
unplugged in the screen is off like from

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.490
unplugged in the screen is off like from
 

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.460

the users in the pocket it does allow

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:48.470
the users in the pocket it does allow
 

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.630
the users in the pocket it does allow
for a few things that aren't allowed

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:49.640
for a few things that aren't allowed
 

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.480
for a few things that aren't allowed
during during regular doze and then and

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:52.490
during during regular doze and then and
 

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.190
during during regular doze and then and
then we also did this thing called app

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:54.200
then we also did this thing called app
 

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.110
then we also did this thing called app
standby so if someone doesn't use an app

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120
standby so if someone doesn't use an app
 

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.000
standby so if someone doesn't use an app
very often it starts slowly limiting

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.010
very often it starts slowly limiting
 

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.920
very often it starts slowly limiting
what the app can do and that's really

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:02.930
what the app can do and that's really
 

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:04.600
what the app can do and that's really
good because a lot of like I install

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:04.610
good because a lot of like I install
 

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.100
good because a lot of like I install
apps that I only use when I'm in certain

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.110
apps that I only use when I'm in certain
 

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.620
apps that I only use when I'm in certain
places and this allows me to to make

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:08.630
places and this allows me to to make
 

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.120
places and this allows me to to make
sure that they're not constantly

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.130
sure that they're not constantly
 

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.320
sure that they're not constantly
draining my battery but for a game

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:11.330
draining my battery but for a game
 

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.730
draining my battery but for a game
developer it does mean that if someone's

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:12.740
developer it does mean that if someone's
 

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.140
developer it does mean that if someone's
not using your app all the time and

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:14.150
not using your app all the time and
 

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.130
not using your app all the time and
you're trying to do all sorts of stuff

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:15.140
you're trying to do all sorts of stuff
 

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.600
you're trying to do all sorts of stuff
in the background you'll stop they'll

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:16.610
in the background you'll stop they'll
 

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:19.900
in the background you'll stop they'll
stop seeing these things and then stay

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:19.910
stop seeing these things and then stay
 

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.910
stop seeing these things and then stay
tuned we have a lot more stuff coming in

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:21.920
tuned we have a lot more stuff coming in
 

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.120
tuned we have a lot more stuff coming in
P that we'll be talking about tomorrow

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:24.130
P that we'll be talking about tomorrow
 

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.370
P that we'll be talking about tomorrow
so how do you test these things it's

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:27.380
so how do you test these things it's
 

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.390
so how do you test these things it's
pretty straightforward you can test

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400
pretty straightforward you can test
 

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.310
pretty straightforward you can test
those this way using an ADB command you

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320
those this way using an ADB command you
 

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.630
those this way using an ADB command you
can see how and this allows you to see

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640
can see how and this allows you to see
 

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.010
can see how and this allows you to see
how your how your app actually performs

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.020
how your how your app actually performs
 

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.020
how your how your app actually performs
when it's running in doze mode you can

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.030
when it's running in doze mode you can
 

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.670
when it's running in doze mode you can
test app standby by doing this you have

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:36.680
test app standby by doing this you have
 

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.980
test app standby by doing this you have
to unplug the battery but you can do

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:38.990
to unplug the battery but you can do
 

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:40.450
to unplug the battery but you can do
that with this nice command that makes

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:40.460
that with this nice command that makes
 

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.860
that with this nice command that makes
it makes the system thinks the battery

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:41.870
it makes the system thinks the battery
 

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:43.060
it makes the system thinks the battery
is unplug

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:43.070
is unplug
 

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.239
is unplug
before you start doing that okay and I

00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:46.249
before you start doing that okay and I
 

00:17:46.249 --> 00:17:47.409
before you start doing that okay and I
did mention I was going to talk about

00:17:47.409 --> 00:17:47.419
did mention I was going to talk about
 

00:17:47.419 --> 00:17:48.700
did mention I was going to talk about
kind of modern things you could take

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:48.710
kind of modern things you could take
 

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.129
kind of modern things you could take
advantage of you know one of things you

00:17:51.129 --> 00:17:51.139
advantage of you know one of things you
 

00:17:51.139 --> 00:17:51.999
advantage of you know one of things you
have to take advantage of his

00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:52.009
have to take advantage of his
 

00:17:52.009 --> 00:17:54.009
have to take advantage of his
notification channels because if you

00:17:54.009 --> 00:17:54.019
notification channels because if you
 

00:17:54.019 --> 00:17:55.210
notification channels because if you
don't have notification channels and

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:55.220
don't have notification channels and
 

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.710
don't have notification channels and
you're targeting oh your notifications

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720
you're targeting oh your notifications
 

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.509
you're targeting oh your notifications
don't appear they just don't show up so

00:17:58.509 --> 00:17:58.519
don't appear they just don't show up so
 

00:17:58.519 --> 00:18:00.100
don't appear they just don't show up so
you you really want to turn this on and

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:00.110
you you really want to turn this on and
 

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.019
you you really want to turn this on and
this is actually really cool because if

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:02.029
this is actually really cool because if
 

00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:04.570
this is actually really cool because if
you actually if you actually give the

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:04.580
you actually if you actually give the
 

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.460
you actually if you actually give the
user good channels and explain like this

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:06.470
user good channels and explain like this
 

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.049
user good channels and explain like this
is a really high priority notification

00:18:08.049 --> 00:18:08.059
is a really high priority notification
 

00:18:08.059 --> 00:18:09.519
is a really high priority notification
and these are things you might be

00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:09.529
and these are things you might be
 

00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:10.989
and these are things you might be
interested in these categories it

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:10.999
interested in these categories it
 

00:18:10.999 --> 00:18:12.970
interested in these categories it
prevents them from actually disabling

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:12.980
prevents them from actually disabling
 

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.560
prevents them from actually disabling
all notifications to your game and

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:14.570
all notifications to your game and
 

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.119
all notifications to your game and
that's and so this is actually something

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:16.129
that's and so this is actually something
 

00:18:16.129 --> 00:18:17.710
that's and so this is actually something
I definitely recommend really thinking

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720
I definitely recommend really thinking
 

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.799
I definitely recommend really thinking
about and and and trying to trying to

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:20.809
about and and and trying to trying to
 

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.509
about and and and trying to trying to
make a user scenario with like okay well

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:22.519
make a user scenario with like okay well
 

00:18:22.519 --> 00:18:24.220
make a user scenario with like okay well
actually you know what I really do want

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.230
actually you know what I really do want
 

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:25.600
actually you know what I really do want
to know when there's a cool free offer

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:25.610
to know when there's a cool free offer
 

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.570
to know when there's a cool free offer
here but I don't want to be notified

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:27.580
here but I don't want to be notified
 

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.519
here but I don't want to be notified
every single time that one of my friends

00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:30.529
every single time that one of my friends
 

00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:32.560
every single time that one of my friends
comes on that sort of thing and so you

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:32.570
comes on that sort of thing and so you
 

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.539
comes on that sort of thing and so you
can you can you can really make the user

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:34.549
can you can you can really make the user
 

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:35.919
can you can you can really make the user
make good choices that say you know what

00:18:35.919 --> 00:18:35.929
make good choices that say you know what
 

00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:37.180
make good choices that say you know what
I don't want to disable all the

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:37.190
I don't want to disable all the
 

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.070
I don't want to disable all the
notifications for your app because they

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:39.080
notifications for your app because they
 

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.269
notifications for your app because they
at mean something to me but I can

00:18:40.269 --> 00:18:40.279
at mean something to me but I can
 

00:18:40.279 --> 00:18:41.680
at mean something to me but I can
actually use these channels so Recker i

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:41.690
actually use these channels so Recker i
 

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.409
actually use these channels so Recker i
recommend really thinking about this it

00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:44.419
recommend really thinking about this it
 

00:18:44.419 --> 00:18:45.700
recommend really thinking about this it
actually has helped us to we've actually

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:45.710
actually has helped us to we've actually
 

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.710
actually has helped us to we've actually
seen in devices that have notification

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720
seen in devices that have notification
 

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.419
seen in devices that have notification
channels we actually see less people

00:18:49.419 --> 00:18:49.429
channels we actually see less people
 

00:18:49.429 --> 00:18:51.100
channels we actually see less people
turning off all notifications so it does

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.110
turning off all notifications so it does
 

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.399
turning off all notifications so it does
actually work one of things you also

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:54.409
actually work one of things you also
 

00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:55.810
actually work one of things you also
have to think about is if your app is

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:55.820
have to think about is if your app is
 

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.269
have to think about is if your app is
using immersive mode or you know some

00:18:58.269 --> 00:18:58.279
using immersive mode or you know some
 

00:18:58.279 --> 00:19:01.029
using immersive mode or you know some
games actually do use this translucent

00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039
games actually do use this translucent
 

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:02.499
games actually do use this translucent
status bar which is kind of cool I wish

00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:02.509
status bar which is kind of cool I wish
 

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:05.080
status bar which is kind of cool I wish
more did you have to think about this

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.090
more did you have to think about this
 

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.269
more did you have to think about this
display cut out because a lot of apps

00:19:07.269 --> 00:19:07.279
display cut out because a lot of apps
 

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.609
display cut out because a lot of apps
and games assume that the the status bar

00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:09.619
and games assume that the the status bar
 

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:11.759
and games assume that the the status bar
was like 28 pixels tall 28 divided

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:11.769
was like 28 pixels tall 28 divided
 

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:13.749
was like 28 pixels tall 28 divided
density-independent pixels tall and

00:19:13.749 --> 00:19:13.759
density-independent pixels tall and
 

00:19:13.759 --> 00:19:15.489
density-independent pixels tall and
turns out it's not true if you had these

00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:15.499
turns out it's not true if you had these
 

00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:18.430
turns out it's not true if you had these
cutouts and you can also stimulate a cut

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440
cutouts and you can also stimulate a cut
 

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.340
cutouts and you can also stimulate a cut
out using the P Developer Preview image

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:21.350
out using the P Developer Preview image
 

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.639
out using the P Developer Preview image
so that's useful probably not a lot of

00:19:24.639 --> 00:19:24.649
so that's useful probably not a lot of
 

00:19:24.649 --> 00:19:26.080
so that's useful probably not a lot of
things make sure probably the biggest

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.090
things make sure probably the biggest
 

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.430
things make sure probably the biggest
thing for game developers actually that

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440
thing for game developers actually that
 

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.289
thing for game developers actually that
that some games aren't still doing is

00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:29.299
that some games aren't still doing is
 

00:19:29.299 --> 00:19:30.730
that some games aren't still doing is
dealing well with long aspect ratio

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:30.740
dealing well with long aspect ratio
 

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.009
dealing well with long aspect ratio
screens so this has gotten a lot better

00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:33.019
screens so this has gotten a lot better
 

00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:36.820
screens so this has gotten a lot better
recently I can't imagine why but I guess

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:36.830
recently I can't imagine why but I guess
 

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.320
recently I can't imagine why but I guess
I guess long aspect ratio screens are

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:38.330
I guess long aspect ratio screens are
 

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:39.700
I guess long aspect ratio screens are
getting important are getting more

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:39.710
getting important are getting more
 

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.100
getting important are getting more
common but they're still games that will

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.110
common but they're still games that will
 

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.629
common but they're still games that will
occasionally have content that's cut off

00:19:43.629 --> 00:19:43.639
occasionally have content that's cut off
 

00:19:43.639 --> 00:19:45.159
occasionally have content that's cut off
because a lot of a lot of people really

00:19:45.159 --> 00:19:45.169
because a lot of a lot of people really
 

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:48.129
because a lot of a lot of people really
think of things in terms of things the

00:19:48.129 --> 00:19:48.139
think of things in terms of things the
 

00:19:48.139 --> 00:19:49.899
think of things in terms of things the
layout of their of their HUD in terms of

00:19:49.899 --> 00:19:49.909
layout of their of their HUD in terms of
 

00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:52.269
layout of their of their HUD in terms of
of having a fairly limited set of aspect

00:19:52.269 --> 00:19:52.279
of having a fairly limited set of aspect
 

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:53.350
of having a fairly limited set of aspect
ratio so this is something that's

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360
ratio so this is something that's
 

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.299
ratio so this is something that's
definitely worth testing for and these

00:19:55.299 --> 00:19:55.309
definitely worth testing for and these
 

00:19:55.309 --> 00:19:56.150
definitely worth testing for and these
are going to be

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160
are going to be
 

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.820
are going to be
you know even more common this year you

00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:58.830
you know even more common this year you
 

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.980
you know even more common this year you
can letterbox things if you want another

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:00.990
can letterbox things if you want another
 

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.360
can letterbox things if you want another
thing I haven't seen any games doing but

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:02.370
thing I haven't seen any games doing but
 

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.710
thing I haven't seen any games doing but
I'm sort of waiting for it is actually

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720
I'm sort of waiting for it is actually
 

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.750
I'm sort of waiting for it is actually
supporting picture-in-picture yeah

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760
supporting picture-in-picture yeah
 

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.130
supporting picture-in-picture yeah
obviously people use it for chat but I'm

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140
obviously people use it for chat but I'm
 

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.330
obviously people use it for chat but I'm
sort of waiting for something especially

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340
sort of waiting for something especially
 

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.100
sort of waiting for something especially
I mean honestly I want Pokemon go to do

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:10.110
I mean honestly I want Pokemon go to do
 

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.720
I mean honestly I want Pokemon go to do
this because it'd be kind of awesome to

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:11.730
this because it'd be kind of awesome to
 

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.950
this because it'd be kind of awesome to
have like my little Pokemon character

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960
have like my little Pokemon character
 

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.970
have like my little Pokemon character
running around in the corner while I'm

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980
running around in the corner while I'm
 

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.750
running around in the corner while I'm
doing other things so I put it there

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760
doing other things so I put it there
 

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.840
doing other things so I put it there
also we do have volcán think of taking

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:20.850
also we do have volcán think of taking
 

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:21.710
also we do have volcán think of taking
advantage of it these are the new

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720
advantage of it these are the new
 

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.540
advantage of it these are the new
changes we that are in Vulcan 1.1 which

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:23.550
changes we that are in Vulcan 1.1 which
 

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.730
changes we that are in Vulcan 1.1 which
is actually part of Android pee which

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740
is actually part of Android pee which
 

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.110
is actually part of Android pee which
we're finally implementing multi-view

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120
we're finally implementing multi-view
 

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.480
we're finally implementing multi-view
which I'm really excited about for VR we

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:29.490
which I'm really excited about for VR we
 

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.350
which I'm really excited about for VR we
also have the memory models and are

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360
also have the memory models and are
 

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.460
also have the memory models and are
necessary to have much better

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:34.470
necessary to have much better
 

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:37.250
necessary to have much better
compatibility with hlsl shaders which is

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260
compatibility with hlsl shaders which is
 

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.230
compatibility with hlsl shaders which is
cool of people who are sharing those as

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240
cool of people who are sharing those as
 

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.940
cool of people who are sharing those as
well as some cool things for video

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:40.950
well as some cool things for video
 

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.970
well as some cool things for video
processing and for open CLC

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:42.980
processing and for open CLC
 

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.050
processing and for open CLC
compatibility so again there's there's a

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.060
compatibility so again there's there's a
 

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.490
compatibility so again there's there's a
lot of cool stuff there to consider

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500
lot of cool stuff there to consider
 

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.800
lot of cool stuff there to consider
using Vulcan another thing that I really

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:48.810
using Vulcan another thing that I really
 

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.540
using Vulcan another thing that I really
really like and this isn't part of pedis

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:50.550
really like and this isn't part of pedis
 

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.220
really like and this isn't part of pedis
was actually and added in Android Oh is

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:52.230
was actually and added in Android Oh is
 

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.070
was actually and added in Android Oh is
a audio which is our new audio API it's

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080
a audio which is our new audio API it's
 

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.140
a audio which is our new audio API it's
really straightforward to use like

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:57.150
really straightforward to use like
 

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.330
really straightforward to use like
really simple by comparison to using

00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340
really simple by comparison to using
 

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.340
really simple by comparison to using
opensl and the best part about it is we

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:01.350
opensl and the best part about it is we
 

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.260
opensl and the best part about it is we
actually have this library called oboe

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:03.270
actually have this library called oboe
 

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.140
actually have this library called oboe
that wraps hey audio and wraps opensl

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:06.150
that wraps hey audio and wraps opensl
 

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.590
that wraps hey audio and wraps opensl
gives turns and uses one API with a

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600
gives turns and uses one API with a
 

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.450
gives turns and uses one API with a
audio you also can get access to

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460
audio you also can get access to
 

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.780
audio you also can get access to
something called sharing mode exclusive

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:13.790
something called sharing mode exclusive
 

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.760
something called sharing mode exclusive
which actually gives you super super

highly recommend testing on DP two with

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.170
highly recommend testing on DP two with
 

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.020
highly recommend testing on DP two with
DP one we would throw up a toast when

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.030
DP one we would throw up a toast when
 

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.460
DP one we would throw up a toast when
these things happen with DP two it'll

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:49.470
these things happen with DP two it'll
 

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.470
these things happen with DP two it'll
get logged in logcat and the apple crash

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480
get logged in logcat and the apple crash
 

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.660
get logged in logcat and the apple crash
and what will happen in the release

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:53.670
and what will happen in the release
 

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.090
and what will happen in the release
version is probably something in between

so I'm not guaranteeing not just because
something crashes in DP two doesn't mean

00:22:59.360 --> 00:22:59.370
something crashes in DP two doesn't mean
 

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.650
something crashes in DP two doesn't mean
it's going to crash so if you have a

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:00.660
it's going to crash so if you have a
 

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.360
it's going to crash so if you have a
problem with it and you're saying hey

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:02.370
