00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:03.277
(drum beat music)

00:00:03.308 --> 00:00:06.406
Ann: The Italian futurists
were one group of artists

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.272
who were doing incredible things in 1913.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:12.835
Thinking about art as something
that had to be for the new century.

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:18.168
Speed, noise, machinery, and
the city became a key part

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:19.790
of all of their paintings.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.642
Dynamism of a Soccer Player
challenges any viewer

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.705
to actually find a soccer player:
two arms, two legs, a face.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:28.845
No way.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:32.898
Colors and shapes
moving, running, kicking.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:37.091
Your eye is brought to the next
place or to a place further down.

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:40.602
There's only one way when you look
at a yellow form or a red form

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:43.032
that you can see that
form which is in relation

00:00:43.032 --> 00:00:45.166
to the colors circulating around it.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:50.614
The brush strokes are extremely
visible, they are tangible its material.

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:55.263
Photography which was little
more than half a century old

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.080
had an enormous impact.

00:00:57.172 --> 00:01:02.087
Eadweard Muybridge did photography
in sequence: bop, bop, bop, bop.

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.645
They wanted to do that in painting too.

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.933
The futurists believed
that part of being modern

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:11.694
was not only painting modern
things but creating a ruckus.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:14.377
When their pictures
appeared at exhibitions

00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:18.631
they issued manifestos, they have
lectures, they had performances

00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:23.564
that absolutely provoked the people
in attendance to realizing, "Wow."

00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:25.926
Even if we didn't understand the picture,

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:29.475
what we're doing is being
a witness to something

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:31.707
that is upsetting centuries of tradition.

00:01:31.707 --> 00:01:37.822
