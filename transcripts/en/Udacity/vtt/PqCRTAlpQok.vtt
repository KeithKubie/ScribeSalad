00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.730
Okay, so now we have some idea of what
is privacy in the online context.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.280
What kind of information is private and
what may not be private.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.790
Let's talk about some
threats to privacy.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.560
Well on the internet, we talk about
a source of a request that goes to

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.670
a certain service or a destination, and
so we communicate between two endpoints.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.620
Analysis of who's talking to who.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.860
Obviously, think that who I
communicate with should be private.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.010
Of course this traffic
analysis is a threat to that.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.380
It can violate, or
disclose that information.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.338
Other threat to privacy is,
of course, large scale surveillance.

00:00:41.338 --> 00:00:47.239
And recently, in fact this month,
this letter from this encryption

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.327
experts was published about
the law enforcement agency's

00:00:52.327 --> 00:00:58.632
claim that if we allow encryption
without, sort of, some way to undo it,

00:00:58.632 --> 00:01:04.150
or backdoors and things like that,
then it's like going dark.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.390
Their ability to see what bad guys
are doing completely going away.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.710
So, the other people who
are arguing against that by saying,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.390
this is sort of the golden
age of surveillance.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.820
The amount of information they
can collect is unprecedented.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.196
So, in some sense, everything you do
online potentially can be tracked and

00:01:23.196 --> 00:01:27.990
collected, information about your
activities can be collected.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.870
So if somebody is doing that, of course,
that's a massive threat to privacy.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.660
Finally, with big data, data mining
analytics that we have, we can do all

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.160
kind of inferences and link different
pieces of information, okay.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.392
When we talked about
database of privacy,

00:01:46.392 --> 00:01:52.190
we did discuss inference attacks and
anonymization and things like that.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.700
Well, those could be defeated and
we have, by linking different pieces of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.500
information, very simple
online advertising.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.500
They're sort of making a guess
that you visit certain websites or

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.500
click on certain kind of links,
you'll be interested in certain things.
