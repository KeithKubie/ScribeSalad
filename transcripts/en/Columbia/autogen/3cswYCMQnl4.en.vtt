improvisation as I've outlined it is a

improvisation as I've outlined it is a
field is an interdisciplinary field so

field is an interdisciplinary field so
 

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:04.040
field is an interdisciplinary field so
that each of the fields I outline would

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:04.050
that each of the fields I outline would
 

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:06.820
that each of the fields I outline would
have its own way to study improvisation

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:06.830
have its own way to study improvisation
 

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:09.200
have its own way to study improvisation
so that it wouldn't be limited to the

and say you see improvisation really is

00:58:31.339 --> 00:58:31.349
and say you see improvisation really is
 

00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:35.900
and say you see improvisation really is
a field and so I guess that's one of the

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:35.910
a field and so I guess that's one of the
 

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:38.810
a field and so I guess that's one of the
things I felt that being part of the

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:38.820
things I felt that being part of the
 

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:40.730

university allows me to do is to take
 

00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:42.650
university allows me to do is to take
advantage of that extraordinary of grain

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:42.660

I can't hope to really match some of
 

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.210
I can't hope to really match some of
their achievements and so I'm just

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:52.220
their achievements and so I'm just
 

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:55.120
their achievements and so I'm just
trying to make that little make of space

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:55.130
trying to make that little make of space
 

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:57.820
trying to make that little make of space
as you would do in a province with

as you would do in a province with
 

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:00.130
as you would do in a province with
musicians what you try to do is you make

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:00.140
musicians what you try to do is you make
 

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:03.130
musicians what you try to do is you make
a space for other people to be free and

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:03.140
a space for other people to be free and
 

00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:05.080

improvisation exclusively human well I

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:14.450
improvisation exclusively human well I
 

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:15.730
improvisation exclusively human well I
just spent all that time talking about

00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:15.740
just spent all that time talking about
 

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:21.280
just spent all that time talking about
machines so I guess not know is that

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:21.290
machines so I guess not know is that
 

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:23.680
machines so I guess not know is that
that I'm thinking about how far back you

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:23.690
that I'm thinking about how far back you
 

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:27.040

go I think in terms of evolution and the

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:27.050
go I think in terms of evolution and the
 

00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:29.220
go I think in terms of evolution and the
possibility that added innovation maybe

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:29.230
possibility that added innovation maybe
 

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.600
possibility that added innovation maybe
may be part of the part of evolution

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:31.610
may be part of the part of evolution
 

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:34.380
may be part of the part of evolution
this may be a very very early form of

this may be a very very early form of
 

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:37.630
this may be a very very early form of
adaptation well it's interesting

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640
adaptation well it's interesting
 

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:40.660
adaptation well it's interesting
one can um take this metaphor and very

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:40.670
one can um take this metaphor and very

I don't not being a biology person I
 

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:47.080
I don't not being a biology person I
don't feel comfortable doing that but I

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:47.090
don't feel comfortable doing that but I
 

00:59:47.090 --> 00:59:49.860
don't feel comfortable doing that but I
could say that I have run across the odd

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:49.870
could say that I have run across the odd
 

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:52.510
could say that I have run across the odd
paper talking about the role of

paper talking about the role of
 

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:55.660
paper talking about the role of
improvisation in genetics so that I

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:55.670
improvisation in genetics so that I
 

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:58.630
improvisation in genetics so that I
wasn't really able to to evaluate those

00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640
wasn't really able to to evaluate those
 

00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.550
wasn't really able to to evaluate those
papers and that's why I'm hoping to be

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:00.560
papers and that's why I'm hoping to be
 

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.140
papers and that's why I'm hoping to be
part of an interdisciplinary team of

no one controlled it and so it seems to

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:55.950
no one controlled it and so it seems to
 

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:58.069
no one controlled it and so it seems to

improvisation in some ways improvisation
 

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.710
improvisation in some ways improvisation
will remain static on one

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:07.720
will remain static on one

that is to say as a fundamental human

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240
that is to say as a fundamental human

could certainly use it to decide to well

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:18.730
could certainly use it to decide to well
 

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:20.300

we're going to improvise and

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:20.310
we're going to improvise and
 

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.230
we're going to improvise and
progressively come up with something

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240
progressively come up with something
 

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:24.480
progressively come up with something
that then we can say this is structured

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:24.490
that then we can say this is structured
 

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:26.910
that then we can say this is structured
however that ignores the fact that the

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:26.920
however that ignores the fact that the
 

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.859
however that ignores the fact that the
improvisation itself also has structure

01:05:28.859 --> 01:05:28.869
improvisation itself also has structure
 

01:05:28.869 --> 01:05:31.050
improvisation itself also has structure
so but it may be a structure that

01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:31.060
so but it may be a structure that
 

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.700
so but it may be a structure that
emerges and maybe a structure that you

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:32.710
emerges and maybe a structure that you
 

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:34.320
emerges and maybe a structure that you
have to capture in real time to jump to

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:34.330
have to capture in real time to jump to
 

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.210
have to capture in real time to jump to
study rather than something that you can

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:36.220
study rather than something that you can
 

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.880
study rather than something that you can
impose and once it's dead you can then

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:38.890
impose and once it's dead you can then
 

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:42.810
impose and once it's dead you can then
say we have it so the big promise is to

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:42.820
say we have it so the big promise is to
 

01:05:42.820 --> 01:05:44.430
say we have it so the big promise is to
be in Matias Reyes when we talk about

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:44.440
be in Matias Reyes when we talk about

be in Matias Reyes when we talk about
these kinds of things that's the biggest

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:46.630
these kinds of things that's the biggest
 

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.300
these kinds of things that's the biggest
issue I think and that's going to be

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:48.310
issue I think and that's going to be
 

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:51.150
issue I think and that's going to be
part of the working method part of the

01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160
part of the working method part of the
 

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:55.320
part of the working method part of the
graphic part historical so I'd like to
