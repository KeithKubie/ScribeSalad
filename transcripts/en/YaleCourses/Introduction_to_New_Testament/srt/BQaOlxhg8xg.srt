1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,580
All right.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,580
I asked you to come in with definite
lists of where Paul was when according to

3
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:09,260
two different sources.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,950
The purpose of the lecture today is to
get you to see what you may think of as a

5
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:20,930
historical text as actually not
a very reliable historical text.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,740
This is not to say
anything about your faith,

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,420
it's not to say anything about how you
might use this text religiously are

8
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:30,980
theologically and other words.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,010
It is not my intention to attack the
reliability of the Bible for theological

10
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:42,020
reading or for faith or your
personal beliefs about the Bible.

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,010
But what we will do is demonstrate a
difference today between reading this text

12
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,580
theologically a scripture and reading
it as historical source simply as a text

13
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,730
or a series of texts actually
cause as you know by now,

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,740
the New Testament is
a collection of texts.

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,820
If all you had were these documents
about the first several decades at the

16
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,920
beginning of Christianity,
and as a matter of fact,

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,630
all you have as documents
for the first sec,

18
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,160
a few decades of Christianity
are the new testament texts.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,560
There are documents not
in the new testament,

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,500
but they tend not to tell us anything
we want to know about, for example,

21
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:22,730
the very beginnings of of Christianity
as a movement. So what you've gotten,

22
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:25,310
the new testament comprise at least the,
uh,

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,590
some of the earliest material we have.

24
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,050
If you want to know about the
life of Jesus, for example,

25
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,130
the four Canonical Gospels with
perhaps the gospel of Thomas,

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,450
which we'll be reading later,

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,190
give you basically only
the only information about
Jesus of Nazareth available

28
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,150
to historians.

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,160
The same thing for Paul there our second
century sources that talk about Paul or

30
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:47,480
they claim to be letters by Paul,

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,680
but most of us scholars don't
believe they have any historical,

32
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:53,000
reliable information.

33
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,550
So what we've got about Paul is
what you have in the New Testament.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,720
I'm going to try to get you
to use two of those sources,

35
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,760
Galatians and the acts of the apostles.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,180
And then we're going to talk about what
can we know about Paul from these two

37
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:08,720
texts. So now pick your list
out that you made for acts.

38
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,280
When is the first time we see
the Apostle Paul in acts chapter,

39
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:20,910
in verse.
I'm a former fundamentalist,

40
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,300
which means I want chapter
and verse on everything.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,833
Perfect

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,960
chapter and verse. When was the
first time we see Paul? Yes sir.

43
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,150
Nine one.

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,013
And where is he

45
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,900
on the road to Damascus?
We starts off in Jerusalem.

46
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,333
Yeah.

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,290
Now is that actually the first time we
see Paul in the book of Acts Perfect

48
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,420
in seven 58 so we actually
see him before then.

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,360
And what's where is he there?

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,870
That's right. He was witnesses.
The stoning of Stephen,

51
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,140
who by tradition is the
first Christian martyr,

52
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,090
first person to die for Christianity
and acts. And he's in what city?

53
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,560
Where's he? Come on
folks quicker. Quicker.

54
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,220
Where's the and he's in Jerusalem.
Thank you.

55
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,483
Yeah.

56
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,170
Now let's just read that first part there.

57
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,940
They dragged him out of the city.
That is, Steven began to stone him.

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,720
The witnesses laid their coats at
the feet of a young man named Saul,

59
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,250
who the writer of acts will
later tell us is also named Paul.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,910
So stall is acts depixol
as his Jewish name.

61
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:52,370
And Paul is sort of his
great Greek and Roman name.

62
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,700
While they were stoning Stephen,
he prayed and so forth.

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,740
Look at eight one and Saul approved of
their killing him that day as severe

64
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,840
persecution began against
the church in Jerusalem.

65
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,870
All except the apostles were scattered
throughout the countryside of Judea and

66
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,770
Sumeria. Devout men buried Stephen
and made loud limitation over him.

67
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,300
But Saul was ravaging the church
by entering house after house,

68
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:19,160
dragging off both men and women. He
committed them to prison. So Saul,

69
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,210
as he's known here,

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,400
is fairly active in Jerusalem as a
persecutor of the followers of Jesus.

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,650
He causes several. You've arrested, they
know who he is, they would recognize him.

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,910
He's got a reputation.

73
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,160
So that's where the first time we see
Paul is seven 58 and then we the con,

74
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,860
the acts as we'll see,
does a lot of other things.

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,230
And then comes back to Paul.

76
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:47,231
Now at nine one so after nine one
when's the next time we see Paul?

77
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:55,270
And x
goes,

78
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:59,530
he's on the road to Damascus. Did y'all
do this homework? Yes sir. In the back.

79
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,170
Rolling 1225

80
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,010
and what?
Where is that?

81
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,570
Okay. Barnabas and Paul
go back to Jerusalem.

82
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,430
Let's back up a bit.
So I think we're missing some stuff.

83
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,920
I want every detail of time,
every detail of place.

84
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,620
Look at nine 26

85
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,690
when he had come to Jerusalem,
he attempted to join the disciples.

86
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,780
They were all afraid of him for they
did not believe he was a disciple,

87
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,930
but Barnabas took him, brought him
to the disciples, the apostles,

88
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,170
and describe for them how on the road he
had seen the Lord who had spoken to him,

89
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,750
how in Damascus he had
spoken Bogan name of Jesus.

90
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,570
So he went in and out among in Jerusalem
speaking boldly in the name of the

91
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,930
Lord. He spoken, argued with the
Hellenistic, that is Greek speaking Jews,

92
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,810
but they were attempting to kill him.
When the believers learned of it,

93
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,560
they brought him down to Cesarea
and sent him off to tarsus.

94
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,010
So notice in chapter nine you've got
several chronological and spatial details

95
00:06:15,321 --> 00:06:19,550
about Paul. That's what I wanted you
to notice. Not just read it quickly.

96
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,440
Don't read this stuff like
college students read it
as really critical readers,

97
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:27,350
not just to get the reading done,
but notice the details. Now I'm,

98
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,340
I'm that stressing this now because over
and over again in this semester, we'll,

99
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:36,090
we'll try to push you to read it
much more carefully noticing details.

100
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,810
That's the only way to
practice close reading. Okay,

101
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,520
so we've got him in Jerusalem,
we had a Damascus,

102
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,700
but before 1225 we have lots of other
material with him being in Jerusalem

103
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,730
and introduced to the church there.
And when is this chronologically?

104
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,011
You don't have to know the year,

105
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:03,011
but how much time are we talking about
between this Damascus period and this

106
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,491
time?

107
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,730
Barnabas introduces them to the rest of
the church and gets them accepted by the

108
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,360
church. Yes. Just as in

109
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,110
after some time had passed,

110
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,880
there's one place where it says he's
three days in Damascus after he sees Jesus

111
00:07:19,881 --> 00:07:23,120
before he's baptize. So we have
three days, then he's bad ties.

112
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,400
And then he disputes with
other people in Damascus.

113
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,270
But basically just after some time.
So it can't it,

114
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,040
we're probably not talking
several years here. Right.

115
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:34,100
You get the impression when you're reading
this that you know, it may be months,

116
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:34,970
it may be weeks.

117
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,520
Okay, so then, so this
is time in Jerusalem. Um,

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,670
what happens after Barnabas
introduced them Jerusalem.

119
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:50,100
Look at nine 30 when the
believers learned a bit,

120
00:07:50,101 --> 00:07:54,900
they brought him down to Cesarea and
sent him off to tarsus. So again,

121
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:58,020
before we get him in Jerusalem
here he's in Cesarea,

122
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,320
which is a city on the coastline
of Palestine and he's in Tarsus.

123
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,670
Why does he go to Tarsus? Do
you think that's his home?

124
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,870
Exactly. According to
acts, Paul is from tarsus.

125
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,960
Now when we get further,
I'll point out when we know,

126
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,790
when we have information about Paul
that we get from his letters and when we

127
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,870
have information about part of the,

128
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,960
we only get from acts and with
the question I'll ask you is,

129
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,990
are they both reliable?
Are they both equally reliable?

130
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,260
If you have one piece of information from
Paul's letters and a different kind of

131
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:37,310
a piece of information from ax is one
of them more likely to be historical.

132
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,080
Those are the kinds of questions
we'll ask. Yes sir. Tarsus is, um,

133
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,650
in the very eastern part of what
is now Turkey. Okay. So it's,

134
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,380
it's not far from the border of
eastern Turkey and western Syria.

135
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,470
It's in modern Turkey at the time.

136
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:56,820
At that time it was in
the area called Cilicia.

137
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,730
And that'll be important because
when we get to Galatians,

138
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,360
Paul talks about going to solicit
at one point and I'm going to say,

139
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,680
why did he go to solicit and where is
that? And some smart person's gonna say,

140
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,590
well, isn't Parsis the main capital
city of Cilicia and Iranian part?

141
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,970
And I'll say, that's brilliant. You
made a very important connection there.

142
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,090
Okay,
so he goes to tarsus.

143
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,490
Now you don't hear him much about,
uh,

144
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,170
Paul because then you have
other kinds of stuff. And then

145
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,610
look at 11,
19.

146
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,590
Now those were scattered because of the
persecution that took place over Stephen.

147
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,800
Notice how it will get this and then we'd
get to the acts of the apostles or the

148
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:50,130
electric on that. There's a been
a jump here in the period of time.

149
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,550
The stoning of Stephen was way back
there at the end of Chapter Seven,

150
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,301
the beginning chapter eight.

151
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,090
Then you had a lot of other material
now that the authors kind of taking you

152
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,860
back to that stoning of Stephen episode.

153
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,160
So this is like one of those things
that you know, it's a cutaway. It's a,

154
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:05,400
it's a time lapse sort of uh,
in, in the, the filming here,

155
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,280
they traveled as far as Phoenicia,

156
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:11,160
Cyprus and Antioch and they spoke
the word to no one except Jews,

157
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,250
but among them were some men from
Cypress and Cyrene who aren't coming to

158
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:14,760
Antioch.

159
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,750
Spoke to the Helen is also proclaiming
the Lord Jesus and the hand of the Lord

160
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,150
was with them in a great number of
became believers and turned to the Lord.

161
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,060
News of this came to the ears
of the church in Jerusalem.

162
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,550
They sent Barnabas to Antioch.
When he came and saw the
grace of God, he rejoiced.

163
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,070
He had exhorted them all to
remain faithful to the law
with step, have devotion.

164
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,610
Free was a good man,
full of the host,

165
00:10:33,611 --> 00:10:36,180
bit of faith and a great many
people were brought to the Lord.

166
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,690
Then Barnabas went to
Tarsus to look for Saul.

167
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,020
So again,
before we get this,

168
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,000
we have Saul going to Antioch

169
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,460
again, Barnabas being the
important figure who does that.

170
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,540
Uh, when he came, he saw the
grades, we've got blah, blah, blah.

171
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,680
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus
to look for Saul and uh,

172
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,440
when he found him, he brought
him to Antioch. So it was
that for an entire year.

173
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,830
They met with the church and taught a
great many people and it was an Antioch

174
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,240
that the disciples were
first called Christians. Um,

175
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,000
at that time profits came down from
Jerusalem. So we have one year here

176
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,540
in Antioch.
Before the next incident happens,

177
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,610
one of them named Agablith stood up and
predicted by the spirit that there would

178
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,140
be a severe famine over our little world.

179
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,120
This took place during
the reign of Claudius.

180
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,850
The disciples determined that
according to their ability,

181
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,280
each would send relief to
the brothers living in Judea.

182
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,720
This they did sending it to the
elders by Barnabas. And Saul.

183
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,830
So in 1130 we have Paul
going from Antioch,

184
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,830
with Barnabas
to Jerusalem,

185
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,520
taking with them funds to alleviate
famine for famine relief in Judea from the

186
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:07,600
disciples in Antioch. Okay.
When's the now after that,

187
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,490
do we have another time we see Paul,

188
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,530
that's when you get the 1225 Barnabas,
after completing the mission,

189
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:19,410
Barnabas and Saul returned to
Jerusalem and brought with them John,

190
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,970
whose other name was mark.

191
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,720
Actually, I think that may need to be
returned from Jerusalem. There's a,

192
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,490
there's a um,

193
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,960
manuscript debate over whether they
returned to Jerusalem or from Jerusalem,

194
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,200
but in any case there in Jerusalem and
then 13 one that we find them back in

195
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,580
Barnabas, Barnabas, and Saul there.

196
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,350
So chapter 13 has Barnabas and Saul

197
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,580
and Antioch.
Again,

198
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,100
while they were worshiping the Lord
and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,

199
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,100
set apart from me Barnabas and Saul
for the work to which I've called them.

200
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,580
Then after fasting and praying, they laid
their hands on them and sent them off.

201
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,270
They went by the Holy Spirit.
They went to Solutia. Okay.

202
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:19,470
Then we have what's called the
first missionary journey. All right,

203
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:21,390
so this is the first week
you're near Barnabas and Paul.

204
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,540
They travel through that part of central
and southern Turkey that we call Asia

205
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:28,740
minor if for the ancient
world called Turkey. Now,

206
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,660
so what happens next after
13 one where does Paul go?

207
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,903
Yes sir.

208
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,480
Okay, so they, they have a confrontation
with the magician called bar Jesus.

209
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,730
Where else? Yes. Cyprus.

210
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,000
Yep. So Cypress Psalmist, they're
traveling around. Where else?

211
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,770
Where do they end up?
Sorry,

212
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,310
I conium it's another
place they go to next.

213
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,230
Lystra Darby.
Next Durga.

214
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,190
Pega.
Next

215
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,570
video video. Where do they end
up after that first journey?

216
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,530
At the end of the journey.
Back in Antioch.

217
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,163
Okay,

218
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,550
so we're going to include all those places
you just said in the first missionary

219
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:38,230
journey and then they end up and Antioch.

220
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,540
Where's the next place they go?

221
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,670
Jerusalem.
What do they do this time in Jerusalem?

222
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,063
Sorry.

223
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,270
They have a debate. The whole, the leaders
of the church get together. They debate.

224
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,260
What's the topic of the debate

225
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,230
whether gentiles have to be circumcised
to be members of the community and who

226
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:07,520
makes the decision? Pardon?
Who makes the decision?

227
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,570
Somebody, right? Somebody say
it out loud a lot. Enough,

228
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,670
sorry James. They all make the
decision together. In fact,

229
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:21,410
they say it seemed good to the Holy
Spirit and to us that's an interesting way

230
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:22,670
of putting it because in the book of acts,

231
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,450
the Holy Spirit is actually the
main actor of the whole book.

232
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,980
The Holy Spirit does all this kind of
stuff in the book of acts and so that's

233
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:33,100
why the acts of the apostles
is almost a MS title.

234
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,500
It judged to be called the acts of the
Holy Spirit a much more accurately for

235
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:37,280
the narrative,

236
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,630
but the holy spirit and with all the
beliefs and James who's considered the

237
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:45,650
leader of the church in Jerusalem
actually announces that decision,

238
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,500
but it's a is this isn't.
They all came to by consensus.

239
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,370
Everybody agrees that no gentiles don't
have to be circumcised and they make

240
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:55,760
some rules. They say that they
shouldn't eat meat sacrificed to idols.

241
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,170
They cert shouldn't eat blood.

242
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,920
They shouldn't commit
fornication or sexual immorality.

243
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,270
So they make some rules that they
expect gentile followers to follow.

244
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,010
They get those rules from the Jewish
tradition that these were the rules that

245
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,110
were given to Noah after the flood.

246
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,050
That so therefore all people in the world,

247
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,850
because all people of
course that now exist,

248
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,760
came from the people who lived
through the flood, right?

249
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,510
So all people in the world, we're
given these rules, even gentiles.

250
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,080
And so even pious gentiles
should keep these rules,

251
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,530
although they do not have
to be circumcised. So
that's the way that happens.

252
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,030
Where, where does Paul go
after that? We're going to move
quickly. Now. Part. Pardon?

253
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,470
Antioch. Back to Antioch. And then
he and Barnabas have a falling out.

254
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,480
I had to have a disagreement.

255
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,540
What's the disagreement between
Paul and Barnabas about enacts,

256
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,990
whether to take John Mark with them
on the next journey? They go, uh,

257
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,240
Paul wants to, it's wants to
take mark. Paul doesn't, is
that the way it goes? Yeah.

258
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,020
And then they split up. It's a very
amicable split and acts, right?

259
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,980
It's a personnel decision. They don't
have any debates about doctrine.

260
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,670
They don't have any disagreements
about what the Gospel means.

261
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,170
They don't have any disagreements
about, uh, eating our circumcision.

262
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,270
Barnabas and Saul and Paul split up
simply over a personnel decision about

263
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,790
whether to take John Mark on
the next missionary journey.

264
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,680
So that's notice where we got,

265
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,050
how often is Paul in
Jerusalem before that?

266
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,940
Before this main Jerusalem Council,
how many times?

267
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,170
One, two, three, four,

268
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,440
five.
He's in Jerusalem five times before the,

269
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,890
the General Council that we, that we sort
of ended up a little narrative there.

270
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,180
Now look at Galatians

271
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,640
and we don't have to go all
the way through Galatians,

272
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:03,200
but we're going to read the part of
Galatians much more carefully and closely.

273
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,080
It's only basically the first
two chapters that we need.

274
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,193
And again,

275
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,220
we're going to put the details up on
the board cause I want you to pay much

276
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:17,150
closer attention to this then
apparently some of you paid anyway,

277
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,960
one 11 I want you to know,
brothers, his brothers and said,

278
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,030
may say ancestors in
your English translation,

279
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,510
but it doesn't in the Greek that the
gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of

280
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:36,050
human origin, for I did not receive it
from a human source, nor was I taught it,

281
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,840
but I received it through a
revelation of Jesus Christ.

282
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,420
So first Paul starts out
on the letter saying,

283
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,250
I didn't get my gospel
from any human person.

284
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,940
I got it straight from Jesus.
Now remember,

285
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:52,490
Paul didn't know Jesus
during Jesus' own lifetime.

286
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,140
So he's referring to a
revelation experience that
he had when he saw Jesus and

287
00:18:57,141 --> 00:18:59,090
some kind of visionary
experience or another place.

288
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,860
He says he was lifted up
into the third heaven.

289
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,330
So we'll talk at some point about what
kind of experience was this that Paul had,

290
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,130
but that's where he got his gospel.

291
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,880
You have heard no doubt of
my earlier life in Judaism.

292
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:14,480
I was violently persecuting the Church
of God and was trying to destroy it.

293
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,680
I advanced in Judaism beyond many among
my people are the same age for I was

294
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:21,080
more zealous for the
traditions of my ancestors.

295
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,470
But when God who had set me apart before
I was born, called me through his grace,

296
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,350
was pleased to reveal something so that
I might proclaim among the gentiles.

297
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,100
I did not confer with any human being.
Now,

298
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:34,280
where is Paul at this point?
According to his own statement.

299
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,493
Wow.

300
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,360
We don't know. Right. But
we know one place he's not.

301
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,920
And where is that? Because
we've got, then he said,

302
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,990
I did not,

303
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,030
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those
who are already apostles before me.

304
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,130
But I went away at once into Arabia
and afterwards I returned to Damascus.

305
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,680
That's how you know where he was.

306
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,160
I returned to Damascus.

307
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,700
So where is the first place
we see Paul chronologically.

308
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,550
Geographically according to his letter,
his Damascus.

309
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,233
Okay.

310
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,020
Okay, let's keep them. Then he says, um,

311
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:29,090
I went to Arabia Arabia at this date
at time refers to the part on the other

312
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:37,060
side of the Jordan River from Judea.
So it's what we would call modern Jordan,

313
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,890
mainly. Maybe eastern Syria, western
Jordan. But that's what it was.

314
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,290
Arabian desert. That's,
so he's talking about,

315
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,650
he went away to that area that we
would not call eastern or Jordan.

316
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,970
I remember Damascus is one
of the large cities in Syria,

317
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,480
so that's where he goes.
Um,

318
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,910
afterwards I returned to Damascus.

319
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,530
Yeah.

320
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:06,360
After three years we'd get
a nice little chronological

321
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,080
note. I did go to Jerusalem
to visit CFUs. Who has CFUs?

322
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,810
Peter. Yeah, exactly. So Peter cfs is
the Aramaic word for rock or stone.

323
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,130
And Peter is the Greek word
for rock or stone. So again,

324
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:28,080
we have two different names.
So he goes to Jerusalem

325
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,290
to meet Peter,
but he says,

326
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:35,850
and I stayed with him for 15 days.

327
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,920
So this first trip and
Jerusalem takes 15 days.

328
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,140
Yeah,

329
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
no,
just what he says then.

330
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,440
But I did not see any
other apostle except James,

331
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,100
the Lord's brother.

332
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,580
Is that Jesus. His brother.
Yes. Somebody said,

333
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,470
according to Roman Catholic tradition,
Jesus didn't have any brothers. Uh,

334
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:08,970
but according to the New Testament,

335
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:12,000
he did have brothers and maybe
sister's according to some manuscripts.

336
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,350
So James is called the brother
of Jesus in the book of acts.

337
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,880
Don't confuse this with James, son of
Zebedee, who was one of the 12 apostles,

338
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,450
has a different James. There
are several James's, uh,

339
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,070
cause it was a very common name in
the ancient world. And you know,

340
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:29,340
of course James is just the
Anglos Ization of Jacob.

341
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,420
So it's actually Jacob in the
Greek and that's the word it is.

342
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,270
It becomes James in English.
So James,

343
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:40,650
the Lord's brother in what I'm
writing to you before, God,

344
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,250
I do not lie.
What,

345
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,290
why does Paul have his panties in a wad

346
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,330
confirming that he only was there 15
days and he only saw Peter and James.

347
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,840
I swear it, I swear it. I swear it.

348
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,630
Then I went into the regions
of Syria and solicit.

349
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:08,720
Okay.

350
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,020
Why do you think he went to solicit IA?

351
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,660
That's where tarsus is. Maybe that's a
clue that he actually was from tarsus.

352
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:20,060
Although Paul doesn't never
tell us he's from Tarsus,

353
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,670
so we don't know that's
his hometown from him,

354
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,720
but that's what acts says is his hometown.
So what maybe he went to Tarsus,

355
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,660
we don't know.
He just says he went to seriousness.

356
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,290
I was still unknown by site to the
Churches of Judea that are in Christ.

357
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,270
They only heard it said the one who
formally was persecuting us is now

358
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:41,120
proclaiming the faith and the ones tried
to destroy and they glorify God. I did.

359
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,480
I was not known by sight.
They heard my reputation.

360
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:47,780
They heard that I persecuted
followers of Jesus, but nobody,

361
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,990
no follower of Jesus in Judea knew what
I looked like except Peter and James

362
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,340
and he's two swears it.
He's very adamant.

363
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,980
Then after 14 years,
so we have a 14 year period of time.

364
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,190
I went up again with Barnabas
taking Titus along with me.

365
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,560
I went up in response to a revelation.

366
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,810
Why does he say he went up
in response to a revelation?

367
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,673
You might have an idea.

368
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,490
Yes. No. As we'll see
throughout this letter.

369
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Paul is a month to make it very clear
that he is not playing second fiddle to

370
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:32,870
anybody in Jerusalem. He didn't get
his gospel from those disciples.

371
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,950
He didn't get it from Peter and James.
He got it straight from Jesus.

372
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,960
He didn't check his gospel out with them
at this point. He got it from Jesus.

373
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,000
Paul is trying to establish
his independence from the
church in Jerusalem and

374
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:50,180
he's eventually gonna try to establish
that I'm just as much an apostle as they

375
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:53,760
are. I went up the
responsibility. In other words,

376
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:57,880
he went up in response to a revelation
that God appeared. God's told, uh,

377
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,790
Pete Paul according him go to Jerusalem.

378
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,510
He didn't go because the
Jerusalem authorities said,

379
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:07,860
we need to check you out and see if
you're okay. Come to Jerusalem. They did.

380
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,210
This was not a command performance.

381
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:14,211
He's insisting that I laid before them
though only in private meeting with the

382
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,300
acknowledged leaders,

383
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,960
the gospel that I proclaim among the
gentiles in order to make sure that I was

384
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:21,030
not running or had not run in vain.

385
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,500
But even Titus who was with me was
not compelled to be circumcised,

386
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,280
though he was a Greek,
but because of false believers,

387
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,930
secretly his causes pro false brothers
secretly brought in who slipped into spy

388
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:37,200
out the freedom that we have in Christ
Jesus so that they might enslave us.

389
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,990
We did not submit to
them even for a moment,

390
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,570
so that the truth of the Gospel
might always remain with you.

391
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,020
And and from those who are supposed
to be acknowledged leaders what they

392
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:49,800
actually were make no difference to me.
God shows no partiality. Notice again,

393
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:54,801
Paul is really kind of angry and anxious
about not wanting to cede any authority

394
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,440
to these Jerusalem leaders
except as they are local leaders.

395
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,030
Those leaders contributed nothing
too new to me. On the contrary,

396
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,840
when they saw that I had been entrusted
with the Gospel for the uncircumcised,

397
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,930
just as Peter had been entrusted
with the Gospel for the circumcised,

398
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,280
for he who worked through Peter,

399
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:14,040
making him in a positive of
the circumcised also work
through me and sending me

400
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:17,610
to the gentiles.
And when James and CFUS and John,

401
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,380
this is James the Lord's brother,

402
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,970
CIF as Peter and the disciple
John who acknowledged pillars,

403
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,590
recognize the grace
they've been given to me.

404
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,230
They gave to Barnabas and me
the right hand of fellowship,

405
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,830
agreeing that we should go to the
gentiles and they to the circumcised.

406
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,560
They ask only one thing
that we remember the poor,

407
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,800
which was actually what I was eager to do.
Now,

408
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:41,160
there's a big question here is
what Paul is describing here.

409
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,830
Basically this Jerusalem conference,
is it his version?

410
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,930
It's quite different.
At the white Paul Paul x complexities,

411
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,130
it's mainly him and sort of the
leaders of the Jerusalem church.

412
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:57,180
You'd get together. It's not. It
wasn't brought about by some crisis.

413
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,460
Paul went because God told him to do so.

414
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:01,290
They could just all make sure
that they have an agreement.

415
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,500
They make an agreement. Gentiles
don't have to be circumcised. Cut.

416
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:09,120
Nobody pressured except these
false brothers Titus to be
circumcised the pillars.

417
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,510
Peter, James and John did not
insist that gentiles be circumcised.

418
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:17,490
They agreed with Peter's
with Paul's Gospel. The next
thing that happens though.

419
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:20,100
So look at what Paul says.

420
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,090
He starts in Damascus.
Here's an Arabia who's Damascus,

421
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,650
three year period of time he's
in Jerusalem, but only 15 days.

422
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,010
He only sees Peter and James.
Then he goes back to,

423
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:35,520
goes to Syria and solicit and
then after 14 years later,

424
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,650
so it's some scholars say,

425
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:41,400
well is this 14 years including the
three years that is as this 14 years from

426
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:44,520
his revelation or we have 17 years.
So when you,

427
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,820
when you try to figure out the
chronology for Paul's ministry in life,

428
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,960
you have to make that decision.

429
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:53,990
I think that what's more likely is this
14 years is sincere to be 14 years after

430
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:54,960
this,
three years.

431
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,960
So you've got 17 years that would put
this Jerusalem meeting in about 17 years

432
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,230
after Paul's own conversion.
If he was converted,

433
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,680
he seems to be converted very early,
are called to be an apostle very early.

434
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,730
If Jesus died around the year 30
perhaps Paul, let's say just pay.

435
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:15,900
Paula got his revelation in 34
so you'll be talking, you know,

436
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,960
17 years after say 34 or 35 is when you
have this Jerusalem conference and then

437
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:25,050
you have the the next thing.
Now what happens next though?

438
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,340
Now what that basically is saying,
let's just stop here and say, okay,

439
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,480
how do you make this fit,
this,

440
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,940
how do you make this fit?

441
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:40,941
This on over here you have Paul starting
off in Jerusalem and he's persecuting

442
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:42,174
the disciples.

443
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,490
How can he then say over here that
they had never seen him face his face?

444
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,900
Yeah.

445
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,730
Were all of them dead by this time?

446
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,200
He swears they didn't know his face,

447
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,600
which seems to me to say that Paul is
claiming he wasn't in Jerusalem when he

448
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:03,590
was persecuting the church.
He was persecuting Christians in Syria.

449
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,350
He was persecuting followers of
Jesus in the Jewish diaspora,

450
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,700
not in Judea at all. That's what Paul
is claiming and then he goes, masses.

451
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,080
He goes to Jerusalem for 15 days,

452
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:20,081
but only sees these people and it's 17
years total is the first time he's seen

453
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:25,631
publicly in Jerusalem by many different
followers of Jesus that just doesn't

454
00:29:28,281 --> 00:29:31,700
seem to fit here. Here he starts off
in Jerusalem, he's in Jerusalem again.

455
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:33,590
He goes from Damascus, but it
seems like it's only, you know,

456
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:38,030
a matter of weeks or months perhaps.
He's in his, in Antioch for a year.

457
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,030
He goes back to Jerusalem and he's an
ally for year. He goes back to Jerusalem.

458
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,090
Uh, he's, uh, back to Jerusalem here
in Beckley, Islam here. He's all,

459
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:50,290
he's in and out of Judy Andrews from all
the time. Which one of these is accurate

460
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,750
or do you believe that
now you can find really,

461
00:29:55,751 --> 00:30:00,190
really brilliant fundamentalist who
believe that the Bible has to be

462
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:03,280
historically and scientifically
true and every one of its details.

463
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,940
And you know what? They can kind of
figure out how to harmonize all this,

464
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,120
but it takes a lot of very brilliant work.

465
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,490
It's much more likely,
isn't it?

466
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,300
That one of these accounts is
more accurate than the other.

467
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,820
Which one do you believe?

468
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,583
That's a real question.

469
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,000
Which one do you believe somebody
could make me an argument? Decide,

470
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,960
come on, break out of that, you know,

471
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,560
undergraduate shyness and
just make an argument. Yes.

472
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,270
You believe x, y did you
believe x? Say it loud.

473
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,620
[inaudible]

474
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,430
that sounds like a historical account.
It doesn't.

475
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:54,970
It doesn't seem like it has a
big ax to grind in Galatians.

476
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:58,240
Paul is obviously has an extra grind.
He's, he's gone all over himself saying,

477
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:59,830
I'm not lying. I'm not
lying. I'm not lying.

478
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,160
This fellow says maybe Paul's protesting
too much in Galatians and acts sounds a

479
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:07,390
bit more like an impartial account.

480
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,490
The rest of you by that everybody nods
their head. That sounds good to everybody.

481
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,610
Yes sir.
Yeah.

482
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,770
Galatians is a firsthand account.
I mean,

483
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:22,890
acts was written by someone we don't
know even know who it, who wrote it,

484
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,800
but it obviously wasn't written
by someone who saw this stuff.

485
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,970
He says he used other sources and so when
we get to the gospel of Luke and acts,

486
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,870
which were both written by the same
person will see that this authored admits.

487
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:36,690
They use other sources. So he was not
an eye witness of any of this stuff.

488
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,470
At least the stuff that he tells
him about. Uh, here in this part,

489
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,410
there's some debate about whether he
maybe was an eye witness for some of the

490
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:46,020
travels of Paul later and they'll and x.

491
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,910
But at this point he doesn't
even claim to have been there.

492
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,070
So wooden is a historian.

493
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,830
Wouldn't you take an
account by an eye witness?

494
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:58,740
The person who actually experienced
this over an account written later.

495
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,650
So this gentleman over here says,
no,

496
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:06,240
Paul's account is better historical
source because he was there.

497
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,470
Anybody else make an argument?
Well,

498
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,160
what about the idea that the writer
of acts is just telling a story?

499
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:22,030
Paul clearly has an an ax to grind,
not to make a pun.

500
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,793
Yes,

501
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,760
that's right. So the writer of acts
could be having an ax to grind,

502
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:36,930
which is to make the church sound more
harmonious and United and all that sort

503
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:37,764
of thing.

504
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:42,080
It may also be that the writer of
acts wants to emphasize the center of

505
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:46,850
Jerusalem and Judea and the leaders
there as the central authority.

506
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:49,760
For the early Christian
movement and so he's,

507
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,360
he's exaggerating Paul's presence in
Jerusalem and exaggerating the role of

508
00:32:56,421 --> 00:33:00,230
these leaders in Jerusalem. So yeah,
it's a good point. The writer of acts,

509
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,190
we should all, we should all know that
every, uh, written account of anything,

510
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,760
no matter how historically good
at is still has a point of view.

511
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:09,860
Still has an agenda.
Yes.

512
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,740
No acts was written after the life of
Paul so Paul doesn't have access to the

513
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:21,800
book of acts as one of his sources.
Now the other question is,

514
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,570
did the writer of acts have access
to Paul's letters and we don't know.

515
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Okay.
The basic time for me to wrap up here,

516
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:37,330
the basic question here is whether you
decide to trust more acts or Paul on this

517
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:41,390
issue is a historical question.

518
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,210
But the basic point also
is to get you by very,

519
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:49,211
very close reading of this text to see
that it's much better historical practice

520
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:53,840
as a historian to not text,

521
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,660
not take any of these texts as simple,
straightforward history.

522
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,470
What I will argue eventually is that
Paul is probably telling what is more

523
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:06,890
accurately the case. Yes, he
has a reason to stress it,

524
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,770
but he says it so forceful
and he writes it in a letter.

525
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,100
And if he had actually been in
Jerusalem as much as access,

526
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,480
couldn't the people who received his
letter have checked this out? Yeah,

527
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,110
they could. They could
basically say later, no Paul,

528
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:25,360
in spite of saying that you do
not lie, you're a liar. We've,

529
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,660
we know we've checked it out.

530
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:33,350
So Paul's letter I would say is much
more likely to ha to contain better

531
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:34,730
historical evidence,
but the,

532
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,040
but we can argue about that
till till the cows come home.

533
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:42,020
The main point is that you still have
to sift to these documents with a lot of

534
00:34:42,021 --> 00:34:46,220
careful sifting to get any reliable
historical data out of them.

535
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,670
For example, later when we get to
Galatians some of these things,

536
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,780
we'll talk a bit about what really
happened in Antioch that caused the Split

537
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:57,860
Between Barnabas and Paul in
acts. It's all like, oh no,

538
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,610
they just had a personnel decision,
uh,

539
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,570
disagreement that they
parted perfectly in, in,

540
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,010
in agreement about the Basic Gospel.
According to Galatians,

541
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,130
no Barnabas and Paul disagreed strongly
over whether Jews could continue and

542
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:18,140
table fellowship with
uncircumcised gentiles and
Barnabas went along with Peter

543
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,730
and some disciples from James
in Jerusalem and saying, no,

544
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,950
even Jewish followers of Jesus shouldn't
share meals with uncircumcised gentiles.

545
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:34,190
Paul believes that Barnabas got that
wrong, so according to Paul's letters,

546
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,460
Paul split with Barnabas on a serious
disagreement over doctrine and practice in

547
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:44,841
the early church and again acts kind
of slides that over cause acts tries to

548
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:49,800
make the church look completely
harmonious. This is historical criticism.

549
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,720
Reading these texts,

550
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,190
just like you would read any other
ancient texts with just the same amount of

551
00:35:56,191 --> 00:36:00,600
scrutiny and suspicion
that you would any text.

552
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,220
That's what we're going
to do in this semester.

553
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,710
It's different from reading
the text of scripture.

554
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,250
This is not to say that I believe reading
the Texas scripture is bad or wrong.

555
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,200
I believe it's just with a
different way of reading.

556
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,910
I think you can come up with good,

557
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:17,070
true Christian theological readings of
the New Testament and you can come up

558
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,950
with very decent historical
readings in the New Testament.

559
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,560
They just always won't be
the same kind of reading.

560
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,770
But what this class is going to do for
the most part is talking about that

561
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:29,260
historical reading. And when we
get to Paul and we get to acts,

562
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,640
we're going to pick these texts all apart.
We're going to ask questions like,

563
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,360
is any of this historical?
If so, what and why?

564
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,140
So start thinking that way and
then I'll see you on Wednesday.
