the school of computer science is really

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589
the school of computer science is really
 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.849
the school of computer science is really
important to me and almost no other

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859
important to me and almost no other
 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.030

accepted into an honors college computer
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.429
accepted into an honors college computer
science program I was the only girl in

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
science program I was the only girl in
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.650
science program I was the only girl in
the room and I don't know if that was

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
the room and I don't know if that was
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.290
the room and I don't know if that was
all of the people in the program but

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
all of the people in the program but
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.570

that they had a lot of women in their
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750
that they had a lot of women in their
computer science department but they

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
computer science department but they
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.569
computer science department but they
also were very welcoming to women and

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
also were very welcoming to women and
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.150

women when I came to visit CMU after I
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.090
women when I came to visit CMU after I
had been accepted I met Tom Cortina and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100
had been accepted I met Tom Cortina and
 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.160
had been accepted I met Tom Cortina and
he gave a presentation on the school

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
he gave a presentation on the school
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810
he gave a presentation on the school
computer science for the people who were

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
computer science for the people who were
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.779
computer science for the people who were
admitted and he was very charismatic and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
admitted and he was very charismatic and
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.479

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.240
he just seemed so passionate about what
he was doing and that was another thing

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
he was doing and that was another thing
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.460

of just that all about the reputation

of just that all about the reputation
but CMU isn't like that at all the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729
but CMU isn't like that at all the
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.910
but CMU isn't like that at all the
reason that CMU has the reputation is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
reason that CMU has the reputation is
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.890
reason that CMU has the reputation is
because the faculty are so passionate

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900
because the faculty are so passionate
 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.960
because the faculty are so passionate
about everything they're doing and they
