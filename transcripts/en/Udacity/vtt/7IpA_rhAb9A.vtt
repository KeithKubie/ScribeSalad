00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.610
As I said, my name is Spencer Rugaber
and I have been with Georgia Tech for

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.470
25 years.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.120
Before that I was an industrial software
developer, both for big companies like

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.560
Bell Laboratories in Spery, and for
a startup called Interactive Systems.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.000
Since coming to Georgia Tech I have also
worked closely with industry Both for

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.970
the large telecommunications vendor,
and with several startup companies.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.380
Throughout I have tried to combine
academic software engineering theory

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.820
with everyday industrial practice.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.630
I am the developer of CS 6310,
and have taught it many times,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.190
both on site in Atlanta, and
remotely in Korea, and France.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.130
I also participated in the planning and

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.560
development of other software
insuring courses here at Georgia Tech

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.110
including the course on software process
that is part of the ahms program.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.830
And other courses on software
generation and software requirements.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.280
One thing that characterizes
these courses,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.980
is their emphasis on learning by doing.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.540
Particularly for design, no amount of
academic knowledge can make up for

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.140
the hard won experience of
actually building things.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.730
You will have that opportunity in
the project portion of this course.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.720
You can have a look at my teaching
philosophy by following the link

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.310
in the instructor notes for this lesson.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.970
I now want you to meet Jarrod Parkes.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.010
You will see him in some of the lesson
videos acting as a typical student,

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.410
trying to solve the exercises and
asking questions that arise.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.050
Jarrod, can you tell us
a little about yourself.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.220
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, as Spencer said
my name is Jarrod Parkes and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.990
I'll be working with you and
Spencer throughout this course.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.670
In terms of software experience I've
worked in a number of different

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.340
places in my career.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.400
I've worked in
a telecommunications company and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.590
there I tested and programmed new
features for dsl routing equipment.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.630
I've also programmed a number of
small video games and prototypes for

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.140
the biotech community.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.070
And I own a web and mobile development
company with my twin brother, James.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.620
More importantly,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.230
though, is I want to help Spencer bring
a new, exciting feel to this course.
