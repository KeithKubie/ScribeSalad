00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.299
In 1848, Phineas Gage was working on a
railroad in Cavendish, packing the powder

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.680
down with a tamping iron, blowing up rocks.
The charge detonates prematurely and this

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.860
tamping iron, this three-foot seven-inch,
thirteen and a half pound tamping iron

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.550
fires into Phineas Gage's head.
It enters into his left cheek, it passes

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.920
behind his left eye, it severs his optic nerve,
and then comes out his forehead lands 30 yards away.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.780
Phineas Gage was able to survive having
a three-foot seven-inch bar shot

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.600
transcranially through his head.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.219
In 1850, Henry Jacob Bigelow.
professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School at the time.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.379
brought Gage and John Harlow, his doctor, to
Harvard for an examination.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.180
Bigelow essentially concludes that this man did have a giant iron bar shot through his head

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.200
and did survive, and he publishes the case in1850.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.560
After the accident, Phineas Gage goes from business-like and efficient to
no longer able to follow through with his plans.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.130
He becomes the textbook case
for post-traumatic personality change

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.170
and that's what you find in a lot of the
modern medical neuroscience psychology literature.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.170
Phineas Gage has been at Harvard
Medical School for a hundred and sixty years

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.640
so in many ways I see him

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.399
similarly to how you would see one of
the famous professors who hang on the wall.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.220
He's an important part of Harvard
Medical School's identity and by

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.350
Continuing to reflect on his case, it
allows us to continually change

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.429
how we want to understand the human brain how we
interact with our historical

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.950
understanding of neuroscience
