00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.200
&gt;&gt;Presenter: I'm delighted to welcome to the
Googleplex Kelly McGonigal, a health psychologist

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.210
at Stanford University and the author of a
new book, "The Willpower Instinct."

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.520
So in life, sometimes we struggle with choices
and accomplishing goals and we often believe

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.550
that sheer willpower will get us there.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.890
But much of what we believe and know about
willpower could actually be wrong, or that's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.180
what Kelly discovered in working with students
at Stanford University where she teaches at

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.540
Stanford University School of Medicine and
the Stanford Center for Compassion.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.010
So she created a course called the Science
of Willpower at Stanford School of Continuing

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.180
Studies and it became one of the most popular
courses at the school and went on to be a

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.050
hugely successful blog at Psychology Today
and now a book which you can get your hands

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.649
on at the end of this talk.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.989
And Kelly said, if she has her way, it'll
soon be an action figure and an action movie,

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:02.989
too.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:03.989
[Laughter]

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:04.989
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Willpower!

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:05.989
[Laughter]

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:09.990
&gt;&gt;Presenter: So today Kelly's gonna talk about
how we can accomplish the array of goals that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.670
we often struggle to get done.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.600
It might be a healthier lifestyle, it might
be life of greater productivity or sometimes

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.750
something as simple as having waited for 6
months, finally, finally, finally clearing

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.750
out the closet.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.890
[Kelly chuckles] So please help me welcome
Kelly McGonigal.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.890
[Applause]

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.570
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Thank you.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.570
Hello.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.030
I've been giving a lot of talks in this last
month and a lot about New Year's resolutions

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.690
and I have to say this is the first place
I've talked where there's apparently a healthy

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.660
code resolution going on.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.660
Is that right?

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.869
Did I see these signs right?

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.180
So who's still keeping their healthy code
resolution?

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.180
Anyone?

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.780
Good, congratulations you've got some willpower.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.130
Um, why don't you tell me just to sort of
get things rolling, tell me something that

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.810
has challenged your willpower today, anyone.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.180
&gt;&gt;audience member: Getting up on time.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.980
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Getting up on time.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.869
&gt;&gt;audience member: Washing the dishes.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.750
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Washing the dishes.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.810
Okay, so we've got two kinds of "I Will-Power"
challenges.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.159
Something you have to make yourself do even
though it'd be a little bit easier to just

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.370
not do it.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.370
Something else?

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.370
Yeah?

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.489
&gt;&gt;audience member: Doing yoga for back pain.

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.840
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Doing yoga for back pain,
well, I'm glad to hear that.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.819
We're you at my talk two years ago about yoga
for pain?

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.239
That's great.

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.029
Another "I Will" challenge.

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.609
Something else, yeah?

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.719
&gt;&gt;audience member: [Inaudible]

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:35.749
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Yeah, so an example of
"I Won't" power.

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.980
There's all these links you could follow and
you could just click and get lost down the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.489
link hole and you have to find the ability
to resist that temptation.

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.290
Maybe one or two more?

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.370
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal?

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.370
Anything?

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.669
Back row, any willpower challenges?

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:54.400
[Audience members shout]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Lunch options for today.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.760
Have you had your lunch yet?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.840
&gt;&gt;audience member: [Inaudible]

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840
[Laughter]

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.840
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: So

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.840
&gt;&gt;audience member: [Inaudible]
[Laughter]

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.640
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Great, so we make lots
of decisions everyday about what to eat and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.640
what to do.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.029
Okay, well, these are all great examples of
willpower challenges and I wanna just start

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:13.409
with a little definition, my definition of
willpower or willpower challenge.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.230
And I define a willpower challenge as something
that is basically a competition between two

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.529
parts of yourself.

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:25.790
Neuroscientists are famous for saying that
even though we have only one brain we actually

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.120
have two minds and we are completely different
people depending on which mind is active or

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.069
which systems of the brain are more active.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.650
So, a willpower challenge is anything where
those two versions of yourself have competing

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:40.650
goals.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.719
So, for example, there may be a part of you
that really wants to eat a candy bar for your

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:48.520
snack and then there's a part of you that
actually has some longer term goals, you're

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.919
thinking health, you're thinking weight loss,
you're thinking bikini season, whatever, and

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.489
maybe the banana seems like the better snack.

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.939
And, again, both of these choices you may
be drawn to by different parts of your mind

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.979
or two different versions of yourself and
one of the things that has really influenced

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.639
my work with willpower is thinking about it
in terms of what's going on in the brain.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:13.189
And we're gonna talk about that a little bit
today, the fact that you could be the very

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.519
same person but depending on your mindset,
depending on your energy, depending on your

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.000
stress levels, your brain is gonna meet this
willpower challenge in a different way and

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.210
you're gonna end up making, you know, one
choice today and one choice tomorrow.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.990
So, as was mentioned, this book is based on
a class that I teach at Stanford called "The

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.900
Science of Willpower" those are our actual
students I'm not sure what I said that was

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.330
funny but those are actual Science of Willpower
students.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.400
And I created this course because I was going
around trying to teach people how to be more

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.860
productive, how to improve their health and
everywhere I went people said, "Oh, we know

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.210
we're supposed to do that stuff already, we
just don't want to do it."

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.181
And there was this really interesting fundamental
gap between what people wanted and what they

00:04:58.181 --> 00:04:59.389
thought they wanted.

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.949
But as people were very identified, you could
say, with this version of the self.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.740
People felt like deep down that they were
the person who wanted the candy bar and this

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.590
other person that wanted the banana, "Like,
who is that?

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.870
That's not really me."

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.120
I realized that people didn't just need to
know what is the right thing to do or what

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.050
is the healthy thing to do or tips for stress
management or productivity, they needed to

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.759
feel like this person.

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.020
And they needed to know how to be that person
as the default rather than walking around

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.479
always feeling like they had to resist this
core self that only wants immediate gratification

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.550
or never wants to do anything difficult.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.729
Okay, so that's how the class came about.

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.539
What is with my clicker?

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.689
There we go, okay, great.

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.800
So, I thought today, since this is a class
based on science, that I would share with

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.060
you five of my favorite experiments from the
class and from the book and I chose experiments

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.110
that I like because they use tiny interventions,
really, really small interventions to shape

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.919
people's behavior and they have very large
outcomes.

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.300
I think this is the kind of thing many of
us are looking for, one small change we can

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.860
make, whether it's a change in how we think
or change in the way that we're approaching

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.010
the willpower challenge that can have huge
payoffs down the road making it easier to

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.960
do what it really is deep down that we want
even when it's sometimes difficult, or part

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.530
of us doesn't want.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.449
Okay, let's start with the first experiment.

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.430
How many of you sometimes feel like this guy?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.849
I know at least one of you only had 3 hours
of sleep last night.

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:38.449
So it turns out when you're this version of
yourself, every willpower challenge is more

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:39.449
difficult.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.699
And the first intervention I wanna tell you
about is actually a sleep intervention.

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.030
The main intervention was trying to help people
sleep more or sleep better.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:54.330
And it was people had a very serious willpower
challenge, these are people who are recovering

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.979
from an addiction to drugs.

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.939
And they were in a substance abuse recovery
program.

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:03.729
And half of the people in the standard care
were assigned to take a mindfulness meditation

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:09.150
training that was designed to help them improve
their sleep or sleep more.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.380
So the first thing I want you to take a look
at on this graph, this is minutes of sleep

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.639
per night and you're gonna think this is insanely
optimistic, I know, but everyone's starting

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.240
around 7 hours and we're gonna improve on
7 hours.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.759
That probably seems impossible dream.

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.449
Okay, so everyone in the group was starting
around 7 hours and what the researchers found

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:35.319
was that just doing a little bit of meditation
every day, breath focus meditation, increased

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:40.490
sleep time to just over 8 hours a day and
the control group had a little bit of deterioration

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.800
to slightly less than 7 hours of sleep a night.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.440
Now that's not the interesting finding.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.580
I mean, it is nice to know that if you meditate
for a few minutes a day you will sleep better

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.580
and get more sleep.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:57.810
So what's interesting is that change in sleep
time then made these recovering addicts impervious

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:03.590
to relapse, they were stronger against relapse
and this is a very high correlation, .70,

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:09.219
the increase in sleep time predicted resistance
to relapse with a correlation of .70.

00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:14.249
Getting one more hour of sleep a night suddenly
made it a lot easier for these recovering

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:17.680
addicts to resist the temptation of falling
off the wagon.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.750
And interestingly, the number, I never know
where, it's gonna bounce off the screen right?

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.750
I should point at the screen?

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.259
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: You guys are tech experts.

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:32.740
The number of minutes per day that people
meditated also predicted resistance to relapse.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.200
So there were really two things going on in
this intervention, there was getting more

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.979
sleep and there was also something about the
actual practice time and it wasn't a lot,

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:43.550
it was something like 10 minutes a day, 15
minutes a day.

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:49.170
And both of these things, sleep and meditation,
were giving people more willpower for one

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.360
of the biggest willpower challenges.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.740
So I want us to think together a little bit
about why those two small interventions, an

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.690
hour more sleep or 10 minutes of meditation
a day, might actually give us more willpower

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.360
for any willpower challenge.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.820
What you're looking at here is an image from
an FMRI study about what happens to the brain

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.630
when you are a little bit sleep deprived.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.560
And most studies use less than 6 hours of
sleep a night as sleep deprived which may

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.329
seem normal to you but for most of us that's
actually functioning far suboptimal.

00:09:19.329 --> 00:09:24.231
What you're looking at here is a composite
of a lot of different people's brains, some

00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:26.320
who are sleep deprived and some who are not.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.050
And we're gonna slice the brain, so imagine
me standing this way and we're gonna have

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.760
one of those meat slicers and we're gonna
slice down the head and just start taking

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.790
sections off and look down the middle.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.320
So where you see these yellow spots, that's
the front of the brain, right about here or

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.230
right about here, if that were my brain pointing
that way.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:50.570
And yellow means that this area of the brain
is under activated when you have less than

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.839
6 hours of sleep at night.

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:58.430
This area of the brain is unable to do its
job as efficiently and the red areas are areas

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.630
that are more activated, sort of midbrain
regions that are associated with basic impulses

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.850
and instincts.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:09.940
So when you're getting less than 6 hours of
sleep a night your brain is actually unable

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.880
to recruit the systems of the brain that you
need to be that better version of yourself.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.180
This area of the brain, I love this image
because it's like, here's where the balance

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.920
is weighed, "Do I want the weight loss or
do I want the chocolate bar?"

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:28.149
And this area of the brain right here is basically
keeping track of your goals and it's sort

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:35.410
of hard job, its heavy lifting it needs to
do is to remember long term goals, core values

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.500
and when it is unable to do that, when it's
under fueled or when it's under active, your

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.600
brain thinks all it really wants, all you
really want is the chocolate bar or to procrastinate

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.060
or to follow that link through, or to not
bother doing your yoga exercises.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.889
And so, in some key way, the ability to remember
who you are and what your big goals are is

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:58.570
dependent on the ability of this area of the
brain to use energy well and sleep deprivation

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.110
is one of the main things that can get in
the way of that.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.880
And I think that's one of the reasons why
this small sleep intervention ended up helping

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.680
people resist relapse to drug addiction because
they now have brains that were better fueled

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.940
to remember their goals to stay clean and
sober.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:19.180
And it's not just sleep that impacts the physiology
of your brain, how well your brain uses energy.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.470
There are a couple of other things that seem
to really strengthen the ability of the brain's

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.970
frontal regions to do what they're supposed
to do, to help you control impulses and find

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.070
your motivation.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.720
Here are the four things from the research
that seem to do it, to make your brain a kind

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.970
of willpower machine.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.370
One is sleep, as I mentioned, and hopefully
there's gonna be one thing on this list that

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.570
you're not currently doing that you're willing
to do cause you don't have to do all four.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:52.370
So getting a little bit more sleep makes the
prefrontal cortex better able to regulate

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.680
those systems of the brain the direct you
towards temptation and immediate gratification.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.949
And meditation also, and both meditation and
physical exercise have been shown to make

00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:07.140
not only your brain more efficient at using
these self control systems but they actually

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.780
make these systems bigger and better connected
to the regions that they are supposed to be

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.780
controlling.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:18.089
And, again, it can be a very quick time course
to see these benefits.

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:22.699
People who meditate maybe 10 minutes a day,
after a couple months their brains look different,

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:25.779
these regions are bigger and better connected.

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:29.801
People who work out on a regular basis who
used to be sedentary, again, studies show

00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:33.980
that in as little as a couple of months of
regular workouts, their prefrontal cortices

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.579
are bigger and denser and better connected.

00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:43.210
So these are two things that you can do that
actually train the physiology of your willpower.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:48.709
The last thing that the research suggests
is what you eat has a very big influence on

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:53.199
whether or not your brain is able to be this
better version of yourself.

00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:58.740
There's something about having big, big spikes
in blood sugar levels and then big drops in

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:05.130
blood sugar levels that really screws up how
the brain uses energy and you need your brain

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.620
to be like an energy efficient machine if
you're gonna be walking around the world in

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.110
that kind of better-you mindset rather than
that basic-impulse-you.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:19.780
So, research shows that shifting to eating
a more plant based diet actually changes the

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.519
way the brain functions and has a lot to do
with what's going on with your blood sugar

00:13:23.519 --> 00:13:24.519
levels.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:28.380
So these are things that we sometimes think
of as requiring willpower, right?

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.290
We think, "Okay, I have to sit down and force
myself meditate.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.139
I have to work out.

00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:38.800
I have to say no to the donut and eat something
that has fiber in it for breakfast."

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.769
But we rarely think about the fact that actually
not doing these things may be part of what

00:13:44.769 --> 00:13:50.060
makes it so difficult to begin and there's
kind of a curve where when we first start

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.990
it feels like we're using willpower but everything
on this list that takes a little bit of willpower

00:13:53.990 --> 00:14:00.029
to begin with ends up giving you back far
more willpower than they take and not just

00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:01.029
for these challenges.

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:05.620
It's not just that exercising makes it easier
to exercise, studies show that exercising

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.329
makes it easier to eat right, to not spend
too much money, to stop procrastinating, to

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:14.670
pay better attention, all of these things
have a kind of global training effect on what

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.940
you could think of as your willpower muscle.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.160
Was there a question up front or a comment?

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.779
[Skips question]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: So the question was why

00:14:19.779 --> 00:14:22.829
does it say low glycemic and plant based?

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:28.600
There's actually more evidence that a vegan
diet does this better than a diet that is

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.110
low glycemic and includes animal products
but I'm not sure that that's entirely realistic

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:39.050
for everyone, so I think you can kind of pick
which way you're willing to go with that.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.470
Both low glycemic and plant based help.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.310
But if you look at just the physiology of
it, there's more evidence for the plant based

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:47.890
diet.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.250
Okay, so let me go on to the next experiment.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.040
So the first experiment was just get some
more sleep.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.759
The second experiment, I want you to think
about a recent set back you had or kind of

00:14:57.759 --> 00:14:59.930
a will power failure.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.100
Maybe it was not eating the healthy thing
at lunch, maybe it was not doing your exercise

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.949
in the morning, maybe it was spending all
morning long following links that had nothing

00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:09.490
to do with your project.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:14.200
So I want you to think of a recent time when
you had some kind of willpower failure.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.370
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Does anyone need to borrow

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.370
one of mine?

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.860
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: You guys got one?

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.810
Okay, so my question for you is do you think
that feeling bad about that, presumably feeling

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:32.510
maybe a little bit of regret, a little bit
of guilt about it, a little bit of self criticism

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.379
about that, does that help us improve next
time?

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:39.480
Does that, can that be a real source of future
willpower?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.019
Raise your hand if you think that feeling
bad can actually be a real source of willpower

00:15:45.019 --> 00:15:46.800
to improve the next time.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.579
Hands up.

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:52.440
And how many of you think that that feeling
bad is actually going to be a further drain

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.870
on willpower?

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.399
Yeah, great.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:58.519
Maybe some of you have read that chapter in
the book.

00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:02.060
So I wanna talk now about some of the research
that tends to surprise people the most.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.920
When I first started teaching this class,
this was the research people argued with,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.870
like literally couldn't get them to be quiet
in the classroom because they were so convinced

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.230
this couldn't possibly be true.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:16.449
This is a study looking at whether it's better
to let yourself off the hook for your mistakes

00:16:16.449 --> 00:16:19.630
in terms of preventing future willpower collapses.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.470
So this particular study, that I'm gonna talk
about in a little more detail, brought in

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:28.080
people who were trying to manage their weight
and eat healthy.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.310
And they gave them an immediate willpower
failure.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.889
They showed up for the study and they were
forced to eat a donut.

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:38.689
And they even had to choose the flavor of
donut they were gonna eat so they would feel

00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:40.709
complicit in this willpower failure.

00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:44.980
And they had to drink a whole glass of water
too so they'd feel a little bit uncomfortably

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.980
full.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.959
Okay, so we have everyone, dieters here having,
now, a willpower failure, they just ate this

00:16:49.959 --> 00:16:55.629
donut and the next part of the study is a
taste test where they are given a lot of different

00:16:55.629 --> 00:17:01.700
types of candy and they're said, "You know,
we want you to evaluate all these candies

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.760
so please just eat as much as you need to,
as much as you want so that you can evaluate

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:06.940
these candies."

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.780
And, of course, these candies were all pre
weighed so that experimenters could find out

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:17.260
exactly how much candy the dieters ate after
they had blown their diet with a donut.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.760
And in this particular study the researchers
had a hypothesis.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:28.380
They thought that the guilt that dieters experience
when they fall off their diet actually really

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:30.350
undermines future self control.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.450
So they wanted to create an intervention that
would basically get rid of the guilt and shame

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.950
that people feel when they make a mistake.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:42.780
So in this study, half the dieters were randomly
assigned to receive a special "letting themselves

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.240
off the hook" message.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.300
So between the donut eating and the taste
test, an experimenter came in and said something

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:55.300
very simple, they said, "By the way we've
realized now that some people in this experiment

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.300
feel guilty after eating the donut."

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:02.690
So there was an opportunity for people to
recognize they might be feeling guilty.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:07.780
Second part of the message, "We want you to
remember that actually everyone indulges sometimes

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.200
and we asked you to do it."

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.320
So there's a kind of putting it in a broader
perspective and the last part of the message

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.940
was a simple plea, "Please don't be too hard
on yourself about it."

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.520
Okay, so very simple.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.660
You might be feeling guilty, remember everyone
does it, don't be hard on yourself about it

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.900
and then they went on to the taste test.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:31.360
And what the researchers found is that the
women that had been given the self forgiveness

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.820
message ate less than half as much candy as
women who had not been told, "Don't worry

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.820
about it.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.670
It's not a big deal" which is exactly the
opposite of what most people think, most people

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.470
think you make a mistake, you have a willpower
failure and you start saying nice things to

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.410
yourself about it that this could only lead
to disaster.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:54.940
It would lead to licensing even more indulgence
and yet, that's exactly the opposite of what

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:00.370
was found in this study and not just this
study but in a lot of different studies now.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:05.220
This is one of the, sort of, strongest pieces
of theory we have in willpower research right

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.590
now.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.980
That is, the harder you are on yourself when
you have a willpower failure, the more likely

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:15.920
you are to have the same failure again and
the bigger it's gonna be when you do.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:21.980
For example, one study took a look at problem
drinkers and had them keep track of how much

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.580
they were drinking and how bad they felt the
morning after.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.880
What they found is the people who were the
most self critical and felt the most ashamed

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.610
or guilty about drinking the night before
wanted to drink more immediately when they

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:38.930
woke up and also drank more that night and
the next.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.660
There was something about the self critical
nature and the shame and the guilt that was

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.420
driving people back to the very thing they
felt bad about.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.550
The same has been shown for addiction including
quitting smoking, you know, you have that

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:55.000
first relapse and the more you beat yourself
up about it the more you now need to be comforted

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.570
with something, probably the very thing that
you're feeling bad about because that's probably

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.230
why you do it in the first place.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:06.160
The same has been shown for gambling, the
more people feel guilty and self critical

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.250
about losing money, they more likely they
are to borrow money and try to win it back

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.200
and end up losing more.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:17.610
And even for procrastination, you may not
have any kind of addictions but even for procrastination,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.460
researchers show that the harder someone is
on putting, the harder someone is for putting

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.280
something off, the longer they procrastinate
the next time.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.910
And all this has to do with the basic fact
that when we are feeling stressed out and

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:36.650
guilty and ashamed, that is a state that puts
us into the version of ourselves, the mindset

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:41.550
that is much more susceptible to immediate
gratification, temptation and anxiety.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.280
It's basically the biological opposite of
what needs to be happening in your brain and

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:51.340
body to remember your long term goals and
to be that other version of yourself.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.390
What we would call the willpower version of
yourself.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.920
And as soon as you start piling on the guilt
and the shame, your brain switches into that

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.600
other mode in which now everything's gonna
be more tempting including procrastinating

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.340
or including smoking or drinking.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:10.420
So I just wanted to give you a sense of what
it would be like to give yourself a self compassion

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.420
message.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.060
Again, I said, this was a tiny intervention,
this donut study.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.380
And this is basically all it was.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.140
And there are a number of programs now that
are teaching people how to write these messages

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:26.621
for themselves and literally have them scripted
for the moment they fail, for the moment that

00:21:26.621 --> 00:21:30.570
they procrastinated and they're late again,
for that moment when they had that cigarette

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:36.380
when they hadn't smoked in a week and to be
able to whip this message out as a way of

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.180
not falling down that hole that we often fall
into.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.660
So the three steps of this message are the
first is mindfulness of what you're thinking

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.170
and feeling.

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:50.830
Noticing that you're feeling guilty or noticing
that you're feeling self doubt or self critical,

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:56.010
maybe angry at yourself and to actually allow
yourself to see those feelings because a big

00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:00.411
reason that people go from feeling guilty
to giving in again is they just want to get

00:22:00.411 --> 00:22:04.760
rid of that feeling, it's so kind of overwhelming
and they want to distract themselves from

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.770
it with something that is gonna get them into
further trouble.

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.800
And then the second step is this common humanity.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.870
One of the reasons that it is hard to find
our motivation and our willpower is we start

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:20.830
to feel there's something uniquely broken
with us.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:26.330
There's something about who we are that is
wrong and weak and that mindset makes it very

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.180
difficult to tap back into your motivation
or your strength.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.130
So this message of common humanity is basically
saying to yourself, "You know what?

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:39.630
This is part of the process of change, this
is how things get done.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.270
Sometimes we procrastinate.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.180
Sometimes we fall off the wagon.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.480
Everyone is imperfect."

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.750
And to recognize that this is not saying anything
about who you are, it's saying something about

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:53.450
the process and what matters is how you respond
afterward, not the fact that it happened at

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.450
all.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.520
And then this last step is encouragement over
criticism.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.490
And if you were to think about someone you
were mentoring, you know, some of you probably

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:06.280
have mentees here or interns or you think
about a child that you care about or a dear

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.570
friend, what would you say to them when they
had a set back?

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:15.100
And to say that to yourself, it might be reminding
yourself of your goal, it might be reminding

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.530
yourself of the big picture rather than the
sort of, the micro picture in which you feel

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.320
like a failure.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:25.470
And to do that rather than the voices we often
have in our head that are saying things like,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.890
"Why did you do that again?

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.890
You're so stupid.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.700
You're never going to change."

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.910
And to actually start to talk to yourself
a little bit in the second person as if you

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.120
were a good friend.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.190
And research shows that this particular approach,
learning how to talk to yourself in this way

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:44.530
is more effective, for example, at quitting
smoking than nicotine replacement therapy.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:49.470
That's how powerful being able to respond
to set backs with compassion can be.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:56.610
I want you to take a look at these circles
which go from being totally non overlapping

00:23:56.610 --> 00:24:01.830
to extremely overlapping and you're gonna
decide which of these sets of circles best

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:08.670
represent how you feel about who you are today
and who you're gonna be, let's say, 30 years

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.460
from now, 30 years in the future, or pick
a time period that feels right to you.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.670
Okay, so this is your current self and this
if your future self 30 years from now.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:22.700
This means who you are today is really very
different than who you're gonna be 30 years

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.360
from now.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.320
Some overlap but actually a lot of change
is gonna be happening between now, who knows,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.140
then this last set of circles this is like,
you know what, who I am today is probably

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.870
who I'm gonna be in 30 years, same me.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.650
Okay, so you're gonna pick for yourself.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.740
Take another few seconds and think where you
are on this graph.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:46.740
Actually, let's do a kind of rolling wave
cause I'm actually curious if there's a trend

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.870
here at Google.

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.260
Just put your hand up when you see your circle
highlighted.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.410
Who's over here?

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.820
Who's over here?

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.020
Over here?

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.820
Okay, over here?

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:00.310
Oh you guys are normally distributed, this
is great, who's over here?

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.280
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Who's over here?

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.280
And who's over here?

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.910
Yeah, pretty good, pretty good.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:06.020
That was great.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:12.750
Okay, so it turns out where you put yourself
on this map has a lot to do with some very

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:17.590
important willpower challenges related to
health and money and even moral behavior.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.770
Don't feel too bad if you're at an extreme
tail that is not associated with willpower

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:26.360
cause I'm gonna show you some strategies for
being able to get to the end that is associated

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.370
with willpower if you need it.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:33.710
Okay, so let me start with the first intervention
and this was an intervention that was done

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.840
here at Stanford University and this was using
undergraduate students who are very young

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:44.580
and it was a virtual reality experiment where
undergraduate students came into the laboratory

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:52.230
and the researchers had carefully created
3D avatars of the student themselves.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:58.340
So if I came into the laboratory I would be
meeting a 3D avatar of myself at retirement

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.340
age.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:04.360
It was a really great set up in which you
got all their virtual reality equipment on,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.950
hearing and seeing, and it feels like you
are sitting across the table from your future

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:15.130
self and it's set up with cameras in such
a way that if I move my left hand like this

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:20.770
it looks like my future self is also moving
their hand and if I talk it looks like my

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.750
future self is talking back.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:27.000
And in the study the college students were
invited to interview their future selves,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.800
to say things like, "Hey future Kelly, what's
going on right now?

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.280
What's really important in your life right
now?"

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.570
And then they had to answer the question.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.670
So they would see their, I would see future
Kelly describing what's important in my life

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:43.030
at retirement age.

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.470
And this went on for about an hour, getting
to know their future selves.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:51.530
And the reason the researchers decided to
do this intervention is because they discovered

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.690
that most of us feel like our future self
is a stranger.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.750
And all of you who are on that first half
of the distribution, sort of you're thinking

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:04.070
about your future self and you don't really
know who that is, they could be really an

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.360
improvement on this model or it could just
be an older version of this model, we don't

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.360
know.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.400
But what researchers found is that the more
you feel like your future self is a stranger,

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.730
is different than you, the less likely you
are to do things to protect that future selves

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.570
health and happiness.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:25.090
Because why would you bother saving money
for some stranger when you could spend it

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.970
today on someone you know and love?

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: So in this particular experiment

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:36.890
after they had gotten to know their future
self, there was some time elapsed cause they

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.440
didn't want it to be totally obvious what
was going on, there's some time elapsed and

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:46.430
they brought people back and had them divvy
up $1,000 in a budgeting task.

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:49.800
And they pretended like they were interested
in how people made budgeting decisions.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.970
But what they found is that the college students
who had met and interacted with their future

00:27:53.970 --> 00:28:02.100
self ended up allotting more than twice as
much money into a retirement account than

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.480
college students who had not met their future
self.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.400
College students who had not met their future
selves were more likely to want allot that

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.790
money to their present expenses or just to
some fun splurge.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:18.080
And this research has actually had a lot of
impact in the world of retirement savings

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.130
and banking.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:23.400
I just heard in an economist recommend last
week that we should be trying to Photoshop

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.000
pictures of people's future selves on every
mortgage application or credit card application

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.960
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: So people would really

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.250
have to think about the implications of this.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:38.461
I mean, you can imagine an HR setting, right,
where people are a new employee and they're

00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:42.080
asked to make their retirement allocations,
well, what if they had to interact with their

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.190
future self first?

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:46.630
New college students coming in to a first
job, might make a very big difference in their

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.300
retirement savings down the line.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.541
Okay, so that was just one, that was the intervention,
that was the experiment but I just wanna point

00:28:52.541 --> 00:28:57.720
more broadly to some of the research, looking
at that circle graph that I showed you, and

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:02.660
it turns out that people who believe that
there is more overlap, that they are more

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:08.560
closely related to their future self have
a lot more willpower for different types of

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:09.560
willpower challenges.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.560
Oops!

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.560
I didn't mean to do that.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.350
The first thing is they're less likely to
procrastinate in general and less likely to

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.350
be late.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.960
One of my favorite findings from this research
is that people who had, who felt like they

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:25.050
were less similar to their future self were
also more likely to show up late for the experiment

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.370
or skip it completely, to just blow it off.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.500
That was a kind of interesting finding.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.910
They also are more comfortable, I'm sorry,
are more likely to make ethical decisions

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:36.910
at work.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:42.090
So people who think their future self is more
different, like a total stranger, they're

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:46.870
actually more likely to feel good about betraying
a colleague at work if it helps them advance

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:48.030
in their career.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.280
They're more likely to keep money that they
found even when they might have an inkling

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:57.880
who that money belongs to and that's kind
of an interesting finding cause we could understand

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:04.350
retirement, you know, future self, but it
seems like this ability to disconnect from

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:09.210
the long term consequences of your choices
actually primes you to be that more impulsive

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:13.910
self even when it doesn't really have anything
to do with your own long term benefits.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:19.410
Then also, looking at real world outcomes
not just an experiment, but you look at what

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:24.250
circle people choose and how much money they
have, their assets, their home, their debt,

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:30.700
their wealth and people who feel closer to
their future self actually have more assets,

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.750
are more likely to own their home outright,
more money in the bank, more retirement savings.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.960
So this is a real world finding not just an
experiment.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.150
And they're also more likely to do things
that don't have a payoff immediately, like

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:47.440
flossing and exercising but that would be
good to protect their future self.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.940
So with that in mind, one of my favorite willpower
boosting strategies that you can do that doesn't

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:58.210
really take any willpower at all, is to get
to know your future self.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:03.480
And there are, you, you, actually here maybe
you can do 3D avatars, is that something,

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.850
is that a Google project somewhere?

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:05.850
[Laughter]

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:06.850
&gt;&gt;audience member: We can't tell you.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.150
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Can't tell you.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.030
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: So most people can't actually

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.200
interact with their future self in that high
tech a way but it seems like there are other

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.770
ways that work as well.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:20.220
One is to write a letter from your future
self to your present self and you can do this

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.710
in a number of different ways.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:26.830
One way is just write to your present self
about who you are, what you're doing, where

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.540
you're living, what you care about.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:33.710
Or you could write a more closely defined
letter that looks at some challenge you're

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:34.910
dealing with now.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:40.171
Maybe you're struggling to quit some addiction
or spend time with your family or just something

00:31:40.171 --> 00:31:43.820
that is seems like it's just not working the
way you would like it to.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.410
And you could write a letter from your future
self thanking your present self for doing

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:52.390
it and describing what it was you did and
why it mattered.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.990
And research suggests that this kind of letter
writing from your future self can actually

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.990
give yourself more willpower.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.990
Yes?

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:02.280
&gt;&gt;male audience member: Does this boomerang
if you actually have low self esteem now telling

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.280
yourself you're gonna be more like you are
now in the future?

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.250
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: That is probably not the
letter you should write

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.130
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: So just for the people

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:16.270
who are watching this on the video the question
was, if you feel really bad about yourself

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.430
now could this have the opposite effect where
you think, "Oh my God, I'm never gonna change"

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.620
and if you're a loser now you're always gonna
be a loser so the letter might be like, "Dear

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.020
loser, I'm still a loser.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.020
You're still a loser.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.020
Life sucks."

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.330
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: That is not the letter.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.740
Actually, so research suggests it is better
to be optimistic in this letter than to be

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:34.740
pessimistic.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:41.950
But at the same time, so the key thing about
this finding is not so much whether you think

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:48.330
you're going to be exactly the same, but whether
you understand that it's going to be the same

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.730
person having the future experience.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:55.170
And that, which actually comes to the second
point here, so that's actually a different

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.170
thing.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:00.840
It's not like, are you still going to have
all the same problems and all of the same

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.310
neuroses or have you fixed them?

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:08.860
It's not that kind of same self different
self it's do you understand that, like you

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.400
know how real pain is right now if I were
to come and punch you, how much that would

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:13.400
hurt?

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.890
Do you understand that 30 years from now it's
gonna hurt if someone punches you?

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.730
That seems to be the thing that people actually
have problems with.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.520
When they think about their future selves
they don't have access to those emotions,

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:30.470
they don't understand that that future happiness
is going to be as real and as important.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.361
So when you're doing this kind of letter writing
or doing this future self imagination, the

00:33:34.361 --> 00:33:39.810
actual critical part is getting to feel like
that future self is real and that it is in

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:40.810
some way you.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:43.750
That you are going to be the one having this
experience.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:48.220
And it's not so much whether you think you're
going to be the identical person still listening

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.000
to the same music you listened to in 1983
or not like that.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.830
Okay, so here's the second future self exercise
that gets to that.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:58.510
And I call this going back to the future.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:02.350
And this is the exercise of just imagining
yourself in the future.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.841
Studies show that just imagining yourself
grocery shopping in the future, okay, not

00:34:06.841 --> 00:34:12.089
like not anything even relevant to your goals
but just grocery shopping then ends up helping

00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:17.190
people make better decisions in the present
moment that's going to lead to pay off in

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.369
the future because you can actually imagine
it.

00:34:20.369 --> 00:34:23.730
You can imagine what would be on the shelf
and you know what it feels like to be pushing

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:27.859
a shopping cart and there's something about
making the future real that gives us more

00:34:27.859 --> 00:34:31.210
willpower kind of independent of the content,
what you're thinking about.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:35.362
But there's also studies showing that you
can imagine specific futures related to your

00:34:35.362 --> 00:34:40.639
willpower challenge and both good sort of
future realities and negative future realities

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:41.690
can be very motivating.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:46.919
So in one study they had people who wanted
to improve their health, to imagine the consequences

00:34:46.919 --> 00:34:50.829
of not making a change, like really vividly,
what's that gonna be like?

00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:54.649
What's it gonna feel like ten years from now
if you don't make this change?

00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:58.390
And they had another group thinking about
the positive consequences of making the change

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.880
and what would that be like and how are you
gonna feel?

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:06.849
And both of those sort of future thinking,
ended up increasing the good health behavior

00:35:06.849 --> 00:35:07.849
in the present.

00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:10.960
So you guys have seen Back to the Future two,
right?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.610
You guys have seen Back to the Future two?

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:15.970
You know he goes into the future and there's
like a really bad future and a really good

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:20.599
future, okay, at some point that reference
is not going to work anymore.

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:24.539
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Okay, here's, so we got

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:27.980
two more interventions and this next intervention
I just wanna take a poll.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:33.200
So we're talking about visualizing things,
if you had to guess which would be more helpful

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.250
for finding your willpower, do you think it's
more helpful to imagine or visualize yourself

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.839
failing or is it more helpful to visualize
and imagine yourself succeeding?

00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:47.859
Raise your hand if you think imaging failure
is gonna be more helpful.

00:35:47.859 --> 00:35:50.450
Raise your hand if you think imagine success.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:51.819
You guys are such typical Americans.

00:35:51.819 --> 00:35:54.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Okay, that's what everyone

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480
thinks.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.710
So, actually it turns out imagining failure
is way more helpful than imagining success.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:04.890
Not that imagining success is always bad but
imagining failure is better.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:09.020
So let me tell you about this one intervention
and then some of the theory a little bit more

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.020
broadly.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.930
In this particular study they took women from
young adult to middle age, a little bit older

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:21.180
adult all of whom were not exercising at all
and all of whom had the goal to exercise and

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:26.470
some of those women were randomly assigned
to your typical it's good to exercise, here's

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:32.700
why you should exercise, now think about your
goal and imagine yourself doing it, very typical.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.690
And the other half were randomly assigned
to what they called an obstacle condition

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.710
where they had to imagine themselves failing.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:46.160
They had to ask themselves, "When are you
gonna not exercise?

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.520
What is the obstacle going to be?

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.340
When is it gonna happen?

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.880
What are you gonna do if that happens?"

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:57.200
And they had people write about that every
single day.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.470
They had to write out, when are you gonna
not exercise?

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.940
What are you gonna say to yourself that allows
you not to exercise?

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.320
When's it gonna happen?

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.200
How's it gonna happen and what are you gonna
do when you start to recognize that stuff

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.200
happening?

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.299
So the women were becoming kind of detectives
of their own failure and every day they revised

00:37:14.299 --> 00:37:16.230
what they were writing based on what they
noticed.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:20.160
"I didn't exercise cause I told myself I'll
do it later, I'll do it later, I'll do it

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.369
later, now it's time to go to sleep."

00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:25.960
Or, "I didn't do it because I go so busy at
work then I didn't have my sneakers so I didn't

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.960
do it."

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.160
And they became very clear about how they
fail and they were able to predict future

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.740
failures from that.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:38.020
Here's what the results were, it had an immediate
effect of doubling the amount of time they

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.020
were exercising.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:43.599
So the very first week they started to predict
their failures in this way, they doubled to

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:49.089
102 minutes of exercise a week and that's
getting pretty close to the amount of exercise

00:37:49.089 --> 00:37:53.420
that you need to have very serious health
benefits, both mental health and physical

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.420
health.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.839
There was a much smaller improvement here
in the group of women who were given the standard,

00:37:59.839 --> 00:38:01.460
"You wanna exercise.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.840
Exercise is great, let's do it!"

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:09.089
And 16 weeks, so 4 months after that study,
the women who had been predicting their failure

00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:14.400
had maintained and were exercising twice as
much as the women who were in the basic 'let's

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.390
exercise, here's why it's good'.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.890
This is the thing that always blows people's
minds.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:24.980
There is a lot of studies that show tracking
your success leads people to slack off in

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.529
the long run but nobody believes it.

00:38:28.529 --> 00:38:32.369
So you probably heard how important it is
to keep track of your success because we feel

00:38:32.369 --> 00:38:35.819
really good when we're able to write down
that we did something, right?

00:38:35.819 --> 00:38:37.579
You know you feel something really good and
you're like, "Yes!

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:38.579
Check it off!"

00:38:38.579 --> 00:38:39.579
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Some people make to do

00:38:39.579 --> 00:38:42.000
lists just so they can check stuff off.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.010
And we know how good we feel when we're able
to write down and record our successes and

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.140
we mistake that feeling good as motivation
to do more.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:54.900
But a number of studies show that when people
are reminded of their success and take note

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.759
of their progress they are much more likely
to then do something inconsistent with their

00:38:58.759 --> 00:38:59.759
goal.

00:38:59.759 --> 00:39:03.609
So if you are somebody, for example, there's
studies of dieters where people come in and

00:39:03.609 --> 00:39:08.259
the experimenter says, "By the way, we wanted
to let you know how much progress you've made

00:39:08.259 --> 00:39:09.460
on losing weight.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.880
You're this close to your goal, you've been
doing great."

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.010
And on the way out of the lab, "Would you
like a chocolate bar?"

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.130
And women are much more likely to take the
chocolate bar if they were reminded of their

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.130
success.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.420
The same studies been shown for procrastination.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.920
You have people that keep track and feel good
about their progress that they've made on

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.670
a task and they're much more likely to choose
not to work on it.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:33.760
And this is the goal switching hypothesis.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.440
The idea is that any willpower challenge is
a competition between these two versions of

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.920
yourself and they're both you.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:45.760
And as soon as your mind realizes that one
of you is satisfied because you made some

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.960
progress, the other goal becomes primed in
your brain and it becomes more appealing.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.200
So I don't wanna say don't keep track of your
success cause I think, what I really wanna

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.369
encourage you to do is both.

00:39:58.369 --> 00:40:04.470
But let me just, let me point to a couple
other ideas along this line.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:10.730
Okay, so about why pessimism can be so helpful
because it's profoundly un-American to be

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:15.390
pessimistic when you have a goal and I just
wanna encourage you to think about using pessimism

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.829
as actually a source of willpower.

00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:22.349
So there's this kind of finding floating around
that people who are most optimistic about

00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:27.690
their ability to make a difficult change,
give up sooner and are most likely to fail

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.980
and it tends to be because they are shocked
by their setbacks.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.839
So one of the ways that predicting failure
can be helpful is that when it happens it's

00:40:35.839 --> 00:40:40.599
not like some shock to your system where you
can't believe it happened, it must say something

00:40:40.599 --> 00:40:44.950
bad about who you are or about your likelihood
of success in the future.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:50.299
There's also interesting studies, as I mentioned
that optimism, well this is both progress

00:40:50.299 --> 00:40:54.280
and optimism, but studies show that if you
have people making optimistic predictions

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.319
about what they're going to do, they're more
likely to then not do it today.

00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:03.309
So people who intend to exercise tomorrow
are more likely to eat something unhealthy

00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:05.280
today and skip the gym.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.030
Even just having people think about what they're
gonna do in their future makes people more

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.339
likely to make a different choice today.

00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:16.839
So just knowing that you're gonna be just
as tempted tomorrow, you're gonna be just

00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:22.480
as busy tomorrow, just as stressed out tomorrow
turns out to be an important source of willpower

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.480
today.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.420
Okay, then this, I just had to throw this
in cause I think this is one of the funniest

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.220
findings in the willpower research.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:35.330
That 75 percent of corporations that are investigated
by the SEC for fraud can be tracked by to

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.710
initial optimism that then people were unwilling
to let go of.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:44.299
They were so optimistic about profit, their
profit projections, that when they met their

00:41:44.299 --> 00:41:49.339
first setback they didn't know what to do
and they started to fudge the numbers.

00:41:49.339 --> 00:41:54.730
And this is something that we all do with
our own goals when we set very high ideals

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:58.900
and then refuse to adjust our expectations
based on reality.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.119
This is something I run into a lot at Stanford,
people say they wanna make big change or they

00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:08.700
have a big goal in mind and they aren't the
least bit interested in setting a small goal

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.980
or a baby step cause how is that gonna ever
get me where I want?

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.830
So let's go big or go home.

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:19.079
And then when they start to run into problems
with that huge level of success, they kind

00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:22.460
of hang on to the ideal and yet end up doing
nothing.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:28.430
So you can think of yourself as your own little
corporation with goals and if you find yourself

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:33.940
hitting setbacks one of the most important
things you can do is adjust your expectations

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:39.130
and take a really serious look at the process
of how failures working.

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:44.690
So here is, um, here is an example form that
exercise study that's a little broadened out

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:49.130
and this is basically the writing exercise
those women were doing that doubled the amount

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.560
of time they were putting into their goal.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.250
And they were supposed to do this writing
exercise every day.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:59.680
The first is to identify your goal and what
would be a really positive outcome of that?

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.910
So you gotta get your motivation on board,
right?

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.880
Then what are you gonna do to take it?

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.589
So you set some clearly defined steps and
then you spend some time thinking about how

00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:11.560
is this not going to happen.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:14.309
When and where and why?

00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:17.779
Is there anything you can do in advance to
prevent that failure?

00:43:17.779 --> 00:43:21.200
And when failure happens, what are you gonna
do about it?

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.710
You don't actually have to make it 7 full
steps like this but it's a very basic exercise

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:26.960
that you can do for any goal.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.660
I think of it as being like stress testing
a goal.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.090
You have a goal, you say you're gonna do something,
well now put it to the test and find out how

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:36.809
it's gonna break, how it's gonna fail.

00:43:36.809 --> 00:43:39.549
Okay, last intervention.

00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:44.640
Let's all do it together unless you have health
problems and, you know, I don't want anyone

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.980
to pass out or have a stroke.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:53.339
So if you are willing to take this challenge
we're just gonna hold our breath for 15 seconds.

00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:54.780
Whose got a second hand?

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:55.780
Great!

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.180
You're gonna time us.

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.819
Okay, only if you wanna do this.

00:43:59.819 --> 00:44:01.180
Take a deep breath in.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:06.039
Look at your second hand, go ahead and take
a deep breath out, now exhale, exhale, exhale

00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:09.020
it out, stop breathing.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.670
Time us.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:15.329
Remember you can breathe anytime you want
to if you need to.

00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:18.069
I just want you to notice how this feels.

00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:23.059
3, 2, 1 breathe.

00:44:23.059 --> 00:44:29.470
Good, okay, so holding your breath obviously
that's a little bit of a willpower challenge.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.819
Some of you maybe need to hold your breath
for two minutes to feel it but I did not want

00:44:32.819 --> 00:44:34.999
anyone passing out.

00:44:34.999 --> 00:44:40.410
So would you believe that this ability to
hold your breath is one of the best predictors

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.260
of people's ability to succeed at difficult
goals?

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.799
It's kind of interesting.

00:44:45.799 --> 00:44:48.640
Psychologists call this distress tolerance.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:53.380
The ability to stay put when things get uncomfortable.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:59.830
So I wanna tell you now about a small intervention
that teaches people how to sort of hold their

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:05.530
breath but not exactly, how to basically ride
out physical discomfort that gets in the way

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:07.400
of making a difficult change.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.329
I'm gonna tell you about two different studies
that are basically using the same technique.

00:45:10.329 --> 00:45:13.900
So you can kind of pick your willpower challenge
here.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.819
The first I call the torture chamber and this
is the study of smokers that wanted to quit

00:45:18.819 --> 00:45:19.930
but had been unable to.

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:25.599
And the researches asked the smokers to abstain
from smoking for 24 hours, sort of a first

00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:30.730
challenge and then to come into the laboratory
with a fresh unopened pack of their favorite

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:31.920
brand of cigarettes.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.359
So all the smokers show up, they've got their
pack, they are desperate for a smoke, and

00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:40.579
they even like carbon monoxide tested them
to make sure they hadn't smoked, so they had

00:45:40.579 --> 00:45:42.960
all, they were ready for a cigarette.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:49.390
They all get, they seated at a long table
and asked to put away all distractions except

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.960
for a lighter or a match and their cigarettes.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.220
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: So you've got a bunch of

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.990
smokers now they're ready.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:46:00.380
And then the experimenter is about to begin
the process of allowing them to smoke and

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:04.579
she says, actually through a microphone like
that, you hear this voice that says, "Take

00:46:04.579 --> 00:46:09.190
out your pack of cigarettes" And everyone
does, they're all excited, "Woo hoo!"

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:10.190
"Stop!"

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.190
Okay
[Laughter]

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:13.359
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: They have to wait 2 minutes
now and they're not allowed to do anything

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:15.359
except look at their pack of cigarettes.

00:46:15.359 --> 00:46:18.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: "Pull off the cellophane!"

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.400
"Okay, great, whew!"

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400
"Stop!"

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400
Two minutes they have to wait.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.619
"Pack it" Oh, there was pack, I don't smoke
so I forget some of these steps, they had

00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:30.940
to pack the pack, too and they got the cellophane
open, okay.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.999
"Take out a cigarette" "Finally!"

00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:33.999
"Stop!"

00:46:33.999 --> 00:46:38.230
They have to wait 2 minutes and this goes
on and every two minutes they're writing down

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:42.059
how intense their cravings are and how much
they want to smoke but other than that they're

00:46:42.059 --> 00:46:43.059
not allowed to do anything.

00:46:43.059 --> 00:46:44.829
"Take a cigarette out" "Stop!"

00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:45.829
Two minutes.

00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:47.049
"Look at the cigarette" "Stop!"

00:46:47.049 --> 00:46:48.049
Two minutes.

00:46:48.049 --> 00:46:49.049
"Smell the cigarette."

00:46:49.049 --> 00:46:50.049
"Stop!"

00:46:50.049 --> 00:46:51.049
Two minutes.

00:46:51.049 --> 00:46:52.109
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: "Put the cigarette in your

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:53.119
mouth" "Stop!"

00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:54.119
Two minutes.

00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:55.630
"Take out a lighter, look at it."

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:56.630
"Stop!"

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:57.630
Two minutes.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.630
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: This went on for over an

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:59.630
hour.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.390
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: Nobody was actually allowed

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.609
to light the cigarette, okay.

00:47:04.609 --> 00:47:08.059
So here's what, I didn't tell you what the
actual intervention was yet, half of them

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:12.490
before this happened had been taught a technique
called surfing the urge in which you learn

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:18.079
to pay attention to the physical discomfort
of wanting something, you give it your full

00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:24.999
attention and you trust that you can tolerate
those physical sensations and if you just

00:47:24.999 --> 00:47:28.069
wait with patience they will go away.

00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:35.430
That any craving, any emotion will eventually
pass if you can just breathe and wait, wait

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.430
it out.

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:39.410
But you don't have to act on every impulse
or emotion.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:42.559
So that's the technique they were taught,
they were surfing the urge, they were imagining

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:46.951
those cravings as a wave that they were getting
on and they were just gonna breathe and they

00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:52.109
knew that would eventually end just like a
wave.

00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:54.620
Before I tell you the result of this study,
let me just give you the food one.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.400
The food one's a little bit different.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.730
They took people who have had problems with
self control around food, especially sweets,

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:06.650
gave them a clear container of Hershey's Kisses,
a transparent container and they had to carry

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:11.510
that box of Hershey's Kisses around with them
for 48 hours and were not allowed to eat a

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:16.119
single one and they were all carefully marked,
little pin scratch so the researchers would

00:48:16.119 --> 00:48:18.980
know if they ate them and restocked it which
would not be cool.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:20.589
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kelly McGonigal: And they were taught the

00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:23.150
same technique about how to handle cravings.

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:27.980
How to surf the urge, allow yourself to feel
the craving and yet remember you don't need

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.190
to act on it and the craving will go away
eventually.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:32.509
Okay, so the results.

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:38.200
In this study, the smokers who'd been taught
how to surf the urge in that one hour torture

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:44.339
test, they ended up reducing their cigarette
smoke by 40 percent in the very next week

00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:46.890
even though the researchers had not asked
them to.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:53.269
The control group did not reduce their cigarettes
at all and interestingly in the people would

00:48:53.269 --> 00:48:58.599
learn to surf the urge, there was now no longer
a connection between psychological stress

00:48:58.599 --> 00:49:02.900
and smoking which is actually, that's the
main connection for most people who are trying

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:06.749
to quit, they're stressed out, they're anxious
and so they need a cigarette.

00:49:06.749 --> 00:49:12.549
And in this particular group with this intervention,
it cut that link between stress and giving

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:18.230
in probably because they had a tool for dealing
with difficult feelings and emotions.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:23.070
In this study, the people who had trouble
with self control around food, if they were

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:30.880
taught to surf the urge, 0 had a single Hershey's
Kiss over the entire 48 hours whereas those

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:35.710
who'd been given other strategies including
distraction ended up much more likely to give

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:38.900
in and also really stressed out about it.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.790
So these are just two different examples about
how surfing the urge can give us a lot of

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:46.660
willpower for the things where we need willpower.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:51.230
You know, a lot of times I hear people talk
about how important it is to build good habits

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:56.519
but the reality is sometimes you need strength
to do something difficult and there's no habit

00:49:56.519 --> 00:50:00.789
in the world that's gonna make you not want
a cigarette when you see it or want a donut

00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:04.230
when you see it or maybe you wanna avoid something
cause you're anxious.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:09.059
There's a real impulse and a real feeling
that you need to deal with and this power

00:50:09.059 --> 00:50:13.759
of acceptance seems to be the best strategy
for dealing with these difficult emotions,

00:50:13.759 --> 00:50:17.289
these difficult thoughts and these difficult
cravings.

00:50:17.289 --> 00:50:21.549
And any attempt to kind of push them away
or get rid of them backfires but being able

00:50:21.549 --> 00:50:27.180
to ride them out and imagine them as passing
experiences that you don't need to act on

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.420
has been shown to help a lot of different
willpower challenges including the kind of

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:36.260
anxiety that leads us to not do things we
know we should do.

00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.970
Intrusive thoughts, you know, that's a real
willpower challenge.

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:44.549
Sometimes our mind goes places we don't want
it to go, to memories or to things we're imagining

00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:48.569
or to negative thoughts about ourselves and
others and research shows you can apply the

00:50:48.569 --> 00:50:51.970
same technique to a negative thought without
having to act on it.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:56.989
It's been shown to improve weight loss, it
actually, this technique of learning how to

00:50:56.989 --> 00:51:02.579
accept your own cravings, tripled the long
term one year weight loss success rate among

00:51:02.579 --> 00:51:06.299
people who were in a really standard weight
loss program.

00:51:06.299 --> 00:51:08.950
It helped substance abuse and it even helps
people with schizophrenia.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:14.220
I mean, talk about a willpower challenge when
you have voices in your own head that you

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:19.400
cannot escape and you're trying desperately
to have some kind of normal life and relationship

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.539
with the world when you've got these voices
in your head that are telling you to do something

00:51:23.539 --> 00:51:25.309
or not to do something.

00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:30.420
And studies show that schizophrenics who learn
to accept their own intrusive thoughts and

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:35.970
hallucinations and delusions, like a craving,
that's not real and you don't need to act

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:42.890
on it but it's gonna be there and eventually
it will pass, they actually end up being more

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:48.380
likely to be out of the hospital, be dehospitalized
and function normally compared to people who

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.579
have not been taught this technique.

00:51:51.579 --> 00:51:58.400
Okay, so if you want to apply this technique
to any willpower challenge yourself, here's

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.480
what that small intervention would look like
for yourself.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:06.810
Here's what people were taught in both of
those studies and the first is this mindfulness

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:12.239
to allow yourself to feel what you're feeling
or think what you're thinking and to actually

00:52:12.239 --> 00:52:16.390
attend to the experience rather than immediately
try to escape it.

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:19.989
So if you're hungry, actually notice like,
what does hunger feel like in my body?

00:52:19.989 --> 00:52:25.670
Or if you're anxious, what does anxiety feel
like in my body right now?

00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:30.499
And then to actually just breathe, breathe
it out, use the breath as a source of stability.

00:52:30.499 --> 00:52:35.569
You know what you're feeling, take a few breaths
and then broaden your attention out and look

00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:40.390
for the first opportunity to recommit to your
goal, that's what they were taught in both

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:45.380
the smoking study and in the Hershey's Kiss
study and it's a technique that you can practice,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:50.930
it takes like 30 seconds and it can help with
any sort of willpower challenge.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:56.910
Okay, so just to wrap up, 5 willpower rules
and I would just invite you to think if you

00:52:56.910 --> 00:53:01.619
heard anything today that might be relevant
to your willpower challenge, to give yourself

00:53:01.619 --> 00:53:07.079
this short dose, this small dose intervention
and see how it works because that's actually

00:53:07.079 --> 00:53:08.980
the nature of the class and the nature of
the book.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:14.049
It's basically to become a willpower scientist
yourself, to get some ideas from the research

00:53:14.049 --> 00:53:15.119
and then test it out.

00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:19.430
I mean, you've got a hypothesis you can see
if it works or not, collect your own data.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:24.400
So those five strategies, one is to train
your willpower physiology by meditating, by

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:29.549
sleeping, by exercising or by eating a diet
that's gonna sustain your energy.

00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:33.630
Forgive yourself the next time you have a
willpower setback.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:37.480
Make friends with your future self, kind of
think about the future in a way that feels

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.580
real.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:43.849
Predict your failure even though it's really
nice to imagine success, really get interested

00:53:43.849 --> 00:53:46.009
in the process of how you fail.

00:53:46.009 --> 00:53:51.499
And then, finally, think about surfing the
urge when you are facing temptation.

00:53:51.499 --> 00:53:55.799
And thank you, boy you guys, you waited it
out, you showed a lot of willpower sticking
