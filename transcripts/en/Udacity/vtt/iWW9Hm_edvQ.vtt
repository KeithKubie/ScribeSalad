00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.740
Because you can either win or

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.240
learn in a Design Sprint,
your next steps are going to vary.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.430
Now, it's likely that you' receive
feedback from users about how they used

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.740
the product, and what they didn't like.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.570
In this case, you'll need to reconsider
some user flows or you might need to

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.190
make some small adjustments in the user
interface, such as clarifying user

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.640
actions or making particular buttons and
links more prominent.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.310
If you received critical feedback
about the value proposition or

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.770
if users are not clear in what
they can do with the product,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.320
then you should revisit
the original idea.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.840
You might alter the original idea or

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.930
validate that the product
solves the user's problem.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.550
Entrepreneurs see these moments
as learning opportunities.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.470
So don't feel like this type
of moment is a setback.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.840
If you receive mostly positive feedback,
then you need to monitor metrics and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.810
continue to improve your product.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.895
As you get more feedback on the product,
you can add more features and

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:50.730
fine-tune the user experience.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.676
You'll see examples of this and
learn about metrics in the next lesson.
