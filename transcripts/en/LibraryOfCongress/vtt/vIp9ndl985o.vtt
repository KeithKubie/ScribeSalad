00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:19.300
[ Silence ]

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.750
&gt;&gt; Tell us what you do here
at the Library of Congress?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.920 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Ok, I'm a reference librarian, so I get to
answer questions every day, and it's from people

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.250 position:58%
who come in by person or by telephone

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.960
or over our Ask The Librarian
system and sometimes by email.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.290 position:67%
And I also teach a lot of classes on how to
use the library and do some outreach work.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.200
&gt;&gt; Well, as a digital reference
specialist here at the library,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.740 position:72%
I focus on helping our online users access and
understand the information that can be found

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.130 position:58%
on our website, including our primary
and secondary source materials.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.690 position:59%
I also staff, like Abby, the Ask A
Librarian service here at the library.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.120 position:61%
We receive over 50,000 questions a year
through Ask A Librarian, and my team,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.380
the digital reference team,
handles about a quarter of them,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.160 position:67%
so we spend a lot of time fielding
questions that come in all across the world

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.370
from people with information needs.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.760 position:58%
&gt;&gt; I also am a reference librarian,
so like Abby, my job is very similar.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.500 position:63%
Another thing that we do is acquisition.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500 position:56%
So we're also collecting books,
choosing books from around the world

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.590
in many different languages
for the collections here.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.030 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Would you say that people are
seeing items from the online collection

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.510 position:64%
and that's driving them then to ask
questions of you where maybe before they,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.620 position:59%
you never would have encountered them?

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.400
&gt;&gt; I think that's true.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.580 position:72%
I think people now are realizing that the
Library of Congress has materials and services

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.370 position:72%
that can actually address some of their needs,

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.580
so they might never have
even known we existed before,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.390
but now through the internet
they actually realize

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.660
that we're a resource that
we can take advantage of.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.700
&gt;&gt; And are you seeing both students
and teachers asking questions

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.950
of you online, the online system?

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.590
&gt;&gt; Really anybody.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.400
&gt;&gt; All kinds of people --

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.460
&gt;&gt; All kinds of people.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.020 position:59%
&gt;&gt; -- all levels, elementary school on
up through people writing their Ph.D's

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.500 position:66%
and sometimes they kind of expect us to do
all the research for their Ph.D's, but I,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.380
I think you're getting just, just,
and curious people, you know,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.880 position:70%
not pinned into any particular academic hole,
but they just want to know, know some things.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.960 position:73%
&gt;&gt; Right. And I think the other thing about the
impact of technology is that people are so used

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.220 position:64%
to Google, and they're Googling things,
but it doesn't, just because they're used

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.550
to technology doesn't mean
they're really good at searching,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.120 position:58%
and sometimes we can find things very
quickly that they've been searching

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.690
for for a long time just
because we're really good at it.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.330 position:70%
&gt;&gt; Right, and I think another thing that
we're good at doing is filtering information.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.720 position:64%
A lot of problems people have today, from
the students and other online searchers,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.810 position:72%
is the sheer explosion of information at their
fingertips and while that's good in many ways,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.030 position:70%
it's often difficult for them to parse out
what's credible information from what's junk,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.050 position:64%
and so one of the things that reference
librarians here can do is help put people

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.630 position:73%
in touch with material that is authoritative --

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.780
&gt;&gt; Peer reviewed.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.970
&gt;&gt; -- peer reviewed, scholarly,
that they can use in their research

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.940 position:59%
and for whatever needs that they have.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.810
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
