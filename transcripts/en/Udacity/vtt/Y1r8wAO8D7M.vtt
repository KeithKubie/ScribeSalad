00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.940
So that was the original
condensation paper.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.790
Like I said, it was in 98.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.270
There have been many versions subsequent
things that have to do with importance

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.804
sampling, that look at the particles and
stuff.

00:00:10.804 --> 00:00:15.076
Here's another example of
doing head tracking, 2002.

00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:18.342
And you can see,
it's still a hard white right there,

00:00:18.342 --> 00:00:20.270
tracking the head there, kay?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.370
There's an interesting
example right here.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.070
You see the head here is fully visible,
but then it goes behind the cabinet.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.040
In fact, the only part of the head
that's visible I just outlined,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.130
in fact,
only the top half is visible there.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.260
So the question is,
how did they move through occlusion?

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.440
Okay?
because part of the head is missing.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.940
Well, maybe they used velocity in
their state or maybe they didn't.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.770
What do you think?

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.170
You think they did or
you think they didn't?

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.800
Personally, I would have thought they
did because, I mean, I know all about

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.940
common filter and I know if you
track velocity it's real easy, but

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.490
then if I think about particle filters,
I say I probably didn't need

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.890
to track velocity for
the following reason.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.460
It's not the case that it has to be
a great example of a head contour.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.380
It has to be the case that the example
of the head contour that's here

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.280
is a better example than if I
put the head somewhere else.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.810
And in fact, indeed, this paper,
they track the head through the,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.860
the partial occlusion without velocity.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.510
Now, would it have worked if the head
was totally occluded behind the cabinet?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.380
No.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.930
Because then the thing would
just stay there in fact they,

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.970
they call it a velocity zero model.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.170
The particles just
stay where they are and

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.620
they just defuse out
from the uncertainty.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.334
And so if you showed up on
the other side of the cabinet,

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:54.810
you'd be out of the frame
of view altogether.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.438
Yes, Megan, I'm back, okay.

00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:02.436
Where as, if you did velocity, you would
follow me, follow me, there you go,

00:02:02.436 --> 00:02:04.240
follow, very, very good.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.540
So now you get the, you get the point.
