00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.560
Military bases and embassies, contrary to popular opinion,  don't count as American soil;

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.760
though, they're close.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.720
The country hosting the base agrees that her laws don't apply within the base, but the base is still on her land.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.040
That she owns.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.280
Because it's hers.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.720
In her country.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.780
This is called extraterritoriality, 
and it isn't unique to the United States,
but it's notable with her because of its frequency,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.800
and in one case,
(Guantanamo Bay, Cuba), contention.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.260
The short version of this story is:

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.080
Cuba used to be a U.S. territory,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.140
(taken after the Spanish-American War
 with Puerto Rico, and Guam, and Spain's pride).

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.300
Cuba eventually went her own way,
but the U.S. naval base, in Guantanamo Bay,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.760
stayed where it was and the U.S. payed to rent the land.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
But then, revoluciÃ³n, and
disagreement between Cuba and the U.S. over the rent,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.760
leading to the current awkward situation:

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.680
where the U.S. says to Cuba,
"Thank you for renting us this land!"

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.080
and Cuba says,
"We didn't rent you that land."

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.060
and the U.S. says,
"Here's our rent payment!"

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.360
and Cuba says,
"We don't accept that. Please leave?"

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.960
and the U.S. says,
"Thank you for renting us this land!"
