00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.090
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.170
Most people when they hear the word tumor
think CANCER but that’s not always the case.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.320
There are a lot of different types of tumors,
or neoplasms as they’re called by medical

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.320
professionals.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.720
The two main types, benign, which means it
stays as it is, and doesn’t change and malignant,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.750
which signals something bad, like cancer,
which means it can spread.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.390
There’s a lot of tumor terminology.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.510
Names of tumors most often come from where
they grow.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.940
Like Adenomas come from epithelial tissue,
which is a thin layer or membrane that surrounds

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.000
your organs.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.680
Fibroids grow on fibrous or connective tissue.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.500
Fibroma durum (hard fibroma) is a common type,
they’re those skin tags you get on your

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.980
neck or armpit.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.550
Hemangiomas are more like those strawberry
birthmarks, they are just a collection of

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.239
too many blood cells in one place.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.760
These are often temporary and last just a
few years in childhood.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520
Those are just the benign tumors.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.629
Carcinomas are cancerous tumors found in epithelial
cells.

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.989
Sarcomas start off in connective tissue, such
as cartilage and bones.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.039
Leukemia originates in the marrow and generally
mature in the blood or lymph nodes and Blastomas

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.390
form from embryonic tissue.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.610
While they all go by different names, many
tumors come from an overgrowth of tissues,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.259
maybe caused by a mistake in DNA.

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.920
DNA might be damaged from radiation, tobacco
smoke or other environmental agents, or maybe

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.520
it’s just a stroke of luck.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.700
Whatever causes it, this mutation makes the
cell divide uncontrollably, basically making

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.100
clones of themselves.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.720
As the cells pile up, a tumor grows.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.920
If it grows big enough it can harm nearby
organs and tissues or sometimes a part of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.490
the tumor can break off and take up residence
in other parts of the body, which is when

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.679
cancer metastasizes.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.349
There’s another idea, that stem cells trigger
tumors.

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:47.149
These wonky stem cells drive tumor growth
and just like normal stem cells can give rise

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.670
to differentiated cells.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.990
These stem cells are especially good at resisting
treatment like chemotherapy.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.550
Chemotherapy might wipe out those differentiated
cells, but leave the cancer stem cells behind,

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.830
so they come back stronger and in greater
numbers.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.640
And I mean chemotherapy is a brutal process,
the first chemotherapy drugs were a derivative

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.899
of mustard gas..

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.600
But it does have the nifty ability to stop
cell growth.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.910
Which is handy when dealing with runaway cell
growth.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.920
But it can also harm other type of cells that
grow a lot, like hair follicles.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.810
While modern drugs work in other ways, they’re
still pretty nasty.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.031
With the usual side effects of hair loss,
fatigue, nausea, and a knocking out of the

00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:21.319
immune system.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.060
Another way we attack tumor cells is through
radiation, where radiation beams are aimed

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.709
at a tumor and stop its growth by damaging
DNA.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.239
While the immediate side effects are minimal,
it might feel like a sunburn.

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.560
Other long-term effects might be more damaging.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.180
And radiation isn’t 100% effective.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.239
Some tumor cells could get left behind, which
is a problem with surgery too.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.290
Some of these treatments are nasty and painful
and seem to leave the job unfinished.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.349
So why haven’t we come up with anything
better?

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.760
Well there’ve been some cool new ideas put
forward recently.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.640
Researchers from Duke University are looking
to treat tumors WITH POLIO.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.469
Polio, a horrible virus, used to run rampant
and kill thousands of people a year and paralyze

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.459
thousands more until the introduction of a
vaccine in 1955.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.989
You’d think the world would never want to
see the disease again.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.459
Yet over the past few decades scientists have
reengineered the virus which seems to knock

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.930
out a brain tumor’s defenses, allowing the
patient’s immune system to finish the job.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.540
GIVE THE DISEASE DISEASES…

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.540
WHOA.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.519
Another new idea might make surgery a little
easier.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.430
Some researchers from the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Center in Seattle propose injecting

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.999
people with scorpion venom.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.879
Alright, sounds crazy I know, but bear with
me.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.749
The venom is injected into the patient's blood
stream, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.549
makes its way into the brain tumor.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.219
Tumor Paint, as it’s appropriately called
consists of two parts.

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.900
Scorpion venom has to find it’s way to the
prey’s brain to paralyze it.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.310
Turns out that same compound binds really
well the surface of brain tumor cells.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.560
The other part of Tumor Paint lights up under
fluorescent light.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.739
This could be huge.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.969
That way brain surgeons can see the tumor
literally glowing and see where the tumor

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.109
stops and the healthy brain tissue starts.

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.920
But with any kind of new experimental treatment,
it’s best to be cautious.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.969
Very cautious.

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.760
We hear the term CURE FOR CANCER in the news
a lot, and sometimes we never hear another

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.060
word about those treatments again.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.930
It’s okay to be optimistic and skeptical
at the same time.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.849
AND REMEMBER: say it with me now…

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:19.950
MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:30.160
Can you go one whole day without producing
trash?
