though in the World Trade Center when it
 

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:16.360
though in the World Trade Center when it
was built they had to build a bathtub

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.370
was built they had to build a bathtub
 

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.670
was built they had to build a bathtub
under it for drainage reasons and the

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680

so when you think about the adaptation

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080
so when you think about the adaptation
 

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.719
so when you think about the adaptation
to climate change it's going to cost a

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:28.729
to climate change it's going to cost a
 

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:31.779
to climate change it's going to cost a
lot of money so we need to be thinking

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:31.789
lot of money so we need to be thinking
 

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:34.360
lot of money so we need to be thinking
about how to reduce that essentially to

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:34.370
about how to reduce that essentially to
 

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.000
about how to reduce that essentially to
protect our investment now what's

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.010

was growing up in the 1960s the planet
only had three billion people today we

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.250
only had three billion people today we
 

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.490
only had three billion people today we
have more than twice that now it's not

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500
have more than twice that now it's not
 

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.550

going to grow much more than I mean

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560
going to grow much more than I mean
 

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.139

probably the population the planet will

00:16:24.139 --> 00:16:24.149
probably the population the planet will
 

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:26.120
probably the population the planet will
peak at 10 billion but that's still

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.130
peak at 10 billion but that's still
 

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.460

three times as many as were around when

I was growing up and they got us they of

I was growing up and they got us they of

I was growing up and they got us they of
living somewhere and and what it means

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:32.790
living somewhere and and what it means
 

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.519
living somewhere and and what it means
is the probability than being impacted

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:34.529
is the probability than being impacted
 

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:37.129
is the probability than being impacted
by natural disasters is greater so we

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139
by natural disasters is greater so we
 

00:16:37.139 --> 00:16:39.230
by natural disasters is greater so we
have to build a governance system that

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240
have to build a governance system that
 

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.050
have to build a governance system that
accommodates that we have to build a way

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060
accommodates that we have to build a way
 

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.499
accommodates that we have to build a way
to respond to emergencies and

00:16:44.499 --> 00:16:44.509
to respond to emergencies and
 

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:47.389

reconstruct after those emergencies take
 

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:49.759
reconstruct after those emergencies take
place and then there's the issue of

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:49.769
place and then there's the issue of
 

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:53.150

human conflict Wars target people but

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160
human conflict Wars target people but
 

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.749
human conflict Wars target people but
also can target human systems the idea

00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759
also can target human systems the idea

already starting to do this the fact

already starting to do this the fact
that the green part of the US economy is

that the green part of the US economy is

growing faster than the rest even during
 

00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:30.480
growing faster than the rest even during
the recession is an indicator of that

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:30.490
the recession is an indicator of that
 

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.369
the recession is an indicator of that
but we're also going to have to find the

infrastructure some of this capital will
be raised by the private sector by

be raised by the private sector by
 

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.049

efficient and effective economic machine

00:20:21.389 --> 00:20:21.399
efficient and effective economic machine
 

00:20:21.399 --> 00:20:24.789
efficient and effective economic machine
because in the long run something that's

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799
because in the long run something that's
 

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:26.680
because in the long run something that's
renewable will be cheaper than something

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:26.690
renewable will be cheaper than something
 

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.549
renewable will be cheaper than something
that you use and throw away and by

00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559
that you use and throw away and by
 

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:33.519
that you use and throw away and by
reducing the ecological impact of our

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:33.529
reducing the ecological impact of our
 

00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:36.609
reducing the ecological impact of our
development we will reduce the cost of

00:20:36.609 --> 00:20:36.619
development we will reduce the cost of
 

00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:38.259
development we will reduce the cost of
the cleanup that will inevitably follow

00:20:38.259 --> 00:20:38.269
the cleanup that will inevitably follow
 

00:20:38.269 --> 00:20:40.869
the cleanup that will inevitably follow
you may not realize it but you're now

00:20:40.869 --> 00:20:40.879
you may not realize it but you're now
 

00:20:40.879 --> 00:20:43.299
you may not realize it but you're now
paying the cost of all the cleanup of

00:20:43.299 --> 00:20:43.309
paying the cost of all the cleanup of
 

00:20:43.309 --> 00:20:45.609

50s and 60s it's part every time you buy

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:48.529
50s and 60s it's part every time you buy
 

00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:50.680
50s and 60s it's part every time you buy
something you're paying for that clean

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:50.690
something you're paying for that clean
 

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.389
something you're paying for that clean
up because most of the cleanup costs are

00:20:52.389 --> 00:20:52.399
up because most of the cleanup costs are
 

00:20:52.399 --> 00:20:54.129
up because most of the cleanup costs are
in fact being borne by the private

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:54.139
in fact being borne by the private
 

00:20:54.139 --> 00:20:57.609
in fact being borne by the private
sector so we need to figure out a way to

00:20:57.609 --> 00:20:57.619
sector so we need to figure out a way to
 

00:20:57.619 --> 00:21:00.430
sector so we need to figure out a way to
do that but our organizations and our

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440
do that but our organizations and our
 

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.680

and this is not an easy thing to do but
we're going to have to figure out a way

00:27:52.009 --> 00:27:52.019
we're going to have to figure out a way
 

00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:54.849
we're going to have to figure out a way
to do it so that's basically the

00:27:54.849 --> 00:27:54.859
to do it so that's basically the
 

00:27:54.859 --> 00:27:57.830

I think it's going to happen also

00:28:12.499 --> 00:28:12.509
I think it's going to happen also
 

00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:13.549
