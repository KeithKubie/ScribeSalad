00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's make sure we're all on the same page about these simple regular expressions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the "findall" function in Python that allows us to manipulate them.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I've written out three Python expressions involving re.findall

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that returns a list of substrings that match the given regular expression.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What I'd like you to do is for each of those lists

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
write out the elements in the list in the correct order.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.252
Fill in the boxes with the elements of the return values of the findall expressions.
