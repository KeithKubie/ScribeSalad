00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:09.010
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon and welcome to

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.070
Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.510
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Gernot Wagner.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.300
Along with Martin
L. Weitzman, Gernot

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.790
has co-authored the
subject of today's talk,

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.710
"Climate Shock-- How Unnatural
Selection and Non-Random

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.960
Mutation are Changing
Life on Earth."

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.720
In the book they explore
the likely repercussions

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.250
of a hotter planet
drawing on and expanding

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.970
from work previously unavailable
to general audiences.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.530
They show that the longer we
wait to act the more likely

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.970
an extreme event will happen.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.450
What we know about climate
change is alarming enough.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.970
What we don't know
about the extreme risks

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.120
could be far more dangerous.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.540
They tell us that
we need to think

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.710
about climate change
in the same way

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.870
that we think about insurance,
as a risk management problem

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.360
only here on a global scale.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.960
Gernot is lead senior economist
at Environmental Defense Fund,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.550
adjunct associate
professor at Columbia,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.590
and research associate at the
Kennedy School of Government

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.850
at Harvard.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.671
Please join me in
welcoming Gernot Wagner.

00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:24.108
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:25.310
GERNOT WAGNER: Thank you.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.210
Thank you, John, for
the kind introduction.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.680
I guess that big
question always is

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.000
why yet another book
on climate change?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.530
A topic that we all should know
quite a bit about, or at least

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.315
know enough about to act.

00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:46.690
And the short
answer in this case

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.390
is, this isn't
about what we know.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.400
It's about what we don't.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.070
And as John already mentioned in
the introduction, what we know

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.880
is bad enough to lead
us to want to act.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.470
What we don't know is
potentially much, much worse.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:13.720
So here is a range of numbers
that basically defines life

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.230
on earth, or will define life
on earth very, very soon.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.280
Now, turns out this
is 1.5 to 4.5 degrees

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.000
centigrade, the number
of climate sensitivity,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.700
which in fact only
really matters decades,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.840
centuries hence.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.910
It is what happens to global
average temperatures and both

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.150
of these matter-- global
average-- as concentrations

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.520
of CO2 in the atmosphere double.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.729
And what happens eventually
hundreds of years hence.

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.020
Now, there's a few things here.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.700
Now, first of all, we've
already seen 0.8 degrees

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.870
of warming centigrade since the
Industrial Revolution by today.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.500
So if you look at
this range and look

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.600
at the lower bound
of this, 1.5, you

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.130
can be pretty sure that this
is in fact a lower bound.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.950
We you will be very, very lucky
if we undershoot that outcome.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.980
Now, there is a couple
more things here.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.987
So this has been
with us for a while.

00:03:26.987 --> 00:03:29.070
And frankly, this is really
the main point, that's

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.860
the core point of this book.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.830
We happen to live in a world
where a range like this

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.090
will define life on earth.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:51.540
And in about 35 years we have
learned very, very little.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.020
Now this is literally what came
out of a National Academy study

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.032
by Jule Charney in 1979.

00:04:01.032 --> 00:04:01.990
And here's what he did.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.448
There were two
studies at the time.

00:04:03.448 --> 00:04:04.400
One said two degrees.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.380
The other one said four degrees.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.810
Add half a degree on each
side because why not?

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.520
There's uncertainty after all.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.750
Average to two,
declare three degrees

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.269
as the most likely value.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.050
And we were given this
range as something

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.140
akin to a likely value.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.920
1990, IPCC, Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.450
enshrines this range
as it's likely range

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.320
for climate sensitivity.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.420
Decades of climate
research in between-- well

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.640
technically, I guess 11
years of climate research

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.140
in between-- many, many
years of improvements

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.870
in how we understand and
amazing improvements in what we

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.560
know about climate change.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.880
This key variable that
links concentrations

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.870
to temperatures, what we
ultimately should care about,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.750
we don't know much more.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.820
1992, exactly the same.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.170
1995, once again.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.760
2001, we still have
precisely the same range.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.610
Now in the meantime,
what the IPCC has done

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.360
is it has more precisely defined
what this range actually is.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.440
But now it calls it
the likely range.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.110
Not 67% likely.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.810
Turns out it's exactly
defined as 66%, so around 2/3.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.210
Don't ask why it's 66 not 67.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.210
But that is the probability
of being within that range.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.460
So by now we know
with greater certainty

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.720
we'll be within this range.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.130
The range itself hasn't changed.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.060
Big revelation, 2007.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.720
Now two things happened.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.100
Well, one thing happened
to the range, the lower

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.656
bound changed from 1.5 to 2.

00:05:57.656 --> 00:05:59.530
And now you have two
interpretations of this.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.210
One is to say, oh
good news for science.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.450
We now have a better idea
of what will in fact happen.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.300
It turns out it's bad
news for everybody else.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.050
Because it looks
like the lower bound

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.690
is in fact, out at this point.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.900
Global average warming
due to a doubling of CO2

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.530
in the atmosphere--
and double we

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.610
will unless we change
course-- will now

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.250
be at least 2 degrees centigrade
or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.020
That was 2007.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.750
Fast forward to October 2013.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.400
The latest and greatest
IPCC assessment

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.240
report five, once again
hundreds of climate scientists,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.620
several years, lots and
lots of pages and dozens

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.600
and dozens of academic
papers going into this.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.140
And apparently we are back
to where we started in 1979.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.290
1.5 to 4.5 degrees centigrade.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.330
Many, many years of climate
research, decades of learning

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.470
and amazing advances in
climate research on basically

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:18.940
most everything else, the one
defining number concentration

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.570
of two temperatures, no change.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.430
That alone should already
give us pause at least,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.870
if not actively scare us.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.100
And of course, really
what's happening here

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.570
is in this case you could sort
of reverse the 2007 argument

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.360
and say, well, really
now what we can do

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.980
is say, well, bad
news for science.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.080
Because we know less
apparently, up to a point.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.660
Good news for the
rest of us because it

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.470
looks like lower global average
warming is once again part

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.790
of the likely range.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.910
Well, turns out the uncertainty
itself, the risk itself,

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:05.730
not knowing in itself is in
fact really, really costly.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.050
So this isn't good news
for the rest of us.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.450
It is in fact bad news for us.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.310
Having unlearned, well, for
that matter, taking into account

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.970
this is not necessarily throwing
out the latest research.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.400
This is adding research
and saying, well,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.490
looks like taking
everything into account

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.970
the range is indeed once again
higher than what we thought.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.559
OK, so here is another version
of the exact same story.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.890
So we could in fact look at a
probability density function

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.390
essentially try to see what
is the chance of hitting

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.770
every one of these global
average temperatures

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.710
eventually?

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.710
And there is a likely
range between 1.5 and 4.5.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.690
And yes, there is
a likely chance

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.930
of being within that range, 66%
which by definition, of course,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.040
means it's unlikely we'll
be outside that range.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.740
But we can't ignore
the possibility.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.205
34% chance we will
be outside the range.

00:09:07.205 --> 00:09:08.580
Now, funny thing,
of course, when

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.050
it comes to global
average warming.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.114
or global warming in general.

00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:14.280
We're pretty sure that
there's a lower cut off here.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.350
Adding CO2 isn't going
to lower temperatures.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.160
Or for that matter, where
we are today not even

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.750
having increased
pre-industrial concentrations

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.840
in the atmosphere
by as much as is

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.900
necessary to get these
temperature outcomes eventually

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.150
but only going from
280 parts per million

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:41.700
pre-industrial levels to 400
today not yet 560, a doubling.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.160
Today we've already warmed
the earth on average

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.510
by 0.8 degrees centigrade.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.280
In equilibrium, which is
really what this is showing,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.229
it will be higher
than today's value.

00:09:55.229 --> 00:09:57.020
And of course we haven't
stopped adding CO2

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.630
into the atmosphere
in the meantime.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.290
So this is, in many ways, the
core of what's going on here.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.570
It's also slightly misleading.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.270
Because really what
we're doing here

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.590
is just looking at what happens
every time you double CO2.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.980
Here is another view of this.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.520
International Energy Agency, you
take a conservative scenario--

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.690
lowercase conservative
scenario-- of what is projected

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.440
will happen by 2100 not even
not even eventually, basically

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.350
this century, and we take
the number from the IEA

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.270
that tells us 700
parts per million.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.912
They call this, by the way,
their new policy scenario.

00:10:40.912 --> 00:10:42.370
Or in other words,
they are already

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.140
assuming that new
policies will come

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.050
in place that are
currently not on the books

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.420
or not projected to be
in place for that matter.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.290
But let's just give everyone
the benefit of the doubt.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.450
We will act.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:58.170
We will add new policies
despite that by 2100 we

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.230
will be at 700 parts per million
of CO2 equivalent emissions

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.980
in the atmosphere.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.480
So we have more than
doubled concentrations.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.040
What are the
temperature outcomes?

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:17.160
Well, now we are
looking at a 10% chance

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.250
of let's say,
temperatures exceeding

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.840
six degrees centigrade,
11 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.910
But this is, by definition,
on the unlikely side

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.520
of our outcome.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.030
It's not what we expect to be.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.120
The expectation is lower.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.595
But of course we can't
exclude that a priori.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.140
Here's a slightly
different view of this.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.260
And of course the title
gives away the punch line.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.310
What everyone is focused
on, climate scientists,

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.660
the IPCC Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, everyone

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.140
is focused on this top line.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.035
The median temperature
is the average.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.430
Today we are already at 400
parts per million for CO2

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.930
alone.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.634
This is CO2 equivalent emissions
where we are about 450.

00:12:12.634 --> 00:12:14.430
Plus, minus a few.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.010
So we have basically
already locked

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:23.160
in global average warming
off these 0.8 so degrees

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.990
centigrade.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.590
And now we can consult
climate scientists

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.980
and they will tell well,
there's a good reason

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.770
we've chosen 2 degrees as
a threshold or some might

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.417
disagree and say,
actually, really we

00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:36.250
ought to go back to be
pre-industrial levels

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.840
and limit warming
to 1.5 degrees.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.410
Lots of debates to be had.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.790
What is non debatable is that
that global average will go up

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.670
the more CO2 we add
to the atmosphere.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.180
And it'll go up by an
enough and of course,

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.640
when you look at 700 PPM,
3.4 degrees centigrade

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.920
of global average warming
is really, really bad.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.710
Just to give you
a sense of this,

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.210
how it relates to
us today, well,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.570
today at 400 parts per
million we have, in fact,

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.746
experienced this before.

00:13:12.746 --> 00:13:14.370
The planet has
experienced this before.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.200
We of course haven't.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.370
Last time that was the case was
more than 3 million years ago.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:28.110
Pliocene the geological
period and when

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.030
you look at the record,
we had camels in Canada,

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.530
crocodiles in Montana.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.350
Sea levels were up
to 60 feet higher

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:40.600
than they are today, 20 meters
higher than they are today.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.170
Now, no one necessarily
predicts that this

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:49.070
will in fact happen based
on today's concentrations.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.070
But of course, once again,
it points to the fact

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:58.260
that we actually know a lot
less then we often think we do.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:03.530
And that not knowing
can only be costly.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.420
Now here is an even more
concrete manifestation

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.850
of this how not
knowing is costly.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.850
Look at the bottom line.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.600
The median, the mean
goes up quite a bit.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.450
And that's costly and important.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.960
Now, no one would
disagree with six degrees

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.930
average global warming.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:29.210
Which, by the way, means
polls of warming by at least

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:30.980
around three times as much.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.140
So bad news for your
beachfront property.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.380
That's if you two degrees
of warming, let alone six.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.110
No one would disagree that this
is a planetary catastrophe.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.530
And look at the probabilities
of that happening

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:50.230
as we creep up when it comes
to concentrations of CO2

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.410
in the atmosphere.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.390
So right now we are
basically at around 0.3%

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.010
which is not nothing.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.230
But at least it's less
than one in this case.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:07.610
Well, if you increase
concentrations from 450 to 550,

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.660
which we will surely do
unless we take really,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.270
really strong
action, you've just

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.500
increased the chance of global
average temperatures exceeding

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.171
six degrees centigrade
by a factor of what?

00:15:23.171 --> 00:15:23.670
10X.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.840
That is huge.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.860
700 PPM you have a
probability of above 10%.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:42.550
We insure our houses, our lives,
our cars for a much, much lower

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.451
probabilities.

00:15:43.451 --> 00:15:45.700
And of course, insurance has
a very particular meaning

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.420
in that case.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.840
You pay an annual
premium in order

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.510
for if that eventuality
in fact happens

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.140
you get all your money back.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.840
In this case, there
is no such thing

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.122
as insurance in
the sense of well,

00:16:00.122 --> 00:16:01.330
let's just wait what happens.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:04.680
If it's bad we'll
somehow make sure

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.370
that we are made whole again.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.130
The only insurance
in this case, really,

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.990
is putting the
price on CO2 today,

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.780
avoiding emissions today.

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:21.030
That's where the insurance
analogy comes to play.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:24.810
Now, so far I've told you
that what we care about

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.200
is temperatures.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.410
Not the concentrations,
temperatures.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.680
And there's a lot of uncertainty
linking one to the other.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.380
It's not uncertain
that it'll be bad.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.430
It's just uncertain how
bad it will, in fact, be.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:44.280
Now really, we actually don't
care about temperatures either.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.900
You care about the
damages associated

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:47.900
with those temperatures.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.850
If this wasn't
already scary enough,

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:56.330
well, this is where
it gets really tricky.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.890
Because now we need
to make assumptions

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:04.599
of what will happen in
terms of economic damages

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:09.980
once global average warming
hits certain thresholds.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.860
And we've already
passed one degree.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.859
Sorry, we have passed 0.8
degrees at this point.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.190
But we are closer
to one degrees.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:16.689
Right?

00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:19.176
So we can look at
actual experience.

00:17:19.176 --> 00:17:20.290
How much are hurricanes?

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.206
How much are droughts?

00:17:21.206 --> 00:17:23.849
How much are anything that's
linked with global warming

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:26.040
today already costing us today?

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:35.140
And then of course, you can
look at many, many, many studies

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.250
that are going to
project, are projecting

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.170
what will happen as well, you
creep up just a little bit.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.730
From 1 to 1.2 or from
1 to 1.5 and so on.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.970
What happens at
relatively low levels?

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:55.730
No one has any idea what the
actual damages are at let's say

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:02.650
five or six degrees centigrade
of global average warming.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.670
Now, that doesn't stop
economists of course.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:04.840
Right?

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.010
So what do economists do?

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.880
Well, we somehow need
to make assumptions.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.980
We need to extrapolate
based on actual experience

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:16.200
of projections of what we
do know into the unknown

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.940
or I would argue in
many ways unknowable.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.740
Well, when you look at the
standard assumptions feeding

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.980
into the three models that
are used most prominently

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:35.000
to calculate what climate
change is actually costing us

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.150
every single one of
them assumes something

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.536
akin to this bottom line here,
a quadratic extrapolation.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.550
What does that mean in English?

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.160
Well, no one really believes
it's a straight line

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.490
as in the warmer it
gets we just keep adding

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.770
sort of a bit of damages.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.860
Well, the warmer it gets
once you hit certain

00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.980
thresholds the higher the costs
of any additional warming.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.880
Hence not a straight line but
one that curves slightly up.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.900
Now, of course we
don't in fact know how

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.490
that line ought to look like.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:15.300
Whether this quadratic
extrapolation here is in fact

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.330
correct.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.670
Now, we are not saying that
the red line here is anymore

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:26.450
correct then the quadratic one,
the exponential extrapolation.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.300
The point is we just don't know.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:34.250
What we do know is that
this quadratic extrapolation

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.000
is in fact rather conservative.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.980
Very, very conservative,
lowercase conservative

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.700
when you try to estimate
what the actual damages are.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.410
And the difference
is, in fact, dramatic.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.570
At one degrees or four
degrees, well, in fact,

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:49.720
they're exactly the same.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.550
There is no difference.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:56.960
At six degrees, this is looking
at average global damages

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.020
as a percent of global
economic output.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.280
You're now looking at a
difference between 10 and 30%.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:08.107
Those numbers are a trillion
here, trillion there.

00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:09.690
Soon enough you're
talking real bucks.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:13.060
So this starts adding up here.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.440
And once again, lots
of uncertainty what it

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.600
actually is.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.100
We can be pretty
sure it's not going

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.210
to be below the blue line.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:21.079
Although of course,
that is uncertain too.

00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:22.620
What, of course,
should really scares

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.690
us is that there's
a potential to have

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.400
this go quite a bit higher.

00:20:30.735 --> 00:20:36.360
OK, now here's what we
know-- or at least what

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.650
the models that have the
known knowns and some

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.680
of the known unknowns
and footnote somewhere.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.650
But certainly none of the
stuff that it could potentially

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:50.520
really cost us big time--
those three economic models

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:53.660
climate economic models
that essentially look

00:20:53.660 --> 00:21:00.190
at damages that we can
estimate grind the cranks,

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:07.810
feed them through some pretty
sophisticated calculations,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:15.300
come up with $40 per
ton of CO2 as the cost.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:19.530
Now that's $40 per ton
of CO2 emitted today

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.340
in today's dollars.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.450
That that ton of CO2, once
it's up in atmosphere,

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.010
will cause over its lifetime.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.400
Stuff stays up there for
centuries, millennia.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.150
So much of the damage is
in fact in the future.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.820
Much of the damage
is in fact not

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.887
affecting us but our
children or others children.

00:21:42.887 --> 00:21:44.720
Which of course, once
again, is the problem,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.130
why the global warming such a
big problem in the first place.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.830
Nevertheless, when you
calculate the cost of each ton

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:57.097
you and I emit
today it's that $40.

00:21:57.097 --> 00:21:57.805
The known knowns.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.260
If you take the unknown
unknowns seriously,

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.580
it's pretty clear that
it can only go up.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.820
Here's where we are today.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.460
When you look at
fossil fuel subsidies,

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.120
half a trillion
dollars per year.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.320
Average it out.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.216
The global average price
is in fact negative.

00:22:26.216 --> 00:22:29.290
Now, of course that's
not true everywhere.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:34.370
Those subsidies are concentrated
in particular countries.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:37.510
Still, on average, we
are not even getting

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.624
the sign right, let alone
getting the number right.

00:22:42.624 --> 00:22:45.290
So you could argue all this talk
about what the actual number is

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.300
is a sort of false
precision if you will,

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.550
really what we need to worry
about is getting the sign

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:50.580
right.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.550
And of course,
you will be right.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:57.010
At the very least,
we to get to the $40.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.920
Of course one big, big
question is it in fact 40?

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.460
In which case some
jurisdictions that today have,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.760
let's say, common
price of $15 or so.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.520
That's sort of
within the ballpark.

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.540
But it's still clearly
not enough if you

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.320
pay $15 per ton of CO2 and
the damage caused by every ton

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.225
is, in fact, 40.

00:23:16.225 --> 00:23:18.350
But at the very least, you
have the system in place

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:22.450
that will get you there
relatively easily.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.420
Or at least relatively easily
compared to, let's say,

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.250
if the real number
is in fact 150, $400

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:34.030
or whatever else it could
be even higher than that.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:39.525
OK now what to do?

00:23:39.525 --> 00:23:42.340
Well, here's what not to do.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.625
I'm not talking about either
having kids or flying.

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:50.260
That's my kid flying when he
was three weeks old on his way

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.550
to visit his
grandparents in Austria.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.884
He is wearing a small
carbon footprint hat.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.290
Let's take another image here.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.490
Same example here.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:09.700
Now, when I say what
not to do I mean

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.580
we ought not to look
at this and then say,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.140
oh, well, this is clearly out.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.750
This by the way is to me
or at least a free upgrade

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.680
from British Airways.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.190
Thank you BA.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.069
It's pretty nice, three windows,
fruit basket, class of wine.

00:24:24.069 --> 00:24:25.610
Of course it's my
laptop here writing

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.270
a paper on funding the
term to climate safety.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.770
And you could
basically look at this

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.750
and say, well, as
the good upstanding

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.580
environmentalist
you really shouldn't

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.430
be doing this kind of thing.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:40.030
Or you should be acting more
in line with this ad here.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.280
And a course, there's
a very good reason

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.560
why we should in fact
take these kinds of steps,

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.280
the right things, as it were.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.230
Recycle do all the right things.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.765
I don't have a driver's license.

00:24:57.765 --> 00:24:59.140
I try to do all
the right things.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.680
Now of course, I
fly quite a bit.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.300
And take these voluntary steps.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.580
Just ethically do
the right thing.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.400
And of course, I teach my
kid to do exactly that too.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.600
Now, here's a good example.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.600
This was in fact a full
page ad in "The New York

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.160
Times" on Black Friday,
day after Thanksgiving.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.070
So Patagonia paid
$40,000 or however much

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.300
it costs for a full-page
ad to tell people not

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.979
to buy their product.

00:25:27.979 --> 00:25:30.270
First of all, I can tell you
it's a pretty good jacket.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.970
My wife owns two of them.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:37.000
I also did go to
the Patagonia store

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.610
at that point in the Upper
West Side, Columbus Avenue

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.987
in Manhattan the day after.

00:25:42.987 --> 00:25:44.570
As a good environmentalist,
of course,

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.640
you don't walk into a
store on Black Friday

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.950
because that's the
day you don't shop.

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:55.780
So I checked Saturday,
the following day.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.950
Turns out they were sold out.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.390
So advertisement works, right?

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:01.120
Of course it does, right?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.495
So this is the
kind of thing that

00:26:02.495 --> 00:26:04.760
appeals to well, you and
me, the kind of people

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.170
who know where Patagonia is.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:10.750
Not the store,
the actual region.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.830
And well, you read the
text and this is fantastic.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.410
It makes you feel good
every step along the way

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.080
while wearing the
jacket of course.

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.730
And it's a pretty
darn good jacket.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:29.759
Now, OK, what do I mean when I
say this is not the right step?

00:26:29.759 --> 00:26:31.300
If it's basically
personal sacrifice,

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:36.970
if we rely on personal sacrifice
to fix this problem-- climate

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.800
in this case-- we are losing.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.580
There's just no way.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:46.750
That doesn't mean we shouldn't
appeal to ethics as it were.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:47.745
It would be great.

00:26:47.745 --> 00:26:50.120
So sooner rather than later,
throw out all the economists

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.230
and sort of make
this an issue just

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.080
like child labor essentially.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.710
Something not to be done.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.020
Polluting CO2 is
just something we

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.950
can't, shouldn't,
wouldn't want to do

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.540
because it is unethical to do.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.590
Fine, all right, sure.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.060
I live in 02138.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.010
Sign me up.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.400
Of course.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.410
On the other hand,
it's just not the way

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:19.020
to in fact get to
where we need to be.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.130
The one thing we have
an economics literally,

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.320
the one law we have in
economics is the law of demand.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.974
Price goes up, demand goes down.

00:27:31.974 --> 00:27:34.390
Technically that's the law of
compensated demand and there

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:37.060
are, in fact, a
couple of exceptions.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.340
CO2 isn't one of them.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.855
You increase the price of CO2,
demand for the CO2 goes down.

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:52.080
$150 above $150 at
this point is the price

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:58.930
of each ton of CO2 in the
heating sector, the transport

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:03.930
sector in Sweden.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.880
So Sweden is one of
the notable exceptions

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.910
of the price on CO2
certainly is negative

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.500
or for that matter, too low.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.110
One could argue
possibly the other way.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.780
But the average Swede
pays an average of $150

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.750
and above for each ton of CO2.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:24.460
So two things.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:30.920
Well, guess what happens in
the Swedish home heating sector

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.304
or electricity for that matter?

00:28:33.304 --> 00:28:34.470
It's basically decarbonized.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.130
Now, Sweden also happens to be
a pretty darn cold place most

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.420
of the time.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.300
It also is a pretty
wealthy place.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.000
So no one's freezing.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.070
Certainly not because of this.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:53.620
Certainly not because
of the price of CO2.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.660
Well, for that matter, I just
talked to the average Swede

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.930
when you come home for dinner
and guess what they talk about?

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.540
Their wives and girlfriends
and husbands and boyfriends,

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.320
they don't talk about
the price on CO2.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.190
Life goes on.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.940
It just happens to be much,
much more decarbonized.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.380
Market forces still operate.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.255
They just happen to be pointing
in the right direction.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:27.800
And at that point, of
course, we then easily

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.630
should have the conversations
around the ethics

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.040
and everything else.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.050
And for that matter,
we can and should

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.460
and must have the
conversation around the ethics

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.050
to get there in the first place.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.980
But the point is that we need
to get to something like this.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.850
At the very least
a positive price

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.600
on CO2 to not guide all of
us in the wrong direction

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.080
but at the very least
in the right direction.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.890
So far I talked about
what we don't know.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.310
This is very quick.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:05.560
I guess these are the chapters,
literally, from the book.

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.970
911 is pretty obvious.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:11.790
411, directory assistance
right here is where we are.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:15.280
Then the business around
what we don't know.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:17.772
Now here are these
asterisks to all of this.

00:30:17.772 --> 00:30:19.230
And not the asterisks
on the bottom

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.400
that says that people said
nice things about the book.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.358
But the actual asterisks
to what we don't know.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:31.660
What we don't know
basically means

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.620
that things will
just be much more

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.970
costly than we can imagine.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.429
And what's driving this?

00:30:39.429 --> 00:30:41.470
Well, what's driving the
fact that we are talking

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:45.400
about climate change at all is
in fact what economists would

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.120
call a free rider problem.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.460
It's not in anyone's
personal short term

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:55.230
immediate economic interest to
do enough or for that matter,

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.400
is it possible to do
enough as an individual

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.340
to solve this problem
for the rest of us

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:02.990
by decreasing CO2 emissions?

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.906
If all of us here were or every
committed environmentalist

00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:07.530
on the planet decreased
their emissions

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.630
to zero that would be laudable.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.740
That would be good.

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:15.655
A, it probably wouldn't
even be possible.

00:31:15.655 --> 00:31:17.280
And I would even
question the statement

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.004
whether it would
be good overall.

00:31:20.004 --> 00:31:21.420
Given current
technologists that's

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:26.010
just not what we
could reasonably do.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.010
Well, turn this on its head.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.140
From the free rider
problem of it's

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.250
not in any one
ours interest to do

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.570
enough to what we call
the free driver problem.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:44.597
When you look at something like
the what techno fix, quick fix,

00:31:44.597 --> 00:31:45.430
like geoengineering.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.570
Dumping stuff into
the stratosphere

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:55.720
to deflect sunlight and cooling
the planet while we are at it.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:03.370
Now, it turns out in
a very big crude form.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.320
we know that works.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.540
Volcanoes have been
doing it forever.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:13.110
At Mount Pinatubo,
Philippines, 1991,

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.600
decreased global average
warming the following year

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.580
by about 0.5 degrees
centigrade, which at the time

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.660
was precisely the global
average warming up

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:27.840
to that point since
pre-industrial times.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.340
It works.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.100
Now, first of all, I mean
one good way, frankly

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.280
of describing what
geoengineering actually

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.610
is, is it's basically
chemotherapy for the planet.

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.600
So just because some
experimental drug

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.950
worked on some rat
somewhere in a lab

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:54.520
in not spreading cancer quite
as rapidly as it would have,

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.700
doesn't mean you should
start smoking today.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.850
That's clearly not.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:06.110
Or like another analogy,
tracheotomy for the planet.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.110
So you probably
want to your doctor

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.995
to have that in his back pocket
when you walk into the office.

00:33:12.995 --> 00:33:15.370
You probably don't want to
deal with a doctor who doesn't

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:16.580
know what a tracheotomy is.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.914
Let's put it that way.

00:33:17.914 --> 00:33:20.080
Now, you certainly don't
walk into a doctor's office

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.960
and say, sir, could you
please cut my throat open?

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.590
I always wanted to
see what it's like.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.590
Clearly not.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.330
Now that's what I would
say is a pretty apt analogy

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.950
to geoengineering.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.100
It doesn't mean
that we shouldn't

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:48.000
want to see whether it
is in fact something we

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.510
could be eventually
forced to many ways use.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:57.192
We certainly don't want to be
looking at it as anything close

00:33:57.192 --> 00:33:57.775
to a solution.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.800
At most it's a complement
to what we are doing

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.640
and a very, very poor
stand in for that.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.389
And when I say what
we're doing is getting

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:12.290
rid of CO2 in the first place.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:15.850
Never mind here is now
the bit that we do know.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.340
The economic forces that
prevent us from doing something

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:23.010
about mitigating CO2
in the first place.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.179
Basically all of
them get flipped when

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:28.100
it comes to geoengineering.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:35.530
It is so cheap, relatively
speaking, to be dumping

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.270
the sulfates into
the stratosphere

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:42.230
to deflect sunlight
that you could

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:49.260
argue the national security
adviser to the Indian Prime

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.679
Minister at a time when
the monsoon turned off

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.060
and have a billion
people are starving,

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:59.230
would be remiss in not
mentioning the option.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.770
We don't know
whether it'll work.

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.770
What we do know is there's
half a billion people

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.644
starving right now
because of global warming.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.590
So when you then essentially
turn all these around,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:13.670
such high leverage, so
cheap, relatively speaking.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.480
In many ways I'm
very, very afraid

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.580
that it is not a question of if.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:28.290
It's a question of when somebody
out there will look at this

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.630
and say, hmm, here's our option.

00:35:35.452 --> 00:35:36.910
Now, the way we
talk about it well,

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.530
bailing out the planet
of course is the chapter

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:40.752
where that would happen.

00:35:40.752 --> 00:35:42.710
And then, of course, you
can have fun with this

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.270
and say, well,
what about looking

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.395
at instead of green finger
you look at gold finger.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.540
One way of looking
at this is OK,

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.880
this is sort of the cutesy
way of describing what

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.330
could in fact be a scenario.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.450
Of course, none of
this is, in fact,

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:01.790
any more pleasant then
pointing to a tracheotomy

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.720
or to chemotherapy
for that matter.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.200
We did attempt to write
it as a screenplay, 007.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.970
Nevertheless, there is
a huge, huge warning

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.790
attached to all of this.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:19.810
And of course, at the end of the
day, well, what can we in fact

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.170
do?

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:26.290
So with that, I'll turn
it over to questions.

00:36:33.038 --> 00:36:35.370
AUDIENCE: My impression
in this country

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:37.800
is probably the biggest thing
we're dealing with right now

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.864
is willful blindness.

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.280
And I'm wondering if you could
just talk a little bit more

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.030
about that?

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.570
GERNOT WAGNER: Willful
blindness, I guess,

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:50.090
is exactly what you
think it would be.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:50.590
Right?

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:53.960
I mean, at this point there
is no way of describing

00:36:53.960 --> 00:37:01.330
what's happening in many
areas or public [INAUDIBLE]--

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:05.110
let's put it that
way-- than to say,

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:11.670
you have to be willfully blind
not to want to look at this

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:16.550
and say, we have to take
care of this problem.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.570
This is frankly the
challenge, right?

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:23.970
So here's one, right?

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:25.340
A very real one.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.480
As soon as you mention
uncertainty in an honest way,

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.560
well, uncertainty
means wait and see.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.742
Oh well, we don't
know quite as much.

00:37:35.742 --> 00:37:37.200
Looks like we need
to wait and see.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.690
Well, in other
words, really what

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:45.350
we ought to be talking
about isn't uncertainty.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.270
It's risk.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.350
Because when you hear
risk you hear mitigate

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.132
or when you hear risk
you think mitigate.

00:37:51.132 --> 00:37:53.590
And of course, mitigate has a
very direct implication here.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.100
Mitigate CO2 in the first place.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:56.580
That was actually
the defined term

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.690
of what you ought to be doing.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.670
Never mind that right
as a PhD economist

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.210
I'm obligated to tell you
that ever since Frank Knight's

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.360
University of Chicago
dissertation in 1923

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.330
we have tightly defined
idea that uncertainty

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.370
is worse than risk.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:18.835
Sure, in the new
Chicago library fine.

00:38:18.835 --> 00:38:22.050
Or amongst PhD Economists
talking amongst themselves

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:23.610
amongst statisticians.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.110
For the real world
that's just not the case.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:30.210
So this goes beyond
your question of what

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:32.320
it means to be willfully blind.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.820
But so this is the challenge
for us then, the ones who do

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.900
know who understand the
science to then say,

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:46.880
OK, well, we know enough to
know that we have to act.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.330
Let's also figure out how to
convey this message in a way

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:53.440
that in fact resonates.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.130
And talking about climate
uncertainty, for example,

00:38:56.130 --> 00:39:00.380
well, we know that that's,
in fact, the proper term.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.970
But in many ways it's
associated with wait and see.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:06.940
Well, climate risk is
associated with mitigate.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.690
Here is a partial
answer right there.

00:39:12.354 --> 00:39:13.770
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you.

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:15.353
This has been a
wonderful talk really.

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:16.312
Very much enjoyed it.

00:39:16.312 --> 00:39:18.020
This is in some ways
a follow-up question

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.590
because the following century
is a little bit interesting

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.175
in that there are multiple
ways that civilization

00:39:23.175 --> 00:39:24.340
could be destroyed.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.680
We have nuclear weapons.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.200
We could have all nuclear war.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.290
We could have runaway
bio engineered plagues.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:34.790
What, as an economist who knows
about Knightean uncertainty,

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:37.260
does that make you believe
that how we should balance

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.530
or how much we spend on
these various risks given

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:43.240
that many of them actually
have bigger uncertainties

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.550
than climate change?

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:48.680
GERNOT WAGNER:
Excellent question.

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.070
Turns out climate
change does not

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.400
have a monopoly on worst-case
scenarios, yes, absolutely.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.660
Now, we've actually thought
quite a bit about this.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.800
And in fact, the chapter on
willful blindness, half of it

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:05.630
isn't just talking
about willful blindness.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:07.430
Half of that
chapter is, in fact,

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:11.060
well let's go through the worst
case scenarios and figure out

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:15.520
what makes climate change,
if anything, unique?

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.010
And at the end of the day,
we do describe climate change

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:25.760
as uniquely long term, uniquely
global, uniquely irreversible,

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.200
and uniquely risky,
uniquely uncertain.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.780
Or at least it's unique in
the combination of all four.

00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.330
Now, that does not
mean that there

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.437
aren't other problems out there
that deserve our attention.

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:42.020
But let me just give
you two examples.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.220
And we go through eight
total then basically

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.410
say, well, climate change
isn't in fact the only problem.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.570
But it may be the
only problem where

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.970
the disconnect between
public attention

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.750
and for that matter, public
action to what science

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:02.020
tells us is in fact necessary is
the largest out of all of them.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:05.100
We go through nuclear
war and GMOs and so on.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.270
Now, here's two of those
we are considering.

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.990
One of asteroids.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:11.430
The other one are
the strangelets.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.700
Stable strange matter that sort
of sucks up everything and CERN

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.930
is now ramping up again and
there's sort of these worries,

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:20.440
right?

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.390
Now, asteroids.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:27.280
arguably 65 million
years ago there

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.470
was an asteroid that
wiped out the dinosaurs.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.365
It's not unprecedented.

00:41:31.365 --> 00:41:33.010
It has happened before.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:36.360
And in fact, asteroids
and climate change

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.130
are the two, in
this entire category

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:42.910
of all these worst-case
scenarios that are in fact,

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.090
have historical precedent.

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:46.790
We can point to
history and say, here's

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:50.320
what will happen based
on what has happened.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.490
OK, asteroids once again.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:51.990
Right?

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.870
So the big ones that's going
to wipe out civilization

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:58.970
as we know are in fact,
a big, big problem.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.920
And we have to do
something about it.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.630
Now, you don't have to be
Armageddon Bruce Willis going

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.610
up there and sort of taking
matters in his own hands.

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:12.900
On the other hand, actually, the
nuclear standoff collision kind

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.860
of sort of what was featured
in this Hollywood movie

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.370
is, in fact, something
that serious scientists,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:22.420
National Academy
study in this case,

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.060
is pointing to as
something that NASA

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.800
should in fact be exploring.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.140
And as instance, well, OK,
if you look at the study

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:36.428
and it says, we need about
10 years and 2 to $3 billion

00:42:36.428 --> 00:42:41.729
to test one of these
nuclear standoff collisions.

00:42:41.729 --> 00:42:43.270
So yeah, that's a
lot of money right?

00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:46.950
It's 2 to $3 billion bucks
and it'll take us a decade.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:50.600
Now, we pretty much know that
none of these sizable asteroids

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.660
are going to hit
us within a decade.

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.980
So yes we have the time.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.527
We certainly have the money.

00:42:57.527 --> 00:42:59.610
And the shorter answer is
let's go spend the money

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.640
and invest the resources and
go take care of this problem.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.570
But-- and this is the big
but in this case-- we can,

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:10.450
up to a point-- never
100% certainty--

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:13.300
but we can be pretty darn
sure that if we invest

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.840
the resources-- finite amount
of resources in this case--

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.340
we can basically check
this worst-case scenario

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.340
off our list.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:24.470
There'll always be smaller
asteroids hitting us.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:26.680
And in fact, we start the
book with the scenario

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.700
of the Russian asteroid
hitting basically

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:31.050
injuring 1,500 people.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.930
Killed no one, injured 1,500.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:34.620
That's a problem.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:39.470
And these asteroids are probably
too small to identify and track

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:40.640
and for that matter deflect.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.720
Won't happen.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.260
Every single one of
them we can probably

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.070
invest the money to
at least identify

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.550
them and tell
people to stay away

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:50.760
from windows for the next hour.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.760
But at the end of the
day it is, in fact,

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.280
a relatively small problem.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.760
It's not a worst-case
scenario that

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.200
will swallow up the planet.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.450
All right now flip gears.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:04.010
Strangelets would, in
fact, swallow up the planet

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.780
quite literally in a fraction
of a second no one of us

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:09.160
would notice that it happens.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.070
Now, you talk to
theoretical physicists

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.860
some would even doubt that
it's theoretically possible.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.470
Which of course is a
whole different matter.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:20.930
If you can prove that it's
theoretically impossible then

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.290
why worry about it?

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:24.390
It might make a good
headline but it's clearly

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.012
not something to worry about.

00:44:26.012 --> 00:44:27.470
I guess there are
physicists who do

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.890
believe that it is at least
theoretically possible

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:33.090
have in fact tried to
do some calculations.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.050
And I forgot the
exact number of zeros

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:40.050
that go between the period
and the actual the two

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:40.720
in this case.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:48.180
It's 0.00002% of that
in fact being possible.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.910
So no, it's not zero.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.990
And yes, it will be the
ultimate catastrophe,

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:54.114
swallowing up the universe
or the planet, at least,

00:44:54.114 --> 00:44:55.240
as we know it.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.410
On the other hand, when you look
at the chance of catastrophe

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:04.820
where we say, well, it's at
least around 10% unless we act.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:10.360
In that case it is so much
lower that it's not zero

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.571
but it might as well be.

00:45:13.571 --> 00:45:15.570
Or In other words, all
these other catastrophes,

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:18.910
we look at nuclear catastrophe
and GMOs for that matter.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.760
GMOs is a fantastic
example too, by the way.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.640
So the public is scared.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.950
The average public is scared
of GMOs wreaking havoc.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:36.610
When you talk to the
well-informed scientist, most

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:40.930
of them-- the vast,
vast majority of them--

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:47.240
are much less worried about the
ultimate worst-case scenario

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:51.470
when it comes to GMOs
than the general public.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:55.010
Flip gears and look at climate.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:57.590
The average climate
scientist is most

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:59.510
definitely much,
much more worried

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:03.430
than the average citizen.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.220
Not just here in
the US, everywhere.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.380
Europe, anywhere.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.930
And then what you actually
have is many of the more level

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:16.280
headed climate scientists
have, in fact, moved on.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.470
And not moved on in sort
of worrying about GMOs,

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.200
but moved on and
basically are now

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.450
thinking about geoengineering.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.740
That's a real problem.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.620
So I'm not saying
climate change is unique.

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:34.390
I would say it's unique in
the combination of these four

00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:37.176
long term, global,
irreversible, and uncertain.

00:46:37.176 --> 00:46:39.050
Which, of course, makes
it uniquely difficult

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:43.050
to solve which is a
problem, a real problem.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:47.220
And more important
or equally important,

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.990
it is probably the one
problem with the biggest

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:57.755
gap between informed citizens
versus actual action.

00:47:01.715 --> 00:47:04.780
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.702
You put up the slide $150
and then you said Sweden.

00:47:08.702 --> 00:47:11.470
And I almost tolled
my eyes a little bit.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:14.140
Because if you had
asked me, OK, make

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.260
a list of the most
likely countries that

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:21.490
are making public investments
in reducing climate change,

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.220
many of us in this
room ah, Sweden's

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.890
probably up there somewhere.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:29.910
Their approach to
public investment

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:32.950
on particular issues, add
this to the list of things

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.590
that Sweden has
done that won't even

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:37.800
put it on the map of
American politics, right?

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.390
I guess I'm curious, as
you go down that list.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.010
Are there surprises?

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:45.800
Are there countries whose
economy and other approaches

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.222
to public investment
would not lead

00:47:48.222 --> 00:47:50.180
you to believe that they
were to climate change

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:53.297
seriously and yet,
that country does?

00:47:53.297 --> 00:47:55.380
Because those might be the
countries that we would

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.240
want to look to.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.881
Making countries more like
Sweden in all other ways,

00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:02.880
and then bringing them
up to the climate change,

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.550
may be a harder thing
if there turns out

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:08.610
that there's kind of a shortcut
to this particular issue

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.196
of public investment?

00:48:10.196 --> 00:48:12.320
GERNOT WAGNER: Yep,
great question.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:17.030
So yeah, trust the Scandinavians
to always do the right thing

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:21.010
even though it's not in
this narrow self interest.

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:22.160
Right?

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.590
Now, it turns out, yes there is.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:32.180
India has $1 per ton
of coal, coal tax.

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:33.970
Not CO2 tax, coal tax.

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:34.890
Price on coal.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.450
Raising half a
billion dollars a year

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.450
and spending it for the
most part on renewables,

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:44.990
the kind of stuff you would
expect that money to be used.

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:49.930
China is experimenting now with
seven regional cap and trade

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.380
trials.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.140
And NDRC, the National
Development Reform Commission

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.200
is essentially writing the next
five-year plan as we speak.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.820
And it will very
likely have something

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.530
akin to a national
cap on emissions

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:08.760
at least for the electricity
sector, let's say,

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.340
which of course, is the big one.

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.215
For the matter when you
look what is actually

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:16.860
happening in reality, well,
Chinese coal consumption

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.835
has, in fact, peaked.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.690
It did peak two
years ago, I guess.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.910
It went down last year.

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.570
When you look at
global CO2 emissions

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.950
from the energy sector, not
global greenhouse gas emissions

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:34.950
from everything, but CO2 from
the energy sector-- which

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.590
in many ways, is in fact,
the most important gas

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:42.570
from the most important sector--
has for the very first time

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:44.716
ever since IEA-- the
international Energy

00:49:44.716 --> 00:49:46.840
Administration's been
keeping track of these things

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:53.030
but now 40 years-- been leveling
off during 2013 and 2014

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:58.010
without a recession,
without a global recession.

00:49:58.010 --> 00:50:00.610
In part as a result
of China's coal

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:02.640
use peaking in part
because emissions in the US

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:04.514
have been going down,
because we're switching

00:50:04.514 --> 00:50:09.282
from coal to natural gas and
renewables in energy efficiency

00:50:09.282 --> 00:50:11.115
about a third, a third,
a third contributing

00:50:11.115 --> 00:50:15.260
here in the US and
lots of other factors.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.610
And of course,
right, I'm obligated

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:23.450
to tell you that leveling
emissions isn't enough.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:26.550
Now we are filling the
bathtub at a steady rate.

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:30.300
But we are still filling
the atmospheric bathtub.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.550
Which is, by the way, one
of these-- in many ways--

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:37.990
very, very simple concepts
that when you, to be fair,

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:39.800
not explain it with
a bathtub analogy

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.240
but explain it in sort
of climate context,

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.720
you quiz 200 above average
MIT graduate students.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.570
They get that wrong.

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:51.660
They think that leveling
off emissions is the goal.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:53.160
When you think about
it as a bathtub

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.390
it's pretty darn obvious
that that's not the case.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:51:00.510
Your bathtub will still
overflow if you have kept

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:03.620
the inflow of water steady.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:08.610
What we have to do is
turn down the flow.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:11.700
Get to zero and even
below zero in order

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.820
to stabilize global
average temperatures.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.950
So it's a heavy, heavy lift.

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.510
That said, positive
examples-- well,

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:28.450
we've seen the US China
climate deal last November.

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:32.160
That in many ways no
one really expected.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.990
And yes, it is ambitious
yet achievable goals

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.240
for the two largest
economies, the two largest

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.640
emitters of CO2.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:43.215
And it was a clear
positive step forward.

00:51:43.215 --> 00:51:44.840
Well, for that matter,
very concretely.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.430
Right?

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:48.680
California eighth or ninth
largest economy on the planet

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.260
independently has
a cap on emissions,

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.800
has a price on CO2 as a result.

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:58.090
And emissions are going down.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.602
So it's certainly
not just Sweden.

00:51:59.602 --> 00:52:01.310
There are certainly
also some unexpected.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:05.050
And by the way, China and India
are, in fact, very unexpected.

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:07.430
The Climate bill,
Waxman-Markey Bill on page one

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:09.640
mentioned two countries.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.410
None of them was the US,
it was China, and India.

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:15.820
And it was in the context
of unless China and India,

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.659
we won't.

00:52:17.659 --> 00:52:19.200
Well, now you look
at China and India

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.307
and they are the ones, in fact,
taking some of these steps that

00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:23.890
are necessary.

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:28.450
Not enough, but still, steps
that are in fact pointing

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:30.860
in the right direction.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.060
Thank you.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.610
[APPLAUSE]
