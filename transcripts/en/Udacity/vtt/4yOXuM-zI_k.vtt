If you've gotten this far,
you've done some really cool stuff with

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.510
understanding the location and
context of your device.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.930
&gt;From the skills you've learned,

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.510
you'll be able to write applications
that know where your phone is,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.280
where it's going, and maybe even
how high off the ground it is.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.690
Now how about we take
it to the next level?

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
How about an app that tells you when
you enter or leave a specific location?

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.620
You could use this for
social checkings, or maybe,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.020
as a parent, you can use this
to tell when your kids get home.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.840
I've even seen games that use this,
where they virtually hide loot, and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.120
when you go to the real world location,
your device knows and can react.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.508
A great and easy way to implement
this is using a geofence.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.530
Simply, a geofence is
a location in latitude and

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.950
longitude, a radius around that location
and a time for which it's active.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.910
So for example,
you could put the latitude and

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.860
longitude of your lute stash.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.570
A radius of, say, ten meters and
data that is only active on weekends.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.500
The location APIs will take this and
when you exit or

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.030
enter that space, it can be used
to generate a notification.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.350
It's up to you, as a developer,
how you handle this.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.590
Does that sound exciting?

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.430
Well I think so.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.080
So let's dive in and learn how it works.
