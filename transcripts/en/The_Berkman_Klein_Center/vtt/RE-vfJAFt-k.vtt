00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.540
In this final segment of
the lecture, I will briefly

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.420
juxtapose the US fair use doctrine
with a few strategies adopted

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.860
outside the United States.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.370
Which of the available strategies makes
most sense is currently hotly debated.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.590
Many countries, for example, the
United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.420
are currently reviewing
their laws in this area.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.550
So the legal landscape may shift soon.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.620
In the meantime, you can and should
form your own opinions concerning

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.340
which of the approaches
I'll describe is optimal.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.090
 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.540
A few countries other
than the United States

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.000
have adopted general exceptions
to the rights of copyright owners

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.480
that resemble the fair use
doctrine in the United States.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.970
The Copyright Law of
Israel, for example,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.120
now contains a provision the closely
echoes section 107 of the US statute.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.420
As you can see, it adopts the
same ad hoc open-ended approach

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.750
as is used in the US, and indeed employs
more or less the same four factors.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.790
The Israeli provision does
however deviate from the US

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.480
approach in two respects.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.650
First, as you can see,
it omits any reference

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.740
to the commercial character
of the defendant's use,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.950
tacitly following the lead of the
US courts that in recent years

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.710
have, as we've seen, increasingly
demoted the commercial use sub factor.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.850
Second, the final section
of the Israeli provision

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.500
empowers the Minister of Justice to
quote "make regulations prescribing

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.050
conditions under which a use shall
be deemed a fair use" close quote.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.280
Thus far, apparently,
the Israeli government

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.940
has not exercised this power, but
it offers an intriguing possible way

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.030
in which the unpredictability
of fair use might be mitigated.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.930
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.600
The copyright law of Singapore contains
a similar position, factors A, B, C

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.980
and D, once again echo, as you
can see the components of fair use

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.740
in the United States,
but factor E is new.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.410
The instruction to consider
quote, "the possibility

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.680
of obtaining the work or
adaptation within a reasonable time

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.760
at an ordinary commercial
price," close quote,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.810
presumably will have the effect of
limiting the availability of fair use

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.220
somewhat, because it would
weaken the position of defendants

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.610
who could have obtained a license from
the plaintiff but refused to do so.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.400
This provision might also put
pressure on copyright owners

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.000
to collaborate in the
organization of a system,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.370
like the Copyright Clearance
Center in the United States,

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.620
designed to facilitate licensing.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.520
The net effect would be roughly
analogous to a compulsory licensing

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.510
system of the sort we have previously
considered in this series of lectures.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.780
A recent study by Roya
Ghafele and Benjamin Gilbert

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.237
of the impact of the adoption of this
approach on the economy of Singapore

00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:24.195
is broadly encouraging.

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:27.570
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.790
As we can see, these three variants of
fair use in the United States, Israel,

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.550
and Singapore are not identical,
but they share a basic approach.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.210
Give judges considerable power to decide
after considering various factors,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.610
whether a given putatively infringing
activity should be privileged.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.170
Radically different is the so-called
"enumerated exceptions approach."

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.370
The central principle of the
strategy is that instead,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.530
conferring on court's responsibility
to assess on an ad hoc basis defendants

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.550
assertions that they should
be excused for making

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.540
unauthorized uses of copyrighted
works, the legislature

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.100
should anticipate and provide
in advance for all circumstances

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.800
in which unauthorized
uses should be permitted.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.329
This approach has been adopted in a much
larger set of countries than fair use.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.510
It reigns in the European
Union, for example.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.080
As you can see, article five of the
EU's Information Society Directive

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.160
employs this approach.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.070
It identifies one exception
that member countries must adopt

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.960
and a long list of
exceptions, specifically

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.070
to the right of
reproduction and the right

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.370
to communicate or make works
available to the public, that

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.010
member countries may adopt.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.830
The list is exhaustive, meaning
member countries are not

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.740
obliged to recognize all of them,
but they may adopt a subset,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.500
but they may not recognize
more and they may not

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.655
adopt open-ended discretionary standards
like the US or Israeli approaches.

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:07.190
 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.350
Many of the activities
that, as we've seen,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.810
escape liability in the United
States on fair use grounds

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.050
are dealt with in specific
provisions in the EU's list.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.780
For example, parody here in
item 3-K, but other things

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.260
such as copying student essays verbatim
for the purpose of running a plagiarism

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.060
detection service that have
been able to pass muster

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.490
under fair use in the
United States are likely too

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.350
new or idiosyncratic to have
been anticipated in 2001 and thus

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.660
would be hard to justify
under the EU's approach.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.280
 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.860
China as you can see, adopts
the same general strategy.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.940
Article 22 of China's copyright
law contains a long list

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.100
of enumerated exceptions,
although shorter than the EU list.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.750
Some items are not surprising.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.350
For example, the ninth
exception for quote,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.210
"gratuitous live performances of a
published work for which no fees are

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.530
charged to the public, nor
payments are made to performers,"

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.060
echos a provision of the US statute.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.910
But others are more striking, for
example, the 10th exception which

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.780
privileges copying,
drawing, photographing,

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.210
or video recording of a work
of art put up or displayed

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.250
in an outdoor public space.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.880
That provision is, at least
on its face, much broader

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.470
than any analogous exception in
either the United States or the EU.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.530
Also remarkably expansive,
is the privilege

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.530
to translate quote, "a published work
of a Chinese citizen or legal entity

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.190
from Han language into minority
nationally languages for publication

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.940
and distribution in the country."

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.680
In sum, there are two polar
positions, the open-ended fair use

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.060
approach pursued in the United States,
and the enumerated exceptions approach

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.510
pursued in the EU, China,
and several other nations.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.100
In between these two
sets of countries is

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.620
another set that have adopted what
might be described as hybrid models.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.160
Typically, such hybrid systems
require a defendant first

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.220
to show that his behavior
falls into one on the list

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.790
of enumerated potential exceptions.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.230
These tend to be more general than
the type of specific exceptions found

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.400
in the enumerated approach.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.480
But a defendant who is able to fit
his activity into one of these boxes

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.400
is still not home free, he must
demonstrate that his conduct is also

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.850
justified on the basis
of a list of factors

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.330
that are analogous to those
employed in the United States.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:51.280
An extra element sometimes
found in such hybrid systems

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.410
is a requirement that
the defendant acknowledge

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.990
that he is taking material from
the plaintiff, in other words,

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.950
he give credit where credit is due.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.780
The result is to import into
the fair dealing analysis

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.740
a bit of the right of attribution
that as we've seen more commonly

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.110
is treated as a form of moral right.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.720
The United States, as yet,
has no such requirement

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.960
and many defendants, who have given
the plaintiffs no credit whatsoever,

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.340
have successfully invoked the fair
use defense in the United States.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.220
One of the many possible
implications of the cultural theory

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.340
we'll take up next week
is a reconsideration

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.600
of the US position on this point.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.950
In other words, the possibility
of according greater recognition

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:43.000
to the principle of attribution
here in the fair use setting

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.590
or in other settings.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.020
So where is this hybrid approach found?

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.970
The United Kingdom, as
you can see currently

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.350
employs such a system, although it may
make some dramatic changes to its law

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.430
soon.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.710
Canada's does as well,
although it too is considering

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.610
further liberalization of its approach.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.710
Australia, New Zealand, and
Taiwan have analogous setups.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.600
So we turn to the general question.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.880
Which of these strategies is best?

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.910
This issue is often
addressed as if it were

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.820
purely a question of optimal legal form.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.140
So conceived the question of
the optimal fair use approach

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.470
is a variant of an age old
debate in legal theory.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.810
Fair use, the US system, is an example
of a type of legal norm commonly known

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.680
as a "standard."

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.880
While the enumerated exceptions
approach is an example

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.420
of a type of legal norm known,
somewhat confusingly, as a "rule."

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.480
A standard, within this
literature, is a norm

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.020
that makes direct reference
to policy objectives.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.740
For example, the best interests
of the child in family law,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.580
or the avoidance of unjust
enrichment in contract law.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.280
And then leaves judges
or other officials

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.060
lots of discretion in deciding
how best to accomplish

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.505
those ends when resolving
particular disputes.

00:10:09.505 --> 00:10:12.040
 

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.870
A rule, by contrast,
constraints discretion.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.200
It requires judges or other officials
to respond in a determinant way

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.090
to specific sets of readily
ascertainable variables.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:29.320
So for example, a norm that
declared that only wise persons are

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.430
eligible to be president
of the United States

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.760
would be a standard, because it would
require judges or other decision

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.180
makers to make judgments
concerning whether candidates

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.080
are, all things considered, wise.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.940
By contrast a norm that declared,
as it does in the United States,

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.070
that only persons over the
age of 35 may be president

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:57.590
is a rule because it leaves decision
makers very little discretion.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.620
Standards and rules,
it is widely believed,

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.580
have characteristic
advantages and disadvantages.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.580
For examples, standards are more
flexible, but also more unpredictable.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:13.840
Rules are more predictable, and less
conducive to corruption or bias,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.570
but they are also inevitably both
under-inclusive and over-inclusive.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:25.480
In other words, they will fail to
advance policy goals as precisely

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.950
as well administered standards.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.730
So which of the two
types of norm is better?

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.845
The standard answer is
that it varies by context.

00:11:36.845 --> 00:11:39.920
 

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.180
Much of the current debate
about what to do about fair use

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.320
uses this same framework.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.020
Should we have more ruleness?

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:49.520
I.e.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.670
Move closer to the EU
enumerated approach.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.220
Or should we have more standardness?

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:55.720
I.e.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.260
Move closer to the US fair use approach.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.440
Scholars who argue about
the issue in these terms

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.900
draw on many of the
considerations that figure

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.190
in the more general
rule-standards debate.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.860
 

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:16.190
But framing the issue in these terms
misses two dimensions of the problem.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:21.180
First, the enumerated exceptions
approach exemplified by the EU

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.610
is less rule-like than it might appear.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.720
As Bernt Hugenholtz
and Martin Senftleben

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.790
have shown in a recent paper,
the information society directive

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.900
that we examined a few minutes
ago permits more discretion

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.460
than it might seem.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.000
Not only do countries
enjoy latitude when

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.170
incorporating elements of
this list into their own laws,

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.750
but they can and sometimes do
formulate their national laws

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.320
in ways that confer on judges
some degree of discretion.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.370
For example, the Swedish Copyright
Act, as Hugenholtz points out,

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:04.640
interprets provision 53D to permit
the quotation of published works quote,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.680
"in accordance with proper usage and to
the extent necessary for the purpose,"

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.260
close quote.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.340
That construction intentionally gives
judges a fair amount of latitude

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.640
when deciding whether a particular
defendant has gone too far.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.400
Similarly, the Canadian courts
have stretched the categories

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.230
of their fair dealing system
considerably with the result

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:29.600
it operates in practice, more
like US fair use than it appears.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.340
In short, characterizing the
choice among these systems

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.495
as a choice between rules and
standards is to some degree inaccurate.

00:13:36.495 --> 00:13:39.760
 

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.930
Second, and more fundamentally,
on reflection the US system

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.676
is not so clearly a standard.

00:13:48.676 --> 00:13:53.070
A standard you'll recall,
identifies a policy goal

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.520
and then gives judges
discretion in advancing it.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.610
That's not really what the fair use
doctrine in the United States does.

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:07.260
Rather, it identifies some factors that
judges should consider, but doesn't

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.920
tell the judges why
those factors matter.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.290
The law does not, in
other words, identify

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:17.500
the substantive goal of
the system as a whole.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.830
The result is that judges
in the United States

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.730
are forced to decide for themselves
what copyright law should

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.780
be trying to achieve.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:31.950
Maximize social welfare, reward authors
fairly, protect person-hood interests--

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.850
as we've seen all of those
are possible aspirations

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:39.950
for copyright law, which one
is your primary concern will

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.670
make a big difference in
how the statutory fair use

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:46.210
factors are construed and applied.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:49.540
Judges in the United
States disagree concerning

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.130
fundamental purposes of copyright.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.570
It should thus not be
surprising that as a result

00:14:55.570 --> 00:15:01.960
they disagree concerning how fair
use should be construed and applied.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.270
Seen this way, the current fair
use doctrine in the United States

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.210
is worse than a standard,
because it does not clearly

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.680
articulate a normative criterion--
a goal, or set of goals-- the judges

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.120
when deciding individual cases,
should strive to promote.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.290
We ought to be able to
do better than that.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:28.248
One possible route to a better regime
will be considered in the next lecture.

00:15:28.248 --> 00:15:28.747
