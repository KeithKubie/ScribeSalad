00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.100
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.320
is talk about congressional roles.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.106
Now, what do I mean by
congressional roles?

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:11.470
Well, whether someone is a member of

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.640
the house of representatives,
or the senate,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.730
or even one of the state legislatures,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.800
there's different ways that they can act

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.570
on behalf of the people
that they are representing.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.310
One way is to just be a delegate.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.990
And that's to say, okay,
what would my people

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.810
that I'm trying to
represent want me to do,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.780
and then to do exactly that.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.560
The other role is to be a trustee.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.440
And this is the idea of,
well there's some issues

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.990
where either the people in my
district don't have an opinion

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.050
or maybe if they
superficially looked at it

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.660
they would want to vote one way,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.710
but I, as a representative, as a trustee,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.890
I can dig a little bit
deeper into the nuances

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.930
and realize what's actually
better for the people

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.860
that I represent, or for
a country as a whole.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.000
So, one way to think about it,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.720
a delegate would get a sense of the people

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.140
that they represent, and
what they would want,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.070
and just do that.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.380
While a trustee would say,
okay what do I believe is best

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.360
either for the people
that I'm representing

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.050
or for the country as a whole.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.670
And sometimes they
obviously could coincide.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.845
And the third type of role is politico.

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:21.610
Now, the everyday definition
for politico is a politician.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.060
And sometimes it's used in
the not-so-favorable sense.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.660
But in the context of,
especially in a government class,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.260
a politico is a representative who does

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.760
a little bit of both
depending on the situation.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.280
If there's something that the
people that they represent

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.180
care a lot about, something
that the constituents

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.980
care a lot about, well
there they would say,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.010
okay, you know what, I'm just gonna vote

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.950
the way they want me to vote,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.560
even if I don't necessarily agree with it,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.090
because it matters to them a lot,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.227
so there I'm gonna be a delegate.

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:48.470
But on the things that really matter to me

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.910
or that don't matter so
much to my constituents,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.920
well, there I'm going to be a trustee.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.520
So you could view a politico
as a bit of a hybrid.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.210
So with that out of the way,
let's look at some scenarios,

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.180
and think about whether
these are describing

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.543
a representative as a delegate,
a trustee, or a politico.

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:08.238
So let's start with this first one.

00:02:08.238 --> 00:02:11.750
It says, there is a vote on a bill in the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.500
House of Representatives that
would increase environmental

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.820
regulations on major businesses.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.110
Several citizens in Illinois'
9th congressional district

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.260
have contacted their
representative to influence him

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.430
to vote in favor of the bill.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.610
However, Representative Wallin thinks that

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.290
these regulations will cost
businesses too much money,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.020
which will lead businesses
to firing his constituents,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.700
so he decides to vote against it.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.100
So pause this video, and so,
is Representative Way-lin,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.360
or Wall-in, acting as a delegate,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.210
a trustee, or a politico?

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.070
So the key clues here are,
that Representative Way-lin,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.760
or Wall-in, decides to
vote against the bill

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.260
despite the fact that
some of his constituents

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.860
have contacted him to
vote in favor of the bill.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.030
And so here is clearly acting
based on his own beliefs,

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.970
so he is acting as a trustee.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.390
He's doing what he thinks is
best for his constituents,

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.870
even though they might not agree with him.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.420
Let's look at another scenario.

00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:22.250
In the Senate, there is a vote on a bill

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.390
that would eliminate the penny.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.110
Citizens in Indiana reach
out to their Senator

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.930
to encourage her to support the bill.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.190
Even though Senator Portela thinks

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.250
the penny is incredibly useful,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.960
she decides to vote for the bill.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.450
So pause this video, think about

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.610
how is Senator Portela acting?

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.620
As a delegate, trustee, or politico?

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.280
Well, it's pretty clear that she's doing

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.360
exactly what her
constituents want her to do.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.550
The constituents are encouraging her

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.930
to support the bill
and she votes the bill.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.510
And she's doing this despite what

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.530
she thinks is the better option.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.790
Even though she likes the penny,

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.270
she's going to vote to eliminate the penny

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.220
because that's what her constituents want.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.870
So she is clearly acting as a delegate.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.290
And to be clear, and
this is often the case,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.348
many times the representative will agree

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:12.390
with their constituents
and then in that situation

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.290
they're acting as both a
delegate and a trustee.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.090
Now let's look at one more scenario.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.100
There are two major bills up for a vote

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.820
in the Indiana state senate.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.020
One bill will change the
name of a high school

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.430
in Indianapolis to Larry Bird High School.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.210
The other bill would set aside 100-acres

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.580
for a new state park.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.620
Senator Kamath has
received about 1200 calls

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.270
from her constituents asking her

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.700
to support the bill to
rename the high school,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.810
but no calls about the park bill.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.630
Senator Kamath is incredibly
passionate about parks,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.930
but has not decided her vote

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.870
on the renaming of the high school.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.980
Senator Kamath decides to vote
in favor of the park bill,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.460
using her better judgement
to decide her vote,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.050
and in favor of changing
the name of the high school

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.140
to represent her constituents' interests.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.410
So you, once again,
should pause this video,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.310
and figure out is Senator Kamath acting

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.350
as a delegate, trustee, or politico?

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.030
Well, you can see on the park
bill, which she supports,

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.510
so she votes in favor of the park bill.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.270
She does that because that's
just what she thinks is better,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.316
she's using her better judgement.

00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:19.060
So in that scenario she's
acting as a trustee.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.930
She's doing what she thinks is right.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.570
And then on the naming the high school

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.100
Larry Bird High School,

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.390
there she just says, hey, you know what,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.870
I don't have a strong opinion of it,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.530
I am just going to represent
my constituents interests.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.960
And so there she's clearly
acting as a delegate.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.860
And so the scenario where
sometimes you act as a delegate,

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.366
sometimes you act as a trustee,

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:42.168
this is sometimes categorized,
or often categorized,

00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:45.140
especially in a government
class, as a politico,

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.650
which as I mentioned before
is really just a term

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.650
often used for a politician.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.280
And you can imagine it's very natural

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.270
for a politician to
sometimes act as a delegate,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.920
hey I've got to make
my constituents happy,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.900
let me do exactly what they want me to do.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.040
But every now and then
my constituents either

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.170
might not care about an issue,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.520
or they might not realize
all of the details

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.120
or all of the implecations,
and so I might do something

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.620
that's maybe not exactly what they want.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.410
And in those scenarios,
well then I'm just gonna,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.950
I'm just gonna vote my conscience.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.448
And if I do a little bit of both,

00:06:12.448 --> 00:06:14.122
on different types of issues,

00:06:14.122 --> 00:06:16.210
well then I'm acting as a politico.
