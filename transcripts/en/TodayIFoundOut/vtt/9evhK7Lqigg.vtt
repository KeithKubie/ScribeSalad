00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:13.830
The US Plan to Invade Canadа

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.609
A time-honored tradition in the U.S. military,
contingency plans have been drawn up for the

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.180
defense against, and invasion of, most major
military powers.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.619
In fact, in response to recent events on the
Korean peninsula, the U.S. and South Korea

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.270
recently signed on to such a plan.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.580
One of the most interesting episodes in this
rich history of preparing for things that

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.640
will probably never happen came when Uncle
Sam planned to invade Johnny Canuck.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.899
Early Planning

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.050
In the years leading up to World War II, beginning
in fact in the 1920s, the army began planning

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.499
for wars with a variety of countries, designating
each plan by a different color: Germany (black),

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:59.829
Japan (orange), Mexico (green) and England
(red); as a dominion of Great Britain, Canada

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.170
(crimson) was presumed to be loyal to England,
and thus was included in the plan against

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.250
a supposed British invasion (not to be confused
with that of the 1960s).

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.940
The paranoid U.S. military strategists who
devised War Plan Red believed that if the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.110
Britain and America were to battle again,
it would begin from a trade dispute.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.150
Whatever the cause, army planners anticipated
that any war with England would be prolonged,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.640
not only because of British and Canadian tenacity,
but also from the fact that Britain could

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.740
draw manpower and resources from its empire,
including at that time Australia, Hong Kong,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.590
India, Kenya, New Zealand, Nigeria, Palestine,
South Africa and Sudan.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.369
Canadian Invasion Plan

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.689
Different versions of the plan were proposed,
and one was first approved in 1930 by the

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.689
War Department.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.270
It was updated in 1934-1935, and, of course,
never implemented.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.119
Although it was far reaching and addressed
some of Britain’s greatest strengths, such

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.659
as the Royal Navy, one of the chief areas
of concern was the U.S.’s long border with

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.659
Canada.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.690
As a result, the plan addressed our northern
neighbors with great detail, to wit:

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.100
British Columbia

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.550
With its vital naval base, military strategists
planned a naval attack on Victoria, launched

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.610
from Port Angeles, Washington, as well as
a combined assault on Vancouver and its island.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.580
Successful occupation of this area would effectively
cut off Canada from the Pacific.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.580
Manitoba

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.620
The central hub for the Canadian railway system
was located in Manitoba’s capital city,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.510
Winnipeg; army strategists felt that a land
assault could easily be launched from Grand

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.260
Forks, North Dakota, and Canada’s rail lines
neutralized.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.290
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.730
Military planners apparently hoped to stun
the Maritime Provinces with a poison gas attack

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.110
on Nova Scotia’s capital city, Halifax,
then also home to a major naval base.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.610
The chemical battle would then be followed
by a sea invasion at St. Margaret’s Bay.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.570
It that didn’t work, an overland invasion
and occupation of New Brunswick would, hopefully,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.900
isolate the valuable seaports of Nova Scotia
from the remainder of Canada, effectively

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.810
stopping British resupply of its forces.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.810
Ontario

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.410
A three-pronged attack, arising from Buffalo,
Detroit and Sault Ste.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.290
Marie would gain control of the Great Lakes
for the U.S.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.950
In addition to causing a crushing blow to
British supply lines, it would allow the United

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.570
States to control most of Canada’s industrial
production.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.570
Quebec

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.920
An overland attack launching from adjacent
New York and Vermont was planned.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.620
Control of this French-speaking province would,
when combined with control of the Maritime

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.180
Provinces, stop Britain from having any entry
point to the remainder of the country from

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.730
the Eastern seaboard.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.400
Revelation of the Plan

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.370
Although it was declassified in 1974, portions
of the plan were inadvertently leaked long

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.370
before.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.940
During what was supposed to be classified
testimony by military brass to the House Military

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.230
Affairs Committee, two generals revealed some
of the details of War Plan Red.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.420
That testimony was mistakenly published in
official reports, which were picked up and

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.730
printed by the New York Times.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.280
Also revealed in the New York Times was the
fact that the United States Congress had assigned

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:27.070
$57 million in 1935 (nearly $1 billion today)
in order to build three air bases near the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.310
U.S./Canadian border in line with War Plan
Red’s recommendations, in case the U.S.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.040
needed to defend against or attack Canada.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.900
These air bases were supposed to be disguised
as civilian airports, but the Government Printing

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.280
Office accidentally reported the existence
of the air bases on May 1 of 1935, blowing

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.320
their cover.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.810
Interestingly, War Plan Red’s recommendations
also proposed that the U.S. not just invade

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.310
in such a war with Britain and Canada, but
take over, adding any conquered regions as

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.250
states to the United States.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.960
The Sad History of Americans Invading Canada
Badly

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.900
Americans have a history of underestimating
the Canadians:

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.970
Revolutionary War

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.720
In September 1775, Benedict Arnold (when he
was still on our side) led an unsuccessful

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.900
assault on Quebec City overland through difficult
Maine wilderness; over 40% of Arnold’s men

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.990
were lost making the attempt, and yet, inexplicably,
he was promoted to Brigadier General.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.510
War of 1812

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.120
During the second war with Britain, Thomas
Jefferson opined that to occupy Canada was

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.190
a “mere matter of marching” for U.S. troops.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.760
Yet attacks in the Old Northwest, across the
Niagara River, and north from Lake Champlain,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.490
all failed.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.700
Proxy “War” for Ireland

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.551
Over a period of five years from 1866 to 1872,
Irish Catholics from the U.S. engaged in a

00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:59.120
series of raids on Canadian targets, including
forts and customs houses.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.540
Known as the Fenian raids, the Fenian Brotherhood
had hoped that their actions would force the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.500
British to withdraw from Ireland.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.950
They were unsuccessful.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.380
Post Cold War

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.040
In 1995, Michael Moore created a fictional
war between the United States and Canada in

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.230
the comedy, Canadian Bacon.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.360
Like the real-life Americans who went before
them, the fictional invasion in this farcical

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.040
political commentary failed.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.669
What Comes Around Goes Around

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.590
Before you get the idea that only Americans
are aggressive bastards, you should know that

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:37.570
the Canadians had developed a plan to invade
the United States before the U.S. ever started

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.730
on its scheme.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.460
Characterized as a counterattack, the 1921
plan more accurately resembles a preemptive

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.460
war.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.560
The brainchild of Lieutenant Colonel Buster
Sutherland Brown of the Canadian Army, the

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.130
plan called for a surprise attack on the U.S.
as soon as the Canadians had “evidence”

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.270
that America was planning an invasion; it
was felt that a preemptive strike was required,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.410
as it would be the only way Canada could prevail
in a battle with its larger, southern neighbor,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.490
which benefited from a far greater arsenal
and much more manpower.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.470
Other advantages of the quick strike included
the fact that the war would be fought on American

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:21.410
territory, so losses in civilian life and
infrastructure would be borne by the Americans.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:26.410
Finally, the colonel thought this plan would
best buy the Canadians time for their allies,

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:32.190
the British, to come to their rescue before
the Americans could launch an effective counterstrike.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.010
It’s always the quiet ones
