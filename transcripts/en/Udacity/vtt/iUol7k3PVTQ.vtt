00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.700
At the top of the course viewer, where

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.900
you're watching this video, you'll see a progress bar.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.630
It looks something like this. As you go along,

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.180
watching a course, the videos that you have already

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.960
watched will turn blue as you pass them. Videos that you're currently

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.325
watching are orange. Videos that you haven't watched yet remain shaded

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:26.130
out in gray. You might notice that some videos have dots in them.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.410
These dots indicate the presence of quizzes at the

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.890
end of the video. The dot changes from white

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.620
to blue after you've completed it. If you skip

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.570
the quiz, the dot remains white. This reminds you

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750
to go back and complete the quiz when you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.990
have time. You can go to any video segment

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.140
of the course by clicking directly in the progress

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.110
bar on the section that you want to visit.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.050
Let's go back to the classroom to the software development course

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.790
to demonstrate the progress bar. Notice that when you hover over each

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.830
section, you can see the names of the videos. There's also

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.360
a drop-down menu, where you can toggle between lessons in the course.
