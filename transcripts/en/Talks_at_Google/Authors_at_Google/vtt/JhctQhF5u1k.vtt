[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.950
AMY BLANKSON: Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.491
Thank you so much
for having me here.

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:11.360
This is such a privilege to get
to be your first speaker here

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.880
in this new, awesome
space and to get to spend

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.196
the afternoon with you.

00:00:15.196 --> 00:00:16.820
We're going to have
a lot of fun today.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.340
And I have a few
experiments up my sleeve

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.220
that I'm looking forward
to subjecting you to.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.440
And I also have some
information that I really

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.810
am hoping to share and
convey to you, some of which

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.600
you may already know
or you might already

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.252
feel validates who you are.

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:32.960
And some of the
information which I think

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.150
might challenge you or
be great information

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.060
to share with those of your
colleagues, friends, and family

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.280
members who weren't
able to be here today.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.910
So I want to start off
with one statement that's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.070
really beginning to challenge.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.260
It was the beginning
and the genesis

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.970
of what caused me
to write my book

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.380
on "The Future of Happiness."

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.360
And it was a statement
I read that said,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.720
technology is the greatest
disruptor of happiness

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.270
in human history.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.230
And is that really true?

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.040
We hear news from
multiple different sources

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.740
about how technology is the
equivalent of digital heroin.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700
How there is screen
time that's eroding

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.490
the fabric of our society
and ruining our relationships

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.755
with our grandparents.

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:17.660
But some of this
information comes

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.400
from a sensationalized source.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.640
And so I wanted to delve into,
what is the truth about this?

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.070
I come from a background in
positive psychology, which

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.050
is an odd place to
come to technology.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.810
Most people think that
technology and happiness

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.152
are actually oxymorons.

00:01:32.152 --> 00:01:33.860
But I think that
there's something really

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.990
important to be said for
the time and the place

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.270
that we're living in
that requires us to think

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.520
a little bit more
deeply about how we're

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.290
living in the digital age.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.830
How can we live with greater
happiness and mindfulness

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.640
in the digital age?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.730
Is this even possible, or is
it truly the greatest disrupter

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.980
of happiness in human history?

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.080
In the past 10
years, we have found

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.920
that technology has sped up
so dramatically that we find

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.610
ourselves overwhelmed and
unprepared for the challenges

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.990
that we face today.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.620
We find that since the
iPhone came out in 2007,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.289
we're now about a decade
out from the first iPhone,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.580
that the world has
changed dramatically.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.540
We have technology that
would have blown our minds 10

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.290
years ago, from FaceTime
to 3D printed organs that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.610
are saving lives.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.490
And yet at the same time, we're
finding that depression rates

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.960
have doubled in that
same period of time,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.670
that the amount of cyberbullying
has gone up by 88% just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.430
in the last five years
alone, and that the number

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.490
of repetitive stress injuries
for teenagers visiting

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.920
the chiropractor-- teenagers--

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.500
have gone up by 50%.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.234
That's from a lot of this.

00:02:41.234 --> 00:02:42.650
And I think that
it's interesting,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.260
and it's changing the way
that we're thinking about how

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.970
are we as a society evolving?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.510
What does that mean for us,
not only physiologically,

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.220
but also emotionally.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.450
What is this doing
to our happiness?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.760
Now don't be alarmed.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.990
I know I'm in a tech space.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.942
I love Google.

00:02:57.942 --> 00:02:59.900
And I think that it's
important to reassure you

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.474
that I'm not anti-tech,
that I'm also not going

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.890
to tell you that
you need to throw

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.390
your phones out the window.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.710
I'm actually a huge
fan of technology.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.950
I believe it has
so much potential.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.810
But part of my
mission and my message

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.020
is to help us use technology
in our personal lives,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.300
as well as their
professional lives, in a way

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.820
that fosters mindfulness,
in a way that

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.760
elevates our emotional
well-being and our happiness

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.489
for the long run.

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.030
Because I believe that the path
that we are setting ourselves

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.700
on right now, right
here today, is

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.160
what's going to determine
how we feel in the future

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.590
and what our world
looks like today.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.440
Currently, what we struggle
with is overwhelming

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.760
social media feed.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.470
We have news coming
from all sources.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.480
Our Twitter feed is
constantly coming in.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.647
You've got e-mails that
are probably piling up

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:45.980
while you listen to me talk
about not being stressed out

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:46.563
by technology.

00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:47.075
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:49.130
And you have to go back
and answer all of them.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.094
We have Netflix feeds that are
now creating a backlog of shows

00:03:54.094 --> 00:03:55.760
that we're going to
have to catch up on,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.920
because they're releasing
all the episodes at once.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.080
And these things begin
to stress us out,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.450
even though they're things
that make us happy, even

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.866
though they're
things are supposed

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:05.540
to drive our productivity.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.120
We find ourselves feeling
more and more overwhelmed,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.430
frustrated, and
unprepared for how

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.492
to deal with the onslaught
of information in our lives.

00:04:13.492 --> 00:04:15.200
So the question that
I want to pose today

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.720
is, can our happiness
and our health

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.870
keep pace with the
speed of innovation?

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.370
And I think that
the question really

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.430
comes down to a bit of
self-awareness on our own part.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.850
Oftentimes we'll feel like
victims of distraction,

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.010
that somebody keeps texting you
when you're trying to focus,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.430
that so and so keeps
sending your messages

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.070
that you don't care about,
that you're getting bulk email

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.740
messages or junk mail or
junk phone calls that you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.340
have to deal with.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.740
But the truth is that
sometimes we actually

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.150
invite those distractions
into our lives.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.436
How many times have you
ever been in a conversation

00:04:49.436 --> 00:04:50.810
with a friend
where you're having

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.140
this really deep, important
conversation, and all

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.056
of a sudden you hear
a beep, and they say,

00:04:56.056 --> 00:04:57.180
oh, excuse me for a minute.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.630
I got to get out my phone
and check this message.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.630
And your moment of
quality time is lost.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.650
Those moments
happen all the time.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.260
And get a load of this--

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.670
there was a survey
done recently,

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.610
a national survey of smartphone
users, that asked people

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.310
how often it's OK to
pick up their phone.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.170
And not surprisingly,
about half of people

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.419
said it was OK to pick up
their phone during dinner.

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.710
About half the people-- it's
a little more surprising--

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.250
say that they will pick up
their phone in the bathroom.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.360
Get this, a third of
people, a third of people

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.880
said it's OK to pick up
their phone during sex.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.130
I think this is the moment
in which I realized, OK, we

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.120
have a problem.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.800
We've got to talk about this.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.300
There's something
going on where we

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.430
feel like we need to be
needed, where it feels so good,

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.550
and so addictive,
other people find

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.240
our attention valuable, that
they need to constantly come

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.080
after us.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.110
And there's a reason why we
continue to feed into it.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.410
So what is that, and what is it
doing to our emotional state?

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.500
What I find happening, from a
positive psychology standpoint,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.060
is that so often we are chasing
after this emotional high

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.440
that we are literally running
ourselves off of what I

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.250
call the happiness cliff.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.890
And the happiness
cliff is that moment

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.230
when you are surfing
your Facebook feed,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.870
and you're really enjoying
connecting with your friends

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.900
and your family members.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.180
Seeing oh, that cute
kid just started school.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.180
And oh, this really
important article

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.250
just came out that I
need to check in on.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.070
About 30 minutes in,
you're still surfing,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.600
and you don't even know why.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.960
An hour, an hour and
a half, there you are.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.730
And what happens
is that we cross

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.050
the point of what I call the
point of diminishing return,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.180
which is that point
at which we passed

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.850
our maximum utility
for using technology

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.226
to increase our productivity,
and then we went off the edge.

00:06:39.226 --> 00:06:41.350
So that point, actually,
if you look at this graph,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.183
it's really interesting
to me that the point

00:06:43.183 --> 00:06:46.890
of highest productivity comes
before the peak of the curve.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.840
But the point at
which people realize

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.530
that they've fallen
off the cliff

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.320
is way on the other
side of the curve.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.680
So what I'm going to do is
to help you think through

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.100
how do I recognize both,
in terms of emotion

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.080
and through my
physical body, how

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.590
do I recognize that point
of maximum productivity,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.230
and then be able to
train myself to stop

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.330
before I fall off the cliff?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.010
And that's a skill
set that I think

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.515
that we're just now beginning
to develop and emerge with.

00:07:13.515 --> 00:07:15.390
Because these are
challenges that we've never

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.820
had to deal with before.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.560
We're in an area where
we've never had boundaries

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.360
that we had to create for this.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.170
And all of a sudden, we as
a society are recognizing,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.490
OK, I think it might be
time for some boundaries.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.480
I feel that.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.230
I just don't know
what to do about it.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.830
So what I want to do is to
bring you to positive psychology

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.620
and some of the time tested
strategies and principles

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.275
that we learned from
the field that I

00:07:36.275 --> 00:07:39.360
think can be really, really
helpful to understanding what's

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.040
going on in your
own mind and body

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.850
and what you can do about it.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.099
So how many of you
grew up in the '80s?

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:46.890
Raise your hand if you
grew up in the '80s.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.740
Then you might be familiar
with this old ad that used

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.540
to be part of the war on drugs.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.020
It said this is your brain.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.454
This is your brain on drugs.

00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:55.370
This is my take on it.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.380
This is your brain on too much
technology, where you literally

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.710
have fried it by letting it sit
on your computer for too long.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.200
So that's the mental
image of what happens.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.810
I also like to use the
analogy of a sunburn.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.300
And a lot of people say,
well, how long would

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.030
you recommend that people
should be on computers?

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.130
Like, the American
Academy of Pediatrics

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.460
now advises or used to
advise that children

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.730
between the ages of two and ten
spent no more than two hours

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.050
on computers a day.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.850
And over time, they
started to change that.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.560
Well, you know if they're in
school that doesn't count.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.400
Or if they're talking to family
members, that doesn't count.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.860
What we're finding is there's
a lot of gray area in there

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.429
for what is acceptable
for time on the computer.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.820
And not everybody hits the point
of frying upon their computer

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.979
at the same point.

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.520
Just in the same
way that some people

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.480
sunburn at different rates.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.570
My skin is pretty fair.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.310
I know I sunburn pretty much
every time I walk outside.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.900
My husband has a
much darker skin,

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.889
and he can handle
a lot more sun.

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:52.680
But what's happened
over time is we've both

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.638
learned our own bodies.

00:08:53.638 --> 00:08:55.980
We know that I have
to use sunscreen.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.900
I know when I'm feeling
burned and that it's

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.990
time to deal with it.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.323
And my husband knows that he
can just go outside and not

00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:02.910
even have to worry about it.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.310
Those biological
symptoms become so

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.190
crucial to shaping
my behavior, changing

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.910
what I'm doing with by
preventative measures

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.106
as well as recognizing
signs and symptoms.

00:09:14.106 --> 00:09:15.480
And so I think
what we need to do

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.580
is start recognizing,
when does our egg start

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.930
frying on the laptop?

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.050
What is that point?

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.340
And how do we get away from
it when we hit that point?

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.480
You might think well,
what's so bad about it.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.780
I mean, I might play around
the edges a little bit

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.060
now and then.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.510
I might even have to be
on my computer for work.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.930
So I can't cut
back on the amount

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.900
of time I'm on the screen.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.400
Let me share with you the impact
or destruction in our lives

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.020
that's emerge, in
the past 10 years.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.800
In the year 2013, The
National Information Center

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.160
for Biotechnology reported
that the human attention span

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.859
has now dropped below
that of a goldfish,

00:09:50.859 --> 00:09:51.900
below that of a goldfish.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.570
A goldfish's attention
span is nine seconds,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.140
and a human attention
span is now eight seconds.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.940
Now just let that
sink in for a moment.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.917
It's crazy.

00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:01.625
What that means--

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:02.249
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:03.390
--for us-- whoops.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.681
Let me pause that for a second.

00:10:05.786 --> 00:10:08.017
Talk about distraction.

00:10:08.017 --> 00:10:09.600
What that means for
us is that there's

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.490
some really key
information for us

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.560
that we need to
process about what that

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.160
means when we get distracted.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.240
And so to show you what
distraction does to our mind,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.980
I want to show you
this two minute clip.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.540
It's really fun
and entertaining,

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.240
and it'll give you a snippet of
an idea about what destruction

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.930
does to us.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.850

and let you see this.

00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:48.429
- All right.

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:49.295
OK.

00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:51.042

- OK.

Now, Sarah could have selected
any card at all from the deck.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.660
But she selected the card which
is now face down on the table.

in fact, the three of diamonds.

OK, excellent choice.

AMY BLANKSON: Awesome.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.260
So this, for me, is such
a great illustration

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.410
of how our attention
and our focus works.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.220
What we're finding is
that, if you pay attention

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.380
to all the things
that are distracting,

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.219
your brain literally
has no power left

00:13:30.219 --> 00:13:31.760
with which to process
the things that

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.449
are meaningful within
your environment.

00:13:33.449 --> 00:13:34.990
So you're taught
that, in this video,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.550
it cues you to focus
on the cards, right?

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.010
And you feel so
tricked at the end.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.940
Like, I can't believe it.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.280
Did anyone, by the way, see
any of the color changes

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.502
before I explained it?

00:13:44.502 --> 00:13:45.710
I heard a couple of snickers.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.390
I heard some people
were getting it.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.490
So that's awesome, right?

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:53.120
But the ability to see the
bigger picture is so important.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.770
Because attention has
everything to do with intention.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.870
And if you're not
focusing on intention,

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.850
you can't pay attention
to the things around you.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.150
And so that is what
mindful living is all about

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.230
in the digital era.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.030
How do we get beyond
the distractions

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.940
so that we can focus in on
what is really happening

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.590
and the bigger picture?

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.100
Or to put it in another
way, one of the statistics

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.600
that I came across
in my research

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.860
was that the average text
message takes about 2.2 seconds

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.620
to come into your phone.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.570
And that 2.2 seconds,
what we see happen

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.720
is that the error
rates get doubled.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.880
2.2 seconds, you
double your error rate

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.890
on simple tasks like adding.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.900
If you have a text
message that you send,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.270
which takes an average
of 3.3 seconds,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.400
it triples your error rates.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.430
Now imagine the impact of
that on your productivity.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.400
Get this, beyond that, every
time you get distracted

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.370
by your phone it takes
approximately 11 minutes

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.650
to return to the focus on the
task you were doing before.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.790
So that text message that's now
doubled your error messages,

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.370
has now stolen 11 minutes
of your productivity

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.550
that you could have been doing
other things with in your life.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.160
So how do we get over that?

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.160
A lot of people immediately
turn to a digital detox.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.620
I feel so saturated with
technology in my life,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.650
I just need to get away from
it all for a little bit.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.360
Now, that strategy
is very effective

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.100
if you want to simply detox.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.010
But what we found is
that just like in diets,

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.880
short term diets ultimately fail
because they're only short term

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.910
interventions.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.840
And I think what we need to do
is be able to create patterns

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.420
in our life for dealing
with technology in a way

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.210
that we can live alongside it,
that not only makes us happier

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.720
while we're in the process,
but will make us happier

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.550
for the long run as well.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.190
Because just like the cavemen
who discovered fire back

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.100
in the day, right, they
knew it was dangerous.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.860
But nobody once suggested,
let's get rid of fire.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.420
I think fire is a
really bad idea.

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.550
It burned me the last
time I touched it.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.340
No, you simply learn how to
use the tool better so that you

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.190
can then be able to take
advantage of the power that

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.150
comes with it.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.980
And that's my approach
to technology.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.530
If we're able to begin to
use this tool for its best

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.540
and highest purposes,
then we'll be

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.910
able to capture the
power for ourselves

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.220
as opposed to getting burned.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.200
So the key here, we've
got to figure out

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.330
how do we stop using
technology to zone out,

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.600
and how do we use it to
start tuning in on our life?

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.058
Because I really
sense that there's

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:17.750
this bifurcation
[? that it has ?]

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.250
that technology is
either one or the other.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.590
There's no middle ground here.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.300
Either it's causing
us to move away

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.010
from our goals and
our priorities,

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.530
or it's helping us
move closer to them.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:30.200
And so I have five strategies I
want to share with you briefly

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.700
today.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.380
But I'll give you some takeaways
that you can just immediately

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.200
put into action in your own
life that are very simple,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.360
but I think are very
eye opening as well.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.670
And the first one is
to know your stats.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.580
Now the average smartphone
user checks their phone

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.250
150 times a day.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.930
Now you may think, well,
I don't check my phone

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:49.820
100-- there's no way.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.010
That's crazy talk.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.100
Maybe not.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.070
But if you did, the
average smartphone user,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.500
if it took them one minute
to pick up their phone,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.794
check the message and
put it back down--

00:16:59.794 --> 00:17:01.460
that's ignoring the
11 minutes of trying

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.860
to get back to the task
before that-- so just assume

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.819
one minute.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.270
That would be the equivalent
of 2 and 1/2 hours of your day

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.410
just picking up your phone.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.349
Which is crazy-- if
you multiply that

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.930
by the 12 months
of the year, that's

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.079
38 days a year of your life that
you're picking up your phone,

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.630
not even doing anything,
just picking it up.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.000
If you don't believe
me, I have a great app

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.319
that is worth checking out.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.609
It's called Realizd.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.400
And Realizd has been
really insightful for me,

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.100
and generates a lot of
aha moments for people

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.110
I speak with as well.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.140
It's a free app.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.630
And what it does is it simply
tracks your phone usage

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:36.920
in the back of your phone.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.295
Now your phone has ways that
you can do this on your own,

00:17:39.295 --> 00:17:40.730
whether Android or iPhone.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.090
But what I like about Realizd is
it gives a lot more statistics

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.150
behind your usage of your phone,
including how many times you've

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.890
picked it up, how
much time you've

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.690
spent every time
you picked it up,

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.390
what apps you were on for the
longest, what you were using,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.400
what your patterns
are over time.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.650
And it was most
eye opening to me

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.290
when I was doing
research for my book.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.190
I'm going to be very
transparent with you.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.200
This is my real data right here.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.170
This is my real data during
Thanksgiving and my daughter's

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.640
birthday.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.250
So the numbers by
the little clock

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.600
there should be green if
you're in the good zone.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.700
They're yellow if you're
in a caution zone.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.290
And they're red if
you're not doing well.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:18.610
Red was my daughter's birthday.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.700
That's six hours on the
phone, doing who knows what.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.880
Maybe I was videotaping
to capture the moment.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.770
We'll just assume the best here.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.190
But what I think is
interesting is that at no point

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.010
did I actually dip
below the 2 and 1/2

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.860
hours of pickups that were
the average smart phone

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.970
user for the day.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:39.270
My lowest amount of time is
two hours and 37 minutes.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:41.610
So this was a really good
litmus check for me, to say,

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.700
OK, you know, I thought
I was behaving one way.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.472
Now I know for a fact
how I'm behaving,

00:18:47.472 --> 00:18:48.930
and I don't want
to live like this.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.650
This is not who I want to be
and how I want to spend my time.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.160
I actually have a lot of other
things I want to be doing.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.402
And if you're like me--

00:18:55.402 --> 00:18:56.610
I have some great strategies.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.080
My colleague Alexa
and I are going

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.860
to be doing a workshop
right after this

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.640
to talk about digital
time management

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.850
and how we can rethink and
reshape some of our behavior

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.190
patterns to recapture
that time in our lives

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:11.320
and what that looks like
on a very practical level.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.702
But that's the first step.

00:19:12.702 --> 00:19:14.160
You've got to know
where you're at.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.576
You've got to get
real, and you've

00:19:15.576 --> 00:19:18.480
got to create a baseline so
you know where your behavior is

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.390
and where you stack up
with where you want to be.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.450
The second step is to tap
into your third prong.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.940
Now, the third prong, just
like an electrical outlet

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.740
has usually two prongs on it.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.020
If you add a third
prong to the cord,

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.910
you get a grounding
wire that begins

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:34.740
to channel and focus energy.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.620
And so I call this grounding
wire your third prong,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.140
to help you think about
what it is in your life that

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.840
are your set of guiding
principles and beliefs that

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.330
shape the way you think
about your technology use.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.594
It may be something that you've
never even contemplated before.

00:19:48.594 --> 00:19:50.760
If you're a parent, you've
probably thought about it

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.051
in terms of your children,
how you want your kids to be

00:19:53.051 --> 00:19:54.876
spending time with technology.

00:19:54.876 --> 00:19:56.250
But it took me
some time to think

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.890
through what does that mean for
me and what I want to be doing.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.430
And one of the things that I
came across with me for myself

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:03.870
was that I'm at a
place in my life

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.760
where I really
want to be growing.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.140
I want to be
learning, and I want

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.100
to invest a lot in my family.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.430
And so my set of
principles and intentions

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.630
all began to gather around
that set of intentions,

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.790
that third prong that
shaped the rest of what

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.630
I'm about to tell you.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.470
So some people who want
to set their intentions

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.720
have been able to come up
with a lot of great hacks

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.940
to make this a
little bit easier.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.550
I have a great friend in Dallas
whose name is Raj Daniels.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.830
He used to be CEO of a tech
startup called OpenTime.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.970
And he once created
this phone box screen

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.560
that I thought was
pretty brilliant.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.070
And it was this simple idea that
said, when he opened his phone,

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.590
it would have a picture that
said, am I moving closer

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.060
or farther from my goals.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.480
So every time he picked up
his phone for about 150 times,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.120
he would ask himself that
question, farther or closer

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.140
to my goals.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.330
And so I've developed this
set of free lock screens

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.700
that, if you're interested
in trying to set yourself,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.620
you can go and
download any of them

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.830
or create your own,
whatever it might be.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:04.710
But the idea here is simply
that you create something visual

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.920
that makes you check yourself
every single time you

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.807
go to your phone.

00:21:08.807 --> 00:21:10.140
And I'm focusing on phones here.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.056
I know there's many other
forms of technology,

00:21:12.056 --> 00:21:15.980
whether game systems or VR or
computers, a time for work.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.720
But I think for right now and
where we're at in our society,

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.310
phones are a big deal.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.680
They're our lives, mushed
together with work,

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.269
and play and learning,
and we never escape them.

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:27.060
And so I think it's
really important for us

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.010
to think through, if
we're going to live

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.510
our lives in some symbiosis
with these devices,

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.010
what does that look
like, and are we

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.551
going to check
ourselves to make sure

00:21:35.551 --> 00:21:37.352
we're going where we want to go.

00:21:37.352 --> 00:21:39.810
Some of the intentions I've
heard from other people I speak

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.210
to is that my intention
is to use my phone

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.850
as a tool, not as an escape.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.522
Or my intention is to check my
email only three times a day.

00:21:48.522 --> 00:21:49.980
Because scientifically,
that's been

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:53.340
proven to be more effective
than checking constantly.

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.000
My intention is to not turn on
my phone at family dinner time.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.850
Or my intention is to
look people in the eye,

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:00.930
rather than at my screen.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.294
Particularly when I'm meeting
with a friend for coffee,

00:22:03.294 --> 00:22:05.460
or a colleague, that I'm
not going to have my phone,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.501
constantly looking at it.

00:22:06.501 --> 00:22:08.190
I love having that conversation.

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.980
I think each one of those
is so important to shaping

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.870
your behavior and the
way you want to be.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.610
And we found through
positive psychology

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.942
that if you take a moment to
write down your intentions.

00:22:17.942 --> 00:22:20.400
Just for a second-- it takes
less than two minutes to write

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.840
down what your intentions are--

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.260
42% more likely to actually
stick with your positive

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.250
behavior change
than if you didn't.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.180
So write it down.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.040
Write it huge.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.610
Put it somewhere very prominent
in your life that would really

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:36.480
help you out, to help you
stick with your intentions.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.954
The fourth strategy is to
simplify, simplify, simplify.

00:22:39.954 --> 00:22:41.120
Now we do this in our homes.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.988
There is constant de-cluttering
and springtime cleaning, right?

00:22:45.988 --> 00:22:48.100
But oftentimes we
don't take the time

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.230
to clean up what I call
our digital graveyard.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.320
And this is the
items in our closets

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.890
that I'm pretty sure everybody
in this room has one.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.594
Their old videotapes,
their old game systems,

00:22:58.594 --> 00:23:00.010
there's cords and
wires, you don't

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.240
know what to do with them.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.850
They begin to creep up on
you when you least expect it.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.710
You have no idea
what to do with them.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.720
Some of your old
laptops that are broken,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.970
have sensitive data.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.290
What are you going to
do with all this stuff?

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:14.080
What I find is that, if you keep
this stuff around in your life,

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.250
not only does it
impact your happiness,

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.520
but it begins to
create an effect where

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.780
the longer you hold an item, the
harder it is to get rid of it

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.580
later.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.270
In fact, trying to separate
yourself from an item

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.730
has the same effect in your
brain as actually getting

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.600
a cut or a wound.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.230
Excuse me.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.750
So when we're able
to simplify, when

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.480
we're able to really
cut down to what's

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.850
most important in
our lives, that's

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.740
what begins to
create space for us

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.750
to make way for
future happiness,

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.240
to begin to bring in
new technology that

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.650
might begin to help us.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.410
And if you're looking
for some really fun tech

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:53.060
strategies for how to recycle,
to upcycle, to reuse or to get

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.490
rid of items, I have a lot
of strategies in my book

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:58.779
I'd be happy to share
with you as well that

00:23:58.779 --> 00:24:01.070
can help you begin to deal
with your digital graveyard.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.910
I think it's a really
important topic

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.600
that I'd like to start having
the conversation around.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.840
And last, we need to
establish invisible fences

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.969
at home and at work.

00:24:09.969 --> 00:24:11.510
How many of you out
there have a dog?

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.020
Raise your hand.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.300
Ooh, lots of you, yeah.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:18.110
So when I was in
Virginia, I had a puppy.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.180
And we had a yard that
didn't have a fence.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.400
Apparently, for those of you
who live in suburbia of Texas,

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.900
we all love fences, right?

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.180
It's like the Container
Store for backyards.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.462
Everybody has their
own little square.

00:24:31.462 --> 00:24:33.920
But in Virginia, there were
just these sprawling backyards,

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.570
and people didn't put up fences.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.180
And I was, I
confess, that person

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.880
who let their dog
just run wild, chasing

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.862
the mailman and the pregnant
ladies and their strollers.

00:24:43.862 --> 00:24:46.070
And I didn't understand how
everyone else's dogs were

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.630
so well-behaved, until one day I
discovered the invisible fence.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.130
And the invisible
fence is a system

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.910
that people started using where
they put an underground wire

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.930
under the grass, and
they put a little collar

00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:59.930
around their dog's neck.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.420
And what would happen is, if
the dog crossed the line where

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.520
the wire was, it would give them
a gentle vibration or shock.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:08.660
And they'd learn over time that
they shouldn't cross that line.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.410
What was interesting
to me, though,

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:12.410
was that the invisible
fence company

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.160
said that 80% of people
who have invisible fences

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.240
don't have them turned on.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.220
Which is crazy, right?

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.130
What happens is your dog
learns where the boundary is,

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.620
and they just never
cross it again.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.290
This is my vision for what
we might become as a society,

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.480
for ourselves and technology.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.462
We didn't have
boundaries 10 years ago.

00:25:31.462 --> 00:25:33.170
Now we're beginning
to create boundaries.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.919
And we're trying to
figure out where do we

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:37.340
put that boundary, what should
the boundaries look like,

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.650
how much shocking do I
need to stop this behavior?

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:42.300
And then, how do
I stick with it?

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.020
But the idea would be that,
if we can train ourselves now

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.900
with appropriate boundaries,
that later on, down the line,

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.840
we won't have to have
so many shocks or so

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.110
many burns from being
overexposed, overused.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.100
In particular, I find this
very important for children.

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.460
Those of you who have children
or have nieces and nephews

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.460
that a number of young
people are stumbling on

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.301
websites that, as
we all know, are

00:26:06.301 --> 00:26:08.300
out there that we don't
want them to have access

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.500
to at this age.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.890
I happen to have a 10-year-old,
a 7-year-old, and a 4-year-old.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.920
And I was testing out a
new device recently called

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.240
KidsWiFi.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.030
And I kid you not,
literally five days

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:24.270
after I installed this, my
daughter, who is 10 years old--

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.900
she's a fashionista, she loves
looking at things on YouTube

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.890
for fashion--

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:28.850
she came running to me.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.550
And she's, like, Mom,
the internet's broken.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.890
I said, sweetie, what
were you looking up?

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.240
And she said, well,
I was just looking up

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.090
cute girl, short skirt, and
the internet wouldn't work.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:41.412
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:41.412 --> 00:26:42.790
Whew!

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.240
Thank goodness I had just
tested out this device.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.230
Because who knows what
she would have seen.

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:51.530
I guarantee it wasn't going
to be what she was hoping for.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.550
But that for me was an
amazing beginning step

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.790
at an invisible fence.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.564
I wasn't there.

00:26:56.564 --> 00:26:57.980
I can't catch all
the moments when

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.170
she might have searched
for things that I don't

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:01.760
want her to be searching for.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.250
But I'm beginning to
use technology as fire

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.830
to fight fire so that
I've got boundaries

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.910
around that keep us not
only safe but also happier

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.555
and healthier for the long run.

00:27:11.555 --> 00:27:14.101
And that was a
really important one.

00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:16.100
Another boundary that
I've heard a lot of people

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.050
say is that they've
just learned when

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.600
and where to have their
phone within their presence.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.310
A research study I
came across last year

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:24.200
said that the mere
presence of a cell

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.750
phone in your line of
sight when you're working

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:29.330
decreases your focus,
your productivity,

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:30.890
and your effectiveness.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:34.880
Now that's if you don't
even look at it or touch it,

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.797
which is crazy, right?

00:27:35.797 --> 00:27:37.963
You would think that, maybe,
if you're picking it up

00:27:37.963 --> 00:27:39.200
constantly that would happen.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.908
But this is if you
don't even look at it.

00:27:40.908 --> 00:27:43.940
Just the mere presence of
it in your line of sight

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.540
makes you less productive,
less focused, less effective.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.880
And so the simple tweak, the
simple invisible boundary

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.620
here is simply to
hide your phone

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.970
while you're trying to focus.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:54.971
It means putting it
behind your laptop screen.

00:27:54.971 --> 00:27:56.720
It means putting it
in your bag, or if you

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.940
have nowhere else, to stick
it in your back pocket

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.940
so that you don't have
it in your line of sight.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.630
It's the simplest
invisible boundary

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.490
that I know of, but
the most effective.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:07.130
Because we know, scientifically
now, that this is something

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.070
that affects our brain, and
it is shaping our behavior

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.730
as we speak.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:11.390
So try it out.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.610
I encourage you to
try it, to share it.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.190
I'd love to hear your
stories about how

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.420
that goes for you as well.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.410
So we talked a little bit about
how technology can keep us away

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.980
from things that are
causing us to zone out.

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.200
But how do we use
technology to help

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.029
us tune into ourselves better?

00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:31.070
Because this is a whole
new frontier that I think

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.700
is so fascinating.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.270
It's amazing that we're
living in this time and space

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.740
in our world where
we're beginning

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.410
to see the cognitive
revolution collide

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.390
with the technological
revolution.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:42.390
I love this picture.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.310
This is actually a
picture of my dad,

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.670
who is a neuroscientist
at Baylor University.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.830
And this was a photo of
him back from the 1970s.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.710
He was considered
quite avant garde

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.370
for having living brains
in his office for years.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.870
And everyone was
totally grossed out

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.700
by these brains in formaldehyde.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.550
But he was fascinated with
looking at the human brain,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.560
because at that
point, nobody had ever

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.180
been able to hold a brain.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.740
That was really cool.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.920
Now we're in a Technicolor
world where we're not

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.350
only able to hold the
brain, but we're actually

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.920
able to manipulate it, to see
it, to track it, to study it,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.440
to see what's going on
when our brains are firing.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.260
And for me, that begins
to help us peel back

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.120
the layers of our
brain and mind to begin

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.502
to create behavior change.

00:29:24.502 --> 00:29:26.210
Where we know there
are certain things we

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.430
can do that will
change our outcomes,

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.190
that will make us happier
and more successful and more

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:33.020
effective and more focused.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.730
And so this is where
I think technology

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:37.070
becomes the most
helpful for moving us

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:39.610
into the future of happiness.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.936
Now to show you exactly
how important this is

00:29:41.936 --> 00:29:43.310
and how this works,
this is where

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.340
I want to do an experiment
with you that I am really

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.340
looking forward to.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.220
So nobody is required
to do this experiment.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.850
I'm no longer allowed to bring
consent forms to my talks

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:58.990
anymore after that last
electric shock therapy snafu.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.440
So this is totally up to you
if you want to participate.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.430
But if you do, I need you
to move around a little bit,

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.320
and everybody needs
to find a partner.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.736
So I'm going to
give you a minute.

00:30:07.736 --> 00:30:10.609
Everyone find a partner, and if
you need one, raise your hand

00:30:10.609 --> 00:30:12.650
and I'll partner you up
with someone in the room.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.641
But find someone you can
do the experiment with.

00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:17.030
How many of you,
raise your hand,

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.150
if you have a background
in psychology?

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.490
Anybody in here-- a couple, one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.570
OK, great.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:26.180
So for those of you with a
background in psychology,

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.370
this is what I call
the emotional prime.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.160
And for everybody
else, this is nothing.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.120
Don't worry about it.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.060
So for the last several years
of your life, the last decade

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.760
of your life, you've been
developing your self-control

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:38.450
and discipline.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:41.905
That's why you are as effective
as you are here today.

00:30:41.905 --> 00:30:44.030
And so what I want you to
do for this experiment is

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.390
to use all of your self-control
and your discipline for just

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.570
seven seconds, and
at eight seconds,

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.370
you can do whatever you want
to, or with your partner.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.160
But seven seconds I
need your attention, OK?

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.160
So person number one, what
I want-- oh, first of all,

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.110
I need to tell you who
person number one is.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.940
So if you're sitting
closest to this wall,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.650
you're going to be
person number one.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.400
And if you're sitting
closer to this wall,

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.570
you're person number two.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:08.900
So person number
one, raise your hand.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.390
Person number two, great--

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:13.250
that was not the experiment.

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.170
That was just the setup.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.810
I did this experiment on
Wall Street a few months ago,

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.790
and it literally took
them five minutes

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.480
to figure out who
number one was.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.040
So I always just verify, now,
who number one and two is.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.360
It's not a statement
about who you are.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.390
But person number one,
what I want you to do

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:34.400
is turn, and get within striking
distance of person number two.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.070
Person number two, I don't want
you to move to defend yourself

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.090
from bodily harm.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.730
Don't flinch.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:41.960
Don't move your face.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.090
Just sit there and take it, OK?

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.540
You ready?

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.380
OK, person number
two, I want you

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.570
to look at person
number one in the eyes.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:54.412
And person number
one, your job--

00:31:54.412 --> 00:31:56.870
well, actually person number
two first-- person number two,

00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.140
your job is to keep your
face as still as possible,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:04.130
showing no fear, no
flinching, no frustration, OK?

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.220
Person number one, your job is
to look into the eyes of person

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.310
number two as deeply,
warmly, and genuinely

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:13.710
as you can, and smile the
biggest smile you've ever had.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.790
You're trying to get the
other person to smile.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.050
All right?

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:17.770
Go.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:22.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.160
Bingo.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:28.550
Ooh.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:32.470
OK.

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.960
Hold it.

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.460
Hold it.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.390
Hold it.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.720
Person number two,
what happened?

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.753
That was horrible.

00:32:41.753 --> 00:32:44.280
I mean, you held out
for longer than anybody,

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.590
but you eventually broke, right?

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.450
What I'd like do
is try this again.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.890
I want to see if the other
person can retaliate.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:53.610
So person number one, let's
see if you can keep your face

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.900
straight for seven seconds.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.510
Person number two, your
job is to look them--

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.640
up into their ideas
as warmly, deeply,

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.620
and genuinely as possible.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.364
Go!

00:33:02.364 --> 00:33:06.316
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:06.316 --> 00:33:16.355
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:16.854 --> 00:33:17.687
AMY BLANKSON: I see.

00:33:24.594 --> 00:33:27.064
I think that was maybe
worse than before.

00:33:32.004 --> 00:33:36.680
How many of you failed
miserably at this experiment?

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.510
Yeah, I thought so.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.660
How many of you successfully
did what I asked you to do?

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:42.650
One, really, Nick?

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:43.240
Wow.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.565
Two, three, four.

00:33:44.565 --> 00:33:45.690
AUDIENCE: I'm cold hearted.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.330
AMY BLANKSON: Wow.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.030
The truth comes out.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.400
What's so interesting for
me about this experiment

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.780
is it shows to me how the human
brain is wirelessly connected

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.760
to each other.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.310
How one person could
smile at another person,

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:03.860
and even though they're
actively resisting you,

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.770
it's still able to create an
emotional connection there.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.040
Which is amazing, right?

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.219
How many of you either
felt your own lip,

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:12.261
or you saw your partner's
lip, start to quiver

00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:13.219
during this experiment?

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:14.700
Raise your hand.

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:19.040
OK, that's weird,
but totally expected.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.440
What's happening there, and
this is phenomenal to me,

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.530
is that your motor neurons are
fighting against your mirror

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:25.310
neurons.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.370
So your muscles in your face
are fighting against your brain,

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.280
literally trying to
stop you from smiling.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.909
And they begin to quiver because
they're at war with each other.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:38.290
And you see it, in just seven
seconds, begin to take place.

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.040
This is what's happening
in the human mind

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.340
as we begin to connect our
minds together in a room.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.000
What we're finding is that
positivity and negativity

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.389
within a room can go from one
side of the room to the other

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:51.860
in under two minutes.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.770
Or if you're at an airport
gate, and you really

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:58.300
want to try an experiment
to mess with people--

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.110
don't tell anyone I told
you to do this or to try it.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:03.200
But there was once
a research study

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.930
done where there was a
research confederate placed

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.710
at an airplane gate.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.960
And the research confederate
had about 15 people

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.130
standing around him.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:14.810
And all he did for
two minutes was look

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.180
at, his watch repeatedly
bounce up and down,

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.420
and occasionally do the
uh, [HEAVY SIGH] sigh.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.880
And what began to happen
in under two minutes

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.160
was that 11 of those
15 people began

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.100
to copy the exact same behavior.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.590
We begin to mirror each
other through a room,

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.870
whether it's positive or
negative, because we're

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.850
emotionally connected
to each other.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:38.240
And this, to me, changes how
and why it's so important for us

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.240
to begin to shape the way that
we interact with technology,

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.140
with each other.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.260
With the wires, whether
wireless or we're not wired,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.200
the ways that we interact
as a species and as humans

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.900
begins to shape the way
that we begin to create

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.980
the future of happiness.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.410
Because it changes both
our emotional awareness

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:59.360
of each other as well as shaping
how we begin to create emotion

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.410
affect within the community.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.350
Next week I'm going
to get to go to MIT,

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.140
and they're doing this amazing
emotion awareness summit,

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:08.420
looking at technologies
that will begin

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.090
to use the camera on
your phone or your laptop

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.670
to study your
facial recognition,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:16.790
telling you through 11,000
valence points on your face

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.844
about whether you're feeling
joy or sadness or frustration.

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.260
But what they're
using that for is

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.590
to begin to create an emotional
connection with technology

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.340
that says--

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.440
imagine, if you were
sitting at your office desk,

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.292
and it could say--

00:36:28.292 --> 00:36:30.750
you know, you've been sitting
at your desk for so long now,

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.125
and your face is
really beginning

00:36:32.125 --> 00:36:34.580
to show frustration
or stress or anger.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.124
Why don't you take a break now?

00:36:36.124 --> 00:36:38.290
At which point, you might
want to hit your computer.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:42.380
But I think that that kind of
sensitivity and thoughtfulness,

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:45.940
to begin to tie an emotion and
humanity into our technology,

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.250
is going to be where the future
and the frontier of happiness

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.270
is moving towards.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.700
And I'm really excited to
see how do we shape that

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.200
through active conversation.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.560
And additionally, we can
begin to use technology

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.680
to train our brains for greater
awareness and happiness.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.590
The idea of being able to peel
back the layers of our mind

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.470
comes right back to
tracking our own behavior

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:10.190
through life logging or
simple things like Fitbit.

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:13.370
I love my Fitbit because it
helps me track, over time, not

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.490
only my eating my
health, my sleep,

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.450
but this is just the
beginning of the frontier.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:20.570
As many of you know,
health trackers

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.890
are just the most
commercialized at this point.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.450
But there's a number of amazing
gadgets and apps and devices

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:29.889
I've had the opportunity to try
over the last couple of years.

00:37:29.889 --> 00:37:31.430
For the course of
my book, I wound up

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.700
trying out 400 different
apps and gadgets and devices.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.000
And I literally had my skin
pricked for blood testers.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.150
And I've had my body
vibrated from shock therapy

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.350
that was gone awry.

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:49.850
I've had Velcro adhesive
rip off part of my skin

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:51.512
for a posture trainer.

00:37:51.512 --> 00:37:53.720
I've literally got my skin
in the game at this point.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.312
And I find that
what's so amazing

00:37:56.312 --> 00:37:57.770
is that despite
the fact that there

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.390
are so many misfired
technologies,

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.110
there's some really phenomenal
ones that are beginning

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:04.980
to create change in behavior.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:06.980
Whether it's Happify,
that trains your brain

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.890
for greater happiness through
simple little games that

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:13.130
are free online, or
it's apps and gadgets

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.160
like Spire, which helps you to
track your breathing patterns.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.700
These are the beginning
places for beginning to think

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.782
about emotional awareness.

00:38:21.782 --> 00:38:23.740
And I put up here a
website, if you're curious.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.460
I've got another 40 of my
favorite apps, gadgets,

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.460
and devices that I've
personally tested out now,

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.310
that I find to be particularly
effective for training

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.140
the brain for greater
happiness or well-being.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.410
That's at AmyBlankson.com/Tech.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.150
And I think they're fascinating.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.190
If you know of others,
I'd like to learn more.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.320
So feel free to share
with me after this talk,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.580
because I'm curious.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.260
But I mentioned
this Spire stone.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.200
This is one of the gadgets
that I tried out last summer.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.740
And it went from just a
fascinating gadget wearable

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.870
to fundamentally
transformative for me.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.250
Of all the gadgets
and wearables,

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.580
this is probably the one that
I stuck with the longest.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.250
And the reason why it
became so important to me

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:04.520
was that my 10-year-old
daughter, she was nine

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:05.450
last summer.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.430
Through a series of
unfortunate incidents,

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.730
she wound up breaking her
neck last summer in our pool.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.260
Fortunately, she's fine now.

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.480
She's back to doing back
handsprings and flips

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.710
all over the place.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.270
But at the time that
this took place,

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.672
it was a dramatic
moment for our family.

00:39:19.672 --> 00:39:21.380
And I had that privilege
of being the one

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.650
to drive her to the hospital
to meet with the doctors

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:26.495
and get fitted for
this neck brace.

00:39:26.495 --> 00:39:28.130
And what was
interesting was that, it

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.140
was a time I was
testing the Spire stone.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.300
And so all the way
to the hospital,

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:36.170
the Spire stone showed that
I had been completely calm.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.480
It was perhaps that, like,
mother instinct calm,

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.940
where you're thinking
like, OK, this is go time.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.760
I've just got to
take care of stuff.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.730
But it wasn't until after we
were leaving the hospital,

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.554
that the Spire stone
started to vibrate,

00:39:48.554 --> 00:39:49.970
and it sent a
message to my phone.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.830
And it said, Amy,
you're feeling tense.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.675
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:53.675 --> 00:39:56.390
I know.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:59.060
But in that moment
of recognition,

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.820
it made me think about
why I was feeling tense.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:05.750
And what I realized was
that I was feeling tense

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.215
that other people in the
hospital were looking at me

00:40:08.215 --> 00:40:09.590
and wondering what
kind of mother

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.470
I was that my daughter's
neck was broken.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.920
And that was the dominant
thought in my mind.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.645
But I recognized that that's
not who I wanted to be.

00:40:18.645 --> 00:40:21.020
I wanted to be the mother who
was there for her daughter,

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.430
contemplating her summer
of having to wear this neck

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.130
brace, and what people
were going to think of her,

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.220
and what activities she
wouldn't be able to do,

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.970
and how hot and
sticky it was going

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:33.030
to be in Texas with this neck
brace on, and yada, yada, yada.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.410
And I think that that
moment of self-recognition

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.560
helped me to mindfully
pivot in about 30 seconds

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.390
to be the person I wanted to be.

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:43.400
I could recognize I
was feeling tense,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.320
could understand why
I was feeling tense,

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.180
and I could change my behavior.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.180
And for me, this is
technology at its finest,

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.800
beginning to raise
our consciousness

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.590
to create lifestyle and
behavior change so that we

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.360
can be who we want to be.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.250
And that, my friends,
is happiness.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.940
That, to me, is the beginning
of creating a path in which we

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.910
can create change that
we can create together,

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.670
that we can create
something that we can make

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:11.120
a difference in the way that
we become aware as a humanity,

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.330
as a group of humans to
create that ripple effect,

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:16.640
the mirror neuron
effect in our brains

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.170
where we see change happen.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.102
I think if we do
nothing in the future,

00:41:20.102 --> 00:41:21.560
we're perhaps on
a trajectory where

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.260
we're heading towards a
future where everybody

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.630
sits at the dinner table
staring at their devices

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.120
and not interacting.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.870
If you're like me, I
don't want that to be

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.010
the end of our story.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.165
I think that we're just
at a crossroads right now,

00:41:33.165 --> 00:41:35.540
and we're able to begin to
move through that to something

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:39.110
better and more powerful if
we use technology for the best

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.584
and highest purposes.

00:41:40.584 --> 00:41:42.500
And I bring this slide
to you because you guys

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.610
are the innovators, right?

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.410
Google is at the top
of the food chain

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.074
for creating innovation
and positive change.

00:41:48.074 --> 00:41:49.490
And so I want to
encourage you not

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:53.000
only to innovate, but to think
specifically about well-being.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.370
We're not just about creating
smart cities these days,

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.440
we want smart and happy cities.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.090
We don't just want
smart schools.

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.220
We want smart and happy schools.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:04.790
So how do we use innovation to
feed and funnel more change,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:08.060
to create and continue to
think about our humanity

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.280
and our connectedness
and how we're wirelessly

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.260
connected to each other.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.040
And I'll conclude with this.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.670
I think that, while
sometimes people think,

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.046
well, I'm just not an engineer.

00:42:18.046 --> 00:42:19.670
Like, you know, I
might work at Google.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.044
But I'm not one
of the people who

00:42:21.044 --> 00:42:24.750
creates the gadgets and
devices or the new game

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.139
changers in the field.

00:42:26.139 --> 00:42:28.430
And what I want to encourage
you is that each one of us

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:31.010
are innovators in our
own space and field.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.020
These days all it
takes is one person

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.260
with an idea to begin to
create positive change.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.600
It takes an idea to
collaborate and be

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.940
willing to put yourself out
there, to bring people together

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.130
around an idea.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.170
And this story for
me is powerful.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.450
I read this about
this organization

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.430
called Enabling Our Future.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:53.000
And it's an organization that's
a global alliance of volunteers

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.150
around the world who build
3D printed prosthetic

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:57.650
hands for children in need.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.980
So instead of spending $200,000
on a prosthetic arm, now

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.700
kids can get one for $30,
printed at their local library.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.560
And so I told a friend
in my neighborhood

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.410
who has a daughter who was
born with Symbrachydactyly.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.910
This little girl
is seven years old,

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:12.368
just like my
daughter, who's seven.

00:43:12.368 --> 00:43:14.300
And she loves gymnastics.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.300
And up until this
point in her life,

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.340
it's never stopped her from
doing monkey bars or cartwheels

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.570
with the best of them.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.210
But as she's getting older,
her body is getting heavier.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:24.710
And she found on
the monkey bars,

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.660
she was starting to
get painful blisters

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.660
from trying to grab the
bars in unusual ways.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.509
And so I told her mom, you got
to check out this organization.

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:33.550
It's kind of fascinating.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.810
Maybe it could help her
grip this gymnastics

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.520
bar a little bit better.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.187
Well, one week later,
I get this phone call.

00:43:40.187 --> 00:43:42.020
She said, Amy, you've
got to come over here.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.200
And I said, OK, I'm coming.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.190
What's going on?

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.190
And she said, well, my
husband and I checked out

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.840
that website you told us
about, Enabling Our Future.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.470
And my husband spent the entire
weekend at the Frisco Library.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.924
He printed a hand
for our daughter,

00:43:54.924 --> 00:43:56.340
and I wanted you
to be here to see

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.616
her use it for the first time.

00:43:58.616 --> 00:43:59.610
Oh, it was amazing.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.650
I get goosebumps every
time I think about it.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:05.460
Because it was the story
of one website that

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.830
led one father to
go find a resource,

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:11.340
to find a 3-D printer, to
begin to create a change

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.690
for his daughter's life.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.970
That is a story I
can now tell to share

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:17.310
with you to go find other
people to find resources

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:18.840
to do similar things.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.610
And it's a story
grows and changes

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.620
with time as we begin
to see that technology

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.470
is a magnifier, right?

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:28.572
That website was magnified
into community change.

00:44:28.572 --> 00:44:30.780
And these things that we do
in our lives, these ideas

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.120
and innovations we come
up with, are up to us

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.530
to change and decide--

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:36.686
are we going to let
technology distract us?

00:44:36.686 --> 00:44:38.310
Or are we going to
tune into ourselves,

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.644
and use technology for its
best and highest purposes?

00:44:41.644 --> 00:44:43.935
So I encourage it, and I
leave you guys with this torch

00:44:43.935 --> 00:44:46.990
and mantle to think about
what does this mean for you?

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.536
What would it mean to
create the next innovation,

00:44:49.536 --> 00:44:50.910
whether in your
own personal life

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.040
through setting your
intentions, or beginning

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.069
to change the way that
you use your phone,

00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:56.610
or beginning to
think through an idea

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.620
and build a collaboration
around something

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.290
that brings more humanity to the
way that we interact together?

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.510
So thank you so much for
giving me this opportunity

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.940
to speak to you, and
I wish you the best

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.370
as you go out there and create
great change for the world.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:08.910
Thank you.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.960
[APPLAUSE]
