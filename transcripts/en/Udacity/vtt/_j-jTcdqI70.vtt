00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.960
To build a great gaming community,

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.240
you might also want to involve your
players in the game creation process.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for our ball game I'm kind
of stuck on ways to improve it.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.940
I can only get so
far by adding more rings of fire.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.820
Where else do you think I should do?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.970
&gt;&gt; Well, you could add multiple
balls of different sizes, and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.140
I'm kind of getting tired
of the rings of fire.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.326
What about including different obstacles
like maybe walls that you want to avoid?

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:26.820
&gt;&gt; Those are great ideas,
thanks for your feedback.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.240
&gt;&gt; I'm happy to help.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.210
&gt;&gt; None of us knows how to
build the perfect game.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.040
But by listening to our players and
getting their feedback, you can

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.630
improve your game, and your players
will know that their input is valued.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.220
So what are some ways that we can
include feedback in the game app?

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.170
&gt;&gt; There a couple of meaningful
ways to get feedback.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.575
Most apps just use reviews and
ratings, but

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:48.435
you could also add in-app
messaging systems.

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.060
Surveys, forums and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.620
whatever else you want to get to
increase player participation.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.730
Recently, game developers
are actually inviting

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.140
fans to watch them on Twitch
as they're building the game.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.506
This is really cool because developers
can get real time feedback from

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:05.843
potential players.

00:01:05.843 --> 00:01:10.134
&gt;&gt; One great example of a strong gaming
and player community is the one for

00:01:10.134 --> 00:01:11.380
League of Legends.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.220
League of Legends gets feedback from
players from direct messages and

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.790
from forums.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.450
The game has great graphics and has
a number of strong social components.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.881
Players can chat with one another,
teams compete.

00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:28.783
And there are even tournaments
watched throughout the world between

00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:30.710
the strongest players.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.150
And with such involved players,
this game makes a lot of money

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.180
off of in-app purchases that let players
personalize their experience and

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.259
enhance their gameplay.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.340
Lots of players get so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.300
involved that they even create
fan art based off of the game.
