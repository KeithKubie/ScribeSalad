00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:07.329
The sea has been pounding the rocks mercilessly
since dawn.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.240
How much lies beneath that deceptively simple
word, the ‘sea’,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.520
 in truth a continuous

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.430
roiling evolving drama of a billion waves,
each one of individual character and rhythm.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.080
Up in the cliffs is a cross section through
the earth’s autobiography: bands of sandstone,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.380
siltstone and shale dating back to the Upper
Carboniferous period, 300 million years ago.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.760
How long it took for us to make it here.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.860
The sea’s rage and threatening power invites
us to a redemptive sense of our own smallness

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.790
and fragility: a bracing vastness that calms
and dampens our petty fears and egoisms.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.640
- the indifference of nature as a relief from
being ourselves.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.090
There are gulls overhead and large colonies
of razorbills along the perilous cliff-face ledges.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:48.640
Every day they head out eighty miles
or more, diving 25 meters deep in to the Atlantic,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.360
in search of sprats, cod and herring:

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.640
 our
varied co-inhabitants in this otherwise deserted,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.990
gaseous universe.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.280
We are part of all this.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.920
We should no longer say 'I' and 'they' - but
we. We should surrender our jealous, frightened

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.700
attachment to the human perspective - and
learn at times to merge with the universe,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.980
to identify with its vast, impersonal forces.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:37.300
We are the waters, the sky, the land, the currents.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:50.800
At night, as we fall asleep, we can hear the
sea seemingly pulsing through our ears, our veins.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.069
A little of nature’s energy is inside all
of us - and will continue its relentless beat

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.489
when we are exhausted and gone, having left
less of a mark even than the tiny trapped

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.829
corals and brachiopods in the rocks; mere
frenzied instants in eternity.
