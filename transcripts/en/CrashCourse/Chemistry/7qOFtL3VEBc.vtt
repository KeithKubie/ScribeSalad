00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Have you ever been to a demolition derby?

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.899
Basically it's a bunch of people driving cars
around a field,

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.240
doing their best to ram into each other while
protecting themselves as much as possible.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.049
The goal of course is to damage the other
cars so badly that they can't be driven anymore.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.800
The driver of the last operational car wins.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.680
You know Crash Course chemistry well enough
to know that

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.710
I probably wouldn't have mentioned this if
it have some relation to chemistry.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.070
So yeah it does, chemical reactions basically
work just like this.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.430
Atoms and molecules move around their environment
occasionally ramming into each other.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.050
If they do it right, a reaction happens between
them, and if enough of them do it,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.540
the concentration of the reacting molecules will go down while the concentration of the products goes up. Win.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.760
But it's not as simple as it sounds, for demolition
drivers, or for chemicals;

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.850
in both cases a lot of the collisions that
occur have very little effect on the end result.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.970
One molecule hitting another doesn't mean
a reaction's going to take place.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.680
In the same way that just randomly bumping into a guys car doesn't mean you're gonna ram him out of the derby.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.840
So, what makes a collision effective? The hit has to be hard enough and it has to be aligned just right.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.360
The branch of chemistry that studies how these collisions effect the rate of reactions is Kinetics.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.280
And if you ask me it's just as exciting and a heck of a lot more useful than demolition derbies.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.960
If only they sold funnel cakes in chemistry
class.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:31.540
[Theme Music]

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.140
So if chemical reactions only work when particles
bang into each other good and hard,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.140
just how hard do they have to bang into each
other?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.380
Every reaction has a minimum amount of energy
required to get it started.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.760
This is known as the activation energy.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.319
Molecules require this much energy to hit other molecules hard enough to break them apart

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.579
and reform them in different ways;
without it nothing will happen.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.399
It's like a hill that molecules have to get
over before they can go any farther.

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.799
So where do they get this energy? Well it's
kinetic energy, the actual speed of the particles.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.469
So just like the cars in a demolition derby,
all else being equal,

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.670
the faster the particles move, the harder
the collision will be.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.909
But still no matter how hard they hit it won't do any good if they're not hitting the right way, in the right places.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.299
Like, if you keep smashing into the back of some guy's trunk it's not going to stop his car, there's no engine back there.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.100
You can bang Velcro together all day and night and if it's not turned the right way it'll never stick together.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.220
Same thing with molecules.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.970
As an example take nitric oxide, one of the
byproducts of gasoline combustion,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.110
and something that you can smell quite clearly
at a demolition derby.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.390
Under the right conditions it reacts with
hydrogen gas to produce nitrogen gas and water.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.080
But the molecules have to hit each other just
the right way.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.150
To make N2 two NO's have to collide in such
a way that the nitrogens are together,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.489
and to get H2O, a molecule of H2 has to collide
with the oxygen side of an NO molecule.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.730
Just like Velcro being turned the wrong way,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.209
you can smack the N side against the H2 all
day and you'll never get any water from it.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.489
Now let's say we're having a lot of solid,
effective collisions between the molecules.

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.170
The reaction should hum along with no further
hindrances, right? Well yes and no.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.310
Once the energy requirements are met the reaction
will proceed,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.540
but its speed, or reaction rate, will vary
wildly from super fast to super slow.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.129
So the reaction rate, that's the rate at which
the concentrations of the reacts decrease

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.689
and this has to be determined experimentally.

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:28.019
It can't be calculated from the energy change
or any other thermodynamic factor.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.810
One useful way to think about the rate is
a quantity called the reaction's rate law.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.620
It describes the relationship between the
initial concentrations of the reactants

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.099
and the rate at which they react.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.999
The rate law for a reaction is written like
this:

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:46.059
The rate equals a constant, k, times the concentrations
of each reactant, raised to some power.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.560
Notice that only the reactants are used for
this not the products.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.879
The rate law for our nitric oxide reaction then ends up as k times the nitric oxide concentration raised to some power,

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.930
times the hydrogen concentration also raised
to some power.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.269
So you're probably wondering about all those
raised to some power.

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.349
Like, what power? And you should be wondering
that.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.310
The exponents in rate laws are tricky even
for professional chemists and engineers

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.239
because like I said they can only be determined
experimentally.

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.079
It's kinda intense, but we can handle it,
check it out.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.120
Suppose we did the reaction a few different
ways and calculated the rate for each instance.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.820
Let's say that with the first reaction we
got a rate of 0.006 moles per liter per second.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.800
Then we repeat the reaction with the same
amount of nitric oxide

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.570
but this time with twice as much hydrogen
as before.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.850
And now we find that the rate of the reaction
is 0.012 moles per liter per second.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.070
What does this tell us?

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.200
Well, doubling the hydrogen, doubled the rate;

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.420
meaning that the rate and the H2 concentration
change in exactly the same way.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.440
So in the rate law this can be expressed be the concentration being raised to the power of 1.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.240
Finally we do it one last night with the original
amount of hydrogen and twice as much NO.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.460
This time we find that we get a rate of 0.048
moles per liter per second.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.280
Doubling the nitric oxide caused the rate
to increase by 8 times,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.070
and that can be expressed in mathematical
terms by cubing the concentration term.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.460
This means that the final rate law for this
reaction is:

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.940
k times the concentration of hydrogen gas to the first power, you need to write out the 1 obviously,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.440
times the concentration of nitric oxide cubed.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.310
A rate law in this form is said to be of the
fourth order.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.790
We get that by adding the exponents together: 3+1 (there is some math that isn't hard here) that equals 4

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.640
Fourth order reactions are actually quite rare, most reactions are of the zero, first, or second order,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.340
but in all cases it's calculated exactly as
we have done here.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.280
Now if you've watched our episode on equilibrium
this formula should look familiar to you.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.260
Equilibrium expressions also use bracketed concentrations with exponents, and that's no accident.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.980
Those formulas come from these ones.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.660
A reaction is at equilibrium when its forward
and reverse rates are equal, right?

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.400
So if we were to find the reverse rate law for a reaction it would take the same form as the forward one,

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.580
but using the initial concentrations for the
products rather than the reactants.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.520
Think of like an imaginary reaction
A plus B yields C plus D.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.250
The lower case letters represent the coefficients
of the reactants and products.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.620
The forward rate law if k multiplied by the
concentration of A raised to some power

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.400
times the initial concentration of B raised
to some power.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.930
And the reverse is it the same, except with
C and D in place of A and B.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.810
Notice that these exponents are not however
the coefficients of the balanced equation.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.120
If we write these two terms together to show that the forward and reverse rates are equal, like in equilibrium,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.150
and solve for a single constant, we get something
that looks very much like an equilibrium expression.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.400
For mathematical reasons the exponents don't
translate,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.340
but, yeah basically this is where the equilibrium
equation's come from, pretty cool.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.900
But if it's that simple why don't all reactions
just go to an equilibrium state and stay there?

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:47.160
Well sometimes the reverse reaction isn't as thermodynamic spontaneous for one reason or another.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.040
Sometimes that forward reaction is so vigorous that any reactants that might reform are immediately pushed back into products.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.800
Or the products might physically separate
and have little chance of colliding at all,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.180
like when products separate into solids and
gases.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.430
Often though it's just that the reverse reaction
has such a high activation energy

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.810
that the collisions are almost always ineffective.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:12.330
Because, remember, most reactions don't happen instantly, boom, all at once; instead they happen in steps.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:18.030
And as with any multi-step process the reaction can only happen as fast as the slowest step takes.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.020
And sometimes that step is very slow indeed.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.740
Since its what controls how fast everything else can go, we call it the rate limiting or rate determining step.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.780
The slowest step, is the one that has the
highest activation energy.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.420
If the particles have trouble getting over
that part of the energy hill,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.620
then they'll have trouble making it to the finish line, not matter how fast the other steps are.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.780
So in the case of the nitric oxide reaction we've been discussing, there are actually three steps.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:47.080
First the nitric oxide and the H2 form water
and elemental nitrogen;

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:53.260
then the nitrogen combines with another molecule
of NO to form N2 and elemental oxygen;

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.540
finally that atom of oxygen combines with
another molecule of H2 to form water.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.810
Here step two is the slow one and no matter
how fast you take the first step,

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.010
the water product can never be produced until
the nitrogen gas is.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.990
The problem is we can't always afford to wait
around for reactions to happen on their own,

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.600
sometimes they need to be forced along.
And that's the job of catalysts.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.400
A catalyst is a chemical that lowers the activation
energy of a reaction,

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.960
thereby speeding it up without actually being
changed by it.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.040
Catalysts take many different forms, they can be just another chemical added to the reaction vessel,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.400
a piece of metal that's in contact with the reacting chemicals, or even a gas that's added to the environment.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.340
One of the most common and important classes
of catalysts are the enzymes in living things.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.460
Without them, many other chemical processes that our bodies must do every day to keep us alive

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:45.370
would slow essentially to a stop, we literally
could not survive without them.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.190
So there you go, in demolition derbies and in chemistry it all comes down to how hard you can hit,

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.470
and how well you can aim your punches.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.300
Chemistry! Surprisingly exciting even without
funnel-cakes.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.820
Thanks for hanging out for this episode of Crash Course chemistry, if you paid attention you learned that:

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.220
chemical reactions depend on collisions between
molecules and atoms,

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.640
that the particles have to be oriented correctly
when they collide,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.890
and that they have to collide with enough
energy to meet the threshold for the reaction

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.450
known as the activation energy.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.590
You also learned how to write rate laws and
figure out their exponents

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.320
and how to calculate the form or order of
a rate law;

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.710
you learned how rate laws are related to equilibrium
expressions,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:26.060
and finally you learned that chemical reactions
actually happen in steps.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.250
That the slowest step determines the overall
rate of the reaction

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.440
and that the reason for that come right back
around the activation energy.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.240
