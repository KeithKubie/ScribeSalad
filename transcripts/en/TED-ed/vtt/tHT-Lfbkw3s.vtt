Don't stop singing.

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:10.875
And that's because at a certain point

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:14.730
when I became 16 or 17,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.600
I stopped singing

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.817
and really being used to hearing my voice.

00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:20.842
And for many years,

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:23.939
I wasn't comfortable in front of people,

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:24.744
speaking,

00:00:24.744 --> 00:00:26.121
sharing my opinions,

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:28.453
just making my thoughts known

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:29.933
and available for other people.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.487
And I think that it took me a long time

00:00:32.487 --> 00:00:34.043
to find my voice again.

00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:36.128
And I think if I hadn't stopped singing

00:00:36.128 --> 00:00:37.895
and being in front of people like that,

00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:39.922
I would have probably been able

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:42.173
to share a lot more of what I thought

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:44.442
in those important years.
