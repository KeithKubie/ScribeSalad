00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.500
 With the Android system "Lollipop" .. 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.560
 The "multidimensional design" differs from the way applications look, 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.051
 To create more magical moments. 

00:00:06.051 --> 00:00:08.299
 But the devices that run older versions of Android, 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.492
 You do not have all those features. 

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:11.520
 I'm Joanna Smith, and one of the best things ... 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.253
 The multi-dimensional design given to us is "toolbars". 

00:00:14.253 --> 00:00:17.480
 Which are now more magical, because they have become so convenient to go back. 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.690
 The toolbar is a richer and more flexible viewing mode than the traditional process bar. 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.750
 In fact, toolbars are part of the display hierarchy. 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.290
 It can move, or even interact with scrolling "pass options". 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.770
 As a viewing method, you can use toolbars. 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.960
 As a standalone element anywhere in the application. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.830
 To give the user options, controls, 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.270
 Without having to display the design model at its widest at the top of the screen. 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.899
 You can also make multiple toolbars, 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.190
 If the application structure depends on the design content, 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.470
 Or if you grant the user a lot of controls. 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.310
 To provide the toolbar with instructions and choices, 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.340
 You can switch the menu to a toolbar, 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.250
 To display those instructions to the user. 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.280
 You can also make your own controls, 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.200
 Such as to use a button to return to the top level. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.230
 Because you can use toolbars anywhere in your design, 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.390
 You can also choose to use the toolbar instead of the Help bar. 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.330
 Simply put, the more you need to control 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.100
 Giving you the appearance and function of the traditional help bar. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.110
 If, in order to use the toolbar, instead of the normal Help bar, 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.779
 The Help bar should first stop working, 

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:16.320
 The easiest way to do this is .. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.620
 You can extend the theme from: "theme.AppCompat.NoActionBar" 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.300
 Or one of its other variants. 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.010
 Then make the toolbar the same as any other design in your app. 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.160
 Set the Help Bar to customize 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.660
 When he or she passes a particular activity or part. 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.020
 In doing so, 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 The system adds "Standard" Help bar options for you, 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.040
 So you do not need to fill the list yourself. 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.760
 Now you may be convinced how distinctive these "toolbars" are. 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.740
 But how you use them in versions of your app, 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.810
 Targeting the older SDKs. 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.860
 Well, toolbars have been added 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.740
 To the support library for "AppCompat V21". 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.070
 And now it has become easy 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 "Setting Support for the Help Bar" instead of "Adjusting the Help Bar" 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.780
 To replace the Help bar in older devices 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.820
 See "Explanation" for more support options available, 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.050
 So you can bring more magical moments to users. 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.990
