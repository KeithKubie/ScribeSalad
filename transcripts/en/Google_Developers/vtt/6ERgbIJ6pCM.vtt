ALOK CHANDEL: Hello, my
name is Alok Chandel.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.880
I'm a user experience
designer on Project Glass.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.720
Today, we'll be
talking about how

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.680
to create some great
experiences on Glass.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.300
We'll look at what are the great
experiences on Glass, and then,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.440
how do you go about
creating some of those?

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.980
Let's get right to it.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.845
What are the experiences which
feel right at home on Glass?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.370
Keep the user in the moment.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.500
As a user of Glass, if
I'm walking down a bridge,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.700
I have a question, I ask,
get answered instantly.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.220
What's important on
Glass is that you

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.520
allow the user to stay in the
physical world, while still

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.130
taking these short, small
dips in the digital world

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.300
and continue through
rest of their day.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.860
Voice first.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.680
Now, this is really important.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.330
Because unlike
other devices where

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.280
voice may be just
one of the ways

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.530
the user interact with it,
on Glass, voice is critical.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.740
It is also fast and a
natural way to interact.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.230
As a Glassware developer,
you will have an opportunity

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.420
to provide some voice commands.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.580
When you are doing
such a thing, think

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.140
about what are the actions
your users are going

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.270
to take to invoke
your Glassware.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.360
Something like "OK, Glass, take
a picture," is a great command.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.870
"OK, Glass, start a
camera," not so much.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.440
Just like any other wearable
device, speed truly matters.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.540
If you can deliver
amazing experiences

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.560
in less than five
seconds, they're

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.920
just going to become perfect.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.120
If you have a feature-rich
mobile or web application,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.830
think about what are
the specific nuggets

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.530
of amazing experiences
you can provide on Glass.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.560
And then you can use voice
or one tap actions for users

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.320
to access those.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.010
If you can reduce
the amount of time

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.470
between an intent
that the user has

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.750
and the action they need to
take to fulfill that intent,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.300
you will be able to create
brilliant Glasswares.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.510
Keep things relevant.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.470
Now, on Glass, you want
to deliver experiences

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.380
which are relevant
right down to the moment

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.550
user is interacting with them.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.700
If I have a Glassware which
lists all of my shopping list,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.380
and I walk into a
grocery store, show

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.630
me only the part of
the shopping list

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.840
which I can purchase
in the grocery store.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.340
Something which I'm
going to order online

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.910
just doesn't belong on
Glass at that moment.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.080
Understand the context, like
a location, time of day,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.570
day of the week, even
my personal preferences.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.515
Combine all of these to create
some amazing experiences.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.150
The display of the Glass sits
so close to the user's eyes

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.810
that you have a
unique opportunity

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.570
to create Glassware
which orient to the view

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.140
that the user is
having of the world.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.880
Now, it's important,
that when you're

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.060
creating these experiences,
that you update the view

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.250
the moment user is
turning their head.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.380
Now, that's how you
create good experiences.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.130
What makes these
experiences even better

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.300
are if you can use either voice
or head gestures to free up

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.700
the hands, so that
the users can interact

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.455
with the world around them.

00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:55.830
Let's summarize what are the
experiences which work great

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.960
on Glass.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.620
Those who keep the
user in the moment.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.480
Those who use voice for quick
and natural interactions.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.990
Make sure that
experiences of delivering

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.500
the right amount of information
at just the right time, that

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.880
orient to the view of
the world around me.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.779
And finally, free
up my hand so that I

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.150
can interact with
the world around me.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.030
In the next section,
let's take a look

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.640
at some of the
recommendations on how

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.480
to create some
great experiences.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.740
Let's start with typography.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.410
On Glass, the default
system font is Roboto.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.940
We use two weights of
this font, thin and light.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.230
When you look at
all the templates,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.190
40 pixel is the font
size we use almost

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.600
as a regular or
normal font size.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.620
You can increase it to
50, something like large,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.510
or 70 pixel, like an
extra large font size.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.800
Anything larger
than this may not

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.190
give you enough space on
Glass to write full sentences.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.080
However, you may be
able to use larger font

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.900
sizes for very specific
pieces of information.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.870
For example, temperature
or sports scores.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.730
Let's take a look at the
other end of the spectrum.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.560
If you go down to 34 pixel font
size, think of it as small.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.260
30 pixel, extra small.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.280
Anything smaller than
this in the body text,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.510
it's just not going to
be legible for a user.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.810
So stay away from those sizes.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.475
Let's look at a very important
facet of designing really,

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:48.060
really good and legible
Glassware-- padding.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.300
You'll notice that
all of our templates

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.100
will have 40 pixel
padding on all sides.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.240
Now, this is important so
that the content that you're

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.320
putting in front
of the user doesn't

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.400
get clipped on the
left or the right side.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.980
Similarly, this will allow
some of the system UIs

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.820
like scroll bar or progress
bar to easily occupy

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.850
this 40 pixel space without
interacting with the content

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.990
that you're presenting
to the user.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.980
The closer you can
present the content

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.970
to the center of the
screen, the easier

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.570
it will be for a
user to focus on it.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.470
Let's take a look at some of the
core templates that we provide.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.230
This is a basic template.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.260
Really good for putting
in a lot of text which

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.500
is still digestible on Glass.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.870
One important thing that you'll
notice on all the templates

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.740
is there is a space
provided to put in metadata.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.340
Now, this metadata
allows the user

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.910
to understand who is
providing this content,

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.270
and also, what is the context
in which this content is

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.300
being provided.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.670
Another template,
we call it Otter.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.010
This is great for both providing
who is the sender, as well

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.060
as the subject line, of
course, in addition to

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.130
the body of the message.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.910
There are tons of
other templates

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.290
which you can find at
our developer website

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.106
that deal with things like
lists, full-bleed images, et

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:20.605
cetera.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.580
Glanceable UIs.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.210
Now, this is an important part.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.550
Glass is a device which is
designed from grounds up

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.390
to be used out and about.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.540
When you are presenting the
user an information which

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.055
is divided up into lots of small
chunks, really start thinking,

00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:45.610
can you actually
spread this information

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.060
across couple of
different screens?

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.820
Can you reduce this
information into something

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.140
which is much more
easily digestible?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.690
So, for example, if
I change this screen

00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.360
to something like
this, all of a sudden

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.580
it is much more easy for me
to read this information even

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.920
when I'm jogging.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.820
If you are able to reduce
the number of chunks down

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:16.740
to just one without diminishing
the value of information,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.810
you may actually have a
truly great Glassware.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.790
Low density, high quality.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:29.070
Now, you may have created
some great experiences

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:33.150
on mobile and web using
responsive design.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.010
If you want to scale down
those designs on Glass

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:40.179
and expect that those
experiences are going to work,

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.240
you may not actually
have that much luck.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.490
If you want to create
experience on Glass

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.040
think about creating
them from grounds up.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.910
There are certain
experiences which

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.900
work especially beautiful,
especially nice on Glass.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.150
Things like full-bleed images.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.460
Again, make use of the
space provided for metadata

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.800
to make sure that the
user is understanding what

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.380
is the context in which
this image is being provided

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:08.880
to them.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.070
The last point here, and
this is really important.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.700
When you are creating
experiences on Glass,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.080
make sure that you are testing
it both indoors and outdoors.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.500
Now, it is important
because some colors

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.710
may look different
on Glass compared

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.980
to how they look on
your computer monitor.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.020
This happens because Glass
is a transparent display.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.200
A color like black may
actually be just transparent.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.760
White may actually provide you
with the max amount of contrast

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.160
to improve the
legibility of your text.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.870
Make sure that you
are truly testing

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.390
all of your UIs, both
indoors and outdoors.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.020
Let's recap some of
the recommendations

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.710
we talked about.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.480
Use proper typography.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.570
If you have your own brand
related fonts, use them.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.270
But make sure that
they are following

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.700
the guidelines we talked about.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.440
Similarly, make sure that you're
using the standard templates,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.820
or at least using
them as guidelines

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:21.180
to create really rich, nice,
legible content on Glass.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.420
Make sure that the content
you are presenting to a user

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:29.300
is in small bite-size chunks
that they can easily digest.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.890
And lastly, make sure that
every single interface

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:38.490
you're creating on Glass, you
test both indoors and outdoors.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.870
As you go about creating
some amazing Glassware,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:48.200
think about what can you do on
Glass which can be done better

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.000
on Glass than any other device?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
At the same time, think
about some of the things

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.060
we talked about in this talk.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.480
Create the content
which is relevant

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.300
right down to the moment.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.220
Use voice for fast and
natural interactions.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.230
Work with some of the
standard patterns and styles

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.750
to create truly
useful Glassware.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.300
And finally, the better
you can do these things

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.620
together, the better the
experience for your users

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.760
is going to be.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.820
We have some amazing
documentation

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.550
on our developer website,
which you can take a look.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.110
At the same time,
make sure that you

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.100
continue exploring more and more
ways in which you can create

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.940
amazing experiences
for your users.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.920
Thank you very much.
