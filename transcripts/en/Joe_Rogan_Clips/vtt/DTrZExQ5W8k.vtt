The Joe Rogan experience.
Why you getting punched in the head?

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.880
What is going on with you?
I'm not getting punched hard.
How hard.
I mean,

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:09.740
sometimes there's a,

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.590
then my buddy Chris from Boston is a giant and heal by accident.

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.110
Sometimes you need to get connected and stuff,
but now you know,

6
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.020
you learn how to kind of keep your hands up,
but you're getting older.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.470
You're worried about that.
I'm insecure,
Bro.
But are you worried about your brain?

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.340
I sure and rattled.
I was a little cloudy.
I stopped for a little while.
Yeah.

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.610
So you're getting cloudy from getting hit.
I don't know.
I said to Brendan,
I said,

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.570
you know,
he has no time for this shit.
He gets so mad at me.
He just goes,

11
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:36.240
you're older.
What are you doing?
Oh,
you're getting that look like.
Yeah,

12
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:39.740
that's right.
That's what happens.
So keep that shit up,
man.
He storms off.
Yeah.

13
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.260
Well he,
he came to the realization,
you know,
he ducked.
He ducked.

14
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.470
He was,
oh,
I don't know.
He was sparring with Shane Carwyn.

15
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.260
It's not mark hoarding all those guys and,
and throwing up after,

16
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:55.920
after his training sessions and he played football forever.
I'll be all right.

17
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.720
Yeah.
Well right.
He quit though at the right time.

18
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.020
Is He really did.
Yes he did.
I mean he's fine.
Yes.
He,

19
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:06.810
he made it out at the right time.
I'm so invested in him like,

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.470
like he's my brother.
So whenever he talks about Sierra t I'm like,

21
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.640
I'm like see a CTM.
Like,
no,
you're okay.

22
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.920
Don't worry about it cause you're a doctor.
I go,
you're fine.

23
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.440
I promise it's not going to happen.
I don't like to think about it.

24
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.570
Well I mean he's,
he's honest.
If he wasn't doing good,
he'd tell you,

25
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.800
you know,
if he wasn't feeling good,
that's already true.

26
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.390
I think everybody needs someone who they trust implicitly that the can pull the

27
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:36.180
cord on them and to tell them,
hey man,
you got to stop getting hit.
Yes.

28
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.700
And for young fighters,
man,

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.430
it is such a hard decision to make.

30
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.800
I've talked to several guys who have to tell their fighter,

31
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.600
several trainers that have to tell their fighters to retire.
And it's never easy.

32
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.730
It's never easy.
And sometimes identity,

33
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.870
the fighter will leave and go with a different trainer and be successful and,

34
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.060
and the,
the,
you know,
and this one case,
the trainer was like,
I wish him well,

35
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.270
I'm an,
I'm sure he can still beat guys.
That's not the problem.

36
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.340
The problem is he's showing some obvious signs of deterioration mentally,

37
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.340
neurologically,
the way he moves,
the way he talks.

38
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.770
And a good person who cares about,
she was going to go,
okay,
we had a lot of fun.

39
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.050
It was a great run.
You're fine right now.

40
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.690
Like you can talk and we can treat whatever problems come up.

41
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.290
Apparently CBD is fantastic for that for a lot of people with brain issues and a

42
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:31.470
lot of,
you know,
inflammation issues because of trauma.

43
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.490
There's a lot of stuff they did,
I don't know,
magnetic stuff that pads and gone,

44
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.510
oh,
did right doing down in San Diego on soldiers where they put the electronics

45
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.500
guys doing that right now.
Seal Guy.
Yeah.
But I,
I,
um,

46
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.940
I don't think I've ever met a fighter who is retired who doesn't still feel like

47
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:50.440
they could fight for the belt.
Oh yeah.
They all want to give it up.

48
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.220
Even Chuck Liddell,
when he did fight and the kid was like,

49
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.160
I'd like to throw my hat in there.
I guess John Jones,
I'm a pretty good wrestler.

50
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.860
Like he was already 48.
Yeah.
You never lose that.

51
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:02.260
Part of what makes you a great fighter and a killer is that,

52
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.000
that's sort of love of the game.
If you asked Polly and how's you right now,

53
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.150
I guarantee,
I guarantee if you were like,
could you fight for a title right now?

54
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.660
He goes,
I thought,
put my ad in there.
Yeah.
Fighters like that.
Of course.
