00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.490
Why is Poop Brown?

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:14.930
Poop is brown due to bile from your gall bladder
being metabolized by the bacteria in your

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:15.930
intestines.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.500
This results in a byproduct called stercobilin,
which, in turn, makes poop look brown-ish.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.180
Without this stercobilin, your poop would
typically look grey-ish/white.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.910
Because of this, a sure sign you are having
problems with bile production, such as a blocked

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.859
bile duct by a gall stone or something more
serious like pancreatic cancer, is if you

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.859
notice your poop is this white/grey-ish color.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.440
In the end *pun intended*, brown poop is a
pretty good sign you are a relatively healthy

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.449
individual.

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.579
Some other common poop colors that generally
aren’t a good sign of health are as follows:

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.949
If you notice your poop is red, this could
be a sign of internal bleeding or could just

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.140
mean you’ve recently eaten beets.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.949
If the cause is bleeding and the bleeding
is from your stomach or throat, however, your

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.839
poop won’t be red, but rather black and
will smell worse than that time you decided

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.060
you should eat a box of Twinkies and a box
of Cheesy Handi-Snacks all in one sitting.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.350
Yellow poop means there is a lot of fat in
your feces.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.550
This is not a good sign.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.640
Consider turning this into a positive by making
poop candles with your fatty deposits.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.020
Yellow poop also has a very strong odor, which
will give your poo-candles that little something

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.020
extra.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:32.110
Green poop is an indicator of some sort of
bacterial infection or that you 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:49.680
are 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.280
a vegetarian and eat way too much leafy foods
