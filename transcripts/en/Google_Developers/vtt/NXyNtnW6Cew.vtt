COLT MCANLIS: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:01.700
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.550
COLT MCANLIS: Hello.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.956
Are we all properly boozed?

00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:05.830
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.860
COLT MCANLIS: Are we
all properly boozed?

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.510
AUDIENCE: Yes!

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.990
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.300
My name is Colt McAnlis.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.350
And I know I've gotten a lot of
weird confused emails and looks

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.100
in the past couple of
days about like what

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.720
is this Perf like
a Pirate thing?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.059
And so for those of you
who don't know what it is,

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:22.850
I want to give you a
little bit of history.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.980
So last year, we did this perf
matters meet up on SFHTML5.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.050
And it just randomly happened
to just weirdly land on Talk

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.130
Like a Pirate Day.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.850
And so I said, you know,
hey, how many times do you

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.760
get a chance to be
fired in your career?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.580
And so I'm going to do
the entire talk in pirate.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.770
So historically though, this
was a really we're anomale.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.270
Because after that,
that happened.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.760
For those of you on the live
stream, like autocomplete.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.850
No one cares about my Twitter
or my blog, Colt McAnlis pirate.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.120
Which I thought was great.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.990
But more importantly to me,
like apparently this talk

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.880
changed someone's life, right?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.120
Like "one minute in, and by far
the best talk I've ever seen."

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.420
I have no idea how to
help this man any further.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.830
First off, how do
you top that, right?

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.300
This man's life was changed
because of my crazy pirate

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.940
talk.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.260
Which is a little
awkward for me tonight.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.030
I mean here you
all are, pirated,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.879
and our cast our
crew is pirated.

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:41.420
And it's a little
awkward for me just

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.366
come up here and start
talking like a pirate, right?

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.338
AUDIENCE: No.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:48.020
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.655
Keep that enthusiasm.

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:51.030
So what we're
going to do tonight

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.790
to make sure that everybody
wants to talk like a pirate is

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.210
we're going to sing
a little pirate song.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.188
Together.

00:02:01.188 --> 00:02:02.470
AUDIENCE: Argh!

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.350
COLT MCANLIS: Argh.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.290
So I'm going to headstart here.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.354
I want to invite all
the speakers, everybody.

00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:09.520
I guess I'm keeping the mic?

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.230
So now everybody, if you want us
to talk like a pirate tonight,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.790
we need to hear you
sing, louder than us.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.880
Watch the words we're
going to have here, OK?

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.631
And make sure that
you sing along.

00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:27.880
This is going to be available
for download afterwards,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.900
by the way.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.193
I want to hear some ringtones
on the streets of San Francisco.

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.460
[PIRATE MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.480
There's a break.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.616
There's a break.

You got it that time.

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:15.666
All right, ready?

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:16.900

Now get off me stage,
you minus doubloons!

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.573
Let's get to what you
all came here for, aye?

00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:22.320
AUDIENCE: Aye.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.177
COLT MCANLIS: I said aye!

00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:24.760
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.990
COLT MCANLIS: Listen
here, you rascals.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.240
I didn't come here to hear
you bellow to your mothers.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.410
I said aye!

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.054

00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:32.720
COLT MCANLIS: That's
what we be hearing.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.280
My name be Captain Mainroach.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.370
And I'm here
tonight to teach you

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.530
how to keep your vessels running
smooth, and fast, and straight,

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.455
and through, through the
world of performance.

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:46.805
I think I swallowed a bug.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.596
Just give me a second.

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:54.096
Grog.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.740
Tonight we be here for one
thing, lads and lasses.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.360
I be here to teach you how to
properly plunder that battery

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.090
booty.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.590
Arr?

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.990
In order to understand
that, we need

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.990
to talk about your mobile ship.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.790
Yar she be a good vessel,
out about your day,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.500
helping you haul your
load, fight your battles,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.110
and upload pictures of
various parts of your anatomy

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.350
to the internet every day.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.580
It's a-- I'm on Snapchat.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.620
I see what goes on.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.360
And really most of you
shouldn't be on it.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.380
Except Peter, he's OK.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.400
He's a good looking
man over there.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.303
But everyone know that the crew
be the life of your ship, aye?

00:05:41.303 --> 00:05:42.210
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.543
COLT MCANLIS: I said the crew be
the battery of your ship, aye?

00:05:45.543 --> 00:05:46.250
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.375
COLT MCANLIS: That's right.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.480
But the fact is that you
be going about your day,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.080
plundering and pirating,
your crew is going to die.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.590
Yeah, it's true, it's true.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.200
The pirate's life
is hard with scurvy,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.890
and the scorn of the sea,
and checking your email

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.620
15 times a day.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.320
They just die.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.640
Arr, the cracking.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.530
Yes.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.740
That's a different metaphor.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.690
We'll get to that one later.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.070
But I like where you're going.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.760
So the question be, the more
you plunder, the more you do,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.710
the more your crew
dies, and the more you

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.914
need to get back to
port to get somewhere

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.580
to throw the dead
ones overboard and get

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.640
the nice live crew with
a real pulse, right?

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.430
Yar many a time we all be
cast to sea with our energy

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.280
crew thrown-- are we
getting the metaphors?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.190
Our energy crew be
thrown overboard,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.820
trying to find a charge
until we get back home.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.050
And the fine traders at
Purdue Pirate University--

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.230
go Fightin' Boilermakers-- did
a study of the top pirate ships

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.080
out in the sea.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.140
And what they found was that
these cockroaches of captains

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.410
had no care for how their
crew was being slain.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.360
They were letting the
entrails of their men

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.770
just be flaunted all over
the floorboards where

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.970
the gulls come and nest and
feed upon their entrails.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.940
For the standard
pirate activities

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.230
of tossing birds and
reporting the news, only 30%

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.020
of their slain crew actually
went to the pirate deeds

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.620
that they be doing.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.125
The other 70% of their
crew that they be slaying

00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:22.610
was gone to things like checking
whether there was an update

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.430
or figuring out whether or
not they can upload user data

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.510
or downloading
advertisements to display.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.290
And the truth is
these captains had

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.080
no idea what was eating
up all of their crew.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.780
It was as though there
were a magical shark, just

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.150
hiding aboard on their deck,
waiting to eat their crew

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.980
when they weren't
looking around.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.830
Land shark.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.340
Ship shark.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.330
AUDIENCE: Narwhal.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.885
COLT MCANLIS: Narwhal?

00:07:46.885 --> 00:07:47.885
AUDIENCE: Battery shark.

00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:49.051
COLT MCANLIS: Battery shark.

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:50.820
I like the crew tonight.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.540
Yar!

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.266
AUDIENCE: Yar!

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:54.140
COLT MCANLIS: When we
get this much feedback,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.380
it means the grog was good, aye?

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.510
Aye.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.624
I'm seeing the back rows
are not grogging enough.

00:07:59.624 --> 00:08:01.540
All right, the front,
quiet down for a second.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.450
I just want to hear the back.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.110
Aye!

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.254
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:05.420
COLT MCANLIS: Now the front.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.169
Aye!

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:06.752
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:08:09.015 --> 00:08:11.640
COLT MCANLIS: I'm going to give
you one more chance in the back

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.520
there.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.020
And then you go out, and
everybody else comes in.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.750
One more chance in the back.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.500
Aye!

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.390
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.778
COLT MCANLIS: All right.

00:08:19.778 --> 00:08:20.586
AUDIENCE: Front!

00:08:20.586 --> 00:08:21.450
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.104
Front!

00:08:23.104 --> 00:08:24.090
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:24.750
COLT MCANLIS: That's good.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.416
He caught you off
guard with the timing.

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:29.380
Anyhow, back to--
I had a point here.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.883
I was getting to it.

00:08:30.883 --> 00:08:32.799
There was a shark, and
it was eating your crew

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.400
when you weren't
paying attention.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.900
This is a really
important metaphor.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.260
I'll come back to
it in a minute.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.330
But the truth is that
captains and users,

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.572
and though they be paying
you and your pirates to go

00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:48.030
about your day plundering, and
pillaging, and bringing back

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.200
the spoils of your
activities to them,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.870
be understanding
that captains who

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.250
don't manage their
crew-slaying battery habits

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.980
are not good stewards to
be part of their fleet.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.630
And they be using
applications like Carrot

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.580
to identify bad applications
that be slaying crew

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.940
and using their battery unjustly
so that you can uninstall it

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.795
during the day and get rid of it
from killing more of your crew,

00:09:10.795 --> 00:09:11.420
like the shark.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:11.730
See?

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.771
It was an important point,
and I came back to it.

00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:16.380
That's called going
back to a point.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.840
I took a pirate-speaking course.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.270
It helped me, I think, clarify
my methods since last year.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.890
I got a lot of confused
emails from people

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.010
about what the
kraken was and why

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.240
I went into such
graphic detail about how

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.260
the pirates were slain.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.420
Also, some groups that were,
on behalf of pirates, let me--

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.090
Anyhow.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.850
Hashtag perf like a pirate.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.850
So the question be,
how long can you

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.910
be at sea plundering before
all your crew be dead?

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.540
Let's look at a
fully stocked Nexus 5

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.070
vessel from the queen's fleet.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.570
Aye.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.820
She be a pretty lass, although
covered with barnacles.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.628
The queen, I mean, not the boat.

00:09:56.628 --> 00:10:03.280
[LAUGHS] Aye.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.410
Onto the planks with you.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.500
A fully stocked
Nexus 5 vessel can

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.550
remain out at sea
for one month a time

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.050
before your crew
get bored and start

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.510
eating each other for fun.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.060
Mmm.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.081
We've all been there.

00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:19.180
But as you go through your
day, the more active things

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.580
ye be doing when you're
not in standby mode,

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.600
plundering along the shoreline
of cellular, and Wi-Fi,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.990
and wake lock, and screen,
can leave you stranded

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.190
in the middle of the
ocean without any crew

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.580
and just birds to
pick at your school.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.370
Not a good place to be.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.020
Sometimes, you see
these ads online

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.580
for like, free skull
pecking by a bird.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.600
Don't click on them.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.087
They're just money traps.

00:10:40.087 --> 00:10:41.670
Because you're like,
you talk to them,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.460
and you're like, of
course, we should go out.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.310
This would be great time.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.601
We could take the kids with us.

00:10:45.601 --> 00:10:48.264
But then you never use it.

00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:50.520
Oh.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.410
Apparently, that one
was a little too far.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.760
So every pirate captain
knows the golden rule,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.530
and that be that one
second of active pirating

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.170
and plundering be worth two
minutes of standby time out

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.980
in the ocean.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.560
This is a very important
metric for ye captains.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.980
This way, you can line up the
crew members you like least

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.280
and have them killed first.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.240
[LAUGHS] Arr!

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.650
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.934
COLT MCANLIS: I
found someone asleep.

00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:17.350
And so then, the
question we have,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.770
if we're doing 50 acts of
piracy for one second each

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.762
in a single hour, that's equal
to 100 minutes of standby time.

00:11:24.762 --> 00:11:26.470
Now, with these numbers,
it's pretty easy

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.670
to see how fast your
crew can be slain,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.200
leaving you adrift
in the wide open sea.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.382
It's math.

00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:35.965
We be pirates.

00:11:35.965 --> 00:11:37.520
I understand.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.315
But we should still
be able to do this.

00:11:40.315 --> 00:11:42.970
And if you can't do that math,
then what's going to happen

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.796
is the users and the people
financing your voyages are soon

00:11:45.796 --> 00:11:47.170
going to realize
that you may not

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.961
be a good steward of
your ship, and they'll

00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:50.780
stop financing and giving you--

00:11:55.928 --> 00:11:57.810
AUDIENCE: Walk the plank!

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.226
COLT MCANLIS:
Trying to figure out

00:11:59.226 --> 00:12:01.800
if that's coming from up here.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.860
No?

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.790
It's the shark.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.790
Yar.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.354
This is what we
call live internet.

00:12:06.354 --> 00:12:08.770
Someone's probably calling me
from the internet right now.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.242
Like, he's on TV!

00:12:10.242 --> 00:12:11.600
TV.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.602
Anyhow, the point be that unless
you be getting your battery

00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:17.060
handling under control, you're
going to end up with a ghost

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.136
ship out in the sea
with no one to finance

00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:20.510
your plundering
or your pirating.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.343
They won't be given you
any gold, any booty,

00:12:22.343 --> 00:12:24.040
or any rum, which as
we all know is not

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.280
why we're in this business.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.470
So Captain Mainroach here be
with three tales of pirate woe.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.390
Any man who does not
listen to these three tales

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.160
is set adrift on his own course.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.060
And I take no recourse
for his action.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.370
If you not be listening
to what I be saying today,

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.750
woe be you in Davy
Jones's locker.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.880
First, we'll be talking about
the ship the S.S. Wakelock.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.000
Yar, it be a good vessel but
had a naive captain running it.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.700
Very insecure he was
about his pirates, indeed.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.440
And he would wake up the crew
at very inopportune times

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:59.760
during the day and night
to do trivial things

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.750
like count the number of
cannon balls, or swab the deck,

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.390
or just look at the sky
and admire it together.

00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:08.960
We are pirates.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.490
We still have hearts.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.280
The sunset is good.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.150
But the naive
captain had one flaw.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.100
He woke up one day
in a mad frenzy

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.160
and couldn't control himself and
kept the pirate crew awake for

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.670
so long that they started
dropping over dead.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.930
They just fell, and fell,
and fell from exhaustion.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.110
He had depleted all
of his resources

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.860
simply because he
couldn't contain himself

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.680
and didn't let them
go back to sleep.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.110
And what happened was the
ship was sunk and eaten

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.910
by a giant sea turtle.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.670
So are we all clear
on the metaphor here?

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.415
OK, so really
quick, what this is,

00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:44.040
I'm talking about battery-- No.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.640
Once you say sea turtle,
you can't go back.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.440
So let us be learning from
the ship of the S.S. Wakelock.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.117
First off, there
be tasks that ye

00:13:52.117 --> 00:13:53.700
need to be doing in
the middle of sea.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.980
But there are other
tasks which you

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.610
can wait until you are plugged
in back to port to be doing,

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.260
for example, downloading
updates to your applications

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.415
or maybe doing some high compute
intensive task of moving cannon

00:14:03.415 --> 00:14:05.419
balls from one side of
your ship to the other.

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:07.210
You don't need to be
doing these out at sea

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.000
while your users are
trying to figure out

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.310
if you're a worthwhile
investment for their careers.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.580
Arr!

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.506
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:16.460
COLT MCANLIS: Arr!

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.043
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.170
COLT MCANLIS: I'm the captain.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.610
I can say that.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.370
Also, you need to
make sure that you

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.120
don't be waking your crew up
using a wakelock methodology.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.540
You want to be
moving to something

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.020
like a hierarchical
system of using an alarm

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.765
manager to handle it.

00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:35.320
Did everyone get it here?

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.400
It's a lock making wake.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.420
It's a nautical pun.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:38.920
See?

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.740
It's a lock, and
it's a wake lock.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.735
Laugh harder.

00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:45.546
Arr!

00:14:45.546 --> 00:14:46.560
AUDIENCE: Arr.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.540
COLT MCANLIS: I didn't write it.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.040
I'm sorry.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.665
This is my favorite
part of the whole--

00:14:51.665 --> 00:14:53.630
it's a lock making wake.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.927
I don't think you understand
how hard I worked on that.

00:14:56.927 --> 00:14:58.010
That was like a whole day.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.330
I just chuckled to myself
like, no, it's a lock.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.310
They sink normally,
and it's making wake.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.290
[MAN LAUGHING]

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.790
This man, someone
get him a t-shirt.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.070
And more rum.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.160
AUDIENCE: Yar!

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.570
COLT MCANLIS: Yar!

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.735
Now, let's talk
about the S.S. HTTPS.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.810
Apparently, we know
about this ship.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:23.490
It was run by a vile
captain, the Duke of HTTPS,

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.080
who had a love on the
mainland named servlet.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.170
And he loved to spend all
of his time communicating

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.010
with the fair lass
that he wanted to wed.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.650
But when he was out at sea,
he couldn't do that easily.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.490
So he had to find a way
to transfer his message

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.310
packets back to her in
an efficient manner.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.460
But the only thing
he could come up with

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.270
were vile demon birds that
used the blood of his crew

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.920
to initiate their
transfer protocol.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.507
What is that noise?

00:15:53.507 --> 00:15:55.090
I'm going to ignore
it and keep going.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.890
This is an important point.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.150
I don't want to touch anything.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:02.685
Is someone Instagramming me?

00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:05.700
I told you to put that away.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.920
Anyhow, these
birds out here, how

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.020
they work-- describing birds
now because this thing-- so

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.050
the vile birds used one simple
methodology to fly around.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.450
He would have to slit the
throat of one of his crew

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.110
to wake the bird
from its slumber

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:20.880
before it could
make its mission.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.610
And then, he would
have to keep killing

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.500
the crew at regular intervals
after the bird took flight

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.640
in case he needed to find his
way back with the messages.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.890
Everyone getting the metaphor?

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:32.920
We'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.930
So one Christmas morning,
the Duke of HTTPS

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.080
decided to send many messages
of love, and lust, and promises

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.610
of smooching to his
crew-- or not to his crew,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.502
to his servlet.

00:16:45.502 --> 00:16:48.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.725
I guess the bird wouldn't
have to actually fly that far.

00:16:54.104 --> 00:16:56.020
So wait, if he were
sending those to his crew,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.542
why would he be
slaughtering them?

00:16:57.542 --> 00:16:58.500
AUDIENCE: One too many.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.490
COLT MCANLIS: One too many?

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.430
OK, let's back it up.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.180
Let's back it up.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.080
He's talking to
servlets on the mainland

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.910
using the birds
that eat his crew.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.710
We're going to get
this back in line

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.730
now with the binging
and everything else.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.440
We can recover.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.359
We can recover from this.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:11.859
Yar!

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:14.170
Yar!

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.560
AUDIENCE: We're drunk!

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.020
COLT MCANLIS: I
pulled something.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.970
So these vile birds would then
slaughter his crew and return

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:21.910
with messages.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.430
But on this Christmas Day,
he spent so much times

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.069
sending messages to his
lovely servlet on the mainland

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.310
that he ended up
slaughtering all of his crew

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.600
before he realized it.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.200
Now, those same demon
birds run his ship,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.710
and it's captained by the
ruthless Captain Featherbeak.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.760
I hate this bird.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.885
It pecked at my head for
way too long one day.

00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:44.010
Remember that head pecking
vacation I talked about?

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.140
This is the guy.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.650
Just don't click on it.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:48.540
OK, moving on.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.890
So let us learn
from the mistakes

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.000
of Captain Duke of HTTPS.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.870
First off, know
what kind of bird

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.650
you be using for what kind
of transfer you be using.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.630
You don't need to be sending
out packets when you only

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.300
have a 2G bird available.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:03.800
Why?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.120
Because a 2G bird
requires the death

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.720
of more crew members to
effectively communicate back

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.680
with the mainland.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.640
If you can batch your
messages and wait

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.650
until you may be closer
to use a Wi-Fi bird,

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.240
this is going to slaughter
less of your crew.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.417
Wi-Fi bird, nocturnalis
erapis is the--

00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:21.250
AUDIENCE: Lazy load.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.750
COLT MCANLIS: Lazy
load, yes, that's

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.344
the name, the scientific
Wi-Fi bird name.

00:18:26.344 --> 00:18:27.760
In addition to
that, you shouldn't

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.950
be doing the rookie mistake
of every pirate captain

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.520
and sending your
birds to mainland,

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.740
waiting to see whether or
not they respond to you.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.200
No, you should be using the
tried and true technique

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.880
of bartering with the
commissioner of that fair town,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.640
and have them send you data
when things have changed.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.120
Such a barter is often known as
Google Cloud Messaging system.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.120
Yes, this way, you
slaughter less of your crew.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.960
And they send the birds to you,
and they slaughter their crew.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.380
This is actually a very
highly important technique

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.505
to keeping your ship crew alive.

00:18:55.505 --> 00:18:56.380
Hashtag perf matters.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:56.880
Yar.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.370
Are we getting all the
metaphors at this point?

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.570
Now, when you're
out in the ocean,

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.150
it's important to know what
kind of resolution you be using.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.460
And sometimes, you be sending
the birds up ahead of you

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.220
to be looking
around and charting

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.797
the area for where you are.

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:14.380
Now, it's important to know that
the higher you send the bird,

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.690
the less energy it uses.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.280
It's a thermal updraft system.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.780
So you need to make
sure that you're

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.670
using the right resolution
bird to get your GPS.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.160
I worked on this one a
little too hard, I think.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.650
The main thing is
if you don't need

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.720
to be using a bird that
gives you one meter accuracy,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.210
you should wait to be using a
bird that gives you two mile

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:40.590
accuracy or what we
call network GPS, yar?

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.550
Familiar with network
GPS, hands up.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.220
Yar, also triangles.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.300
Familiar with
triangles, hands up!

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.940
For those of you who
didn't raise your hands,

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.230
let's try that again.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.700
We're talking about a triangle.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.010
Do you know what a triangle is?

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.450
Still some hands that are
really unsure if they'd

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.380
like to participate in
tonight's activities.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.080
Does the fact that everyone's
wearing a pirate hats--

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.125
you're in on this.

00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:10.500
You either raise your hand,
or I'm going to keep talking.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.940
Do you know triangles?

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:14.760
Yar!

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.289
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:16.289 --> 00:20:17.830
COLT MCANLIS: One
of them in the back

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.832
was like-- he wanted
to check first

00:20:21.832 --> 00:20:23.290
if everyone else
was going to admit

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.637
to having triangles
in their repertoire.

00:20:26.637 --> 00:20:28.470
He's like, oh, yes, and
me-- oh, no, I mean,

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.340
no, I don't know
anything about triangles.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.120
I'm not that guy.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.290
Please don't contact me
for job opportunities.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.060
Yar.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.770
You all be a strange crew.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.970
Also importantly, when
you let your crew sleep,

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.990
make sure you bring
your birds back in.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.850
Don't keep your GPS awake when
your application be sleeping.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.660
Because otherwise,
your birds will land.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.029
There will be no crew on deck.

00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:57.070
And they'll just start
eating anything and anyone

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.910
they want while ye be sleeping.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:01.384
This is actually a
large, large problem

00:21:01.384 --> 00:21:02.800
with application
performance, just

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.620
eating all of your crew members
while you're actually asleep,

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.890
because they can't
defend themselves, right?

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.760
Because they're asleep, and
it's a bird, and it's evil,

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.640
and it teleports, and sometimes
it wakes up in the night just

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.520
staring at me.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.890
But we're not here to talk
about my problems anymore.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.428
Hastag perf like a pirate, yar!

00:21:20.428 --> 00:21:23.296
AUDIENCE: Yar!

00:21:23.296 --> 00:21:28.060
COLT MCANLIS: Now I got one
final story for you tonight.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.020
It's more of a song, really.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:30.800
Well, not a song.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.140
We already did that.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.710
I want to tell you the
story of Captain Lubberz.

00:21:38.754 --> 00:21:39.420
It's very small.

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.410
You didn't see it.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.750
Captain Lubberz
was a mad captain.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.600
His ship had to be bright.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.890
So he set his crew aflame
to create the light.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:54.548
But when his crew were
through, he lit the ship, too.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.059
Something, something
light-- yes.

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:02.100
I'm a pirate, not a poet.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.218
Get over it.

00:22:04.218 --> 00:22:07.715
I was supposed to click
while that happened.

00:22:07.715 --> 00:22:08.920
Let me try that again.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.967
So there was a mad captain.

00:22:10.967 --> 00:22:12.300
He wanted his ship to be bright.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.780
He set his crew on fire
to create the light.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:16.530
And then, it burned
down because he really

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.400
didn't have a fire
extinguisher back then.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.150
And how did they set fire?

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.680
Never mind.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.000
And the truth be
that the brightness

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.330
of your mobile vessel does
have a direct correlation

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.240
to how many crew be slain.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.960
The brighter your
vessel, the more skulls

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.880
packed upon my graph here.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.010
Yar?

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.610
But the problem is as a
captain application developer,

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.580
you really don't
have too much control

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.090
over the brightness of the
OLED ship manufacturing, right?

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.380
Although some of the
very smart captains out

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.640
there are realizing that
they do have some control,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.056
and this is worthwhile to the
users of their applications.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:57.650
The thing you need to learn here
is if you don't have to burn

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.710
your crew, don't.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.180
Or if you can, only burn
the left half of your crew,

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.350
like my grandma used to do.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.460
Bless her zombie bones.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.930
There's some
applications out there

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.410
who understand that
they can modify

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.500
the brightness of their
pixels on their screen

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.880
to use less battery life, which
is very important for smaller

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.360
devices which may not
have larger crews.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.440
This is still a very
large problem today

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.703
with some form factor
ships out there.

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:28.230
AUDIENCE: Once you go
black, you don't go back.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:35.830
COLT MCANLIS: Uh, uh, moving on.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.940
I want to tell you something
about one of our fine pirate

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.940
captains that'll also
be speaking today.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.540
It's pirate Ilya Grigorik.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.360
Everyone say it, Ilya Grigorik.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.580
When he comes up, you have to
say it that way, "Grigaarrik."

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.163
When it starts to hurt, that's
when you know you hit the right

00:23:57.163 --> 00:23:59.290
number of R's.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.330
Captain Ilya has a
fantastic saying that we all

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.890
try to live by here on
Perf like a Pirate Day,

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.282
and that's you can optimize
what you can measure.

00:24:06.282 --> 00:24:08.490
And most of the time, when
your crew be slaughtering,

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.930
you need to know what's causing
it so you can effectively

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.520
go in and fix the problem.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.220
Now, there's a fantastic
plug-in to your ship.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.020
Well, specifically from
Qualcomm's class vessels

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:26.440
into the Eclipse
floorboards, that

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.770
allows you to monitor how
your crew be getting slain.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:33.187
This is a fine
tool called TERPN,

00:24:33.187 --> 00:24:35.020
and you can find it at
the lower link there.

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.930
It's really important
how these tools work.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.560
Effectively, they
allow you to see

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.920
how standard parts
of your mobile device

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.580
be eating up battery
so that you can find

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.110
a correlation about how the
network radio may be on,

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.530
and the vultures
may be buzzering,

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.488
and how that may be
actually slaying your crew.

00:24:51.488 --> 00:24:53.200
This will allow you
to then pinpoint

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.350
what parts of your
application ship

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.890
stack you can then go in,
and find, and optimize.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:24:59.630
We all got that?

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.390
Fantastic.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.320
They're giving me the time.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.850
The other one is a fine tool
from the new Android tool suite

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:08.580
called Battery Historian.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.910
It actually gives you a
lot more counter power

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.090
than TREPN does
and it actually has

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.580
new counters for the
Android L release

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.670
to get even more information
about battery performance

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.151
on your mobile device.

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:20.650
Arr!

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.434
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:25:21.434 --> 00:25:22.770
COLT MCANLIS: I had to
say that because someone

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.725
checked his watch.

00:25:23.725 --> 00:25:24.655
Arr!

00:25:24.655 --> 00:25:26.050
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.130
COLT MCANLIS: That be it
for me, lads and lasses.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.430
Thank you for listening to me.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.234
Remember, perf
like a pirate, yar!

00:25:33.234 --> 00:25:35.198
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:44.036 --> 00:25:45.450
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Did you swap out?

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.794
MALE SPEAKER 2: I got it.

00:25:46.794 --> 00:25:48.252
MALE SPEAKER 3:
Great presentation.

00:25:52.212 --> 00:25:54.086
MALE SPEAKER 4: I'm just
getting my computer.

00:25:54.086 --> 00:25:57.610
MALE SPEAKER 5: What
type of watch is that?

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:59.860
COLT MCANLIS: It's
just a [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.040
I'll take your flash.
