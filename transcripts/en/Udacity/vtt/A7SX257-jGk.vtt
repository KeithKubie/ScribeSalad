00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.620
Since these problems have
been around for a long time,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.350
why are we only now getting
around to solving them?

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.970
One reason is the increasing
incidence of chronic disease for

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.540
at least the two reasons
illustrated here.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.630
As you probably know, people are living
longer, as we can see by comparing

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.270
the green bars, from 1999 to 2000, with
the blue bars, only ten years later.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.560
Chronic disease rates increase with age.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.690
So, that's reason one.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.439
Moreover, in large part due to
behavioral issues such as increase in

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.560
obesity, the rates of chronic disease
have increased significantly,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.080
even over this relatively
short time period.
