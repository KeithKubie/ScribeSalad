00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.320
Bootstrapping can really,
really test your soul in a lot of ways.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.270
You have to have a thick,
thick skin because

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.590
people are going to tell you that
what you're doing isn't valuable or

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.780
they're not going to see your
perspective, so you have to have

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.600
resolute belief in your core goal for
you to be successful in this space.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.430
Bootstrapping is often looked at as or
it can be looked at as you're crazy or

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.830
that's never going to work or
how could anybody find value in that.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.610
You'll hear a lot of naysayers and I
think it's overcoming the mental games,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.420
both externally and internally,
that are what makes bootstrapping hard.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.950
You can't listen to the negative
voices that are are telling you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.580
you can't do it.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.670
If you've started off with
the belief that you can,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.470
test that theory all the way through.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.230
You owe it to yourself.
