00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:03.504
WHY THEY WERE HERE.

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:05.439
WE WERE BOTH
GETTING WHAT WE WANTED.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.741
I GOT TO WORK THROUGH
MY NERVOUSNESS AROUND WOMEN--

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:10.911
SORRY, I'M KIND OF SHAKING.
- DON'T BE NERVOUS.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.113
[laughs] DON'T BE NERVOUS,
THAT'S SO CUTE.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.214
[laughs]

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:15.682
- AND THEY
GOT TO BE ON TV.

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.887
- I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE EVERYONE
INTRODUCED TO KANGEN WATER.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.656
THIS WATER IS ONE OF
THE BEST WATERS OUT THERE.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.158
IT HAS A PH OF 9.5.

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:26.727
- I'D NEVER BEEN
THAT GOOD OF A FLIRT,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.129
BUT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
TO PRACTICE WITH SO MANY

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.964
BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:34.334 line:0%
 
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL EYES
AND BEAUTIFUL LIPS,

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:39.039 line:0%
 
AND LOVELY HAIR,
AND YOUR STYLE IS...

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:40.774 line:0%
 
WONDERFUL.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:44.378
- OH...THANKS, NATE.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:45.646
[awkward laugh]

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.750
- SO TELL ME YOUR
DEEPEST, DARKEST SECRET.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:53.687
- MY DEEPEST,
DARKEST SECRET IS...

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.069
I DON'T LIKE WEARING SOCKS.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.938
- THAT'S GREAT.

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:12.306
BUT AS THE NIGHT PROGRESSED...

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.074
- OH, COOL.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.275
- MAGIC.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.711
MY FLIRTING SKILLS
DRASTICALLY IMPROVED.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.646
- DO YOU RIDE MOTORCYCLES?
I MEAN--

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.151
- I DON'T RIDE A MOTORCYCLE,
BUT I AM A BIT OF A BAD BOY.

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:27.087
BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED.
