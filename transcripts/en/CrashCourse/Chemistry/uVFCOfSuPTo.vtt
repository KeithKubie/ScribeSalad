00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.810
Over the last 52 weeks I've enjoyed sharing
with you my fascination with biology.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.720
If you've been through it with us, you've
now got yourself now a pretty deep and complex

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.110
understanding of how life functions, from
the chemistry that makes cells work to the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.090
ecosystems that make the planet work.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.529
And it's never too late to catch up on those
biology and ecology courses; they'll be here

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.210
on Youtube forever.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.119
But it's time to move onto something new.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.979
Something bigger because it's smaller, more
beautiful because it's invisible, more powerful

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:29.519
because it's everything.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.279
Crash Course Chemistry.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.450
My undergraduate degree is actually in chemistry,
and I've been a lifelong lover of this subject,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.219
not just the rules, and laws, and the bonds,
and the coefficients.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.860
But of the men and women who shaped this science
that deepened our understanding of the world

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.210
so magnificently.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.109
The Siberian misanthrope who would revolution
our understanding of matter.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.179
The German war criminal who saved a billion
lives.

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.140
The French aristocrat who created the science
of chemistry and all he got for his trouble

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.140
was beheaded.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.600
And of course all of these stories exist within
the greatest science ever.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.840
What is matter made of?

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.770
How and when do atoms come together and break
apart?

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.159
What is an electron?

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.619
Why is silver's chemical symbol Ag?

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.930
How do we fix global warming and live forever?

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.689
The answers to all of these questions (except
for the last two) will be contained within

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:20.689
this course.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.100
But those last two, if and when they get solved
I guarantee you will be solved with the help

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100
of chemistry.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.890
And we'll be doing it in this beautiful new
set that was designed and created by Nick

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.890
Jenkins.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.360
And our graphics team, our graphics team,
will be 'Thought Cafe'.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.990
Which is what 'Thought Bubble' has turned
into.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.860
We're slaving away on Crash Course Chemistry
now and the first episode should be hitting

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.360
your subscription box within the next couple
of weeks.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.939
Until then, feel free to check out any of
the biology that you may have missed, and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.400
we'll see you soon.
