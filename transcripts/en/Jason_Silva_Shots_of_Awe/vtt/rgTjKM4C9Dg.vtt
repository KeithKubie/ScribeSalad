00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.950
SUBJECT: So the
smartphone revolution,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.080
the revolution in
connectivity, has

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.010
created an on-demand economy.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.020
As Kevin Kelly
says, access is now

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.610
more important than
ownership, the idea

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.760
that goods and services are
just a rub on a magic mirror

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.600
away from being fulfilled.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.820
This notion of extending
our will, magic,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.700
as Aleister Crowley described
it, as willed intent.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.840
I summon, and it appears.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.470
As I imagine, so it becomes.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.882
And this is the very essence of
magic, which is a great line.

00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:42.840
And this is the world
that we're living in now.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.550
Services like Uber,
services like Airbnb,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.600
that will literally summon the
ability to go stay somewhere

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.530
and the means to get there
at the speed of thought,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.664
almost, are scaling
to the point that we

00:00:54.664 --> 00:00:58.210
are seeing a transformation
in our phenomenological

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.140
experience.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.350
We are creating a
technologically-mediated flow

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.710
where most of the world becomes
an extension of our agency.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.450
I mean, even the fact that
Uber can sync with your Spotify

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.890
playlist, so that when
you summon the car

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.240
to take you to the place
that you want to go,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.050
the car arrives and the
music that you've previously

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.530
soundscaped is already
playing in the car,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.310
giving you the serendipitous
experience of moving

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.890
into spaces where all of a
sudden, everything's amazing.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.050
This is the song I like.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.050
This is the place I want to go.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.940
Oh, let's go somewhere.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.350
Oh, here's the
car picking me up.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.300
Oh my god, I want to go stay at
this beautiful mountain town.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.820
Oh my god, here's the
apartment waiting for me.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.880
Just an Airbnb again.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.950
I mean, this on-demand economy
is transforming subjectivity.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.590
When we surrender into
it, when we surrender

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.970
into the space and the
speed of the feedback

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.387
loops between our
creative choices

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:46.761
and what is able to be summoned
through our technological

00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:48.690
extensions, our
technological scaffoldings,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.920
we actually step into a
new space of consciousness.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.430
We step into a new way
of perceiving reality.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.420
The whole thing becomes
mental architecture.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.870
We cognitize the world.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.420
That's the AI revolution.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.640
That is the on-demand economy.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.669
We extend our cognition, our
mental neuroarchitecture,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.400
out into the world.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.620
It all becomes dream space.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.390
It all becomes elusive dream.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.170
It all becomes an inception
that we can control.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.170
That's what's promised
by the on-demand economy.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.060
I find it very exciting.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.960
Very exciting.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.510
