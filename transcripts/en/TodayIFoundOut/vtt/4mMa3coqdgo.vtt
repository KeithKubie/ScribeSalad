00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:12.420
That Time the US Accidentally Nuked Britain's
First Satellite

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.460
When it comes to nations with a long and rich
history of space travel and exploration, Britain

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.329
isn’t normally a country that comes to most
people’s minds.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.050
However, they were the third country in the
world to operate a satellite in orbit.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.869
It’s just a shame America ended up accidentally
killing it just a few months later…

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.520
The satellite in question was the Ariel-1,
which was developed as a joint-venture between

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.180
the United States and Britain, with Britain
designing and building the core systems of

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.020
the satellite and NASA launching it into orbit
via a Thor-Delta rocket.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.580
The UK scientists first proposed the idea
for Ariel-1 to NASA in 1959 after NASA made

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.620
an offer to help fly the scientific equipment
of other nations into space.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.830
Due to the close relationship between the
two countries, details were easily and quickly

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.579
worked out and by the following year, scientists
in the UK were given the go ahead to start

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.380
creating the instrumentation needed, while
engineers in the US began work on the satellite

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.620
that would house the equipment.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.930
On the 26th of April, 1962, the first international
space effort ever was launched into space

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.500
and Britain was operating its first satellite.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.580
According to NASA, the instruments aboard
Ariel-1 were intended to help “contribute

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.280
to the current knowledge of the ionosphere”
and its relationship with the Sun.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.020
More specifically, scientists were curious
about how the ionosphere, a part of the Earth’s

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.620
atmosphere made of particles charged by radiation
from the Sun, worked.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.690
(For more on the ionosphere, see: Why Do Radio
Signals Travel Farther at Night than in the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.690
Day?)

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.960
To accomplish its mission, Ariel-1 was loaded
with a tape recorder for storing collected

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.850
data, a device designed to measure solar radiation,
and several instruments used to measure how

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.140
the various particles in the ionosphere reacted
and changed in response to external stimuli

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.990
from the cosmos, most notably the Sun.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.830
On July 9, 1962, mere weeks after Ariel-1
was put into orbit and had successfully begun

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.510
transmitting data about the ionosphere back
to Earth, British scientists were shocked

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.830
when the sensors aboard Ariel-1 designed to
measure radiation levels suddenly began to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.840
give wildly high readings.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.830
Initially, they assumed that the satellite’s
instruments had failed or were otherwise just

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.830
malfunctioning.

Starfish Explosion as Seen from Honolulu

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.430
As it turned out, as Ariel-1 was happily free-falling
around the Earth, the US military had decided

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.239
to detonate an experimental 1.4 megaton nuclear
weapon named Starfish-Prime in the upper atmosphere

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.520
as part of Project Fish Bowl.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.940
The explosion, which happened on the other
side of the planet to Ariel-1, sent a wave

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.870
of additional radiation around the Earth that
ultimately damaged some of the systems on

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.110
Ariel-1, particularly its solar panels, ultimately
killing it and about 1/3 of the rest of the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.660
satellites in low-Earth orbit at the time.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.690
This famously included the Telstar satellite,
which was the first commercial communication

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.770
relay satellite designed to transmit signals
across the Atlantic.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.900
The Telstar actually wasn’t in orbit at
the time of the explosion, being put there

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.150
the day after the Starfish-Prime detonation.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.410
However, the additional radiation created
by the explosion took years to dissipate and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.790
was not anticipated by the designers of this
particular satellite.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.379
The immediate result being the degradation
of Telstar’s systems, particularly the failure

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.709
of several transistors in the command system,
causing it to stop working just a few months

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.620
after being placed in orbit.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.620
As to the purpose of the Starfish-Prime explosion,
according to James Fleming, a history professor

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.990
who combed through previously top-secret files
and recordings concerning the blast, the U.S.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.190
military were working with scientist James
Van Allen to see if nuclear explosions could

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.900
influence the existing belts of radiation
around the Earth.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.040
Van Allen apparently started working with
the military to launch nukes into these belts

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.490
the very same day he announced to the world
that he’d discovered the belts, now known

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.650
as the Van Allen radiation belts.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.750
Flemming noted of this,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.970
“This is the first occasion I’ve ever
discovered where someone discovered something

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:25.930
and immediately decided 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:33.990
to blow it up.”

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.400
He forgot to mention the obligatory, FOR SCIENCE!!!
