00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.879
Whoa.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.980
Where'd you come from?

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.360
The future.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.430
Time travel is real?

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.430
Yeah.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.980
You have no idea.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.000
But why did you time travel back to this moment
in time?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.349
I'm just typing an email.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.231
Cause I just saw the movie Looper with you.

00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:34.600
You know that movie where they send people
back in time to kill people, and then Bruce

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.500
Willis and Joseph Gordon Levitt are--
Yeah, I kind of wanted to see that.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.640
--the same person?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.739
Yeah, don't see it.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.949
Well, why not?

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.370
Because you're going to hate it.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.479
It's not bad.

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:44.540
It's actually awesome.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.620
But you're going to nitpick all the time travel
logic stuff.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.330
Well, I do think it's interesting the movie
thinks one guy can be in one time twice and

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.120
not cause some kind of space-time continuum
issues.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
Right.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.120
Exactly.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.520
That's just one of the things you're going
to find a problem with.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.670
Like, at the end, he's trying to kill this
guy that becomes evil, but, you know, trying

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.440
to kill him is what makes him turn evil in
the first place.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.440
That's impossible.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.610
Yeah, I know.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.610
That's my point.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.760
You're going to nitpick all the time travel
logic--

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.390
So you've come back in time to warn me, to
stop me from seeing the movie.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.390
Right.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.390
Right.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.040
Doesn't that create a paradox in and of itself?

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.040
How?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.160
You know, like, if you're successful, and
I decide not to see the movie, you can't be

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.160
here.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.210
You'd have to disappear.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.270
I think I'd be willing to disappear if it
means I don't have to listen to you complain

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.760
about this movie forever.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.760
Okay.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.150
I won't see it then.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.260
Thank you very--
He did disappear.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.979
There's no paradox.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.180
I'm gonna see it anyway.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.450
Dude, what the f*ck?!
