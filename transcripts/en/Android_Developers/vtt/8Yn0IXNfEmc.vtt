00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.930
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hello everyone.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.260
My name is Reto Meier and welcome to This
Week in Android Development for October 1st,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.260
2012.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.060
Last week on Android Developers Live, we broadcast
from our brand new studio balanced a hair's

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.090
breadth from the gaping maw of a formless
void that threatens to expand and engulf us

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.900
all in its speechless depths.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.500
Each week we'll be throwing a team member
into the depths of the void in an effort to

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.240
appease our shapeless dread overlords.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.079
In Android Design in Action last Tuesday Roman
and Nick took Glimmer and Camera Zoom FX out

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.119
behind the woodshed for a full UX makeover.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.179
Check out the video to see how they fared.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.510
On Thursday we invited the camera App Clinic
patients to be interviewed on Android Developers

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.510
Strike Back.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.510
Then on Friday, Ian and Dan hosted the Friday
Games Review.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.859
Watch as Dan bravely continues the broadcast
despite being under constant mind control

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.500
attack from one of the void's nameless terrors.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.190
And on the App Clinic, Ian and I found an
innovative solution to planning our holidays

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.179
on company time by reviewing travel planning
and booking apps.

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.489
As always you can find all of last week's
shows and the schedule for this week at Google

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.489
Developers Live.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.929
That's developers.google.com/live/android.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:56.859
Coming up this week, catch our Wednesday Office
Hours.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.269
Live from London, Mountain View, and Sydney.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.420
Then on Thursday, Roman and Nick take a shot
at travel planning apps, World Scope, webcams,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.420
and Kayak.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.850
On Thursday's Developers Strike Back, we'll
invite them and the other travel booking apps

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.680
developers to provide feedback on our feedback
from the safe distance of a Hangout.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.500
On this Friday's App Clinic we're taking a
look at video player apps at our regular new

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.180
time of 10:30 AM Pacific.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.479
Then later that afternoon, Dan will continue
his battle to the death with the void creature

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.500
of your choice.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.640
Use the Moderator page link here to nominate
Dan's terrifying opponent and the games you'd

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.399
like his co-host to review.

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.880
In other Android development news, after a
spirited debate over which '80's power ballad

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.920
best describes our team's feelings for the
Android Developer community, our final options

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.979
settled on either the Developer Relations
director's Billy Rutledge's suggestion of

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.619
classic Whitney Houston ballad, "I Will Always
Love You" and Director of Product Management

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.880
Hugo Barra's choice of LMFAO's "Sexy And I
Know It."

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.399
Before recording of either could begin, Executive
Chairman Eric Schmidt declared our devotion

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.490
to developers Gangnam style while visiting
the Google office in Korea.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.799
Last week also saw the release of Android
miniature collection series three from Dead

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.799
Zebra.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.980
Series three features 14 awesome blindbox
designs from a variety of artists.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.820
We also saw the launch of Google Play services.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.570
A new platform that offers Android app integration
with other Google products such as Google+.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.369
Check out the Android Developers blog to see
how Google Play Services makes OAuth2 authorization

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.240
available to Android apps with good user experience
and security.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.800
A recent internal debate on improving the
developer experiences concluded that we should

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.750
give those developers some badges.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.900
Developers love badges.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.870
I'm happy to announce that these new badges
are now available under the Distribute tab

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.560
on the Android developer's site.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.090
Developers looking to improve the display
performance of their apps can now take advantage

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.092
of the new Systrace Guide that explains how
to use Systrace tool to collect and review

00:02:29.092 --> 00:02:33.150
code execution data from your app in the Android
system, to improve the performance of your

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.150
app.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.330
In new and updated apps this week, The New
York Times and Workout Trainer by Skimble

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.730
both released updates.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.261
Starting this week I'll be interviewing a
different member of the Android Developer

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.790
Relations team in This Week in Android Development.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.040
Here's Ian Ni-Lewis answering the question
"Where do you see yourself in five years?"

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hello everyone, my name is Reto Meier
and welcome to This Week in Android Development.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.120
&gt;&gt;Reto: That was Ian Ni-Lewis offering some
insight into his fondest hopes and dreams.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.480
That's all for This Week in Android Development.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.640
We look forward to you joining us for our
many live shows this week.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.430
And remember, you don't know you're beautiful.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.489
That's what makes you beautiful.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.489
My name is Reto Meier.

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:01.780
Thanks for watching.
