00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:08.940
This exhibition was made in conjunction with
the centennial of the 1917 Russian Revolution,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.400
and it kind of covers the very flourishing
period of the Avant-Garde from 1912 through

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.400
1935.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.370
What we call the Russian Avant-Garde is a
group of artists that includes visual artists,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.340
poets, literary people, and of course, filmmakers
who revolutionized the way in which we are

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.620
looking at art.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:38.579
The Russian artists were looking at the European
Avant-Garde—artists working especially in

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.249
Paris and Italy with Cubism and Futurism.

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:51.149
They took all of these ideas, but then they
kind of transformed them into a much more

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.300
radical vocabulary that was nonrepresentational.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.829
Malevich looked at the visual components as
abstract components.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.159
In fact, as forms that were in supremacy over
nature.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.710
Malevich was interested in flying.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.830
He had studied, actually, aerial photography.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.939
So you here have a composition that is gravity-less,
that doesn’t present the usual perspectival

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:36.509
point of Western compositions, but rather
sort of destabilizes the viewer from the usual

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.409
way that we are used to looking at works.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.520
This “White on White” composition probably
is one of the most iconoclastic works in the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.219
history of the early Avant-Garde, and what
you will notice here is an emphasis on the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:04.640
materiality of the paint itself, on texture,
on color, on the white-on-white and the different

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.780
nuances between them, on a kind of asymmetrical
composition.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.180
One of the main questions, in fact, that we
had in putting this exhibition together was

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.680
how can revolution exist in an object, in
an artistic process, in a new theorization

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.260
of art?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.700
And it’s interesting how the Russian Avant-Garde,
in fact, even before the Revolution, even

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.040
before 1917—they were so fed up with artistic
tradition that they wanted to revolutionize

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.970
their society through their artistic production.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.560
So they were kind of creating a tabula rasa.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.310
Through Suprematism, Malevich was creating
a zero degree form.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.690
The Constructivists were less idealistic.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.360
They were less about the supremacy of form
and more about the materiality of form, more

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.770
about the objectivity of form.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.360
And in fact, Rodchenko has done a “Black
on Black” composition which was in direct

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.380
response to the “White on White” of Malevich.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.750
And at this time, as I said, he works as a
constructor, so he uses very simple materials

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.710
and very simple tools such as a compass and
a ruler to create a series of drawings that

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.629
you see here.

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:39.739
And also he develops a theory of Linearism
because “line” is basically a kind of

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.269
mathematical concept, so it’s very rooted
in praxis.

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:55.110
Rodchenko here resists the idea of transcendence,
of infinity, of the supremacy—of Suprematism—that

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:03.050
Malevich was developing, and so he introduces
a non-color which is black in order to kind

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:11.060
of draw your attention more to what he called
the “faktura”—the kind of material support

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:18.250
of the canvas, the very objective aspect of
the materiality of paint itself.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:26.700
Rodchenko was very proud to say that in 1921
he has given the deathblow to painting and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.919
renounced it in favor of photography and film
and design.

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:38.830
Rodchenko was not a photographer, not a professional
photographer, but he was experimenting with

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.630
photography in the same way as before he experimented
with painting and sculpture.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.270
And you can see the extraordinary ability
of Rodchenko, of using different types of

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.250
camera angles, extraordinarily dynamic camera
angles.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.740
From below with this pioneer girl, creating
her as monumental.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.669
Extreme close ups also.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.660
Cinema was extraordinarily important, but
not only cinema but different theories of

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.660
montage.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.790
Here you are looking at Dziga Vertov who was
an extraordinary film director, and the film

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.240
is called Man With a Movie Camera.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:28.060
And it is a film that interestingly at moments
juxtaposes again the kind of relationship

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.830
between filmmaking and the factory worker.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.610
It is a film that makes use of absolutely
all the devices available at the time, all

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:48.569
the experimental possibilities of film at
the time including split-screen, including

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.500
extreme close ups, and different speeds of
filming.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:04.150
By the mid-1930s, Stalin imposes a new style
which is Socialist Realism, as the only state-sanctioned

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:12.630
style for the arts because he considers all
these experiments that the Avant-Garde have

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:21.820
done since the Revolution as becoming formalized,
ossified arts forms of the bourgeoisie—a

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.449
new form of bourgeois art.

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:32.370
And so that brings us to the conclusion of
that extraordinary moment of the Russian Avant-Garde

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.749
that, in fact, informs this exhibition.
