Alright. Now, you've discovered together with Sarah what instance variables are

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.850
needed for the person class. So, let's return to our car example and let's

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.570
start implementing some methods. First off, when you implement a class, you put

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.180
everything inside a class declaration, which has the keyword class followed by

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.190
the name of the class, and we generally make all classes public because we want

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.240
everyone to use them. Inside the class, go the instance variable declarations,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.060
as well as the implementations of the methods. So far, I've just put in the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.230
method headers here. And we're going to add the method implementations in just

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.560
a minute. Alright, let's get going. Here is our car class. Here are the

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.978
instance variables, here is the header of the first method, and we'll put the

00:00:46.978 --> 00:00:54.780
implementation inside this pair of braces. Now, what do we need to do? Let's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.780
say we drive a distance of 100 miles. Then we need to take the miles driven so

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.220
far. And add the distance to it. That's how the statement looks like. You take

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.230
the miles driven and add the distance, say 100. Now, miles driven is 100 miles

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.860
bigger. And we put it back into the variable, so now the variable is updated.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.780
Of course, when you drive, you also lower the amount of gas in the take, but

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.030
we'll come back to that later. Right now, it's your turn, go ahead and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.510
implement the addGas method. Simply put in the code for the method inside this

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.000
text field.
