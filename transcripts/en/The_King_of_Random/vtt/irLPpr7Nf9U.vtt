[GRANT] What's up guys welcome back today is an
exciting day because today is the day we

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.180
get to test out our nitro cotton. Now in
yesterday's video we took some extremely

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.920
dangerous acids and use them to turn
ordinary cotton balls into nitro cotton.

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.830
What exactly is nitro cotton? Well
you're about to find out. Now these here are

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.160
the cotton balls that we worked with
yesterday and I've let them sit

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.460
overnight so they're about as dry as we
can get them, which is good because I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.160
don't think nitro cotton works very
well if it's wet. And now if we compare

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.810
them to one of our original cotton balls
you can see they're a little bit smaller

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.279
and they take on kind of a yellowish
tinge other than that it just feels like a

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.130
cotton ball that got a little bit too
wet and then dried out overnight

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.430
now you remember yesterday we weighed
each of our cotton balls individually

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.820
and I'm curious to know today now that
they've been nitrated if there's any

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.140
difference in weight. All right let's
start a cotton ball number one this was

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.530
0.55 grams originally and now we're
showing 0.80 grams it's kind of like fluctuating

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.580
at 0.5 I wonder if that's because
there's still a bit of moisture in it or

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.020
if it's actually changed weight

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.780
okay so I just reweighed all of the
cotton balls here and it seems that in

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.060
almost every case the cotton ball weighs
about 0.3 grams more than it did

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.520
yesterday and I'm not sure if that's
still because there's a little bit of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.759
moisture in here that's waiting to
evaporate off or if the physical

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.479
properties of the cotton ball itself has
changed but in almost every case the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.900
cotton ball has increased in weight by
0.3 grams interesting now this is the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.420
fun part the moment we've all been
waiting for because now we get to burn

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.840
it now before we start burning our nitro
cotton let's start off burning one

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.960
regular cotton ball just so we have a
standard to measure it against now to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.899
light this thing off we could just use
the flame from a BBQ igniter but that's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.780
a little bit too easy so to switch
things up a little bit let's try using

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:56.149
some sparks from a ferrocerium rod and
hacksaw blade there we go we have

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:04.340
ignition the cotton ball ignites look at
the way it burns the cotton shrinks the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.190
ball turns black as it leaves behind the
carbon residue you can see we got a good

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.160
25 to 30 seconds of burn time there with
regular cotton ball without flame right

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.430
there looks cool you need to see the
heat rising from the charcoal ash we're

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.609
left with now is basically black ash and
bring residue and that's got a lot of

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:35.830
smoke coming off it look at all the
smoke here with all the smoke

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.490
so you can see that gives about 25 to 30
seconds of burn time there's quite a bit

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.640
of smoke and the cotton ball doesn't
completely burn unless you move it

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.030
around and expose it to the oxygen so
now let's see how a regular cotton ball

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.200
compares to Nitro cotton so this is test
number one it's the first cotton ball we

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.750
soaked in acid yesterday so
theoretically it should be the most

00:02:52.750 --> 00:03:00.070
volatile here it is boom there it goes
man okay so do you see the difference in

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.570
the burn time there the flash cotton
actually flash it went up in a huge ball

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.780
fire and if you look down here at the
res view there's really not much Ash

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.710
left over this is the original cotton
ball that's at your burning for about

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.370
two minutes before it finally died down
to this ash and there's still quite a

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.980
bit of residue our flash cotton you can
see almost everything is gone so cotton

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.280
ball one with the success and went up
very very quickly even though it was

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.760
still in cotton ball form if we would
have stretched those fibers out we could

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.150
get them go off even faster watch this
so we don't have to burn the whole

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.040
cotton ball at once we can actually
unroll it and give ourselves more

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.459
material to work with like so what's
really interesting is it still looks

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.870
like cotton it's still very fluffy it
still acts like cotton it's got a

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.739
slightly yellowish tinge to it try
ripping off a small piece of fiber like

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.230
this and touch it gently with a flame
and see just how quickly it goes off

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.310
gone in a flash that's why I love this
stuff it burns so quickly it disappears

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.520
before it even has a chance to at the
table it's why they call it flash cotton

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.660
folks flash paper and flash cotton is
the kind of stuff magicians using their

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.630
shows because it burns so quickly
it's very dramatic it doesn't leave any

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.290
smoke or any ashy residue and guys if
you flake off little pieces of your

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.260
cotton ball like this you can actually
stretch one cotton ball to go an

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:25.070
extremely long way

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.060
so we have it to tests down to full
successes now the purpose of this

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.450
experiment today is really to see how
many cotton balls we were able to

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.890
nitrate with 80 milliliters of nitric
acid we took eight cotton balls soaked

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.730
them each individually for five minutes
and my question is at what point is the

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.360
nitration start wearing off so this may
seem like a bit of a waste but what

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.730
we're going to do now is burn through
each of our cotton balls individually

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.790
until we find the point where our flash
cotton

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:58.220
stops flashing

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.999
bada-boom

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:05.159
whoa someone explosive

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.830
very volatile cotton ball number six

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.830
a little bit slower a little bit slower
and there's a little bit more ashy

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.999
residue there number seven

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.380
still a good burn but that was a lot
slower and you can see there's a lot

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.590
more after as well down to our last
cotton ball this is number eight and

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:44.160
it's even got a nice little fuse ticking
at the top for us

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.960
putting off a lot of interesting smoke
there look at that it's turning yellow

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.170
that's the Tsar is bringing extremely
slowly

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.670
lots of ash it didn't ignite at all it
just kind of fizzled down released a lot

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.080
of yellow smoke and turned into this
black ash which kind of has the smell of

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.240
sulfuric acid they left behind this tar
looking stuff as well

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:14.140
crispy black ash and a greasy tar
residue so interesting guys so out of 8

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.160
cotton balls the first five of them went
off perfectly very very quickly it

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.770
wasn't until the 6th cotton ball that we
noticed a little bit of black ash

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.070
residue a little bit more than normal
the seventh burn was a little bit slower

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.890
and the eighth ball didn't even burn at
all I just released a ton of yellow

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.670
smoke and melt it down into this black
ball of ash so I think based on our

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.060
experiment here today we can safely
conclude that 80 milliliters of nitric

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.500
acid will fully nitrate between 5 to 6
cotton balls now we can actually look at

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.470
the weights of our cotton balls and
figure out exactly how much cotton that

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.190
was so just looking at our numbers here
it looks like the first 5 to 6 cotton

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.110
balls comes out between about 3 grams to
3.25 grams so my best guess based on

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.830
this experiment is that 80 milliliters
of nitric acid will successfully nitrate

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.060
around 3 grams of cotton and don't
forget we nitrated a tampon as well

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.740
which is 2.4 grams so theoretically we
should be able to get this to work now

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.830
our little cotton tampon has a whole
heck of a lot of cotton in it so we

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.590
could actually stretch it out to last
quite a while but I'm thinking let's

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.530
just light off this little strip here
and if it works let's light off the

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.940
whole thing just because we can

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.130
beauteous like magic all right so that
worked no problem at all so let's go

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:31.280
ahead and fluff this tampon out a bit
and set it ablaze we go beautiful all

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:41.090
right here we go
flash tampon in three two one dang that

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.780
was a wicked fireball and it just went
up in my face and it was in an instant

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.950
like less than a second that entire
tampon was completely burned so we did

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:54.170
it the world's first pyrotechnic tampon
Cowabunga dude yeah and look at this

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.480
there's hardly any ash at all we've got
like little tiny bits of black fiber but

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.830
the rest of it is completely gone and no
smoke did you see there was no smoke in

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.800
that just a huge flash of fire in fact
that was quite a bit higher than I was

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.400
expecting it would right up into my face
and look there's hardly any ash residue

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.240
at all if you look down here it's just a
little bit of black matter but for the

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.140
most part that tampon is gone in its
entirety so that was really cool guys

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.290
and now based on these results I think
we can reach some conclusions from our

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.650
experiments here today we start off in
yesterday's video taking regular cotton

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.370
balls and soaking them in the solution
of nitric and sulfuric acid we rinse the

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.820
acid off soaked it in baking soda water
and then rinse it again and let them dry

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.479
overnight to produce a batch of flash
cotton the purpose of today's experiment

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:38.510
was to test those cotton balls to
identify where the nitration started

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.870
dropping off and based on our results we
found that happened right around cotton

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.650
ball number six now because we use 80
milliliters of nitric acid to brew six

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.100
cotton balls that went up in a flash we
determined that one milliliter of nitric

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.030
acid nitrates about point zero four
grams of cotton because our cotton balls

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.990
work so well just for fun we went ahead
and nitrated a cotton feminine hygiene

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:01.550
product to produce the world's first
pyrotechnic tampon so there we have it

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.010
guys we now know how to use nitric and
sulfuric acids to produce flash cotton

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.710
whoa thanks for joining me for this
experiment I'll be looking for you the

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:16.500
next one talk to you then all right here
we go shower of sparks in three two one

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.000
and I missed one two three four five six
seven eight

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:33.000
