00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.430
Authors at Google New
York is pleased to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.807
welcome Andrew Blum.

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:10.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.860
ANDREW BLUM: Hi.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.250
It's very, very exciting
to be here, for a

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.690
whole bunch of reasons.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.790
The first and sort of most
obvious thing is we are

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.130
standing at the center
of the internet.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.550
This building is the
mother lode, the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.850
beast, in a lot of ways.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.740
And for a whole bunch of
reasons, I've actually never

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.670
stepped foot inside of it.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.060
Which is strange, because a
lot of the people I wrote

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.790
about spend many of their days
here-- separate from Google,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.580
in the other parts
of the building.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.860
The other reason it's
really fun to be

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.500
here is because when--

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.410
I guess it was in January when
my publicist at Echo first got

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.570
this book on her desk, the first
thing she said was, oh,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.130
we should we pitch you to
Google to come talk.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.895
And I said, have you read
pages 235 to 245?

00:00:56.895 --> 00:00:58.250
And she said, no, not
yet, I'll read them.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.560
Then she read them, she said,
OK, maybe that's not such a

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.800
great idea.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.760
Because you guys are
my villain--

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.640
or, I should say,
were my villain.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.660
Because after about six months
of going on and on about how

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.020
Google was the absolute
outlier in terms of

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.430
transparency of the sort of
classic [INAUDIBLE] that I was

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.450
looking at.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.050
Suddenly last week, I woke up,
and got 15 emails from people

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.020
saying, oh my god, did you
see what story came out?

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.240
That Google has opened
the doors.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.790
Glasnost.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.320
I'm still getting over it.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.220
I had to rearrange substantial
portions of my talk to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.640
accommodate this new
transparency.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.090
So it's all a bit of a
shock to me still.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.720
How many of you, if
any, are in the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.170
networking side of things?

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:53.642
None.

00:01:53.642 --> 00:01:54.640
OK.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.722
So you'll have no idea
if I'm right.

00:01:59.722 --> 00:02:02.960
That's an amazing thing.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.010
I'll talk a lot about this.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.240
But one of the things that's
most surprising about this

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.920
topic is how small
a world it is.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.860
At Microsoft, for example, there
are 90,000 employees.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.875
You guys are how many now?

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:19.520
50, I think.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.860
There are 200 people involved
with Microsoft Global Network.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.830
There are, I think it was, four
involved with connecting

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.120
Microsoft's network
to other networks.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.180
So you're talking about a tiny
fraction of people who are

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.360
involved with the things that
go on, astonishingly, inside

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.980
this building.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.760
So that's getting ahead
of myself a lot.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.520
What I want to start with--

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.250
sort of talk about different
pieces of the internet, and my

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.360
journey there.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.480
But by way of preface, I came
into this, essentially, as an

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.460
architecture writer writing
about buildings.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.080
And writing about buildings
comes with certain

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.590
assumptions.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.150
And the most dominant assumption
is that if an

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.980
architect designs a building,
and it's shaped by this sort

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.250
of complicated mix of politics
and economics and real estate

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.400
and zoning and any number of
things, regardless of the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.350
difficulty of understanding
those things, at the end of

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.530
the day, you can go and you
can walk around in it.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.410
And you can see it.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.500
And you can experience it.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.740
And you can get some sense
of its sense of place.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.840
You can kind of have a real
world experience of it.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.875
But what was striking to me--

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:31.710
about four or five years ago,
2007, 2008, I was ostensibly

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.900
writing about architecture, but
I was not going out and

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.590
looking at buildings.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.870
I was spending all my time
sitting at my desk

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.850
in front of a screen.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.790
And then at the end of the day,
particularly starting

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.430
about 2007, I was then getting
up and looking at the smaller

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.120
screen that I was carrying
in my pocket.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.660
And that was my new experience
of the world.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.960
As I'm sure all of you do,
you're walking down the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.490
street, and your attention's
divided between this physical

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.880
world around you and this
ostensibly virtual world

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.300
inside the screen.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.290
And what was so striking to me
was that that world behind the

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.520
screen seemed to have no
physical reality of its own.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.000
When you looked for images of
the internet, this was the one

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.820
that comes up again and
again and again--

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.760
this image by [? Opti ?]

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.770
of this amorphous blob that
you're not really meant to be

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.175
able to find yourself on it.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:23.090
It kind of reminds me of the
Apollo blue marble picture of

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.840
the earth that I think is
similarly sort of meant to

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.060
suggest that we are to be awed
in the face of its expanse.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.520
It's meant to make us
feel small, somehow.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.580
And this was what the internet
looked like when this wasn't

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.980
really the actual
internet at all.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.170
And that divide, that very stark
difference between the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.290
world behind the screen and the
world all around me, the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.300
world that I was supposedly
writing about and engaged with

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.810
professionally, became really
pronounced and amounted to a

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.400
kind of small scale existential
crisis.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.830
How could I know myself if I
didn't know what this thing

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.070
was that I was attached to,
in the terms of the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.860
world as I knew it?

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.810
And then one day,
this happened.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.300
My internet broke, as it
occasionally does.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.710
And the cable guy
came to fix it.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.000
And he sort of followed this
clump of wires from behind my

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.820
couch out to the back of my
building in Brooklyn.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.140
And then he saw a squirrel
running along the wire.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.590
And he said, I think that's
your problem.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.360
I think a squirrel is chewing
on your internet.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.920
Which, of course, seemed
completely absurd, because the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.340
internet is a transcendent
idea.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.540
It causes revolutions and
changes shopping and dating,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.120
and has changed the world
in so many ways.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.940
It's not something squirrels
chew on.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.660
But it turned out that it
absolutely was something that

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.840
a squirrel had chewed on.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.020
And I got this image in
my head of yanking the

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.240
wire from the wall.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.020
I should say, I talk about this
squirrel all the time.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.380
And I haven't seen
him recently.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.410
I'm getting a little
worried about him.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.870
But this image of just yanking
the cable from the wall.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.530
If you followed it,
where would it go?

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.880
I don't want to get to the end
of the story too quickly, but

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.430
it goes here.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.820
It goes to this building.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.510
And that became sort
of this question.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.280
I started poking around.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.110
How was it connected?

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.820
And the implication was that
oh, it travels by many

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.470
different paths, which seemed
to be the same as saying it

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.260
travels no paths at all.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.530
But that couldn't be right.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.810
That wasn't right at all.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.750
But when I went to look for more
images of the internet, I

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.740
felt like a fool.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.690
Because only fools
went to actually

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.120
look for the internet.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.340
This is the episode of South
Park where the internet

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.490
breaks, but there's no internet
to know if the

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.260
internet's broken.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.080
So they become refugees
in California.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.700
It's very sort of
Grapes of Wrath.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.090
And they finally find this thing
that is the internet.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.730
And they play the Close
Encounters of the Third Kind

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.430
music at it to try
to wake it up.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.490
And that doesn't work.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.370
And then they shoot at it.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.300
And finally, one of the little
guys goes around and unplugs

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.560
the plug and plugs it back in.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.570
And the flashing yellow
light is steady green.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.730
And it's salvation.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.740
They're all saved.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.040
Or if it's not a big box, it's
a little box, like in the

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.500
British sitcom The IT Crowd,
where they convince their

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.190
colleagues that they have
borrowed the internet for her

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.680
for the afternoon, so she
can present an office

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.790
presentation.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.080
And she says, this
is the internet?

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.470
The whole internet?

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.460
Is it heavy?

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.350
And they say, of course
not, it's wireless.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.100
Which is what most
of us think.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.330
And that is the implication.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.960
Or if it wasn't this sort of
sitcom version of what the

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.640
internet was, it was the poet's
version of what the

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.080
internet was and is.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.330
And my favorite is a writer
named Christine Smallwood

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.080
here, who points out that the
"history of the internet is a

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.220
history of metaphors about the
internet, all stumbling around

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.210
this dilemma--

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.330
how do we talk to each other
about an invisible god?" And

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.320
then she weighs the merits of
describing the internet as a

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.450
Tootsie Roll, a hot tub,
a highway, a plane.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.870
And then finally, she concludes
that she wishes that

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:05.630
the internet looked like Matt
Damon, or like lines of light

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.160
written by an invisible
hand in the night sky.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.440
So we're back to the
amorphous blob.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.140
There's sort of no escaping that
glowing amorphous blob.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.080
But there was one guy who
had the internet number.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.850
There was one guy who seemed
to have a sense of what the

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:23.500
internet actually was, which was
Senator Ted Stevens from

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.180
Alaska, who said in 2006, of
course, that the internet is

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.850
not a big truck.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.280
It's not something you can
dump something on.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.680
It's a series of tubes.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.720
Which was hilarious.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.730
It was absolutely not
a series of tubes.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.460
It was, again, the transcendent
idea.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.309
It was the cause of revolutions
and changes in the

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.100
economy and everything else.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.390
But it's physical reality.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.240
And yet it seems like what
else could it be?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.460
I'm a little terrified by how
much time I've spent parsing

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.520
the dictionary definition
of tubes.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:59.110
But again, if you load a single
web page, and then

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.730
there are 1,000 things happening
behind the scenes,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.590
it doesn't negate the fact that
each one of those things

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.860
is passing through, has a
distinct physical path, is

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.980
coming to you through any number
of places, but through

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.210
absolutely real places.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.830
Places, occasionally, like
this, which is in Kansas.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.390
On the left is a fiber optic
regeneration hut.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.000
And this came out of the piece
that sort of started me on

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.180
this topic for Wired, three
and a half years ago now,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.070
where we set out to get a
collection of images of the

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.860
internet, the physical
internet.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:44.020
And one of the questions was is
there a place in the middle

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.210
of the country that regenerates

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.570
the fiber optic signals?

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.340
And I tried to find out, and
it turned out there was.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.080
And I was talking to a press
person at what was then Global

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.720
Crossing, owner of a big piece
of internet backbone, and

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.330
said, is there a box in the
middle of the country?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.240
And she got on the phone a guy
with a pickup truck in Kansas

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.460
City who is responsible for
all of the fiber optic

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.520
regeneration huts in
a 500 mile radius.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.890
And we then proceeded to have
this very strange conversation

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.330
about which was the most
beautiful of these huts.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.770
And it turned out
to be this one.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.225
But it's quite clear that this
is what is out there.

00:10:21.225 --> 00:10:26.820
If the basic unit today, not
connected to your home, but

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.880
for the backbones, for the
center, for the largest

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.680
networks, is a 10 gigabit per
second wave of light, pulses

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.680
of light, sort of nanosecond
Morse code through, most

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.700
often, a yellow fiberoptic
jumper cable--

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.780
that's the kind of basic
unit of connection.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.310
If the internet is a network
of networks, then it's all

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.670
about the space between
two networks.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.760
No network is--

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.343
actually, there might be one
network that is less of an

00:10:51.343 --> 00:10:53.170
islet than others-- but
for the most part, no

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.350
network is an island.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.710
It has to connect to others.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.270
And it does so through yellow
fiber optic jumper cables like

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.010
this, where if you bend
them, light comes out.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:05.130
It's that tangible.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.930
And to kind of begin to talk
about it in those terms,

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.200
though, requires something
of a caveat.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.370
If logically what goes on when
you load a single web page or

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.380
do anything else is incredibly
complicated, it is very

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.520
difficult for almost all of us
to access is the kind of world

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.130
of algorithms and bits.

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.130
Physically what it is, and
geographically where it is,

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.690
are realms that are much
more accessible to us.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.980
This is the world we learn
to navigate as children.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.540
This is our sort of embodied
experience of the world.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.970
And so for me, it was a question
of putting aside the

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.450
logical, at least
temporarily--

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.450
you have to understand it
to a certain extent--

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.430
and saying, what is this
and where is it?

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:46.150
What is it made of?

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.560
And where is it?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.750
And it ends up being a lot of
yellow fiber optic cables like

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.120
this that then sort of gather
together in these increasingly

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.370
thick bundles.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.540
So the basic unit is a network,
an autonomous system

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.940
in technical terms.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.100
Is that a word that any
of you engage with?

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:05.710
Occasionally?

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.070
OK.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:12.300
So if Google is a network, and
Facebook's a network, and

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.050
Goldman Sachs is a network, and
Cablevision is a network,

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.370
and Comcast's a network, they
physically connect to each

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.170
other, the router of one network
to the router of

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.560
another network.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.310
A big, refrigerator size machine
with blinking lights

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.300
connected, often with a yellow
fiber optic cable like this,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.600
to the router of the
other network.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.840
And again, it's difficult to
overstate this, but quite

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.690
remarkably, they connect
in this building.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.150
There are about a dozen
buildings in the world that

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.932
are by far the most important
places where the networks of

00:12:41.932 --> 00:12:43.360
the internet connect.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.840
This is one of them.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.160
And it's very exciting
to say that.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.970
In those buildings, in these
buildings, there are usually

00:12:54.970 --> 00:13:00.380
anywhere around 400 or 500
networks interconnecting.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.210
In the next tier of places where
networks meet, there are

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.230
usually an order of
magnitude less.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.510
There are usually more like 40
or 50 networks interconnecting

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.100
in these enormous jumbles
of yellow cables.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.350
And what's striking to me is
if it's always about this

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.180
physical connection.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.440
Not a single unique
connection.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.910
It's not as if Google and
Comcast connect their routers

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.040
in one place.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.450
They connect them in multiple
places, but not as many as you

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.830
might expect.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.870
These connections of one machine
to another, this sort

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:34.810
of inter internet, then kind of
pile up and come to sort of

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:41.180
this building scale collection
of interconnections in places

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:44.490
like 60 Hudson Street in
Tribeca, which is another one

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.410
of these dozen buildings in the
world where more networks

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.510
of the internet connect
than anywhere else.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.160
Particularly remarkable because
it's the place where

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.880
most of the transatlantic
cables--

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.730
depending on how you count,
there are 8 or 10 or 12 of

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.070
them across the Atlantic--

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.860
and the majority of them
interconnect with everyone

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.870
else on the ninth floor
of 60 Hudson Street.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.770
And it's a fascinating history
in its own right.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.340
It was the Western
Union building.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.660
It was the telegraph
interconnection, and then,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.720
through post breakup of the
Bells, became the place where

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.050
the independent, the autonomous
networks of the

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.110
internet connected
with each other.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.340
This, again, is another
building.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.590
This is another one of them.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.995
Bought two years ago.

00:14:26.995 --> 00:14:28.680
It was the largest single
real estate

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.020
transaction of the year.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.600
As I understand, it was the
largest single line item in

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.050
the SEC filings.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.440
And it was remarkable for those
of us who were looking

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.100
closely at the connections
among internet networks,

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.850
because it totally went under
the radar screen.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.670
The importance of this
building as a network

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.250
crossroads went entirely
unremarked upon, to the point

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.390
where the Wall Street Journal,
in its account of the largest

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.040
single real estate transaction
of a single building in 2010

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.330
said, oh, one third
of the space is

00:14:58.330 --> 00:14:59.910
telecommunications companies.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:04.310
When the announcement was
they're expanding rapidly, we

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.530
need the office space.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.780
Clearly, there's compression
here.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.540
I know about the move
across the street.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.880
But I sort of laughed,
because this is it.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.250
This is one of the most
important places.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.190
These buildings are sort of
founded on the basic principle

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.150
that the owner of the
building is neutral.

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.440
It's a carrier neutral
building.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.620
The owner of the building does
not interfere with the

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.570
connections going on.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.250
That's a kind of basic principle
of the autonomy of

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.740
these connections.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.050
So I was sort of like, well,
this is surprising.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.850
And I realized it was kind of
like American Airlines buying

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.580
LaGuardia Airport and saying, we
really just a place to park

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.520
our trucks.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.510
It didn't seem to reflect the
importance of this as a hub.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:53.690
And that story is still
evolving, actually.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.400
And there was later slightly
more comment about the

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.600
relationship of Google's
ownership of this building

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.400
with the treatment of the
existing telecommunications

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.100
companies that interconnect
here.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:13.010
But again, if you see parked on
16th Street a white truck

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:18.450
with a lightning bolt, that is
because in many, many parts of

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.190
this building--

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.500
one third of it, probably
a little bit less now--

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.760
are these really dominant

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.590
interconnections between networks.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.200
Actually, this is where my
internet comes from.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.540
I live in Brooklyn.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:29.730
And I'm a Cablevision
customer.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:35.680
My signal goes back to
Cablevision's back office in

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.250
Long Island--

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.540
I forget which town, I'm
blanking on the name--

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.030
and then comes back to 111 8th,
where it interconnects

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.470
with the rest of the internet.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.410
And that's a key idea.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.950
But the other piece that
I love is the kind of

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.360
geographic, is this idea that
if there are this relatively

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.770
short list of buildings where
more networks connect than any

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.090
other, those buildings are then
in very specific places.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.470
And they are quite literally
connected to the Earth.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.520
So when you walk into
a data center--

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.910
and I use that term kind of
loosely, not as a place where

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.280
data is stored, but as just a
room filled with computing

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.790
equipment--

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.579
they're loud and cold.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:15.770
They have a very particular
smell.

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.642
The internet always smells kind
of like burnt toast, kind

00:17:18.642 --> 00:17:20.180
of like new car smell.

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.750
Has anyone been in those
spaces here?

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.800
With that kind of ozoney smell,
if you walk by doors

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.829
where there's like-- yeah?

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:33.390
So it's a sort of dominant
sensation of it being so loud

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:37.490
you can hardly hear yourself
and 65 degrees.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.880
When you walk into this room,
which is the fiber vault in

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.960
another one of these most
important buildings--

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.440
this one in Virginia--

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.870
it's hot, and it's still,
and it smells like dirt.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.760
Because this is where the fiber
comes out of the ground.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.470
This is the kind of connection
between the network, between

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.670
what ostensibly is this
amorphous blob, and the

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.620
Virginia clay.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.450
And that's quite distinct.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.270
And I love those moments where
that scene between physical

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.670
and virtual is most explicit.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.730
And it's often in
rooms like this.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.870
That building in Virginia,
again, another one of the list

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.510
of buildings, another one
of those list of a dozen

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:23.410
buildings in the world, run by
a company called Equinix

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.470
that's very much a competitor
to Telex.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.760
Equinix actually has space
in this building--

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.570
has quite a bit of space in
this building, I think.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.370
But their most important hub
is near Dulles Airport in

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.830
Virginia, in Ashburn,
Virginia--

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:41.120
Ashburn being a place that
internet networking people,

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:45.170
internet workers, talk about
as if it were London or

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.660
Frankfurt, and usually
in the same sentence.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.650
So if you say, where are
the most important

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.520
places of the internet?

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.900
They say New York, Frankfurt,
Tokyo, Ashburn, as if Ashburn

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.450
were a global capital--

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.900
which for the internet,
it absolutely is.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:04.010
And you kind of get a sense from
this picture of how that

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.870
plays out on a kind
of building scale.

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.520
You have this complex of
buildings in the middle.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.940
There's five buildings there
that make up the Equinix

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.970
Ashburn campus that are mostly
distribution depots.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.080
These are the places that are
all about interconnection.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.440
This is kind of the primest real
estate on the internet--

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.260
the most expensive real
estate on the

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.990
internet, you might say.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.610
And around it are these
warehouses, or these kind of

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.560
beached aircraft carriers, that
are more the warehouses

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.810
to the distribution depots.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.310
That combination
is quite clear.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.620
They're kind of tethered
into these buildings.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:48.100
And if the security of this
makes you nervous--

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.000
which would be surprising.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.620
Because if it made you nervous,
then you would also

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.680
be sort of working at this
enormous bull's eye as well.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.800
So I guess your relationship to
that might be slightly more

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.590
complicated than most people.

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:03.660
But when a piece of tubes was
excerpted with a piece about

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.290
Equinix Ashburn, we put an
admittedly sensational

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.960
headline of the bullseye
of America's internet.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.480
And then put red circles
around it.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.040
And then all that week, Equinix
tweeted, we are the

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:16.980
bull's eye of America's
internet.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.580
We are the bull's eye of
America's internet.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.380
Because the importance to
announce the importance of

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.400
this place as one of the major
points of interconnection is

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.450
absolutely crucial.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:30.600
That is what their
business it.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.170
It's also striking, if there's
a relatively short list of

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:39.160
buildings, it's a very
small social group.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.350
Usually about 200 or 300 people
gather together three

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.700
times a year under the banner
of NANOG, the North American

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.870
Network Operators Group,
actually meeting

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.910
right now in Dallas.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:56.460
And these are the people who are
responsible for connecting

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.330
their network to
other networks.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:02.055
And they will run the big global
network of a Google--

00:21:02.055 --> 00:21:05.095
Google's got five or six people
are usually there, of

00:21:05.095 --> 00:21:06.460
about 300--

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.320
and then negotiate these
connections called peers,

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.800
which usually is a very
personal process.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.610
It depends a lot on trusting
the person and the network

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.080
you're connecting to.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.080
So they drink a lot of beer.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.100
They decide if you're
clueful, which is

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.840
the opposite of clueless.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.430
And then if you are,
then you agree to

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.270
connect your networks.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.260
And then you consummate that
connection with a yellow fiber

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.430
optic cable in a building like
Equinix Ashford or 60 Hudson

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.600
Street or here.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.805
And so you hear these
conversations like, OK, where

00:21:34.805 --> 00:21:35.460
should we connect?

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.040
And it's like, Dallas,
111, 60, Ashburn.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.110
And that's the list.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:47.230
And there can be a lot of tricky
politicking and very

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.720
difficult to parse economic
agreements, financial

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.860
agreements, in those connections
between networks.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:59.690
But at the end of the day,
the coordinators--

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.460
those can be the peering
coordinators, peering being

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.920
this work for connecting to
networks as if they were

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.250
peers, or paid peers, meaning
you pay them as well for the

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.430
privilege of connecting--

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.940
that relationship is incredibly
intimate, and is

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.150
incredibly small.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.470
Incredibly small group
of people.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.690
If the sort of most important
center of the internet are

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.236
these very small list of places
where the networks of

00:22:22.236 --> 00:22:25.270
the internet predominantly
connect with each other, the

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:29.360
next piece-- in some ways,
the more poetic piece--

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.520
are the lines in between,
specifically the undersea

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.760
cables that connect
continents.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.630
This is another image from
that Wired photo essay.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.100
Again, came out of this surreal
conversation saying,

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.280
OK, is there a manhole where
the undersea cable

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.040
connects to the beach?

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.200
And the answer is yes.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.010
OK, which is the most
beautiful manhole?

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:55.600
It turned out to be this one,
near Halifax in Nova Scotia, a

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.120
cable that connects Nova
Scotia with Ireland.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.350
The only cable, actually,
transatlantic that isn't from

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:09.990
the New Jersey or Long Island
beaches to the UK, to England,

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.350
but rather takes a more
northerly route, for specific

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.630
reasons of security through
diversity by being in a

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.320
different place.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.020
The cables--

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:26.210
it's difficult to overstate how
wondrous they are, in that

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.790
they're the thickness of a
garden hose in one direction.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.430
In the other direction, they are
4,000 of 5,000 or 6,000 or

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.070
8,000 miles.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:39.270
Usually, there's a kind of
steel mesh outside for

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.730
structure, and then usually,
a copper tube--

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.470
I use that word technically--

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.620
that transmits the electricity
that powers these repeaters

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.420
that sit on the ocean floor,
that are these kind of big

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.320
tuna shaped things every
50 miles or so

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.270
that amplify the signal.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.380
And then in the sort of heart of
it are usually four or six

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.000
or eight strands of fiber,
hair thin strands.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.620
And if the basic yield is a 10
gigabit per second wave,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.560
what's amazing is that each
strand of fiber can carry not

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.390
just one wave, but many
different wavelengths or

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.080
colors of light through
that strand of fiber.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.440
So 50 or 60 or 75 10 gigabit
per second waves of light

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.450
through each fiber, perhaps four
going in each direction.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:30.860
So that's a lot of information
that is through a space that's

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:34.780
difficult to comprehend
in one dimension.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.350
You look out across the ocean,
and it is that kind of

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.760
ultimate expanse of the other.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:44.640
So I really wanted to see one
of these cables being built.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:48.150
If our life online is kind of
defined by these fleeting

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:53.350
moments of connection, of some
random email or Facebook post

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.890
or tweet or whatever it is,
then it seemed like there

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.080
could be a physical corollary
to that, a moment when a

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.630
continent was plugged in.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.140
This is Simon Cooper.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.050
We've never actually met.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.800
We've only talked on his
telepresence system.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.080
He works for Tata
Communications, which is the

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.350
communications wing of Tata,
the big Indian industrial

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.610
conglomerate.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.350
He's an Englishman.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.410
He works in Singapore.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.230
The undersea cable industry
is entirely dominated by

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:19.990
Englishmen.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.490
They all seem to be 42, because
they all started

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.570
basically at the same time,
about 20 years ago.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.780
And Tata had bought out
of bankruptcy a big,

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:32.125
metaphorically speaking, cable
across the Pacific and a big

00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:36.020
cable across the Atlantic, and
then proceeded to finish the

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.540
loop around the world with the
idea that they would promise

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.850
to send your bits
east or west.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.530
And if something happened to
the cable in the Pacific--

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:45.890
which has, in fact, happened--

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.590
they would send your data
around the other way.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.350
And if a cable does break or is
damaged somehow, of course

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.100
you have to send a ship out,
throw a grapple hook over the

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.080
side, pick it up, find the other
end, fuse each strand of

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.060
fiber together, and then throw
it back into the water.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.800
So it's this incredibly
physical,

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.960
incredibly handmade process.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:10.630
Actually, quite a bit of
Google's global network runs

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.540
on Tata's undersea cables.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.010
I'm breaking all sorts of
confidentiality agreements by

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:17.380
saying this.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.330
It's actually not in the book.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.780
But when you go to a Tata
landing station-- and I didn't

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.310
even see it, I could barely make
it out-- but I think when

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.010
you go to a Tata landing
station, there's a whole bank

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.400
of yellow cables that
are labeled--

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.050
I couldn't quite figure out how
to spell it, but I think

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.940
it started with a G--

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.920
that are Google's wavelengths.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.920
These are the wavelengths
across the ocean.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:43.440
Of course, based on this kind
of basic gamble that the

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.160
larger your network
gets, the more you

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.220
want to run it yourself.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.990
The more you don't just want to
buy a circuit, but you want

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.830
to run the wavelength.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.630
You want to perhaps even own
the fiber, perhaps even own

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.650
the conduit through which
the fiber runs.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.210
That's what's meant
by the dark fiber.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:03.550
And that becomes quite tangible
when you visit these

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:09.180
places, because inevitably,
you get to the spot in the

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.780
tour of these buildings
where there's the

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.370
bank of Google's fiber.

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.130
Which, again, these visits are
based on the premise that

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.520
you're not going to remark upon
who is in which place,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.070
except in so much as often, a
company's presence in these

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.160
locations is announced.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.490
Because if they're there, they
want to interconnect.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.610
And so there are open websites
that say where everybody is,

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:30.810
because you can't be silent.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:31.990
You have to interconnect.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.620
Otherwise, what's the point
of being there?

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.900
Anyway, so Tata was building
a new cable.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.590
And he said, we'd be happy
to tell you when that was

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.800
happening so you could watch
this cable be connected.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.080
And he gave me about
four days' notice.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.760
He said if you show up at this
beach just south of Lisbon at

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.670
a little after 9:00 on Monday
morning, this guy will walk

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.530
out of the water.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.700
Which is what happened.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.480
This was the first link for his
first connection from sea

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:10.020
to land carrying a lightweight
nylon messenger line, just a

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.010
basic line.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:13.900
The first link that would then
be leveraged into what was

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.000
called the WACS cable-- the
West Africa Cable System--

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.430
from Lisbon down the west
coast of Africa, to Cote

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.950
d'Ivoire, to Ghana,
all the way to

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.250
Namibia and South Africa.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.900
The construction of which began
with, again, this guy

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:28.900
coming out of the water.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:32.300
And then a sophisticated ship
sort of steamed around.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.070
And a skiff brought the
cable out to the ship.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:39.840
And then they began to pull
it in using the bulldozer.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.860
You can see the English
engineers looking on, the

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.270
Spanish underwater construction
team doing some

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.100
of the heavy lifting, the local
day laborers doing some

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.030
of the even heavier lifting.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.310
And then once it's in place,
that same guy goes back in the

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.210
water with a big knife, and
he cuts each buoy off.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:59.400
The buoy pops up in the air.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.330
And the cable drops to
the ocean floor.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:03.810
And then he does the
whole thing all the

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.240
way out to the ship.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.340
And then when he gets there,
they give him a glass of juice

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.230
and a cookie.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.825
And he jumps back
in the water.

00:29:09.825 --> 00:29:12.210
And he swims the kilometer
back to shore.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.662
And then he gets out and
lights a cigarette.

00:29:14.662 --> 00:29:17.640
And then that connection's
made.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.780
And then they start preparing
to attach the cable to the

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:24.440
other side that's been brought
down from what's known as the

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.480
landing station, which is
basically the lighthouse, the

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.540
place that sends and receives
the pulses of

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.000
light through the fiber.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.920
And in order to get through
the steel armor and get

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.250
through the copper tube that
conducts electricity and get

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:41.260
to the fibers to manually fuse
each of the eight of them to

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.850
the one that's been brought down
from the landing station,

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.380
you need to go at it
with a hacksaw.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.360
And so when you're standing
there and you're watching them

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.560
work at this cable with a
hacksaw, the amorphous blob

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.650
seems a really long way away.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:59.690
It starts to seem like a lot
more tangible thing.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:04.050
Then when the tide goes out,
they cover it, just the first

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.230
little bit out to sea, to
protect it from anchors and

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.170
stuff like that.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.790
And they try to do as much of
that as possible without

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:12.100
having to get their
scuba gear on.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.510
And what's remarkable is that
if the material science is

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:19.720
incredibly sophisticated, and
the computational technology's

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.140
incredibly sophisticated--
again, 10 gigabit per second

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.890
pulses of light times
70 times 4--

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:27.080
the basic physical connection
is the same

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.490
as it's always been.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.950
And the places that are
connected are the same.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.160
Often port cities--

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.850
New York or Lisbon or
Mombasa or Mumbai or

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.530
Singapore or Hong Kong.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.670
And the culture is the same.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:41.520
The same English engineers-- you
can see the guy in the hat

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.030
looking on.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.680
The same local laborers.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.780
And that physical process
of connection persists.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.140
It's about three, four days on
the beach of construction.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.195
And then when it's done, they
put the manhole cover back on,

00:30:59.195 --> 00:31:00.680
and they push the
sand over it.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.920
And then everybody in this
village and all of us kind of

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.130
forget about it.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.330
And that seems a shame.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.710
The basic premise of the cloud
is that when you put something

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.310
on the cloud, you give up some
responsibility for it.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:14.370
You often lose quite a bit of
knowledge about where it is or

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.680
what it is or how it's
being handled.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.840
And I think we shouldn't
forget that.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.630
We should keep in mind that it's
made of places like this.

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.600
So this is in the
woods in Oregon.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.530
If one of the major components,
the physical

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.410
infrastructure of the internet,
are the internet

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:41.230
exchange points, the places
where the networks

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.290
interconnect, and another is
the lines in between, these

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:47.390
cables that connect places
across distance, then the

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:49.610
third, undoubtedly, are data
centers, are places

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.180
where data is stored.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.660
And what's remarkable is that
the number one and number two

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.960
most visited website--

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.050
Facebook and Google, Google
and Facebook--

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.360
made the same decision about
five years apart, which was to

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.000
locate their first ground up
data center in essentially the

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.390
same place in central Oregon.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.700
For all sorts of reasons.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.960
For certainly the availability
of power.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.190
The coolness of the air-- so you
can save as much money as

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:16.660
possible cooling data centers
by just literally but

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.630
basically opening the windows.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:22.150
The availability of the fiber
optic connections, the

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.310
robustness of those fiber optic
connections, and the tax

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:28.580
breaks that sort of make
the towns in which

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.140
they're in good hosts.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.400
But it was striking that to make
that same decision five

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.920
years apart in the same place is
indicative of the power of

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.280
these forces are that allow
buildings that could be

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.040
anywhere to be in very
specific places.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:44.630
So this is the woods behind
Facebook's data center in

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:49.810
Prineville, Oregon, and hemmed
in by these huge power lines.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:55.070
And before I went, my image of
these places was as sort of

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.210
belching information
age factories.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.100
That's how they've often
been portrayed.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.400
When I got there, it
was very different.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.180
Facebook--

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.880
let's talk about Facebook
first--

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.150
in Prineville had really been
embraced by the community with

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.680
open arms, and Facebook had
embraced Prineville.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.950
And it quite directly took the
place of industry that had

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.450
left with the economic collapse
of central Oregon

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:21.790
otherwise, and quite precisely
took those same power

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:22.730
connections--

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.340
not in this case, but actually
in Google's case with the

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.090
closed aluminum smelter.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:30.625
So for those reasons,
was quite welcome.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.440
A lot of you probably saw that
the New York Times series a

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.370
few weeks ago about data
centers, which for me and a

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:42.860
lot of people in the industry
didn't seem very strange.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.080
Certainly there are data centers
using an enormous

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.910
amount of power, but in fact
much less than we might

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.470
expect, particularly in
proportion with the benefit

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.710
they provide.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.750
And the have mantra in the
industry is always to use as

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:59.360
little power as possible.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.790
So that series that sort of
announced the waste of power

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.330
seems sort of strange,
particularly picking on the

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.699
most sophisticated players
in the industry--

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:13.070
in the Times', case,
Microsoft.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:16.870
But what was remarkable to me,
though, about Facebook, about

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:20.190
Prineville, was the degree to
which they were eager to

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:23.350
monumentalize this building, the
degree to which this was a

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:26.130
place that they sort of
celebrated as a temple of

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.730
Facebook's data.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.730
As a writer about architecture,
it's basic idea,

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.580
a basic tenet, that buildings
express ideas.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:39.389
And it was quite special for me
to see the degree to which

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:44.170
Facebook was celebrating
this data center.

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.730
Of course, the guys who run the
building complain about

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:50.080
all the silly things
the architects did.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.370
But what came out, I think,
is quite beautiful, and is

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.810
remarkable for the way that
rather than looking like the

00:34:55.810 --> 00:35:01.410
back of a parking lot, of a
shopping mall loading dock, as

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.720
most of these buildings often
do, there was some attempt to

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.840
say this is a special place.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.820
And that continues
inside as well.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.680
And even more so, the doors
were thrown wide open.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.970
There was a sense that this
is your place as well.

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.420
There's a joke, obviously,
to be made about

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:20.520
Facebook and privacy.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:34.440
But beginning about a year ago,
Facebook has made the

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.225
decision to publish the plans
of this data center at Open

00:35:38.225 --> 00:35:40.820
Compute Project-- to say that
this is the most efficient we

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.340
can build this building, and
the best thing for the

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.280
industry is to share the things
that we've learned, and

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.090
open up the building, and
publish everything down to the

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.120
circuit board, and say if we all
are going to improve, and

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.950
the best thing we can be doing
to lessen our impact is to

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.540
share best practices.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.520
And that kind of sense of
integrity is sort of permeated

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.180
throughout the building.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.980
That said, being
in this place--

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.010
this is ostensibly the place
where things of emotional

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.940
resonance come from.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:12.610
This is where the announcements
of new babies,

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.190
new jobs, and whatever
it is, are stored.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:18.010
And that final leap for me--
sort of saying I know this

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:22.710
stuff is here, but what
does that mean--

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:26.000
that final connection was
difficult to make.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.860
It was hard to finally connect
this sort of virtual world

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.320
that I was in the presence
of with what I

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.340
knew it meant to me.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:40.000
So all of that is made much
more complicated for me in

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.060
front of you this week.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.595
If this were three weeks ago,
it would have been a

00:36:42.595 --> 00:36:44.040
completely different story.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.250
But essentially, the way that I
have been telling the story

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.510
is that where Facebook was wide
open and eager to share

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:55.710
best practices, Google was
completely closed.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.640
And for me, it was quite
striking to my visit to the

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.520
Dalles, which I did go see.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.912
And by go see, I was given a
tour of the parking lot, and

00:37:03.912 --> 00:37:05.930
then given this delicious
lunch.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:10.750
But it was quite striking how
different the desire to share

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:18.530
and for me, the degree to which
Google was the outlier.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:22.190
In terms of willingness to allow
me to understand, and by

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.660
extension readers and some of
you to understand, what goes

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.230
on inside these buildings, was
very different in tone

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.150
compared to everybody
else that I saw--

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.840
all the dozens of places
that I visited.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.960
I'll be specific about
that in some ways.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:44.560
This is the Google Maps image
of the Dalles circa 2010.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.095
It is not an old image.

00:37:46.095 --> 00:37:48.150
It is an obscured image.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:51.480
As a Google Maps user, the idea
that a Google data center

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.680
wouldn't be just absent or old
but would be actually obscured

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.870
was, for lack of a better
word, a kind of

00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:59.620
violation of trust.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:04.350
The assumption is that this is
an accounting of the world

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.870
that is as honest as
possible at points.

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.720
The deliberateness of that

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.820
obfuscation was quite dramatic.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.520
Quite dramatic as well for--
again, I won't repeat back

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.270
your mission statement,
but it's quite clear.

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.010
When we give things to
the cloud, we give up

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.440
responsibility for them.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.380
The message that I got in dozens
of places was that

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:26.870
you're right.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:28.220
This is something we should
be talking about.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.850
This is something that
we should know about.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.690
You can read the gory details,
but my visit to the Dalles

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:37.030
sort of played out like farce,
and a complete disconnect of

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:41.170
what I was asking for and
completely different than what

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:45.740
had been explained to me in
dozens of other places.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:50.080
And last week, this amazing
set of images, and this

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.570
amazing push to communicate what
these buildings were made

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.580
of came out--

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:57.690
the piece written by Steve
Levy at Wired.

00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:00.183
And we had a nice exchange
last week.

00:39:00.183 --> 00:39:02.950
I was very glad that he was the
one that came over, that

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.950
he was the one that wrote the
story about Google's data

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.320
centers at long last.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.260
And again, it's difficult to
communicate how significant it

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:17.240
was for me to talk about this
for so long as saying that we

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.390
should know what our virtual
world is made of, and with the

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:24.440
elephant in the room being
completely shut down, absolute

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.060
just zero transparency
whatsoever--

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.860
and then suddenly, the
doors have opened.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:33.695
And that's a kind of remarkable
thing, to which it

00:39:33.695 --> 00:39:37.170
has lots and lots of
exciting effects.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.070
This was last week.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.720
I was like, OK, great,
thank you.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.080
I'm sure Ted would be pleased.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.230
Down the road from the Dalles
is the Bonneville Dam.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:58.280
And is this great WPA or Army
Corps of Engineers project.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:58.720
It's a fortress.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.820
When you go and you visit it,
an armed guard checks your

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.420
trunk and then says,
come on in.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.790
And then when you go inside,
there's a visitor center, and

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:13.970
a gift shop, and displays about
the very complicated

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:20.170
environmental and economic
history of this place.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.150
And there's this sense that this
is your infrastructure.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.840
And for me, that's obviously
in stark contrast with the

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.620
places that are completely
shut down, that we know

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.790
nothing about.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.290
But also a model for the way in
which we can be connected

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.010
to our digital infrastructure.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.180
So this is my image of it.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:41.490
My dream of it is, quite
literally, a brewery tour--

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.740
not of this building as a whole,
but a brewery tour of

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.650
the place where Google connects
to the rest of the

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:49.480
internet, with a glass wall and
blinky lights and red hats

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.600
or whatever it is.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.910
But it seems like there is
a way that we should be

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.950
celebrating this infrastructure
in more

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:56.570
deliberate ways.

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:57.870
Thank you.

00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.640
Thank you for indulging my
uncomfortable feelings about

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.541
all of you.

00:41:02.541 --> 00:41:09.002
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:09.002 --> 00:41:10.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can you
take questions?

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:11.260
ANDREW BLUM: Yeah, sure.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.104
AUDIENCE: The Wired photo that
you referred to-- is that the

00:41:16.104 --> 00:41:18.920
Neal Stephenson "Mother Earth
Mother Board" article?

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.380
ANDREW BLUM: No, it
was a new one.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:25.230
It was one that I
put together.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:29.320
2009, a photographer named
Randall Mesdon, famous for the

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.090
Marky Mark underwear pictures
as well as his

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:33.782
pictures of the internet.

00:41:33.782 --> 00:41:34.730
AUDIENCE: Is there a place
we can go to see them?

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.990
ANDREW BLUM: Yeah.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.950
The piece is called
"Netscapes." Yeah?

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:41.345
AUDIENCE: Great book.

00:41:41.345 --> 00:41:43.170
I loved it.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:45.110
ANDREW BLUM: Even pages
235 to 245?

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.250
AUDIENCE: At that point, I
worked for a large bookseller

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:50.560
that has [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.070
So there was an apocryphal story
I heard a lot in the

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:57.300
early '90s from [? nano ?]
geeks.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.170
And I'm hoping you can
tell me if someone--

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.670
Jay Adelson or someone--
mentioned it or you did

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.916
research and debunked, because
I've always wondered.

00:42:04.916 --> 00:42:08.310
But in the early days of
MAE-East when the gigaswitch

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:12.066
first happened, and the idea of
IX was so new, there was a

00:42:12.066 --> 00:42:17.220
story told about how the
cleaning ladies would

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:18.170
turn off the power.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.920
The gigaswitch originally
digital, sort of stuck it in a

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.080
corner, and there was a bunch
of surge protectors to it.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.020
And there was a story told
around that time-- '92, '93--

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.893
that every so often, they'd
just pop the fuse and

00:42:29.893 --> 00:42:31.088
it would turn down.

00:42:31.088 --> 00:42:33.410
And of course, [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.370
resilient to it.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.370
Did you hear that story?

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.900
It wasn't in the book.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.230
ANDREW BLUM: I heard that
story in every place I

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:40.070
visited, yeah.

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.320
AUDIENCE: Did you debunk it?

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.420
ANDREW BLUM: It happened.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.920
I mean, when things go wrong,
they go wrong in such silly

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.880
ways that if not has happened
in those exact terms, it

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.130
happened that way
all the time.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.450
One reason that there isn't
huge concerns about the

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:09.970
location of the cables, about
the maps of the buried fiber

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:12.900
optic cables or anything like
that, is that the by far

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.480
greater concern on everyone's
part is some guy with a

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.210
backhoe, not terrorists.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.850
The great story from the last
year and a half is a woman in

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.770
Armenia who was digging for
copper in her backyard who cut

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.620
through with a spade Georgia's
connection to the internet.

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:36.140
There was a story, which
apparently is not true, but of

00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:39.410
some of the outages for Google's
data center in the

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:43.960
Pacific Northwest being caused
by hunters shooting the fiber

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.970
optic lines that are strung on
top of the Bonneville Power

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:49.050
Association regional grid.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.610
That, apparently,
was not true.

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:51.780
That was kind of a joke said.

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.670
That I did debunk.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:56.970
But there's so many stories
about silly missed

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.220
connections.

00:44:00.396 --> 00:44:01.780
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:03.450
My name's Matt.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:05.330
I don't know how many months
ago I emailed you.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:05.795
ANDREW BLUM: Yeah.

00:44:05.795 --> 00:44:07.530
AUDIENCE: But thank you for
coming, and despite

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:10.750
pages 235 to 245.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.220
In your book, you give
kind of two extremes.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:13.550
ANDREW BLUM: Thank you
for having me,

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.040
despite those pages.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.070
AUDIENCE: In your book, you give
kind of two extremes of

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:19.890
the government's involvement
in these kind

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:20.290
of bull's eye sites.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:23.600
You have the town administrator
in Oregon shows

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.156
you his connection to the
internet, and that's kind of

00:44:26.156 --> 00:44:27.990
like the bake sale supplies
in the basement.

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:33.740
And then you have the dockyards
in London, with the

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:38.380
2007 terrorist plot that's
broken up by Scotland Yard.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.840
In your writing this book, and
investigating this for the

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.746
past few years, did you ever get
into the question or try

00:44:44.746 --> 00:44:47.320
to ask the question about what's
being done to protect

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.270
these sites outside of
just not putting a

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:51.192
sign on the wall outside?

00:44:51.192 --> 00:44:52.442
ANDREW BLUM: Yeah.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:45:00.930
The first thing to say is the
security concern about the

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:04.910
lines in between are backhoes
and ships' anchors.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.360
The security concerns at places
like Ashburn or in this

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.340
building are often about, well,
first, somebody walking

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:16.030
out with a pizza box size
thing worth $40,000 or

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:20.600
$150,000, much less the credit
card data that it holds.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:24.790
So the security concerns are
often based on not terrorist

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:29.210
malfeasance, but on theft
of different kinds.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:31.840
A lot of these major hubs--

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:37.900
60 Hudson Street, in the
immediate aftermath post 9/11,

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.930
was surrounded by dump trucks.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:41.640
There was really great awareness
of this as a

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.890
strategic place.

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:50.650
Places like Equinix Ashburn have
followed, are required to

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:54.270
follow, all sorts of different
levels of both government

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:57.110
security standards and often,
it's the bank audits, the

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:00.600
financial institution audits,
that you must be in a class

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.860
whatever data center, which
means there has to be a camera

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:06.720
every six feet, and three
layers of doors with

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.970
this kind of locks.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:12.420
That's what the security's
about, not as much about a

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.950
terrorist threat of any sort.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:18.430
And then there's the flip side
of it, which is that for these

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:22.780
dominant interconnection points,
you can't hide them.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.390
They rely for their success
on everybody

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.020
knowing where they are.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.270
And that's a kind of crucial--

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:35.080
when the al-Qaeda plot to blow
up Telehouse, the 60 Hudson or

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:38.680
111 8th equivalent in London,
was foiled, the Telehouse

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.830
people said, why, yes, actually,
we are the most

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:42.570
important spot on
the internet.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.610
It would make perfect
sense to blow us up.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:48.840
Because that's the position
they want to maintain.

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.155
So that sort of trumps
all other concerns.

00:46:57.685 --> 00:46:59.030
Yeah?

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.020
AUDIENCE: You've got all these
pictures of jumper cables.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.670
I worked a long time
ago on stuff for

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:04.125
doing this free space.

00:47:04.125 --> 00:47:05.580
Is any of that stuff happening
in free space

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:08.860
now, or did that die?

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.720
ANDREW BLUM: The efficiency of
the cables is so clear that

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:17.430
any implication of it evolving
out of that--

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:19.620
there are these news articles
about things

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.240
replacing them, but not--

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.230
it seems that it's--

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:26.210
Well, that said, the 10 gigabit
per second wave has

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.805
become over the last few years
occasionally a 40 gigabit per

00:47:28.805 --> 00:47:30.890
second wave or a 100 gig wave.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:35.760
Same strand of fiber switching
the flashlights on either end.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:40.900
Also, that was like with Egypt,
it was like, oh, the

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.120
government's going to put a
Wi-Fi blimp over Cairo, and

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.080
provide internet access separate
from government

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.740
shutting it down.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.540
And that just seems impossible
to believe.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:56.550
When my phone works in Times
Square, then we can think

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:00.140
about blimps providing internet
access to all of the

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.690
city through some secret
government

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:02.940
technology or anything.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.725
AUDIENCE: About six years ago,
someone told me that there's

00:48:08.725 --> 00:48:12.772
an internet exchange in Palo
Alto which something like 20%

00:48:12.772 --> 00:48:15.230
of all the traffic
goes through.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.980
Is that realistic, and
has that changed?

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.590
Did you recover information
about that instance?

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.150
ANDREW BLUM: Yeah.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:24.400
The building in Palo Alto is
known as the PAIX, the Palo

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.770
Alto Internet Exchange.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.980
It is another one of
these 12 buildings.

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.040
I spent a lot of time there.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.570
One of the chapters is built
around a visit to to that

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:41.040
building as well as Ashburn,
which were both--

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.690
the issue's a little bit
complicated, but basically

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:46.440
both the invention of Jay
Adelson, a guy who has since

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:51.380
gone to do other things less
physical with the internet.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.630
And the 20% number--

00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:02.930
because the traffic is so often
within a single network,

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:08.000
and because a single yellow
piece of cable might have one

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.960
10 gigabit strand or it might
have nothing or it might have

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:17.240
40, any measurements that are
done are done through some

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.650
sort of sampling process.

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:24.610
I focus on physical terms,
obviously, and I focus on this

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.720
list of, which I always say,
about a dozen buildings.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.830
And I've gone through the list
with some of my favorite

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:32.510
network engineers, and
it usually is pretty

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.820
clear that there are.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.300
But it's more about not
quantities of traffic, but

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.060
number of networks
interconnecting.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:44.575
So Google and Comcast,
for example.

00:49:44.575 --> 00:49:46.910
There, it's like, OK, we're
going to connect.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:47.920
We're going to do a pair.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.060
We're going to connect in
New York and in Ashburn.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.510
So we'll connect at 111
and at Equinix.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.500
And that's a regional pair,
and then it's matched by a

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.580
pair across the country, and
there's that sort of

00:49:59.580 --> 00:49:59.885
redundancy.

00:49:59.885 --> 00:50:01.560
So that's hard to manage.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.800
Sorry, the last piece I forgot
to mention with security is

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.250
there's often a flag.

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.820
I had a bizarre conversation
with the head of security at a

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.210
big backbone company who said
you can come visit our site,

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:14.070
please don't say where it is.

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:17.080
And if you enter the name of his
company and the town that

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.110
the landing station is in Maps,
a flag lands in the

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.570
middle of his desk.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:23.870
So the implication that
these are somehow

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.845
secret is sort of bizarre.

00:50:25.845 --> 00:50:28.980
Thanks to you guys.

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.160
AUDIENCE: Can you tell me a
little bit more about the

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.195
business relationships of owning
these buildings and

00:50:34.195 --> 00:50:37.383
these lines that you discuss
so eloquently?

00:50:37.383 --> 00:50:39.255
What does it mean that Google
now owns this building?

00:50:39.255 --> 00:50:42.240
Are people paying us to house
the network connections?

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.240
Or are we paying into
some kind of fund?

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.495
How does that group that
you mentioned, the--

00:50:46.495 --> 00:50:46.880
ANDREW BLUM: NANOG, yeah.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.550
AUDIENCE: --network
administrators work?

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:52.660
ANDREW BLUM: Well, it's very
complicated, and it varies

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:53.380
building to building.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.250
So take Ashburn, for example.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:59.940
Equinix's business model is to
charge by the cross connect.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:03.900
So you pay rent for your cage.

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:07.050
I forget, sometimes you do and
sometimes you don't pay power

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:08.840
to pay how much power
you need.

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:12.400
And then you pay for them to run
a cable across the room.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.650
And that's the business model.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.430
And it's all about
cross connects.

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:22.630
At NANOG, the biggest party at
NANOG is the Equinix party.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:25.070
They want everyone to come and
drink beer and connect their

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:27.280
networks and buy
cross connects.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.660
Telex, which also is in this
building, sometimes they say

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.950
no, we're just selling space,
we'll do the cross connect for

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:37.370
free, and that becomes a
kind of added value.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:39.110
Then there's the other layer.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:41.760
Ashburn's sort of a pure
example, because they own the

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.720
dirt, they own the building,
it's all Equinix.

00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:46.730
This building is much more
complicated, because there is

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:50.880
a legacy history of the
different telecom companies

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.080
owning a suite of offices,
the different colocation

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:54.630
companies--

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.770
the kind of hotel equivalents,
like Equinix--

00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:01.640
owning another piece of the
building, and then whoever

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:04.660
owns the building itself
allowing for the cables to run

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.175
between floors or
between offices.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.520
At 60 Hudson, that code was
cracked first by Telex, sort

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.070
of Equinix's major competitors,
because they sort

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:18.980
of realized what the economic
value was--

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.090
the union labor required to
connect two floors, the amount

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:26.780
they had to charge one time or
two times or monthly, whatever

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:29.000
it was, for that connection--

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.580
but essentially, to cut
out the local loop.

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:36.650
To cut out the Bells or Verizon
or whoever it is where

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:39.880
you are, and allow two networks
to connect directly--

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.410
my router plugged into
your router.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.480
The ecosystem of
this building--

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:54.060
and I'm on a little shaky ground
with this-- but the

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:59.140
basics are that if a Deutsche
Telekom or a Cablevision comes

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.710
in and has a suite of offices,
and the tradition has been

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.860
that they then can connect from
their suite to someone

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.630
else's suite, or if Equinix--

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:07.750
I think has 30,000 square feet
of space in this building--

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.620
can host a cage and everyone
can connect there.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:15.850
Or if you're building a large
global data network for a

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:18.020
search engine, then the first
place you would go is to get a

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.530
suite of offices here, so you
can connect to everybody else.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:29.850
To how the relationship is
between the landlord of this

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:33.650
building, the sublandlord of
an Equinix or a Telex or a

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:38.120
CoreSite, and then the existing
legacy communications

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:41.800
companies that have beachheads
here, and who allows them to

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.590
connect it--

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.870
if they have only do the
construction at night or

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:51.780
during the day and what the
limitations are on that--

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:55.100
is still figuring it out.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.790
Certainly, if you're at Equinix,
and you're being told

00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:00.850
you can no longer grow because
we need the building for the

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:05.850
office space, this is no
longer the most vibrant

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:07.150
meeting place of networks.

00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:10.111
It becomes a very different
animal.

00:54:10.111 --> 00:54:11.572
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
all we have time for.

00:54:11.572 --> 00:54:13.040
Sorry.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.170
ANDREW BLUM: I'd be happy to
sign books, too, if you want.

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: FEMALE
SPEAKER: Books are

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.970
for sale for $10.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:17.570
ANDREW BLUM: $10?

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:19.970
Oh, that's a really good deal.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:24.863
[APPLAUSE]
