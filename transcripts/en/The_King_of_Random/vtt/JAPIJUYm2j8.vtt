00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey, what's up guys? I am back in the kitchen today, wearing my lab jacket

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.470
And you know what that means we are about to do something extremely dangerous

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.950
I have over here some very very concentrated bottles of sulfuric and nitric

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.849
Acids these things are extremely extremely dangerous substances and can cause some bodly infections.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.739
I also have some baking soda some cotton balls and some tampons you'll see what those are for later

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.160
Now for this experiment today, I thought it might be fun to try making nitro Cotton or gun Cotton, flash cotton

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.469
Whatever you want to call it goes by a lot of different names now

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.359
Whatever you want to call this stuff the process of making

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.348
It isn't very difficult at all very very dangerous, but not difficult let me show it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.790
Now to make this experiment a little more scientific. We are going to be measuring our results

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.869
I have a little scientific beaker here so we can measure out equal portions of sulfuric and nitric

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.309
Acid then we're going to dip them in  one by one letting them each soak in the solution for about five minutes

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.259
take them out rinse them let them dry and measure the results now the sulfuric acid

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.039
I'm using is 93% sulfuric acid I got this stuff from a chemical supply store

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.670
And I'm using it just for convenience

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.879
We could use the sulfuric acid I extracted from my car battery in a previous video but for this experiment here

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.249
I want the results to be as pure as we can get them

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.220
We're also using 70% nitric acid which we could make

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.110
Ourselves however the time and effort that would need to go into producing it is beyond the scope of our experiment today

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.869
Now my beaker measures up to 120 milliliters

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.539
And I want to do a 50/50 ratio of Sulfuric and nitric

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:26.350
acid so let's start off filling our beaker with 60 milliliters of nitric acid first then followed up with 60 milliliters of Sulfuric acid to top it off

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.919
Now because we're dealing with some pretty dangerous chemicals here

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.479
I have a bag of ice and some baking soda the idea being that we can fill up a bowl with ice water so if

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.868
We have a thermal runaway we have a place to dump it and mix with baking soda

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.499
So we have a solution that will help neutralize any acid if we have any accidental spills

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.099
Okay, so our nitric and sulfuric acids have been mixed and it's very important to know that when these two liquids mix together they heat

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.400
up very fast

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.320
using an infrared thermometer

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.680
We can see this liquid goes from about 68 degrees Fahrenheit up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit in just a few seconds

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.149
That's the difference of around 20 degrees Celsius to 50 degrees Celsius for International viewers

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.339
And that is one of the reasons we have our bath of ice standing by oh and by the way the fumes are toxic

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.449
Now this is actually still quite warm, and we need it to cool back down to room temperature

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.170
So while we're waiting let's weigh out our cotton balls

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.230
now, I'm not exactly sure how much cotton our

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.179
120 milliliters solution of Acid can handle so I'm going to weigh out and track eight different cotton balls so we can measure their success

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.569
after they've been nitrated so we can find the point where the nitration starts dropping off. Here goes Cotton ball number one and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.319
It looks like we are at 0.55 grams Cotton ball number two

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.239
zero point six zero number five

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.089
Now the beginning of this video. I told you we might be doing something with tampons as well

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.020
And here's what I'm thinking if we open up one of these applicator packages and take a look inside

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.659
You can see that tampon is mostly just made of cotton

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.040
So if we stripped away the outer membrane and dip just the cotton tampon into our solution

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.709
Do you think are we possible to get a tampon to work as well flash Tampax that doesn't really serve any useful purpose

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.780
it's just for fun

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.910
to 2.40

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.169
So our solution is cooled down to about 85 degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.140
That's good enough for me

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.330
So let's go ahead and take cotton ball number one and use a glass stir stick to hold it in solution

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.040
so it can nitrate for about five minutes now the cotton is nitrating theoretically the temperature should be rising again as well

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.930
You can see we're already up to 88 Fahrenheit now while our Cotton ball is soaking here

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.890
Let me tell you a little bit about what's taking place

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.229
The fibers of the Cotton Ball themselves are reacting with the nitric acid to nitrate the Cotton which also releases moisture into the solution

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.390
Now moisture isn't really good for this reaction

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.460
So the sulfuric acid which is a dehydrating agent absorbs that moisture and keeps the reaction relatively clean

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.399
depending on how much cotton we have in the solution the reaction can get very very hot which is why we're measuring the temperature and

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.090
We have a bath of ice water we can dump it to if we need to all right good news

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.790
It's been five minutes. So our time is up with Cotton ball number one

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.719
So we're just going to fish that off and we're going [to] squeeze it to leave as much of the liquid as we can in

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.929
The container we're going to transfer it to a glass of fresh water and let it soak

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.760
You can see that as we dab the cotton ball into the water at least it's quite a bit of the acid that has stored

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.859
And we need to do this four to seven times to thoroughly rinse out as much acid as we can possibly get

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.530
see if there's any fizzing

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.089
There's a little bit of acid on there the baking soda helps neutralize any of the leftover acid in the cotton

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.810
Now we simply repeat that process over and over again until all eight Cotton balls are finished

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.989
Update guys all eight [of] our cotton balls are finished. They have been fully nitrated

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.979
They've been washed rinsed cleansed and put on this plate to sit overnight to dry

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:36.969
Unfortunately while they're still wet we don't have any way to test them, but in tomorrow's video

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.039
We're going to light them [up] and see how they perform

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.058
And what's going to happen with this thing could it be that we've just invented the world's first

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.389
Pyrotechnic Tampon and very curious to find out so in the meantime. Let's take just a second to briefly recap

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:50.139
What we did here [today]?

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:51.559
And what we're trying to accomplish

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:56.648
We start off our experiment with sulfuric and nitric acid and the intent to mix them together in a 50/50 ratio

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:58.479
But going back and looking at it

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.239
I think I messed up things being from this angle and added 80 milliliters of nitric acid and 60 milliliters of Sulfuric acid

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:08.379
But I think it's still going to work out next we weighed and documented each of our cotton balls

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.669
And then soaked them one by one in the solution for five minutes after soaking for five minutes

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:18.308
We squeezed all the acid out of them rinse them four different times and then put them in a solution of [baking] Soda to neutralize

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:21.398
Any leftover acid after that they were rinsed one more time?

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:25.719
And then all the water was squeezed out then they were placed on this plate where they could sit overnight to dry

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:27.939
So here's the question. I want to figure out tomorrow

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:32.679
How much cotton does it take to use up all the nitric acid in our solution tomorrow?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.579
We're going to play with these cotton balls to see if they go off with a flash and we're going to burn through each of

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:40.389
Them to see where the nitration point started to drop off how many of these cotton balls?

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.648
Do you think we're successfully transferred in the flash cotton leave your thoughts in the comments below?

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:49.088
