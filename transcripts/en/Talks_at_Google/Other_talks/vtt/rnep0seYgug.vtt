&gt;&gt;female presenter: We're very happy today
to welcome Frank Bruni, author of "Born Round:

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.130
A Story of Family, Food and a Ferocious Appetite."
Frank Bruni was named the Restaurant Critic

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.869
for the New York Times in April 2004. Before
then, he was a newspapers Rome bureau chief,

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.470
White House reporter, the lead correspondent
for George W. Bush's 2000 presidential campaign

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.509
and a frequent contributor to the Sunday Times
Magazine. He's the author of the New York

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:35.149
Times bestseller; "Ambling into History by
George W. Bush" and his restaurant related

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.880
articles for The Times have appeared in each
of the last three editions of the Best Food

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.019
Writing in America. He was a finalist for
the Pulitzer Prize in Feature Writing for

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.269
his work before The Times at the Detroit Free
Press and he's currently reporter at large

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.440
for The New York Times and he lives in New
York City. So, please give a warm welcome

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.440
to Frank Bruni.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.969
[applause]

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.000
&gt;&gt;Frank: Hey. Thanks for, thanks for having
me here. I really appreciate it. This is an

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.740
amazing place. I think my colleague, Maureen
Dowd, came here about a year ago and I remember

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.240
reading her column about Google, but until
you kind of see this whole campus it doesn't

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.579
really, you can't really appreciate what this
is. You guys work in a very charmed, charmed

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.280
environment. I hope everyone's happy here
and likes it. I'll swap, I'll swap The New

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.119
York Times for Google with you any day.

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.500
Cynthia said, "What kind of perks do you have
at The Times?" And I thought for awhile and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.509
I realized none. We have, we have the pleasure
of saying you work for The New York Times

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.829
and sometimes that opens doors, but there's
no free food, there's no gym, no nap, no nap

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.729
stations, none, nothing of the kind. I, about
a year ago, I wrote this book. Well, I wrote

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.909
this earlier, but a year ago this book came
out in hardcover. It's called Born Round.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.630
In hardcover, it was called The Secret History
of a Full-Time Eater. This, the title has

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.580
now changed. In the soft cover, the subtitle
is A Story of Family, Food and a Ferocious

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.860
Appetite. And it's a book I wrote because
while there, while there were many, many food

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.140
memoirs out there, many of which I've read
over time because it was just a genre I enjoyed,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.240
I didn't feel like there were any that talked
about the flip-side or the dark side of being

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.980
obsessed with food.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.610
Every food memoir I read everyone just talked
about kind of going into a swoon and falling

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.260
into a field of soft arugula while not upsetting
your champagne flute and the foie gras in

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.620
the background. And almost everybody I met
when I started writing predominantly about

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.470
food, as The New York Times' restaurant critic,
everybody I met in the kind of food journalism

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.670
world was someone who was extremely, extremely
disciplined about their food consumption.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.230
They were not these wonder people who had
furnace-like metabolisms who never had to

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.510
worry about what they eat. In fact, they were
the most, they were the most kind of vigilant,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.261
mindful eaters I'd ever met, but no one ever
talked about that as they wrote all of this

00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:58.410
lovely prose that exhorted people to kind
of pull, pull a chair up to the table and

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.410
dig in.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.880
So, I wanted to write a food memoir. I wanted
to write a book about my relationship with

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.750
food, which was a very unusual one in terms
of the drama and comedy of it that, that kind

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.850
of told a fuller story about what food can
do to people and how food can trip people

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.130
up. I was someone who, in the course of my
life, went on every fad diet there ever was;

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.840
yo-yoed over time, back and forth between
about 180 pounds to about 280 pounds. And

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.070
I thought telling that story from the vantage
point, from the ironic vantage point, of someone

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.890
who ended up making, making eating his profession
made a lot of sense.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.640
I, I, what I'd mostly like to do today is
just answer questions people have because

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.370
I find everyone has questions about what it's
like to be a restaurant critic, what it's

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.610
like to be The New York Times' restaurant
critic. We can talk about journalism in general,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.500
Google's effect on it--no, I'm just kidding.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.500
[laughter]

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.900
We can do whatever, but just to give you a
little bit more of a flavor of the book, I,

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.150
I just thought I'd and to kinda run out the
clock a little bit, I thought I'd just read,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.971
read one passage. The book goes through pretty
much a whole life told from the vantage point

00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:09.730
of food, but whenever I had little adventures
along the way I tried to put them in here

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.791
if I thought they made for good stories. Right
before I became the restaurant critic, I was

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:18.269
The Times' Rome bureau chief; that's the title
they use. We have one correspondent in Rome,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.790
so, you're the bureau chief of one.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.790
[laughter]

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.840
But that's the title they give you so we use
it and I was covering Italy and Greece and

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.740
the Vatican. And when I went to Italy, I had
just lost an enormous amount of weight and

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.270
people said, "Well, how are you ever gonna
keep it off if you are in Italy?" And so,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.229
I was looking at Italy, in part, through the,
through the prism of someone who's, "Ok, why

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.680
are all of these people who live in this food
paradise not as fat as the average American?"

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.100
And so a chapter of the book sort of is, is
me going through Italy trying to figure out

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.520
what that's about and, and I just wanted to
read you a little, a little snippet from that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.430
if I've marked it correctly. Ok, this is in
terms of why aren't Italians fatter than they

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.430
are?

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.430
[reads from book]

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.180
"The answer wasn't exercise. My experience
trying to find and use a proper gym, somewhere

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.900
with the full complements of weights and an
attractive array of cardiovascular machines

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.139
and a setting that blunted the potential drudgery
of it all, made that immediately clear. In

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.510
the center of Rome, where The Times office
was located, there was nothing like a spacious

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.680
gleaming equinox where past illegitimate fitness
centers were the sorts of perfunctory setups

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.870
you found in hotels. They were depressing
and they weren't gonna motivate me to visit

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.939
often or linger for more than a few minutes
at a time. But in a slightly less central

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:36.969
location, along one edge of the Villa Borghese
Park, was the Roman Sport Forum or La Roman,

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.749
as people in the know called it, speaking
of it as they might La Loren or La Jolie.

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.870
Romans saw it as an ostentatiously endowed
diva of a gym even though it was little larger

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.629
or better outfitted than the kind of health
club you find in any strip mall in any American

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.680
excerpt. It had a modest pool,--

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.780
[clears throat]

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.050
"a weight room with scores of machines, a
glass walled exercise studio for calisthenics

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.530
and perhaps two dozen treadmills, Stairmasters,
recumbent bikes and the like. It was darker

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.120
than any American gym I knew, making me wonder
if Italians considered mood lighting a catalyst

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.740
for working out. I was thinking along the
wrong lines. Working out wasn't really the

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.639
point of La Roman. In fact, the managers of
La Roman seemed intent on preventing it. For

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.919
starters, there was the signed doctor's note
they insisted I get in order not just to join

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.729
the gym, but even to venture as far as the
locker room during an initial visit. I produced

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.259
a note, paid for a six month membership, changed
into my work out clothes and found an available

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.400
treadmill. I had been on it less than five
minutes when I noticed one of the gym attendants

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.509
standing at my side flapping his arms and
yelling at me. "E vietato," he was saying

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.909
and I would soon realize that whether you
were speaking to an attendant at La Roman

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:48.219
or reading one of the many signs posted on
the walls, that phrase was the most prevalent

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:55.090
one; a kind of motto for the gym: E vietato.
E vietato, translation: It's forbidden. But

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:01.599
precisely what about my activity on the treadmill
vietato? Running? All the Italians on the

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.020
treadmills around mine were walking and they
were walking rather slowly at that and nary

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.999
a pinprick of perspiration smudging their
fashionable exercise outfits. My own t-shirt

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:13.749
was already mottled and wet. So maybe sweating
was vietato.

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:15.639
[laughter]

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:19.770
"The attendant explained that while the note
from my doctor entitled me to use the gym's

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.400
pool, weight machines, locker room and, of
course, snack bar, it didn't entitle me to

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.509
use any cardiovascular equipment. For that,
I needed to submit to an independent examination,

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:34.439
including a stress test with heart monitors
taped to my chest, by the gym's own physician.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:38.330
It would cost me a hundred dollars and an
appointment wasn't available until a week

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.499
from then. I bided my time, paid my money,
passed the stress test and returned to the

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:47.479
treadmill without incident using my gym visits
to run three or so miles on a treadmill and

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:51.800
spend 30 to 40 minutes lifting weights. In
the weight rooms were signs spelling out,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.970
for unexplained reasons, that it was vietato
to chew gum. It was vietato to leave free

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.930
weights lying around, a transgression that
might require one of the half dozen attendants

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.819
to do something other than gossip with one
another, haranguing unauthorized treadmill

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:10.279
users and unwind in the snack bar, which was
a nearly full scale trattoria with seating

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:14.900
for dozens and a menu that included spaghetti
carbonara and prosciutto e melone.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.900
[laughter]

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.840
"My path to and from the locker rooms skirted
its tables at which I'd sometimes spot at

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.259
my way out of the gym, the same La Roman staffers
and members I'd spotted on my way in. It apparently

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:29.450
wasn't vietato for a member of La Roman to
lean against or straddle a weight machine

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.900
for twenty uninterrupted minutes, monopolizing
it without attempting anything more physical

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.630
than the arching of an eyebrow. La Roman members
did this all the time, provided that the weight

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.260
machine in question afforded them a good view
of other patrons and vice versa. Although

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.250
most of them were thin and no small number
of them were gorgeous, their time a La Roman

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.130
deserved little credit for that. I was marveling
one evening at their languorous, even phobic,

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.230
relationship with physical exertion when,
yet again, a flapping yelling gym attendant

00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.570
materialized at my side. He spoke in such
rushed, histrionic Italian that I had to implore

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.730
him a half dozen times to slow down, back
up, repeat himself and maybe use fewer polysyllabic

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:11.390
words. What exactly was il problema? He pointed
to my gym shorts, then grabbed my arm and

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:16.580
tugged me to a sign I hadn't noticed before.
It explained that it was vietato to wear shorts

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.430
that didn't adhere tightly to your legs.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.060
[laughter]

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.970
"My shorts didn't and were thus, vietato.
Trust me on this, the shorts I was wearing

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:29.380
were as unremarkable and unobjectionable as
athletic shorts could be. They were precisely

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.770
the type of shorts: ribbed waist, drawstring,
thick cotton, material reaching halfway down

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.180
the thigh that every college since the dawn
of academia has printed its logo on and sold

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.020
in the student store. They weren't flamboyant
shorts, they weren't tattered shorts, they

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.910
weren't skimpy shorts, they were archetypical,
boring athletic shorts. Why did it matter

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.970
whether they adhered to my legs? I told the
attendant in my flawed, functional Italian

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.180
that for my next visit to the gym I would
get and wear shorts that were adhering or

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.970
adhesive or whatever they were supposed to
be. Then I turned away from him and headed

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.280
to the next weight machine I planned to use.
I felt a tug on my arm; he wouldn't let me

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.530
go. He held up an index finger in the international
signal for "wait a second," and bolted away.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:17.220
Within less than a minute he was back with
two thick, blue rubber bands. I'd seen rubber

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.160
bands like these before; they were the kind
often wrapped around the base of a head of

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.220
broccoli and maybe that's where they'd been
at some point. But as he handed them to me,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.870
I understood that where they were supposed
to be now was wrapped around each two floppy

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:33.090
leg of my two floppy cotton gym shorts. I
fingered them, looked strangely at them, looked

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.190
strangely at him trying to work some self
pity and pleading into my expression and get

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:42.340
a pass. He didn't waver. And so I bet to his
will, or rather, snapped to it and spent the

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.840
next 45 minutes stalking La Roman like a human
broccoli; each thigh banded in blue.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.080
[laughter]

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.850
"A few days later I ran into one of my few
acquaintances at the gym and asked him if

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:56.530
he could shed some light on this floppy shorts
policy. 'You can't wear floppy shorts,' he

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:02.120
explained, 'because if you did, other people
could see up your legs to your crotch.' 'But

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.370
all they'd see,' I said, 'is my underwear.'
'You don't understand,' he said. 'The problem

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.680
the gym was having was that some people were
short, loose legged shorts and not wearing

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.220
underwear.' He paused and added, 'Deliberately.'

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.500
[laughter]

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.390
"So, now I understood what was actually vietato
was flashing your fellow gym users. And what

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.030
many La Roman regulars most wanted to do wasn't
shoulder presses and a full half hour on the

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:30.060
elliptical. They wanted to pose, hence the
mood lighting, preen, hence the avoidance

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:35.000
of perspiration and give their fellow fitness
enthusiasts a gander at the family jewels.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.040
That last impulse explained not only the policy
on floppy shorts, but also a sign posted in

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.760
the men's locker room. It stressed that it
was vietato to shower with the door in front

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.080
of your individual stall open."

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.190
[laughter]

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.730
Anyway, I never did quite solve the riddle
fully why Italians aren't as heavy as we are,

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.130
but I think it mostly has to do with portions
and it doesn't have to do with their time

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.201
at La Roman or any other Italian gym I ever
encountered. I'd love to answer any questions

00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:12.180
anybody has about food, restaurants, The New
York Times, or nothing. You had one before.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.400
[pause]

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:32.368
&gt;&gt;female audience member #1: I was wondering
if you missed being able to eat for a living?

00:12:32.368 --> 00:12:33.368
I mean, having read your book, I know that
some of the food issues and obsessions that

00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:34.368
you had, I just wondered if you missed that,
like, having the excuse to eat?

00:12:34.368 --> 00:12:36.280
&gt;&gt;Frank: When I was The Times' restaurant
critic, I would eat out seven nights a week.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.620
Sometimes I would eat two dinners in a row
because you have so much scouting of restaurants

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:44.330
to do. Every restaurant that we review and
give a star rating to because that rating

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:49.440
can have such economic consequence the loose
rule of thumb is that you visit it at least

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.920
three times. Probably most of the restaurants
I reviewed, I visited four times. So, yeah,

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.610
I had, I had an obligation or definitely this,
this thing that kept me going out. I don't

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.240
miss it in that sense and I don't feel like
I need an excuse to kind of go out or have

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.720
a great meal. I mean, it's something I, I
left to my own devices; it's something I'm

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.800
gonna do anyway. And what's nice is, is not
kind of having to have your schedule determined

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.430
by what the new restaurants are or what you
have to visit two more times before "X" date.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:24.980
I just, I find that I can, I can use restaurants
more the way I want to than ever, than I was

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:29.590
for five and a half years. I can go back to
a given restaurant and keep ordering the same

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.350
dish over and over again because I love it
and that's something that when you're a critic,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.530
you lose that opportunity. You lose the opportunity
to be a regular at a restaurant, which I think

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.200
is one of the greatest joys of restaurant
going; it's establishing a really nice relationship

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.760
with a favorite place and going again and
again. And restaurant criticism sort of doesn't

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.030
sort of allow for that or really capture that.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.030
[pause]

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:52.780
&gt;&gt;female audience member #2: Thanks for joining
us today.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.660
&gt;&gt;Frank: Thanks for having me.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.460
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: So, I was curious about
the, the process. So, you're told you have

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:05.110
to critique a certain restaurant? What do
you do? Do you gather the troops and go a

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:11.762
few times or kind of, how do you then get
to the point where you're actually writing

00:14:11.762 --> 00:14:12.762
the review?

00:14:12.762 --> 00:14:14.630
&gt;&gt;Frank: You're not really kind of told to
go to a restaurant. You pretty much, you're,

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.940
you're watching the calendar of openings.
Usually, it's pretty obvious what restaurants

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.930
need to be reviewed because they're the restaurants
that, in if Tom Kalikio is opening a new restaurant,

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.480
the public curiosity about that is going to
be intense enough that that's definitely a

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.130
restaurant you're gonna have to review. I
would say two thirds of the restaurants you

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:36.500
review in a given year fall into that sort
of "no brainer" category. When you, when you

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.240
see a restaurant opening that you, that you
feel you're gonna have the need to review

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.200
and that people have a curiosity about the,
wants, that the curiosity be sated fairly

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:48.600
quickly, you kind of look at the calendar,
you say, "How, when will that restaurant have

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.450
been open about three, three and a half months?"
Because you don't wanna do it right away cause

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:56.191
that's not really gonna be an accurate snapshot
of the restaurant. You, you don't really wanna

00:14:56.191 --> 00:15:00.040
visit in the first week or the first two weeks.
Once you figure out like when it's sort of

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.810
ripe to be written about, you kind of work
your way backwards and you stagger a bunch

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:09.570
of reservations so that on what would be the
due date for your review, you'll have three

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.741
or four visits to the restaurant under your
belt and you'll be able to write. You get

00:15:13.741 --> 00:15:18.500
on the phone, you make a lot of reservations,
you, you learn exactly what that restaurants

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.750
reservation policies are and you make sure
to call at the earliest possible moment because

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:27.010
you can't afford not to get in because you
need it for your job, but you're calling anonymously

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:30.950
so you're not pulling strings. And then you
reach out to your friends and in this rubix

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.810
cube of a schedule you construct, you can
decide who you invite to come with you this

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.940
time or that time. Sometimes you leave that
to the last minute, but you almost always

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:42.720
make a reservation for four because one of
the goals of repeat visits to a restaurant

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.960
is to work your way through the menu. So,
if you're only going alone or with one other

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.490
person, it's very hard to order a variety
of food. And then you keep track of what you

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:55.640
eat so when you go back a second or third
time, if you've had the salmon twice or you've

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.520
had the rib eye, you don't get that again;
you have a lot of very, very disappointed

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.720
friends who sit down very excited and then
you tell them what they cannot order.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.910
[laughter]

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.690
And you encounter a lot of long faces and
then you hold up your credit card and say,

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.970
"Remember, I'm paying so it's not really so
bad."

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:10.970
[laughter]

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.970
That's the process.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:12.970
&gt;&gt;audience member #1: Thanks.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:13.970
&gt;&gt;Frank: Sure.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.260
&gt;&gt;female audience member #3: Hi. Thanks for
being here.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.700
&gt;&gt;Frank: Thanks for having me.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:29.350
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: I have lots of questions,
among them, can a hole in the wall restaurant

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:38.910
get four stars? And two, did, did you wear
disguises like Mimi Sheraton? Three, what

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.890
was it like going from restaurant criticism
back to real journalism? One is so subjective

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:46.390
and it's a different kind of writing and then
to go back to digging for facts and investigating

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.890
and then to find, I, when you criti-, where
you a critic for two years?

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:56.450
&gt;&gt;Frank: I was a critic for fi-, five and
a quarter years; five and a half, yeah.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:02.740
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: Five and a half, so,
Google had really changed things by the time

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.159
you came back to reporting. So, what was,
what was that like? That's my main question.

00:17:06.159 --> 00:17:08.930
&gt;&gt;Frank: Ok, the, I'll take them in reverse
order because I can remember them that way.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:14.329
The "what was it like to go back to quote
unquote real reporting from restaurant criticism,"

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:18.949
I actually don't see the things as differently
as someone else might. I think where--

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:19.949
[clears throat]

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:23.789
while criticism asks you to insert, it doesn't
really ask, it demands that you insert your

00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:28.700
own opinion, I think its foundation is the
gathering of information and evidence. I mean,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.340
it's I think, the same powers of observation
and analysis that you use when you write a

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:40.009
profile of a political figure are the ones
you use when you are doing a piece of criticism.

00:17:40.009 --> 00:17:44.029
It's just that at the end of it all and during
the process of it all, you're not trying to

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:48.539
put your personal feelings to the side, you're
actually trying to kind of almost, almost

00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:53.350
cultivate your personal feelings. But it doesn't,
it's not really, the process isn't that, isn't

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.940
really that different and I don't think the
skills are that different. The Internet change

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:03.210
has changed restaurant criticism a lot in
the sense that there's now any number of sites

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.440
that, that rely on user generated content.
And so you can go to Yelp--

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440
[clears throat]

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.470
and you can use that as your restaurant reviewing
resource as opposed to The New York Times.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.740
I think that, I think that as people get smarter,
they'll see that it's not a substitute though.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.960
We were talking about this at lunch. You don't
know when you're reading, like you could be

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.480
reading ten Yelp raves for a place all ten
of those may have been planted by the restaurant.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.549
If I were opening a restaurant tomorrow, and
I mean this not cynically, but seriously,

00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:36.290
if I were opening a restaurant tomorrow, the
first thing I would probably do is activate

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:40.539
a phone tree or Internet tree or friends and
say, "Hey, will everyone like post a positive

00:18:40.539 --> 00:18:45.860
review of this place?" So that I'm insulated
from negative star ratings on, on a user generated

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.270
content site. My point is you have no idea
where that stuff's coming from. You have no

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.600
idea if, even if it is a legitimate rave,
if you have no idea if that person knows anything

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.029
at all about dining out, has any frame of
reference, went to the restaurant more than

00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:04.760
once, ordered more than one thing, so I think
that as a lot of, as the Internet offers people

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.999
more and more places to go and get what, what
seems like a kind of broader based review

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:14.679
of things, I think that traditional criticism's
gonna be seen as more important and more reliable

00:19:14.679 --> 00:19:17.990
than ever because it's the only place you
can go and really trust that you're getting

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:23.211
an independent viewpoint that has no economic
stake in what it's writing about and that

00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:26.622
has a kind of broad frame of reference earned
by eating out night after night after night.

00:19:26.622 --> 00:19:27.622
There was another question. I'm, I, I forgot
one of your questions. I'm sorry.

00:19:27.622 --> 00:19:35.289
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: Does a hole in the wall
restaurant deserve a four star rating [inaudible]

00:19:35.289 --> 00:19:38.431
&gt;&gt;Frank: I think any restaurant can get a
f-, can get four stars and there are very

00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:42.600
few hole in the wall restaurants, true hole
in the wall restaurants that are spending

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.730
the kind of money that you would need to spend
to get the kind of ingredients that would

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:51.690
really earn you four stars. But, if you mean
like cosmetically, can a restaurant that is

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:57.350
not, that, that's not draping its tables in
white linen and and pulling all the bells

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.241
and whistles, can something like that get
four stars? Yeah, I think so. And I think

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:05.440
it has happened and it will happen, but four
stars is a pretty rare thing, so it doesn't

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440
happen that often.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.590
&gt;&gt;female audience member #4: Thanks for coming.
One of my questions is about, it's kind of

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.450
related to what you were asking, actually,
is anonymous critics versus someone who's

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.360
recognizable like you, so there was an article
in The New Yorker awhile back about the Michelin

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.360
Guide and--

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.360
&gt;&gt;Frank: Yeah.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:26.210
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: how it's so secretive.
And I was wondering kind of what, what your

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.179
thoughts are on that and if it's more effective,
less effective when it's shrouded in secrecy?

00:20:29.179 --> 00:20:32.159
&gt;&gt;Frank: Right. Well, when I was, when I was
a critic, I mean I, I've done a lot of TV

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:37.179
appearances since I handed in my, my critics
pass or whatever you wanna call it metaphorically,

00:20:37.179 --> 00:20:41.539
but when I was a critic I never let my photo
be taken in real time. There were some surreptitiously

00:20:41.539 --> 00:20:46.120
taken cell phone pictures out there. They
were old pictures from book jackets in the

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.370
past. I was frequently recognized--

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.370
[clears throat]

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:54.370
in a city like New York or like San Francisco
where you have sophisticated restaurateurs

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:59.120
and where the stakes are very high and a lot
of money is, is on the line. You're never

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.970
gonna have a critic who operates for more
than a few months before almost everybody

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.289
who wants to know what that person looked
like, looks like, has figured it out. In my

00:21:07.289 --> 00:21:11.809
first months on the job, many, many times
I would be sitting in a restaurant and I would

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:17.799
notice, in the sort of vestibule area, like
people walk in, pause, like look at me for

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:22.179
awhile and walk out. And I learned that what
was happening was in those initial months

00:21:22.179 --> 00:21:26.480
if a restaurateur did recognize me, he or
she would literally get on the phone to like,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.559
the neighborhood, to the restaurants nearby
and say, "I've got him right here, live in

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:33.201
the flesh, come in, take a look." And that's
what was happening.

00:21:33.201 --> 00:21:34.201
[laughter]

00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:40.790
Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin, told
me at one point that not only did he, when

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:44.460
I was appointed, not only did he do what pretty
much every restaurateur in Manhattan did and

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.200
like do a Google image search and see what,
what could be gotten, but if he saw a reference

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:55.889
to me giving some commentary about the presidential
election on Nightline, back in 2000, he went

00:21:55.889 --> 00:22:02.299
to the, he went to the network and actually
kind of purchased or as a favor, got the tape

00:22:02.299 --> 00:22:06.130
because he wanted his staff not only to look
at still photos of the critic, but to see

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:12.880
the critic gesticulating, to hear the critics
voice. My point is unless you changed in in-in

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.750
cities as cut throat as New York and San Fran,
unless you changed critics every four to six

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.990
months, you're never gonna have a critic that
is not recognized by the restaurateur and

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:27.169
chefs who really want to recognize the critic.
Disguises you hear a lot about because it's

00:22:27.169 --> 00:22:32.600
great copy, it's, it's for, for a restaurant
critic to come whether selling a book or just

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.779
giving a talk and-and tell tales about all
the times they were disguised, it's great,

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:42.769
it's great material. It's not really true.
It's really, really laborious to put on disguises

00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:46.200
that are convincing to wear them, so even
the restaurant critics who've become most

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.190
famous as disguising themselves, really weren't
doing it that frequently. They were doing

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:56.559
it; it's not a lie, but it's not really, it's
not, it's not the nightly MO of any restaurant

00:22:56.559 --> 00:23:00.419
critic cause it's just too difficult. It's,
it's too difficult to pull off.

00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:06.360
&gt;&gt;female audience member #5: Thanks for coming.
I've read your book and it's really amazing.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.960
&gt;&gt;Frank: Oh, thanks.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.830
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: I have two questions
for you. One: what was your most memorable

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:15.470
experience as a restaurant critic? And two:
how are you critiquing your own food?

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:16.669
&gt;&gt;Frank: You mean food I make?

00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:17.669
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: Mm-hmm.

00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:22.570
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, I'm not, I'm not a very good
cook so I don't, I, I'm very impatient. So

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:29.169
I, I don't cook all that often and when I
do, I critique my food very generously.

00:23:29.169 --> 00:23:30.450
[laughter]

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:37.120
But, I forgot your first question, I'm sorry.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.950
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: Most memorable experience
as a restaurant critic.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:43.899
&gt;&gt;Frank: It, it's, it's eating out as much
as you are, traveling as much as you get to

00:23:43.899 --> 00:23:49.409
at times, it's really hard to say there's
a most memorable experience, but I do seem

00:23:49.409 --> 00:23:53.169
to always kind of when someone asks that question
remember early, early on, in the first couple

00:23:53.169 --> 00:23:57.529
months when I came back from Italy and I was
living in New York and I was just beginning

00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:02.549
this particular job, the restaurant critic
job, I was lucky. A couple very ambitious

00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:06.830
restaurants opened just, just as my watch
was beginning, so I got to go to them frequently.

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:12.440
One was Per Se, which is the East Coast version
of The French Laundry, one is the most expensive

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.340
restaurant in New York; it's called Masa.
And it is a kind of set menu that you go and

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:22.220
you have for set price which is anywhere from
350 to 500 dollars based on the ingredients

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:30.539
at that time of year and that's without booze,
water, tip, any of that. And Masa is this,

00:24:30.539 --> 00:24:35.669
it's almost this kind of monastic space; it's
very small. It's Japanese. It's mostly, the,

00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:42.590
the kind of, the, the heart of the meal is
is-is sushi that is made piece by piece for

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:48.429
you by a su-, a sushi chef, who's just attending
only like probably you and the person next

00:24:48.429 --> 00:24:54.999
to you and maybe one other person. Masa would
open for lunch if they had a reservation.

00:24:54.999 --> 00:25:00.630
And one day I went there for lunch and it
was just me and the paper's wine critic. And

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:06.009
we got there and nobody else was in the entire
restaurant and so Masa, himself, not one of

00:25:06.009 --> 00:25:12.179
his, not not one of his his kind of colleagues,
was the only one there and we literally ate

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:16.710
about a three hour meal in which every single
piece of food that we consumed, we consumed

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:21.470
just moments after he finished assembling
it in real time. And each piece of sushi he

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:27.179
would hand you and you would take it in your
hand and there was just something so unbelievably

00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:31.049
pampering and intimate about that that I'll
never forget that meal. And having it in the

00:25:31.049 --> 00:25:34.830
middle of the day just felt like especially
decadent.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.830
[laughter]

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.519
I mean, it was just like the height of decadence
to spend that kind of money and that kind

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:49.809
of time in the middle of the day, I think
just ramped it, I think just sent it off

00:25:49.809 --> 00:25:50.809
the charts.

00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:52.129
&gt;&gt;female audience member #6: I have one simple
question. What, what is your current relationship

00:25:52.129 --> 00:25:53.129
with food?

00:25:53.129 --> 00:26:02.519
&gt;&gt;Frank: I love food. My current relationship
with food is not nearly as tumultuous as it

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:08.730
has been in the past. It's one mostly of just
outright love, but I, I still find myself

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:14.480
still having to be very careful. I, I'm a
life-long overeater who has had some periods

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:20.730
of very bad health because of it and that
never goes away. It's interesting, if-if-if-

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:27.340
if-if my book fits in a genre, in any one
genre, it probably more fits in, in, it's

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:32.239
probably better described as an addiction
memoir than a food memoir in some ways. But

00:26:32.239 --> 00:26:36.379
food is a really tricky thing. I didn't think
of it this until I was fortunate enough when

00:26:36.379 --> 00:26:40.429
I was sending around the manuscript to get
a, a quote, a blurb from Augusten Burroughs,

00:26:40.429 --> 00:26:44.669
who I don't know, but who I, who I knew some
people in common and I sent him the manuscript

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:47.940
and what he said what we put on the cover,
on the hardcover. I think it's on the inside

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:53.690
of this, was food was a really tricky addiction
because with anything else; alcohol, crack,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:58.480
heroin, the answer is just stop. But when
you have someone who's got a food addiction

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.830
or is an overeater, you can't say, "Well,
just avoid the substance entirely." So, it's

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.360
a much, much kind of subtler challenge and
I think it's a challenge that never, that

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.769
never really goes away.

00:27:10.769 --> 00:27:24.419
&gt;&gt;female audience member #7: Where do you
look for, look to as experts when you're looking

00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:26.690
for criticism on food now? Particularly if
you're going to say, a new city, and trying

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:27.690
to decide where to eat while you're there.
Where do you start?

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:31.289
&gt;&gt;Frank: I don't, it's interesting, I don't
have a method. I mean, I, I begin with Google,

00:27:31.289 --> 00:27:35.749
I mean as we all do when we're doing an Internet
search and I say that not just cause I'm here.

00:27:35.749 --> 00:27:40.230
But I mean I just kind of Hoover up a lot
of different things and sort of. I find myself,

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.600
in an unscientific way, triangulating a lot
of different things. Oddly enough, I really

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.440
don't end up looking a lot at Yelp or CitySearch
or stuff like that. And it's not because of

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.570
the extreme negative view I painted a second
ago. I mean, I do think all of those things

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:58.240
are useful if they're, if they're looked at
and analyzed and in the right way and taken

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.380
with a grain of salt, but there's so much
between blogs, magazines, travel guides, there's

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:11.080
so much writing out there that you can be
going somewhere, you can do an aggressive

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.960
Internet search and if you really kind of
read through everything that's coming you

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.960
start to, you start to notice points of agreement
and commonality. Like, suddenly like, I mean

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.940
like, certain restaurants at every, at every
kind of point in the, in the cost spectrum

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:29.039
will just keep coming at you again and again.
And I think you begin to get a gut sense of

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:34.440
where it is you want and need to go. I also,
though, avail myself of a kind of tool that

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.620
unfortunately everyone doesn't have, which
is I know a lot of food writers, I know a

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.720
lot of people who travel a lot--

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.720
[clears throat]

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.289
and maybe haven't written up their discoveries.
So I work, I send out a lot of emails to friends,

00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:50.950
to friends whom I know that like, probably
have, have been to some of the places and

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:53.190
so I use a lot of those informal recommendations
as well.

00:28:53.190 --> 00:29:09.453
&gt;&gt;female audience member #7: Thanks for coming.
I really enjoyed your book.

00:29:09.453 --> 00:29:10.453
&gt;&gt;Frank: Thank you.

00:29:10.453 --> 00:29:11.453
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: If you had a friend
coming to visit you in New York and only had

00:29:11.453 --> 00:29:12.453
time for one meal, where would you take him
or her and what dish would you get?

00:29:12.453 --> 00:29:13.453
&gt;&gt;Frank: I, I can't answer that because I,
I'd ask the friend a bunch of questions, you

00:29:13.453 --> 00:29:18.429
know what I mean? Like, one meal I, I, is
just, is the friend in the mood for Italian?

00:29:18.429 --> 00:29:22.370
Does the friend, if the friends coming from
Italy, I'm not gonna take him or her to an

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:27.470
Italian restaurant. Does the friend want a
semi-formal experience? Does the friend want,

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:32.759
what is currently the most chattered about
thing? For a while there like, the kind of

00:29:32.759 --> 00:29:36.890
split the difference place you never, that
you never kind of bombed out if you took someone

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:41.820
to was Momofuku Ssam Bar because it was very
particular to New York, it was the subject

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:47.830
of a lot of chatter, it had a menu that actually
had like it was very hard; you'd be hard pressed

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.909
to not find something you don't like on the
menu. These days I probably wouldn't because

00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:55.820
it's almost become a cliché. It's still a
great restaurant, but I think New York has

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.289
such an incredible diversity in wealth of
restaurants and everyone is looking for something

00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:04.570
particular on a given night that I don't think
you can say that there's just this one restaurant

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.489
that they have to eat at when they come to
New York. I don't think you could say it for

00:30:07.489 --> 00:30:11.549
San Fran, either. You really have to kind
of find out a little bit more what someone,

00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:13.919
someone's taste, tastes are and what their
mood is on that night.

00:30:13.919 --> 00:30:20.679
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: Thanks for coming.
And I have two questions. The first one is

00:30:20.679 --> 00:30:23.830
like after dining at one of these incredible,
fascinating restaurants, like night after

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:27.960
night, is, is your bar for excellence or your
bar for this like good food so high that it's

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.509
hard to meet every night? Like that's something
that I wonder. And the second question is,

00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:34.879
like you had, whenever you go out to these
restaurants you had this card that would essentially

00:30:34.879 --> 00:30:38.019
pay for all these meals. For someone like
me, I'm currently a college student right

00:30:38.019 --> 00:30:42.009
now, so like is there a way for me to like
ostensibly like fit within a budget and still

00:30:42.009 --> 00:30:47.120
enjoy some of the res-, some of the restaurants
and some of the food that you enjoy?

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:51.799
&gt;&gt;Frank: I think we've never, the last thing
first; I think, I think you've never lived

00:30:51.799 --> 00:30:55.619
at a better time if you're, if you're, if
you're on a tight budget, you're a college

00:30:55.619 --> 00:30:59.290
student, whatever, and you wanna participate
in the food culture, I don't think there's

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:04.909
a better moment than right now because as,
as the whole white tablecloth idiom is declined,

00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:11.450
more and more ambitious, young chefs are strutting
their stuff in, in, in theaters that are not

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:17.049
stuffy. They don't necessarily have a rope
line of a very high cost. We were talking

00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:22.769
a moment ago about Momofuku Ssam Bar, or similarly
Momofuku Ssam Noodle Bar; you can go in there

00:31:22.769 --> 00:31:26.260
and try some of the things that people, because
you're not on the hook for a three course

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:32.370
meal, because you're giving up certain atmospheres
like a back on your seat or the ability to

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:38.999
make a reservation, all, all are great tradeoffs
to make in return for a lower price. And,

00:31:38.999 --> 00:31:43.389
I mean, all throughout New York there are,
one of the hottest restaurants probably right

00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:47.359
now in New York in terms of people talking
about it, is a place in Little Italy, oddly

00:31:47.359 --> 00:31:51.310
enough because that's usually not where you
find real food of accomplishment, but you

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:55.989
find hokey stuff. But it's called Torrisi
Italian Specialties. And this maybe isn't

00:31:55.989 --> 00:32:00.049
a college budget, but what they do there it's
a very no frills atmosphere, it's a set menu

00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:01.429
for everyone, and it's--

00:32:01.429 --> 00:32:02.429
[clears throat]

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:08.109
Six antipasti, a pasta, an entree and a fairly
like big dessert cookie spread and some Italian

00:32:08.109 --> 00:32:12.940
ice and all of that's for 50 dollars a person.
It's a lot of food for 50 dollars and it's

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:19.330
being served, it's being cooked and, and,
and prepared by, by two guys who have really

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.809
big ambitions, but they just want their food
to be accessible. They want to work in that

00:32:23.809 --> 00:32:28.919
format, which also kind of suits the situation
if you have a lot of investment money to kind

00:32:28.919 --> 00:32:33.499
of launch a place with a lot of bells and
whistles. So, I think, as someone dining on

00:32:33.499 --> 00:32:38.649
a low budget, you can be part of the food
conversation better than ever before because

00:32:38.649 --> 00:32:45.159
there is so much ambition and creativity on,
on the lower price, in the lower price points.

00:32:45.159 --> 00:32:49.470
In terms of am I like kind of ruined, was
what your question by like having had so many

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:54.799
great meals, I did, I did, some of you have
laptops you can look at it right now, I did

00:32:54.799 --> 00:33:00.409
a thing called "The New York Diet, A Food
Diary" for New York Magazine's food website,

00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:03.850
Grubstreet, last week. They asked me, they've
been doing a series of people; they've done

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.730
it with like Tony Bourdian, they did it with
my friend Dana Cowin, who's the editor for

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:11.539
Food &amp; Wine, where they just ask you to keep
track of what you have eaten from a Friday

00:33:11.539 --> 00:33:17.090
through the following Wednesday. It's really
like six days. And on one of those days, I

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:23.179
had, I was gonna go to a barbecue place that
wasn't even my favorite one, but it was just

00:33:23.179 --> 00:33:27.389
logistically what was convenient. I got there,
they're air conditioning wasn't working, they

00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:30.720
only had one table, it was in the worst possible
place and I thought, "You know what? It's

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.529
like the umpteenth 95 degree day in New York.
I can't deal with it." It was 9:05, I was

00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:40.980
cranky, I wanted a drink, I wanted food, I
mean, I literally, my boyfriend and I we just

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.529
did a 360 degree look at the corner, we went
into a nothing sports bar and we had burgers.

00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:49.190
The burgers were utterly ordinary and I was
totally happy because I was hungry and it

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:54.270
was food and I think if most of us are realistic,
you can know great food and you can love great

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:58.659
food, but food is also just something that
kind of fills you up at a moment when you

00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:02.039
need it; when you need a cool place to sit,
you need something cold to drink and you need

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:07.299
something in your belly and I, at least, still
can be made plenty happy by, by having those

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:11.800
needs met without it being a two, three or
four star accomplishment.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:25.710
&gt;&gt;female audience member #8: Thanks again
for coming. So, in many ways restaurants are

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:29.639
sort of like the ultimate start-up. There
are so many that start up every single year,

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.190
very high sort of failure rating; every now
and then there'll be one or two that sort

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.190
of last. Are there any lessons that you think
that sort of Silicon Valley tech world can

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:34.190
learn from the restaurant world?

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.810
&gt;&gt;Frank: Wow. I don't, that's a great question,
but I don't know enough about, I know nothing

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:41.639
about the tech world. I'm like, so I'm, so
trying to draw the bridge between the two

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:48.030
would be kind of tough for me. I mean, I think
that the one thing that I always noticed about,

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:52.929
about restaurants and I think this has to
transfer to every endeavor in life is for,

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:58.270
for all the risks and for all the incidences
of failure. I think when you have people of

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:04.701
ability and passion who really throw themselves
at something in an earnest way, I think it

00:35:04.701 --> 00:35:09.950
usually succeeds. I mean, I think you can,
you can stack the deck against yourself in

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:14.470
ridiculous ways in restaurants as in anything
else in life by kind of just making some really

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.549
dumb decisions about location, in the case
of restaurants; maybe there would be a different

00:35:18.549 --> 00:35:23.540
analogous dumb decision for, for a high tech
company, but if you haven't done anything

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:29.200
really boneheaded and you are, and you, and
you have, and you have some aptitude for what

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.869
you're doing and you're really passionate
about it and you are willing to work twice

00:35:32.869 --> 00:35:37.440
as hard as the people around you, I think
almost always in those situations you find

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.450
success. I think it's really just about passion
and dedication and I think that's gotta be

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.170
true of everything, not just restaurants.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:53.581
&gt;&gt; male audience member #2: I presume you
had dinner or lunch on campus. What did you

00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:54.581
have and what did you think about it?

00:35:54.581 --> 00:35:59.960
&gt;&gt;Frank: I did. Well, first of all, I think
it's, I, I, I'm truly still stunned that you

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.619
can just walk around and eat anything you
want for free. I mean, wow.

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:04.619
[Frank laughs]

00:36:04.619 --> 00:36:10.700
I mean, if we tried that out at The New York
Times for a week, I think you'd see people

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.510
leaving the building with Hefty bags of hanger
steak.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:15.510
[laughter]

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:20.109
I had hanger steak and actually I thought
it was really pretty good. I mean, it was,

00:36:20.109 --> 00:36:25.190
it was, I eat a lot of hanger steak in New
York restaurants. I put it on a ciabatta roll

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:31.180
with some tomatoes and I ate it and it was
a damned good sandwich. Yeah, I mean, I, it's

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:35.559
better than the Times cafeteria and ours isn't
horrible. I mean, I think you guys eat well.

00:36:35.559 --> 00:36:38.839
I'm surprised you're all this fit, but then
again you got the gym, too. You got everything.

00:36:38.839 --> 00:36:39.839
[laughter]

00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:51.789
&gt;&gt;male audience member #3: I wonder if you
have a comment on some of the edicts regulations

00:36:51.789 --> 00:36:56.549
that are going on in New York--

00:36:56.549 --> 00:36:58.391
&gt;&gt;Frank: Some of the what?

00:36:58.391 --> 00:36:59.391
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: The edicts or regulations;
no trans fat, no salt, the blah limitation.

00:36:59.391 --> 00:37:00.460
&gt;&gt;Frank: I have to be careful about that because
that's the kind of thing I could end up writing

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:05.000
about and, and, and it's the kind of thing
like, we all have our personal opinions.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
[clears throat]

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.671
I think I actually kind of have to avoid that
question because I think it's the kind of

00:37:08.671 --> 00:37:13.060
thing I could too easily end up writing about
and I would want writing about it to present

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:18.310
all sides of it and not to have someone say,
"No, but we saw you at Google on something

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:22.010
that went out on YouTube saying X, Y or Z."
So, I, I'm gonna have to muzzle myself on

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:28.450
that one. I'm sorry. It's a very good question.
I mean, and it's, and it's a big, no it's

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:33.530
a big, I, I can say this, I think we're gonna
see a lot, I think it's gonna be, I think

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:38.230
we're gonna see a lot of public activism and
a lot of public debate about this. I mean,

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:44.510
there's a lot of chatter about soda taxes
I think in the same way that there are, hey--

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:46.170
[laughter]

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:51.119
I love dogs.

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:52.780
[laughter]

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.970
I think in the same way that there are sin
taxes on cigarettes and alcohol; I think we're

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:04.089
gonna see more and more discussion of instituting
similar things when it comes to foods that

00:38:04.089 --> 00:38:08.260
are not good for us. But I think we're also
gonna and I'm just kind of like predicting

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.829
the debate. I think there's also gonna be
a lot of debate about who those taxes fall

00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:19.260
on and whether it's quite fair as a matter
of kind of, whether it's just kind of fair

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.010
to kind of have the people paying those taxes
who may be paying them in greater measure,

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:26.119
whether the people can afford to pay them.

00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:36.770
&gt;&gt;male audience member #4: So, kind of the
opposite of the tone of some of the other

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.810
questions, I, I kind of wonder how you got
through five years of that much eating?

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:39.810
[audience member laughs]

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:40.810
I'm going to New York--

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:41.950
&gt;&gt;Frank: You mean psychologically, physically,
spiritually?

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:45.890
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: Yeah, psychologically.
It seems great restaurants are wonderful things,

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:51.210
but trans-, transpose it to a different world,
I wouldn't want to go to the opera every night.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.210
&gt;&gt;Frank: Right, no, yeah.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:55.630
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: And you kinda did that
for--

00:38:55.630 --> 00:39:00.030
&gt;&gt;Frank: No, that is a great question. It,
it's a weird question to answer because when

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:05.359
you, the question presumes that it would be
hardship to have that kind of expense account

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:11.410
and, and charge, professional charge, to eat
out every night. But yes, there are many nights

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.579
when you really, really don't wanna eat out.
There are many nights that when, because of

00:39:14.579 --> 00:39:18.950
the reservation's you've set up, you're on
the hook for a four hour meal at a fancy schmancy

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:23.710
French place and what you really want is a
burger. And that's tough because you've made

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:30.079
your plan. What, what you have to keep reminding
yourself is, among all of those things that

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:34.380
we have to do for work, this is a pretty like
not onerous one.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.380
[laughter]

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.299
No, I mean really, you have to say like in
a work, by its definition, is something you

00:39:39.299 --> 00:39:45.289
have to do. And of all the things that people
suck up in the service of work, having to

00:39:45.289 --> 00:39:51.980
suck up a 250 dollar person, five course,
three hour meal is not really, is not such

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.090
a horrible thing. So, you have to remember
that and the other thing is I would try really

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:59.809
hard to just, in the beginning I made the
mistake often of trying to kind of spread

00:39:59.809 --> 00:40:04.910
the wealth of these places at the table and
make sure to invite this person who worked

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:11.460
over in that cubicle X number of times, and
I kinda tried to be a really, I don't know

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:16.480
what the word is, but I, I was very conscious
about like about, about, about that sort of

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:21.160
like, an etiquette I was inventing and forcing
on myself. As time went on I realized that

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.000
if you have to be out at a restaurant every
night as a matter of work, you really need

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.770
to make it as comfortable for yourself as
possible. So, my universe of diners kept shrinking

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:33.730
and I would dine with the same people over,
I mean the same group of like, say 40, over

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:37.829
and over again because I found that if I wasn't
just totally comfortable at the table, if

00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:41.589
I wasn't in a situation where I didn't feel
like I had to kind of be the song and dance

00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:46.971
host, that, that sort of extra social pressure
of entertaining people, for me, was like the

00:40:46.971 --> 00:40:50.930
tipping point when I didn't feel like being
out that made it really an unpleasant experience.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:55.150
So, I kind of made sure to make it as pleasant
for myself as possible. Hey.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:41:27.051
&gt;&gt;male audience member #5: So, New York and
San Fran both have a pretty strong kind of

00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:28.640
grassroots food and events, so for example,
this past weekend we had like an underground

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.440
market in, in San Fran where it's kind of
like amateur cooks or people who are kind

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.040
of like Internet business, like one or two
people. I was wondering, I've noticed that

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.180
there've been some articles in The Times sort
of covering like, for example, the ice cream,

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.180
the artisan ice cream trucks that go around
there. I was wondering like at what point

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.180
do these kinds of, these, these like kind
of small, grassroots chefs, when do they get

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.180
on the radar of something like The Times?

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.180
&gt;&gt;Frank: I think--

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:38.180
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: Yeah, go ahead.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.180
&gt;&gt;Frank: Oh, no go.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.720
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: And then the second
part would be as a critic, cause you, maybe

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:55.770
you're used to the more traditional like kind
of restaurant model, these things like the

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:56.850
carts and kind of these street food events,
how do you sort of recalibrate your reviews

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:57.850
for something like that?

00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:59.640
&gt;&gt;Frank: Things like artisanal dessert trucks,
stuff like that, they get on the radar of

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:04.400
something like The Times, they get on everyone's
radar really fast because of the Internet,

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.250
which is a great thing. I mean, so we tend
to notice them, I mean even though we, as

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:13.710
Times employees, can only have so many eyes
on so many different things in a city as large

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:19.869
as New York, the fact that there are so many
food bloggers, there are so many different

00:42:19.869 --> 00:42:24.460
corners of the Internet where people are writing
about this stuff; it's pretty easy, actually.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.339
It's easier than ever to be a reporter of
certain sorts of social and lifestyle trends

00:42:28.339 --> 00:42:34.359
these days because anybody out there with
a blog and a, and a computer and a keyboard

00:42:34.359 --> 00:42:39.170
is sort of acting as, as, sort of your advanced
troops and your scouts. So those things, I

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:43.089
think, get noticed really, really quickly.
In terms of how they affect reviewing, I don't,

00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:49.539
I don't, I think its, its apples and oranges.
We, we write a lot of article at The Times

00:42:49.539 --> 00:42:54.220
where we kind of round up some of those things
that you're talking about, whether it's like

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.770
artisanal shaved ice, which there was a big
article my friend, Julia, did awhile ago,

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:01.550
and, and within those articles there is plenty
of commentary on what seems to be best or

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:07.270
not. Those things don't need to be and probably
shouldn't be moved into the restaurant space

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:11.950
because they're not, they're not restaurants.
I mean, there's a kind of necessary definition

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.779
of parameters in the restaurant review space
and while it has, while those parameters have

00:43:15.779 --> 00:43:21.779
grown broader and looser over time, if you
go back long ago, if it wasn't a proper restaurant

00:43:21.779 --> 00:43:26.010
with a tablecloth and all that, it was unlikely
to get reviewed. I think we do rightly draw

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:30.140
the line when it's something like a truck.
You can't really give stars to a truck. I

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:35.690
mean, and, and nor is there as much of an
imperative or as much importance in doing

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.840
so because if you think about it, what you're
doing with the, with the restaurant space

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.610
is you're, you're telling people at the end
of the day the one thing you're doing is you're

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:49.040
telling people whether to go or not. And so,
you should reserve that space and that command

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.630
for something that, that asks a certain level
of financial commitment from them that's more

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:58.210
than the dollar 99 they're spending for a
cup of ice. And I think that's one way to

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.391
think of what belongs inside and outside.

00:43:59.391 --> 00:44:00.391
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: Thanks.

00:44:00.391 --> 00:44:01.391
&gt;&gt;Frank: Sure.

00:44:01.391 --> 00:44:02.391
&gt;&gt;female audience member #9: You mentioned
earlier that you don't love to cook and I

00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:03.391
know you come from more of a journalist background.
So, so you think to be a successful restaurant

00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:08.490
critic you need kind of the training and the
professional restaurant experience to be able

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:19.279
to really speak to the technique of the best
crème brulee you've ever had or not?

00:44:19.279 --> 00:44:21.920
&gt;&gt;Frank: Well, I mean, there's, that's a good
question. There's a lot of different opinions

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:28.789
on that. I think you can, I don't think you
need to be able to make a great crème, crème

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:32.971
brulee in order to judge a great crème brulee.
And what's really interesting is, for some

00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:36.690
reason, it often gets hashed out, not just
in regard to me, but in general cause most,

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:42.710
most restaurant critics aren't extraordinary
accomplished cooks. Most of them do, probably

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:49.030
cook more than I ever did or do, but there's
this discussion of like if you haven't worked

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:53.430
in a restaurant or if you haven't gone to
a culinary academy, do you have any right

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:57.819
reviewing restaurants? Well, I don't know
of many movie critics who've been to film

00:44:57.819 --> 00:45:02.619
school or ever stepped behind a camera or
even been on a film set. I don't know of any,

00:45:02.619 --> 00:45:06.670
most book critics haven't written books and
that's not such a kind of rarified thing to

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:12.140
do. I think that to be a critic of whatever
you're criticizing, the one thing you need

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:17.520
is to have really, really exposed yourself
to the broadest possible world of experience

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.660
in that thing. You need to know, you need
to know what greatness is when you see it

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:27.220
and you need to know when something falls
short and the best way to know that is to

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:32.569
have had such a wealth of experiences; to
have a kind of yardstick that is so much more

00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:38.380
finely calibrated and so much longer than
other peoples, that when you say this is the

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:43.040
best short rib entre in the city, you know
what you're talking about because you've tried

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.960
almost all of them. I don't think you need
to be able to go home and make it. And I think

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:53.140
you can also, I mean, I find when I do, when
I do take stabs at cooking, I mean I'm exaggerating

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.740
my incompetence, but I can look at a recipe
in a cookbook and I can make little tweaks

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.410
and end up liking it a lot better because
I do know a lot about how flavors work together

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:06.471
and I do know like, what's going to be an
engine of moistness and what's gonna be the

00:46:06.471 --> 00:46:12.800
opposite. I just don't, I'm just an impatient
person when it comes to the time and, and

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:17.670
patience necessary to kind of put together
a great meal. It usually ends up watching

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:18.670
something I DVR'd instead on the TV or something.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:19.670
&gt;&gt;audience member #9: Great. And then my second
question is, in terms of kind of a celebrity

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:20.670
chef movement and the new attention that we're
getting with Top Chef and all these shows,

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:25.480
do you think that that's a positive influence
on the restaurant or culinary world or is

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:34.960
it detracting from the genuine nature of it?

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:41.200
&gt;&gt;Frank: I think it's both. I think that one,
on the po-, in, in a positive sense what Top

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:47.799
Chef and a lot of those shows have done is
they've, they've gotten more people interested

00:46:47.799 --> 00:46:53.859
in food and in restaurants than formerly were.
And that's a kind of market that then exists

00:46:53.859 --> 00:47:01.190
that allows a lot more chefs to take economic
risks, to open places, to, to try things out

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:06.150
because they've got a more willing and rapt
audience than they've ever had before so that's

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:11.990
really, really positive. I think on the negative
side, the, the kind of commercialization of

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:19.369
food entertainment has sent a message to a
lot of young chefs to be that they are, that

00:47:19.369 --> 00:47:23.970
what they're after and what this world promises
them is fame and riches and, and they're faces

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:28.590
on billboards. And that actually is only gonna
happen for a very few people and so, I think

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:34.030
the, the danger and the negative part is that
some of the wrong people will be attracted

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:40.500
for the wrong reasons to the hard, hard, hard
work, of-of-of cooking in a restaurant because

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:47.430
they have some misguided illusion that what
this really is is a fast track to being the

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:48.430
next Snooky.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:49.430
[laughter]

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:53.260
No, I mean really, we live in a world where
everyone wants to be some version, high or

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.940
low, of Snooky, and food seems to be a bridge.
I'm serious.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.849
[Frank laughs]

00:47:59.849 --> 00:48:02.411
And I think, and so I think that's the dark
side of the--

00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:09.799
&gt;&gt;audience member #9: Ok, great. Thanks so
much.

00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:11.650
&gt;&gt;Frank: Sure.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:25.630
&gt;&gt;female audience member #10: Hi. I was wondering
what was the reason for the change of your

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:26.630
subtitle for your book from the hardcover
to the soft cover? And also, I was wondering,

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:27.630
in your book you talk about your relationship
with food and how portion control was the

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:28.630
most important thing. And I was just wondering,
psychologically, what was the most important

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:29.630
part about getting the, kind of keeping the--

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:31.279
&gt;&gt;Frank: Ok. The subtitle changed for two
reasons. One was, the previous subtitle was

00:48:31.279 --> 00:48:36.990
"The Secret History of a Full Time Eater,"
I think that's right, the full time eater

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:43.500
reference was a double entendre, it, it, it
referred to just how much time in my life

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:48.690
I spent eating, but it also referred to full
time eater as in like, restaurant critic.

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:53.730
With the soft cover coming out pretty much
11, 12 months after I left that job, that

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:59.920
sort of phrase had less relevance. And then
the other reason was when I and the publisher

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.640
got feedback about the book, whether it was
kind of anecdotal or whether it was reviews

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.670
and I was really, really lucky to get great
reviews, almost everybody keyed in as, on,

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.310
on family stories and on the kind of family
members whose portraits I painted in the book

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:18.349
as their favorite part of it. And so we thought
why not just adjust the subtitle so it's clear

00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:25.180
that this isn't, this isn't just or even primarily
inside tales of a restaurant critic book,

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:30.140
but it's really a, a full-bodied family memoir.
And so, I don't know, I don't know if you've

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.671
looked at it or read it, but I mean--

00:49:31.671 --> 00:49:34.079
&gt;&gt;audience member #10: I read the hardcover.
Are they different?

00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:36.279
&gt;&gt;Frank: No, no, they're exactly the same,
but I mean, I know if you read it I mean there's

00:49:36.279 --> 00:49:41.410
a very detailed portrait of my grandmother
who is in a lot of the book, a lot of the

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:46.740
book is about my mother. We want to make sure
that, that stuff was very dear to me and very

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.819
dear to us and we wanted to make sure that
didn't get lost and we thought maybe the first

00:49:49.819 --> 00:49:56.690
subtitle had given short shrift to that. In
terms of the most important thing about portion

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:00.850
control, well, one, one thing that I think
is, is really helpful, was helpful to me and

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.200
I think would be helpful to a lot of people
is if you are obsessed with food and I think

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.519
this would probably be true if you're obsessed
with anything, to channel that obsession in

00:50:07.519 --> 00:50:12.030
a healthier direction. I don't think you have
to necessarily get rid of the obsession, you

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:18.269
can rechannel it and I, over time, and especially
when I moved to Italy and then even more especially

00:50:18.269 --> 00:50:22.960
when I became a restaurant critic, began to
be increasingly obsessed with quality as opposed

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:28.320
to quantity. And that was a kind of psychological
alteration or trick that helped me a lot.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:34.570
And I also just kind of, you know I spent
a lot of time when I, when I have the kind

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.829
of impulse to be as bad with food as I was
in the past, I spend a lot of time just kind

00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:44.529
of, just kind of pausing and reminding myself
of how unhappy I was and how self-destructive

00:50:44.529 --> 00:50:50.849
I was and just sort of literally like kind
of stopping and flashing back and meditating

00:50:50.849 --> 00:50:55.859
for a second before I pick up the pint of
ice cream. I think, I think you just kind

00:50:55.859 --> 00:50:57.990
of have to do that hard mental work all the
time.

00:50:57.990 --> 00:51:06.599
&gt;&gt; male audience member #6: So I was wondering
if you could go a little bit more into the

00:51:06.599 --> 00:51:10.170
writing process that you employed when writing
the reviews. Is it something that after you

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:14.411
go to a restaurant you would stay up for an
hour later and write down your notes? Or when

00:51:14.411 --> 00:51:19.730
would you finally crystallize your, your opinion
of that night's meal?

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:20.730
&gt;&gt;Frank:

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:21.730
[clears throat]

00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:25.050
I would do a lot of different things. It wasn't
always the same, but some of the things I

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:31.769
did most frequently, I learned over time that
I did like to have some sort of contemporaneous

00:51:31.769 --> 00:51:36.289
notes, but it's impossible to take notes at
a table without drawing attention to yourself

00:51:36.289 --> 00:51:40.760
and I tried texting myself, but that also
just kind of goes on a little bit too long,

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.140
so I would, I would either step outside as
if I were going to have a cigarette or I'd

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:48.150
go to the men's room and I would call myself.
And I would either call my work machine or

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:52.720
my home machine and I would essentially dictate,
because you can talk so much faster than you

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:57.300
can write. I would dictate things that were
coming into my head or descriptions of dishes

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:01.720
or reactions I was having. And that way I
also knew that if I got home at 11:30 and

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:05.329
as part of the meal I had three glasses of
wine and I really just wanted to go to bed,

00:52:05.329 --> 00:52:09.359
I didn't have to worry always about writing
things down because they were waiting, they

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:14.320
were waiting for me to be transcribed on my
voicemail. And the only, and I think it's

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:17.740
a great system, the only danger is occasionally
if you're just a little bit sloppy as you're

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:21.310
cleaning out your voicemail, you ruin a whole
night's notes. Like, you hit the three instead

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:24.940
of the two and you're like, "Oh, there they
go." Luckily, it didn't happen very often,

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:28.960
but and the sometimes I would get, I would
go home and if I was still kind of alert,

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.540
I always for every restaurant I was reviewing,
I had a file in my computer that I would just

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.640
keep adding to. Cause I mean, sometimes you
have a thought three days after the meal.

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:41.400
Just call up the file and add to it and those
files would usually grow over the course of

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:45.559
the five weeks you're visiting the restaurant.
And then when, when it was time to write,

00:52:45.559 --> 00:52:52.119
you kind of read through them and that was
that. You seldom decide what a restaurants

00:52:52.119 --> 00:52:55.630
rating was gonna be or what the review was
gonna say until you finished your visits cause

00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:59.369
it could really change over time. I mean,
you can really, you can go to a restaurant

00:52:59.369 --> 00:53:04.891
one night, just happen across the very, very
worst quadrant of the menu. It could be the

00:53:04.891 --> 00:53:08.910
restaurant's most off night and after three
more visits you can realize, "Wow, I love

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:14.190
this restaurant," and that was a truly, truly
abhorrent experience that needs, that needs

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:17.390
like the Russian judges score of the gymnasts
and needs to be thrown out cause it's the

00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:22.519
one that's, the one that's the farthest afield
from everything else. But, yeah, that was

00:53:22.519 --> 00:53:25.089
basically the process. I should probably just,
we're almost at two o'clock so I should probably

00:53:25.089 --> 00:53:26.820
just take one more question. Thank you, everybody,
for coming.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:31.789
&gt;&gt;male audience member #7: An easy one for
you that you can answer, I'm quite sure. What's

00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:33.839
the most common mistake that you've seen restaurants
make?

00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:40.810
&gt;&gt;Frank: I believe the most common mistake
that restaurants make is, is their, is their

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:45.210
immediate public face to the world, whether
it be on the phone or at the door. I mean,

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:49.700
I think that, I always grew up, my father
used to always say, "First impressions are,

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:54.680
are vitally important because like, you'll
never, you only get one crack at it and you

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:58.960
kind of are always trying to overcome it if
it's a bad one." I'm shocked at the number

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:04.990
of restaurants that don't train or manage
their staff in a way that has them be more

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:09.440
polished and friendly on the phone and I'm
shocked at the number of restaurants which

00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:13.349
don't have a system in place so that when
you walk in and are standing in front of the

00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:17.710
host or hostess station, your, your first
experience is a positive one. I mean, I, I

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:22.660
look around at restaurants at the number of
times you see an arriving party stand there,

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:27.230
kind of almost clamoring for attention for
ten minutes before anybody gets to them. I

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:32.170
can't, it seems to me like such an easy thing
not to do wrong, but I can't believe how many

00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:37.029
restaurants do that wrong. But I think the
great ones don't do it wrong because that's,

00:54:37.029 --> 00:54:41.369
because they know how important it is and
they know that it's an utterly controllable

00:54:41.369 --> 00:54:42.369
situation.

00:54:42.369 --> 00:54:44.970
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: Thank you again, Frank, for coming
today.

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:46.339
&gt;&gt;Frank: Thank you, Cynthia.

00:54:46.339 --> 00:54:51.049
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: We really enjoyed the talk and
again the books are available for sale at

00:54:51.049 --> 00:54:52.049
the back. Thank you.

00:54:52.049 --> 00:54:53.049
&gt;&gt;Frank: Thanks.

00:54:53.049 --> 00:54:53.050
