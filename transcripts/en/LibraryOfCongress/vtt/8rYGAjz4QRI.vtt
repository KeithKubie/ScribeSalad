00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.170
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: I'd like
to welcome you to the Library

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.890
of Congress this afternoon,
an auspicious day in March.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.850
I'm Helena Zinkham, Director
for Collections and also Chief

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.040
of the Prints and
Photographs Division.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.940
So you know I have
a very special stake

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.440
in the proceedings
today, cheering Martha on.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.550
The Prints and Photographs
Division is home

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.030
to a rapidly growing body
of work by women artists.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.940
We are very grateful
to the Caroline

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.470
and Erwin Swann Foundation,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.670
which has supported
these new acquisitions

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.720
and is also sponsoring
today's event.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.440
Our program features
a conversation

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.010
with three acclaimed
women artists.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.400
How about that, have you
been called acclaimed before?

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.700
I'm hoping.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.760
We are celebrating both
women's history month

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.360
and the brand new publication
called "Drawn to Purpose"

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.540
by my colleague Martha Kennedy.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.470
She'll be your moderator
today, a curator of popular

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.480
and applied graphic arts.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.210
This opening slide show
loop gave you a glimpse

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.360
of the dazzling original
art created by women,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.510
now represented all of it
in the library's collections

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.960
from vibrant drawings by our
panelists back into the 1800s,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.260
often we think women whose names
you might never have heard,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.980
but well worth becoming
acquainted.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.530
Because the range of
topics that women address

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.570
and explore has broaden greatly
across this last 150 years,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.190
a big point in the book to watch
how women and art have been able

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.710
to interact and be published,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.400
be known to the world
far more publicly.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.040
The fact that work by so many
women has been overlooked

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.980
and underrecognized
was the very thing

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.180
that motivated Martha Kennedy
to dive deep into research.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.160
Starting almost a decade ago?

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.020
OK. She wrote the book "Drawn to
Purpose" with terrific support

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.620
from our publishing office
well represented today,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.420
and also prepare the companion
exhibition currently on view

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.770
in the graphic arts gallery.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.710
And I'll take a moment
to mention

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.920
that we hope you'll have
time to visit the show

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.080
after the panel presentations

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.650
and it is conveniently
located next to the gift shop

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.460
where you'll all be able to
acquire your very own copy

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.310
of "Drawn to Purpose"
signed by the author.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.120
Martha has of course told me
what a special privilege it has

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.160
been to undertake
these dual projects

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.070
that celebrate women's
remarkable contributions

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.010
to both art forms,
illustration and cartoon.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.420
She wants to thank her many
colleagues across the library

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.210
who have supported and helped
her complete this work.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.620
It is now my honor to
introduce our speakers.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.430
Barbara Brandon-Croft.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.510
Would you mind just standing
briefly so we can all.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.940
[ Applause ]

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.160
Barbara created the
groundbreaking comic

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.270
"Where I'm Coming
From" which ran

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.080
for 15 years from 1990 to 2005.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.680
The first African-American woman

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.510
to have a nationally
syndicated strip,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.520
she introduced an engaging cast

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.080
of black women whose
conversations brought topical

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.230
themes into the comics,
historical

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.240
and contemporary race
and gender issues.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.710
She's also published two very
well received comic collections

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.310
and continues using
her artistic talent

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.260
by illustrating publications
that promote activism.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.620
These include a guide
for black teen girls

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.930
and a recent anthology
called APB,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.610
Artists Against Police
Brutality.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.510
Whitney Sherman, we're
moving alphabetically.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.080
[ Applause ]

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.990
Whitney is Director of the MFA
Illustration Practice Program

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.540
at the Maryland Institute
College of Art

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.320
in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.080
As a multifaceted award
winning illustrator,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.760
she has created artwork
for national magazines,

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.800
corporations and book projects.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.280
Some featuring narrative
content, others focused

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.320
on aspects of illustration
itself.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.950
Whitney has recently co-authored

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.730
and edited a monumental
new book.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.200
Listen to this topic,
history of illustration.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.680
Sweeping, covering the range of
image making and print history

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.590
from around the world spanning
ancient to modern times.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.860
We owe you a debt there I think.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.160
Jillian Tamaki [applause].

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.670
In a short span of years,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.290
Jillian has produced an
impressive volume and variety

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.680
of work that includes two
award wining graphic novels

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.220
in collaboration with
her cousin Marico.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.000
A short story collection,
an award winning webcomic,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.410
editorial illustrations for
newspapers and magazines,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.010
book covers and now her
first children's book,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.120
"They Say Blue".

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.550
Her weekly drawings of authors

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.250
that grace the New York Times
book review have included a

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.220
wonderful portrait of our
Librarian of Congress,

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.970
Dr. Carla Hayden, so we're
particularly grateful

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.410
in that area too.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.190
Unfortunately Dr. Hayden is
not able to join us today.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.040
She sends her regrets.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.970
This is one of her favorite
topics, books and illustrations,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.160
but she's been called away.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.690
Martha Kennedy is stepping
in as our panel moderator

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.320
and Dr. Hayden's
message to the foreword

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.200
of the book is what
I've been asked to read

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.190
to you to represent her.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.760
Dr. Hayden recalled being
a kid who read everything,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.670
and personally I believe her.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.930
She poured over the
illustrations just as much

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.960
as the accompanying
words, that's the key part.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.920
She wrote in the foreword,

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.580
"Images make reading more
meaningful and more memorable."

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.990
I think at this point I'm going
to say take it away, Martha,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.990
please come up to the stage
and we'll help you get

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.570
to the graphic arts gallery
at the end of the program.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.510
Thank you.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:07:15.190
[ Applause ]

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.550
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Thank you
all so much for being here.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.960
Can you hear me?

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.260
&gt;&gt; Sort of.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.560
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Sort of?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.860
OK. OK. Great.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.160
Thanks so much.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.890
And thank you, Helena,
for your opening remarks

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.200
and introduction.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:39.470
I would also like to take this
moment to express my thanks

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.750
to my colleagues across
the library who have helped

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:49.490
and supported me in completing
these wonderful projects.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.570
I feel so privileged to
have worked on the book

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.140
and the exhibit "Drawn
to Purpose".

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.760
Turning to our panelists, it is
an honor and a privilege for me

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.230
to moderate today's
conversation.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.950
We look forward to hearing your
perspectives and your insights

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.740
into the arts of
illustration and cartooning

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:19.080
as wonderful creators
in these art forms.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.020
I would like to begin by
asking each of you what is it

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:30.170
like to be an illustrator
and/or a cartoonist today.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.650
Do you think the
playing field is equal?

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.090
Who would like to start?

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.100
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
That's absolutely--

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.540
&gt;&gt; Wait.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.280
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
With the new administration,

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.780
we have everything is solid.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.080
Women are here.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.380
No, we're not.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.680
We're not equal.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.700
We won't be and it's been a
long time when we really aren't.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:57.590
I mean I think about how women
are born, we come here and only

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:02.290
to find out as we get older
that we're considered lesser.

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.760
You know, our points of
view aren't-- We under--

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.640
start to understand
that our points

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.140
of view aren't taken
as seriously or--

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.440
&gt;&gt; Louder.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.740
Louder.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.040
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Can you
hear or the [inaudible]?

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.310
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Holy molly.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.610
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: OK.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.910
Great. Thanks.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.210
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Hello.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.510
Hello. Can you hear me?

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.310
OK. So I just-- And my point
is that, that women are born

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.180
and we come here and
then we start to find

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.110
out that we are considered
lesser

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.840
and we're not taken
as seriously.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.470
The older you get, the
more you find it out.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.330
I mean it's as a kid, you know,
the voice are like suddenly

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.950
like no, we couldn't
play football

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.250
but you can do the cheerleading.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.280
What? You know, you
are ready to play.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.360
And we find out that if you want
to be heard, if you want to--

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.690
point of view to be heard, you
have to make yourself heard

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.150
and you have to be loud or--

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.770
and nobody likes a
loud woman, it seems.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.930
So there's a lot of-- you
come to that realization

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.860
and honestly being a black
woman, you're less than lesser.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.740
You know, you're
like least, you know.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.490
You're not-- not only you're not
heard or you could be ignored,

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.180
you could be a suspect,
you know, there's,

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.910
there's so many things
that happen.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.740
So know that playing
field isn't level.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.170
I don't know when
that's going to happen.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.470
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: OK, OK.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:30.770
Thank you.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.070
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Hello,
hello, can you hear me?

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.370
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Yeah.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.670
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: OK.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.970
And I got to-- OK, I'll
just hold this in case.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.270
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: OK.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:38.570
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: So,
illustration does not--

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.270
in cartooning does
not exist in a vacuum.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.700
It's a part of society
and to sort of answer

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.660
like why women are
devalued in society is

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.530
like a whole other
round table, I think.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.970
But yeah, I feel like it's very
complicated illustration for me

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:59.140
and the way that I've conducted
my career has been very linked

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.360
to the industry of illustration
and mainstream publishing

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.260
and the publishing industry.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:09.130
And that's-- it can be
really complicated, I've--

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.560
especially when I'm working
in [inaudible] comics

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.110
which is famously a very
male dominated little niche

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.410
of drawing.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.470
But then now I'm in picture--
doing stuff with picture books

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.700
where that industry is, you
know, 90% female in terms

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.720
of the creators and the,
you know, the gatekeepers

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.350
and the booksellers, the
librarians and the parents

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.390
that are buying the books
and all those stuff.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:35.680
It's still those issues
persist with who gets the awards

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.530
and who gets the
acclaim and money

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.010
and all these things
that trickle down.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.770
So it's like-- it's even more
complicated than it seems

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.140
on the face sometimes.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.980
But-- but yeah, I think identity
has become a very big part

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:55.280
of publishing and culture
at large now and so it's,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:03.890
it's an evolving thing that I--
I feel strange-- I can feel--

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.690
I actually don't do a lot
of women in comics and women

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.640
in blankety blank
panels because I can feel

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.040
that it's bothering, you know.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.320
It can feel like we talk
about we're OK with this stuff

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.500
as this sort of like separate
thing or it's safe to analyze it

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.290
within this like closed,
sealed off context.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.350
But I always want to
until the day it comes

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.970
where I'm looking forward to
when it becomes more integrated

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.050
and we don't have
to have special days

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.630
and that would seem weird
because we're integrated

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.650
on a more daily level, so.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.950
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah, no.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.250
Thank you.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.550
Very powerful.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.850
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman:
Pass the baton.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.180
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah, that's
kind of in our [inaudible] here.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.480
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: Neither one.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.720
A lot of what I wanted to
say was already been said

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.180
but I wanted to really start
if I'd been the first person

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.700
to speak, I would have
said I was so glad

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.360
that you didn't say what is it,
is there a level playing field

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.930
for women illustrators.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.110
Because I think when
we continue to label us

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.740
as women illustrators
rather than illustrators,

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.670
we already create
a division there.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.630
We create a separate
category that is problematic.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.780
And it becomes something hard.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.510
It's not that we're not
women but we have to crawl

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:27.610
out of this hole that has been
developed by ostracizing that,

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.940
by labeling it that way.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.520
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
It's like an asterisk.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.430
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman:
It is, yeah, yeah.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.860
And it's what's really
curios too is as an educator,

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.490
I've been teaching part time and
full time for almost 30 years

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.850
and majority of my
students are women.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:50.090
So when I look out into the
world, I see more men that are

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.110
out there, that are
namable that become

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.670
"the names" in the industry.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.610
And I think a lot of it
does come out of not, not,

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.410
not having people that are
women that are illustrators

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.580
but by having art directors or
judges on panels or whatever.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.750
Those are the arbiters
of who's going to be--

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.340
become a name or whose
work is going to be seen

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.510
in the publication
or in an annual.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.800
And so because of that I think
that has to shift a little bit.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.450
I think there is more of
an awareness of that now.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.390
I think people are
being sensitive.

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:26.560
Maybe we have to go through
this period of identifying women

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.160
and talking about women for--
I mean they're only, you know,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.080
it's like half the
planet, right?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.760
I don't know why it's been so
invisible but maybe we have

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.960
to go through this little
phase in order for us

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.080
to not have to do it this way.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.380
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.090
No, these are just very
thoughtful answers.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:50.360
Would you be willing to say
that there's been some progress

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.120
in the last 20 years at all,
in certain areas for women?

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.420
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: I would.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.200
Yeah, I would say that
there is some progress.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.210
We can look at things like
the director of the Society

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.480
of Illustrators is a woman.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.890
The majority of the presidents
of the Illustration Conference

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.140
which is the only conference
that's national that's

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.290
for illustration, the majority

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.100
of the presidents
have been women.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.100
So there are people that
are in leadership roles

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.040
that in these things that
are-- it's contemporary.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.250
It's in the last 15--
maybe it's even 10 years--

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.550
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.850
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: --
that it's different.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.650
So there are role models for
women that are coming up that--

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.590
that can look at that and say,
well, that's possible to do.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.890
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.190
There are a few.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.490
And we now have--

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.790
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: We just made

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.090
that other president
to be a woman.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.680
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah,
no, that's interesting.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.500
We have the art editor of
the New Yorker is a woman

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.710
and the new cartoon editor.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:54.100
So there are some-- a few
encouraging signs too.

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.400
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
I mean in comics

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.010
and I mean I mostly
travel and independent

00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.340
in the old comics or whatever.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:06.100
But when I started 15 years ago,
it was just like so different

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:12.090
in terms of, well, now it's like
the market for like YA comics

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:18.240
and kid comics and stuff like
that has just like burst forward

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.040
and I think all the most
like prominent people doing

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.670
that are like-- like [inaudible]
like the apex of all of that

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.640
and her work is like
love by girls and boys

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.030
and like that's extremely
encouraging, of course.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.690
Then you have other issues

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.390
with how identity becomes
this marketable thing

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.350
and all these other
things but it's--

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.740
that has changed so
much since I started.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.040
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah,
and that's one area.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.120
And yet you look at the
comics pages in newspapers

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.960
and it's better online but--

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.260
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Definitely online.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.560
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.860
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
I mean for me you know,

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.350
so many years ago to be
the first black woman

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.620
in the mainstream press, in
the newspapers, that was big.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.570
But also by me being
the first black woman

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.490
in the mainstream press, in
newspapers, I was the only one.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:10.870
And I was kind of-- you think
you're breaking the door now

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:14.070
so more can come in, but you're
really like clogging the door,

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.370
you know, because you're there.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.900
And it's like, OK, I
will hold on to this.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.830
It's like they can and
then-- but I've been--

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.360
you know, I haven't
done it since 2005.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.660
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.960
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: And
there has not been somebody

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.520
who is recognized a black woman
cartoonist for the newspaper,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.530
but newspapers are
dying clearly.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.740
But it's true, it's been.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.450
So, it's hard for me
in my specific area

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.230
of doing this to see progress.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.530
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.830
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
But that's a downer, sorry.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.130
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: No.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.430
Yeah [laughter].

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.730
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: I
think that as a result,

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.030
like webcomics have been
so embraced by women

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.350
because it's there's like you
can just skip to like directly

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.670
to your audience, right?

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:54.420
And then think that that's now,

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.750
if you go to the [inaudible]
small press expo here outside

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.770
of in Bethesda, Maryland,
it's like you see

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.890
that gradually changes,
like more women then--

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.380
they build there
audience by themselves

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.390
and clearly there is this
like appetite for it.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:12.120
And for racialized women as
well and so you don't have

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.240
to necessarily go through
these mainstream channels

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.590
to like get your work
out and then there's this

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.000
like reverse thing of like,
now, the mainstream wants

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.580
that thing, it's like just--

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.880
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Right.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.180
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
-- turn around.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.480
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.780
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
It's topsy-turvy.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.080
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.380
No, that's great.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.680
Good points.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.980
I mean, this leads me
to another question.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.760
Could you comment on the
impact of social media

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.630
on work in both fields?

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.820
You, you know, what do
you think about that?

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.920
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
I think about--

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.400
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Positive
and negative [laughs].

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.700
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Oh, me?

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.000
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.300
So, it's for all three of you.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.600
Just love to hear what you--

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.900
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
You know,

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.200
social media is a
strange bird, you know.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.750
And I am older, so it's even
stranger to me because it's new.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.020
So it's not all good but
there are some good points.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.550
It does help create
communities that are supportive.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:12.740
You know, you can-- I can every
once in a while feel compelled

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.090
to do a strip and I can
put it on my Facebook page.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.110
I actually have one.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.750
And I can get such
a positive response.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.750
So like do it again
Barbara, you know,

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.130
we need to hear these girls.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.840
You know, let's hear
these black women talk,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.350
and it's just very encouraging.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:35.920
So while it is a
weird kind of thing,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.700
it does create certain
communities

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.330
and it does help bring

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:45.490
like minded people
together to make points.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.000
Even if we're just patting each
other on our backs, you know,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.210
it kind of feels good
because that's a community.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.580
It's a community,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.880
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: I mean--

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.180
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman:
Yeah, there's--

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.280
Well, I was going to say
that most illustrators--

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.950
I can't speak for cartoonists

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:04.060
but I imagine it's very
similar, we work by ourselves.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.530
And so, unless you're going
out and you're teaching

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.130
and you're getting
yourself exposed to people

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.960
in a work situation, majority
of your time you're spending

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.550
by yourself and so social media
adds a layer of connectivity,

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.920
that's really helpful.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.710
You get to see what
other people are doing,

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.260
or tell them what you think
about what they are doing.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.750
The other side of it too is

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.190
that there have been
quite a few places

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.890
where women have gotten
beaten up in social media,

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.380
and other places where
they can find refuge.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.770
There's some private Facebook
groups where people can--

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.860
women can talk about
what's happening with them.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.320
They can talk about whether they
think they're getting paid less

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.500
or whether somebody is bullying
them or other, you know,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.910
other topics that are
distressful and you need

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.350
to find support somewhere.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.650
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:01.950
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: Yeah.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.250
So it's like everything,
it's got two sides.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.550
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:05.850
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Right.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.150
Right.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.450
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah, I think

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.750
that that social media has
brought a lot of different kinds

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.820
of people to illustration
and comics and that was very,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.750
very much needed because it is--
I feel like when it started,

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.630
it's very predominantly
white male and straight

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.070
and like now I feel
it's really expanded.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.370
And I-- I used to owe--

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.730
When I started I really
linked illustration

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.940
with this commercial aspect.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.330
It's like you're not an artist,
you're working with your--

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:34.750
with a client, you
know what I mean?

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.920
And like you're creating
a product.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.740
And now, I feel like
I can't sit anymore.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.360
I feel like it's become this
much more nebulous thing

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.560
that actually-- because
it's brought

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.780
in all these different people,
you really question some

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.090
of the power structures
around it like how it moves

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.510
and they're not necessarily--
They think about it in a really,

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:58.270
really different way and it's--
but it can be really scary,

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:03.640
some of these stuff with the--
being a woman on the internet is

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:06.120
like just kind of a
scary place sometimes.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.180
But I can't imagine
my career without it.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.990
I graduated in 2003 like
right at the start of it

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.000
and I just don't think
that would be where I am

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.940
without continually sharing
online and you're never supposed

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.980
to say that like audience
reaction affects your work

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.280
or whatever.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.210
But like I feel totally--

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.230
because I know a lot of
my audience is women,

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.980
like that's where
you can connect,

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.860
especially with young
women, teenagers, right,

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.930
that that's where they are.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:37.630
So I found it like a very--
I can't separate the two.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:38.930
I wouldn't want to either.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.230
You know, it's good and the bad.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.530
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah, yeah.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.910
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: There's a
little bit of a democracy too

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.130
in that someone can have
connection to the internet

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:50.070
and look at things through
social media, and not have

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.440
to have the money to buy a book.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.480
So they might like Jillian's
work or Barbara's work

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.040
and they might not be able
to afford that book or get

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.430
that book but they can
appreciate their work

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.000
through social media
that they're on anyway.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.300
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
But on the flipside of that,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.730
we haven't figured out
how to get paid either.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:07.030
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Right.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.330
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
You know,

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.630
like you don't know how
to make money from--

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.930
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: I hear you.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.230
I hear you.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.530
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: --
putting your stuff out there.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.830
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.130
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
You know,

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.430
it's like there's
not a clear road.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.730
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
And illustration has--

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.030
because of this like become
so incredibly popular.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.680
Like when I started, I feel like
it was for like nerds that want

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.110
to do like airbrush, like
shiny metal and stuff.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:33.000
But it's like completely
like evolved to this other--

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.500
sorry, I can't remember what
I was going to say, but--

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.800
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
That's OK

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.100
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: I got like
distracted by like talking

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.400
about nerds, right [laughter].

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.700
Yeah.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.000
&gt;&gt; Not getting paid.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.300
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Not getting paid.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.600
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
About not getting paid.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.900
Right.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.200
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.500
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: So you-- And
thank you from the audience.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.800
So, not getting paid.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.100
You-- that you-- and of--

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.910
There is this like economy of
like likes and stuff like that

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.700
and I think that--
one thing I've heard

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.660
about this is what
sort of directly

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.960
to women on the internet.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.260
I kind of feel like
sometimes you need

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.560
to present an image, right?

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.050
Not like really values the young
woman, the woman that is willing

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:08.350
to sort of put her
appearance online,

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.730
you know when I always was
very-- when I was starting out,

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.660
I really felt like I tried very
hard to keep all my images,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.090
like all images of
myself off the internet.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.390
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: I
hear you, I hear you.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:20.960
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Because I
didn't want my image linked

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.260
to my work.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.320
I wanted my work just to stand
on its own and stuff like that.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.640
And I have heard that in
recently some young women feel

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.940
that's not a possibility.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.960
You need an attached image to
it, and an attached like persona

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.450
and personality and like brand.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.430
And like-- I feel like that's
really complicated, you know.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.820
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Mm-hmm.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.390
Yeah. No. That's fascinating.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:43.690
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Thank you.

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.300
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.600
[ Laughter ]

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.890
All right.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:55.720
Turning to a slightly
different but related topic,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.990
could you share observations
or insights

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:03.640
about women in these fields?

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:10.750
From your experiences as
teachers or being on panels or--

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:15.710
have you benefited
from teaching?

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.010
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Teaching.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.310
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: And doing--

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:22.070
because I know that
two of you have taught.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.370
I know that, yeah.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.030
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: I've been
teaching for a long time.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.330
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: A long time.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:27.630
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: And
when I first started--

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.670
Well, I'll go back
just a little bit more

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:30.970
and give you a little
bit of story.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.110
When I graduated in college,
somebody said to me, oh,

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.310
do you think, you know,
do you want to teach?

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.660
And like I said, there is
no way I want to teach.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.110
Why would I want to teach?

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.410
I want to do stuff.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:48.750
And I think that time too was--
you wanted to get out there.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.260
You wanted to build
your portfolio.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.970
You want to get more clients.

00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.800
That's what you wanted to do if
you want to be an illustrator.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.060
And so, that's what
I wanted to do too.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.580
But over time, what I found was

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.070
that it gets a little
lonely sometimes.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.380
So you have to find diversion,

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.900
get away from the four
walls that you're in.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.090
And I think a lot of
women do have studios

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.230
in their homes for
whatever reason.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:18.140
I did because I was a parent and
I had a small child and I wanted

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.230
to be able to do
that and do my work.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:25.340
But I also wanted to kind of
connect out with other people.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:30.900
And so, someone I knew asked me
to do a workshop on putting to--

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.000
and this is when I was actually
doing graphic design as well.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.530
To do comps, show students
how to make comprehensives

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.750
which are-- these
are put together--

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:46.770
This is pre-digital world
for anybody that's under 30.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.570
Pre-digital world where if you
were do-- going to do a design,

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.450
you put it together,
you mocked it

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.460
up to show your client what
it was going to look like.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.430
And so I did this workshop
and I was like really charged

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.840
up over this idea that I
had stuff that I had done.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:05.680
And I could put that
together in an organized way

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.560
and I could transmit it
to a bunch of students

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.590
that were eager to
get that information.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:16.200
And it made me feel like I had
this other value beyond what I

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.500
was generating.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.270
So I'm building my career,
right, but I'm also able

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:25.150
to push back some things, push
back some value to others.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.660
And so, that kind of got
me hooked on doing it.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.470
And then over the years I was
picking up part time work just

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.260
as a dimension to
my studio work.

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:42.800
And then in 2000-- in
2000 I was recruited

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.420
to lead the undergraduate
department

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.660
at MICA in illustration.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.600
And I wasn't sure.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.220
I had a really vital
studio business.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.350
It was something that I really
had to think long and hard about

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.380
but I felt like there was
some-- it was a challenge,

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.780
it was a good challenge for me.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.300
So I did that for ten years
and started a master's program

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.090
and we're in year eight.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.720
I think it's successful.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.550
So, what do I get out of
teaching is I get to get

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.830
out of my house and my studio.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.140
But beyond that it's
that same exchange,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.250
it's that same bringing value
to other people's lives,

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.040
sharing things that
I do and that I love

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.380
that are meaningful to me.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:34.390
And to raise up people that
are interested in learning.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.140
I think there's nothing
better than this relationship

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.350
of you giving something to
someone else then valuing it

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.960
and then doing something
with that.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.470
And that to me that's
what teaching is.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.460
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: OK.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.760
Yeah.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.250
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Plus you get
to like-- like see what's cool.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.550
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: Yeah, right.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.850
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
Like coming out, like--

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.030
So it wasn't just like-- I don't
teach right now but I taught

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.340
for a long time in New York and
you'd see like stuff percolating

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.180
in them and then it would be
like in the broader culture,

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.900
like a year-- two years
later, something like that,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.420
because they're like
cool art students.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.610
But, yeah, I don't teach now.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.610
It's all the same.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.370
I mean it's incredibly
gratifying

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.140
to see them grow as people.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.900
It's a formative time, right.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.820
They're like little babies
when they start and then

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:24.940
by end they're like adults,
and it's really a privilege

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.390
to help somebody on that.

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.480
I did feel like in the
end it can get tricky

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.710
because it's this-- especially
New York Arts School are very,

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:37.820
very expensive, and then you're
into this realm of student loans

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.450
and it's-- it becomes this very
incredibly verified experience.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.460
So like that's talking--

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.750
We haven't really talked
about intersectionality a lot

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.080
in this discussion, but like
that becomes a part of it too.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.380
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy:
Actually, yeah.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.680
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
With accessibility,

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.370
and that was like-- that's
a changing thing that like--

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.520
that process that-- or the time

00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.810
that I was teaching,
I saw more--

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:01.110
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.530
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: -- more
of that stratification.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.590
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: That's--
yeah, that's a very good point.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.410
Yeah, that's great.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.710
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
I did--

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.170
I was able to do some workshops.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.470
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy:
Workshops, great.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.770
Good.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.070
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Yes.

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.370
So when you said, I was
like, yeah, I did do that.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:16.670
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yes.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:17.970
Yes.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.270
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: And
it was the Queens Library.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.570
When I was doing the strip,
the Queens Library had--

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.610
I was very popular in
February and March.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:26.700
I would get calls, and we
have got a black cartoonist

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.000
coming in.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
We got a woman cartoonist
coming in.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.340
And all the time it
would be young kids

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.120
that would come-- I
shouldn't say that.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.010
Because it was sometimes there
were older people, you know,

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:43.130
retired people who wanted to sit
among the eight-year-olds and--

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.050
because they also wanted
to have this fun little

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.350
cartooning class.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.130
And it was, you know, it
was really basic, you know,

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:53.710
how you can make faces out of
shapes and, you know, really,

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.100
really basic or-- And then--

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.380
then I would give them all like
a line, just a little sentence

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.410
and have them create a
strip to go along with it.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.710
Which is really-- They came

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.200
up with some really
crazy incredible things,

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.500
these little kids.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.380
So, I think what I got
from it was also being able

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:16.480
to encourage these little
ones and also you recognize

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.950
that you can learn
from everybody.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.250
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.550
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
You know, it doesn't matter

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.740
who it is, you know, it
could be the older gentleman

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.410
who is a little embarrassed
to be sitting there

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.220
with all these kids and makes
a comment about, you know,

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.480
I think-- I'm like, you know,
that's a good point, you know,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.060
so you can-- You really
can learn from everyone.

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:34.360
&gt;&gt; It's true.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.660
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: So I
think that's what I get at it.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:36.960
That's what I got out of it.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.260
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: That's
great, that's wonderful.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.560
Thank you.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:45.240
Yeah. All right, here is another
sort of general question.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:51.290
How or why deserving work
by women illustrators

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.610
and cartoonists matter?

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:56.500
Do you think a sense
of shared history

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.870
in these fields can help
motivate and inspire established

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:07.510
and rising artists,
especially women?

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.610
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: I'm
going to start talking again.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:11.910
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
Yeah, you go first.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.630
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
That because I, you know,

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.690
I thought about these
questions and I thought

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.240
that was particularly a good one

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.400
because that's kind
of what we do.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.950
You know, it's like as
illustrators, as cartoonists,

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:28.090
as artists, as singers and
whatever we do, we are like kind

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.030
of you observe what's
going on, you interpret it

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.950
and then you record it,
you know, and that's--

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:35.250
I got that from my dad.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.270
It's like that's a good point
then, that's what we do.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.050
So we're-- in a certain sense
we are recording history.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:45.410
So for folks down the line
who come back and look

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.570
at what we've done-- Because all

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.680
of our work is informed
from-- by our experiences.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.090
And so you have a way of putting

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.520
down what was happening
during this time.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.700
And, I mean, I was fortunate
enough to have my first book--

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.720
Have Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis do
the foreword for my first book,

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.400
and one of the things they
mentioned was that they felt

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.800
that my strip should go in a
time capsule and that years

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.040
from now folks are going
to open it up and say,

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.330
get a real understanding
of what the experience

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.510
of being a black
woman in America was.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.960
And I was like, well,
that's heavy.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.080
And it's, you know, it's
like it's really kind of--

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.780
it's good and it's true.

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:34.170
So it's being able to take
a look at what's going on

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.290
and being able to
understand that this is the--

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.980
everybody who expresses
themselves are

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.930
from their experiences.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:45.190
And we are-- it's very
important to keep track of it

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.350
and get a chance to look
at it and understand

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.540
because that will
inform later generations

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.410
with their lives, you know.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.710
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.250
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: From
what our experiences have been.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.830
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah, I
think like history is not

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.580
like what happens,
like how it's told,

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:00.880
you know, something like that.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.160
Like I'm sure there's a more
elegant way of saying that.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.490
But I mean, there
is a reason why we--

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:09.730
the [inaudible] is the way it
is and it looks the way it is

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.350
and that's like conscious
and unconscious

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.950
as to how it's shaped.

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:20.400
So I think like we-- you need
to like aggressively reshape it.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.950
As much as I can't wait for
the day that like it feels

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:29.540
like embedded and ingrained in
it like in a more natural way,

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:35.330
I think you have to actually
put effort into it and like--

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.140
and be more intentional,
you know, and aware.

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.840
And I think people are demanding
that and people see that now.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.690
And I go like the consciousness
has like risen so--

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:50.290
like rose so much in
the last like five years

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.590
or something like that.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.890
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: I was
going to say five days even.

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.190
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.170
And like even just like
the younger students

00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:00.340
and younger creators are so
much, they see it as a whole now

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:02.250
and they see the way like
it all works in a way

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.500
that I was completely
naive to when I started.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.540
So there's a lot
more questioning

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.780
of those structures
and-- And then--

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.730
And I think it's very
powerful like I have

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:15.040
to remember being
younger on-- and like I--

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.860
looking around myself and seeing
like I'm mixed but identify

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.440
as like Asian-American and
it's like you're looking

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.220
around constantly,
you know what I mean?

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.620
And like you're looking
for evidence of yourself

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.360
and yourself reflected back,
and it's very, very powerful

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.580
when you find that, especially
when you're a young person.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.710
So, I'm aware of that
too, that like sometimes

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.310
that more intentional effort,
if that's what it results

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.240
in then so be it, you know.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.540
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.350
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: Yeah, I
can completely agree with that,

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.390
that I think there's
been a great turnaround

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.530
in more recent years,
because if you look

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.940
at what women were doing at the
beginning of the 20th century,

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:55.300
the type of work they were
doing, they were stratified

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.530
into women's subjects,
whatever those might be.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:03.750
And that they were
reflecting out the magazines--

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.420
and magazines were emerging.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.360
Magazines that were coming out
for women were reflecting a kind

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.830
of life that was supposed
to happen, this ideal life

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.450
of what a woman should be doing

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.820
and how she should
be a homemaker,

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.710
a good mother, and whatnot.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.410
And I think those
reflections, those images

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.310
that are made are reflecting

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.300
out to not just women
but to the world.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.270
What is expected and if that's
changing if that's different

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:34.740
and it's reflecting out
these different ideas

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.480
and different ways of living
and thinking and being,

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.500
that can change society.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.800
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.250
No, that's great.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.630
Yeah, thank you.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:53.140
This really, I think, leads well
into my next question, which is,

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.340
women have made contributions
to these art forms

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.470
that men probably would
not have, in fact,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.890
probably definitely
would not have.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:05.150
Can you imagine a male
counterpart creating some

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:09.790
of the works that you and
other female artists have made?

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:11.620
And can you give a few examples.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:17.500
Just briefly, you know,
describe or mention?

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.120
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman:
Marjane Satrapi who wrote

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.570
about her experience being
in Middle East, being a woman

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.270
in the Middle East, I think
would have been impossible

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.450
for a man to do.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.030
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:33.330
Yeah.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:34.630
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: I--

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.540
because my strip was
a collection of women

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.790
and that's all that was
in the strip was women

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.670
and it was black
women in particular.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:44.510
Can I imagine a man
doing what I did?

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.810
No.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.110
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy:
No [laughter].

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.410
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: No.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.120
As a matter of fact I-- my--
I was in a bunch of papers

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.560
but I wasn't in this--
my New York area,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.840
and I think the closest paper
may have been to Baltimore Sun

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.600
or maybe Philadelphia
something, but I wasn't--

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.430
I've lived in Brooklyn
and-- so nobody knew--

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.550
I'd say I'm a cartoonist and--

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:07.850
but nobody knew what
my strip was,

00:38:07.850 --> 00:38:09.760
so I would explain what it was.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.120
I have a strip.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.330
It's a weekly strip, it's all
women, it's all talking heads,

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.570
it's all black women, oh men.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.440
You're just going to
take another opportunity

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.740
to put the black man down.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.390
I'm like, wait, wait, wait.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:28.920
How can my point of view, just
because it's a black woman--

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.740
a woman speaking means that
it's anti-men and how--

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:38.420
and likewise, how is being
pro black be an anti-white?

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.760
It's not. It's a perception.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.070
And if somebody, if a guy were
to see it and I got letters say

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.300
that they have a problem
with a strip that I've done,

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:53.910
my point to the guy
would be, let's see,

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.780
you probably have
more of a problem

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.650
with your mirror because--

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.950
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yes [laughs].

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.250
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
And if you can't--

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.540
if you have trouble with her
observations in what she has

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.980
to say, then look into
yourself because it's--

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.130
it's her observations of
your life and if that's--

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.440
if you see yourself and
you're getting upset,

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.890
that's not my issue, you know.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:17.920
But for-- to see a man do
specifically what I did,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.490
that can happen.

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:22.790
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:24.090
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: It looks like
that's like part of the thing

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:27.220
of also like you can't
be a whole person.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:32.370
You need to be like woman
or Asian woman or whatever

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.550
and like you're just supposed
to like exist in that sort

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.330
of static identity and
not have like complex

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:41.210
like feelings of stuff.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.910
So, yeah, I don't know.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:47.080
I mean I guess my work has
always been sort of like--

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.070
you know, when I started
like I know I got a lot

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:54.050
of female topics like
you've got pigeonholed into.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:55.670
She's really great,
like that was her--

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.730
that's her topic,
is girls and women.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.040
And like anytime-- I
feel like for a while

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.880
like if anything horrible
happened to like a woman

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.530
from these newspapers,
like some story

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:05.920
with like something
horrible to like a girl

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.360
and it's like, call Jillian.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.370
Like she is like-- She's really
good with that kind of topic.

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:14.510
So it's like it's interesting
that your value, you're glad,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:18.270
that you can like present that
really empathetic point of view

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.050
but then it's like you
can get [inaudible].

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.350
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
So much more.

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:22.650
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:23.950
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
That I'm so much more.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:25.250
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
Yeah, for sure, so.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.550
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy:
And I think all

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:27.850
of you show that in your work.

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.740
I mean you really-- the range
of subjects that you cover

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.890
and issues, you know,
it's fantastic.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.960
To me that shows progress, sort.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.260
Did-- And did you-- I'm sorry.

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:40.870
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: I don't
think I ever got pigeonholed

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:45.440
on women's topics per
se but I got pigeonholed

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.820
in depressing topics like
depression or divorce

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.920
or you know, murder [laughs].

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:53.580
She's really good at that.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.880
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.580
It's like [inaudible] her.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.490
Yeah, yeah.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.750
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: So, but
it gave me an opportunity

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:04.000
to put women in there, you know,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.930
the more interesting
to draw women.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:08.230
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:09.530
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Yeah.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.830
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman:
Don't you think?

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.130
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
I think, yeah.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.430
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman:
Yeah [laughter].

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:14.730
I do.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.310
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: I just
like to speak one more thing

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.620
on like the race
thing too, like it--

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.660
sometimes it can feel like
when you're working in some

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:24.200
of these spaces that the like
publishers or the editors

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.500
or whatever are right in your--

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:31.590
a person of color that like
it can feel that you were OK

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.350
like up to this boundary
line of like your experience.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.480
And like it's, oh, you don't
cross that experience then

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.780
like we're all good and
we love it and we love you

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.910
and then like-- but
like don't push that.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.210
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Don't go too far.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.510
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yup.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.810
Yeah. Yeah.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.110
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Yeah.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.420
Yeah. And for me-- and again is
when newspapers were doing well

00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:54.100
when I started and all
the editors who were going

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.250
to be white men who were going
to either pick up your strip

00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:01.560
or not and I would get--
We already have Cathy.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.860
We don't need where
I'm coming from.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.160
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.590
Yeah. Yeah.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:06.890
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: What?

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.350
But similarly, my dad, 30 years
before, had a strip, Luther,

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:13.780
and they say we already
have, you know,

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.680
[inaudible] we don't
need Luther.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.060
And it's like, but you can
have Heathcliff and Garfield.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.940
What? [Laughter] How was that?

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:25.240
How was that?

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.540
You know the cats.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.840
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.140
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Plural:

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.440
But you got black
representation,

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.740
you got a woman represented
and that's, that's all.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.040
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
We've done our--

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.340
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Plural: We've done our--

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.640
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Take--
like tick box, yeah, for sure.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.940
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Right,

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.240
so we're in good
standing, yeah, so.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.540
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:40.840
It's great.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.570
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: I wasn't even
counting how many dog strips

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.870
there are.

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.170
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Plural: Oh yeah.

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:50.340
That's the thing exactly.

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.640
Exactly.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:52.940
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: OK, we-- oh.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.060
&gt;&gt; Are you set, Martha?

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.360
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Are we set?

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:03.860
Yeah. I think-- Did, I think
you've done a great job--

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.160
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Thank you.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.500
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: -- answering
all these questions that I have

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.640
and I think it's
time to open up--

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.940
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham:
Exactly right--

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.680
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: --
questions to the audience.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.560
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: We
have one small reminder.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.490
We welcome your questions, so
please, join the conversation

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.420
but realize that if you
do ask the question,

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:25.110
you will automatically
become part of the webcast,

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:28.590
which we will place in YouTube
and make us publicly available

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:31.540
as possible because
libraries' are all

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:35.020
about sharing information
widely and widely.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.730
So, yes, we open
it to the floor.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.610
Thank you.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:44.300
There are microphones on either
side that will come around.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.150
&gt;&gt; Megan: Hi, my name is Megan.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:49.030
I'm a librarian here at
the Library of Congress,

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.460
particularly interested
in making sure

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.790
that the library collects
materials by women

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:57.110
and about women for
the collection.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.310
So, I'm just wondering
if you have any,

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:05.000
you know what librarians
like me can do to make sure

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.890
that your voices are
represented or that things

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:12.350
that are important to you are
represented moving forward,

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:14.630
because I want to make
sure that those gaps

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:19.430
that we have previously
don't exist anymore.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:21.560
So, if you have any thoughts on
that, I would like to hear that.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.860
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.560
And I totally-- I am in
concert with Megan on that, so--

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.860
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: You
approved that question [laughs].

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.160
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: I
totally, it's great.

00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.700
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Could
I-- Could I answer that?

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.000
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Please, sure.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.300
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: So that
would be really interesting is

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:39.820
maybe for you to talk about what
the collection does collect.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:42.740
Like what is the
collection, what is Library

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.450
of Congress interested
in collecting.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:49.720
Just prints, are you interested
in-- I mean you and I, Martha,

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.900
have talked about this
difficulty of digital prints

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.530
and how they are original
but not really originally.

00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:59.480
The original is the digital file

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:02.500
and how do you maintain
digital files.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.240
Do you keep a Giclée
print in there?

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.600
I think one of the pieces
you've got of mine--

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.900
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy:
From you, it's a--

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.200
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: --

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.890
it's a digital print because
it was made on a computer.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.190
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.490
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: No.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:18.420
That is definitely an area that
we're working on right now.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.800
I would say we're in sort
of a state of transition.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.430
We do a have a web comic archive
that Megan has been very active

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:29.550
in building, developing
and but I guess--

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:30.850
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman:
What about zines?

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.640
Sorry to interrupt.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.960
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy:
What about zines?

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.260
We do have zines.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.560
We do have some.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:37.860
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
What's a zine?

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.740
I don't know what that is?

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.040
[Laughter]

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.340
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
Like a small photocopy.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.640
Yeah, like the--

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.940
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.240
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Handmade
little mini comic pick up.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.280
&gt;&gt; Megan: Just to
add to that, we--

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.250
through our small
press expo collection,

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:51.550
we actually are working
with some

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:55.090
of the smaller self-published
cartoonists and the illustrators

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:57.420
who are working now but we
are also working to build

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:01.350
out an actual zine collection
which broadens the scope

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:05.320
to not just comics and
illustration but more, you know,

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.480
literature, and criticism
and other things.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:10.990
So, that's a work in progress.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:13.930
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: I was going
to say the thing-- seem--

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:18.090
I think that like even
apart from digital prints,

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.770
so the stuff just lives on-- And
so much stuff just lives online.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:22.180
That's like all where it lives.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.480
You know what I mean like--

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.450
And so, it's tough
because you have this--

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:31.860
for example, LGBTQ
plus like a lot

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.370
of that content is
on Tumblr, right?

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:37.010
Like if Tumblr then decides
to like shut down or whatever,

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.550
like not host that
stuff anymore,

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:40.240
that stuff just like
totally gone.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.280
So, I think like these
digital collections and I know

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:46.210
that they do it with
SPEx2 but I think like--

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:48.050
I read a little bit like
what [inaudible] does,

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:49.930
with like the new museum
in New York where they're

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:54.090
like digital-- they're like
old GeoCities things like--

00:46:54.090 --> 00:47:00.200
I think that that's really where
the grassroots of like comics is

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.900
and increasing the
illustration as well.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.380
Like Instagram is
just like this--

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.680
That's where it's happening.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.980
You know what I mean?

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.730
And I think that your-- A lot
of those people will not end

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:10.470
up going on to be the famous.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.080
Some of them will but like
some of them-- or most of them,

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.700
the vast majority of
them are not going to.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.630
But like that I think is
like really the pulse of like

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.590
where people are creating now.

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:24.470
And it's that more
accessible space

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.980
than printed published work
too that's super fascinating.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.280
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy:
And, yeah-- Yeah.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.220
All right, so a certain
amount of web crawling

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:33.670
and acquiring of digital files.

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:37.540
I mean that's something
that we're working on.

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.840
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.140
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Yeah.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.440
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: Yeah

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.740
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: And you know,
we've got beginnings going,

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.040
good beginnings in
webcomics, especially.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.620
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: And
talking to other illustrators.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:49.390
I mean I know some black
women, you know, cartoonists

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.400
and illustrators and,
you know, that perhaps,

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.700
you know, like just talking.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:55.000
I'll talk.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.180
Yeah. But just talking to
people who are in the field,

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.440
they can hit you to somebody
else that's also doing it.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.740
Yeah.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.040
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy:
There are also,

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.740
I would say some artists
working in these fields in kind

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.620
of a hybrid way too

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:15.690
and collecting their work is not
only straightforward, you know.

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:19.210
Political cartoonists
for example,

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.400
a lot of them still do drawing,

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:28.450
add color digitally,
abandon that.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:30.230
We have a couple of editorial--

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:36.770
a political cartoonist in the
audience here and so, yeah,

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:38.070
there's a lot still to do.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:39.370
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
Even right now,

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:41.460
especially like illustrate--
because like the weight of--

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.860
it's easier to make a book, it's
easier to make a printed T-shirt

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.160
or make a button or whatever.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.690
Like all this stuff is just--
it's this whole different way

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:50.990
of being an illustrator now

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:54.130
and like selling your stuff
directly online and so it--

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:57.380
do you have then collect
objects, you know, of all these

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.140
like screen for the tote
bags like maybe, maybe that's

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:03.650
like this big part
of illustration now.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:04.950
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.250
And on the other hand
though it is nice

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:10.280
to have high quality
prints, archival prints so,

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.650
they give you a sense of
the sampling of a, you know,

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:19.260
up and coming or award winning
illustrator now, you know.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.260
Other questions?

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.980
Yeah.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.350
&gt;&gt; This question is for Barbara.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:28.920
Barbara, I really
enjoyed your strip

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.900
when it was being syndicated
and I just wander could you talk

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:34.900
about why you gave it up?

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.780
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Because I stopped being paid.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:45.450
Basically, with newspaper comic
strip, the way it works is you--

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:47.240
the newspapers pay the syndicate

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.830
and the syndicate gives you
a portion of what gets paid,

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:52.250
so you can-- You'll have a
contract with a syndicate

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:56.030
that will say, if you go below
a certain number of papers,

00:49:56.030 --> 00:50:01.450
you have-- You can say I'm
done or we can say we're done.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:06.090
And to Universal Press' credit,
they kept me on a long time

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:07.730
when they could have dropped me.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:11.680
I think they felt a
certain kind of, you know,

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.000
they needed me [laughter].

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.480
I mean, you know, so they can
say we have the black woman,

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.840
you know, and that's really
good because they really needed

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.510
to be able to say that and so--

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:23.790
But as newspapers
started declining--

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:28.550
And when I first started in, you
know, the early '90s, you know,

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.790
'90, they-- Universal
Press sent out a letter

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:35.800
to all their creators
and said, you know,

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.330
newspapers are on the decline.

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:41.780
And so not only-- it's
the same strip that goes

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.600
out to every newspaper but
if the circulation is larger

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.530
for newspaper, you
get paid more.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:52.230
So when circulations go down and
newspapers start dropping off,

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.030
then paychecks gets smaller
and then they think, oh,

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:57.570
it's not worth it,
you know, all the work

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:00.160
and energy to keep just.

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.270
So, it was a certain time
when I was doing the strip

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:06.240
that I started also
doing other gigs.

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:07.990
You know, it's like I've
got to do some other things

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:12.690
to keep my life going so I, you
know, worked in other areas.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:14.150
&gt;&gt; What did you do?

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:15.450
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Many things [laughter].

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:17.240
But what I did, it
seems like I stayed

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.150
in publishing for a lot of it.

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.680
But I also did fashion
stuff and--

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.490
but like I've been
at Parents Magazine

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.430
for a hundred years now.

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:31.170
I mean, that was-- I see
somebody I used to work

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:33.530
with [laughs] but--
and that for so long--

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:36.560
and I'm the research director
there, but how did that happen?

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.880
You-- well, you're a-- And they
don't know I'm a cartoonist.

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.480
They're like, oh, you have
such nice handwriting.

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:44.110
I was like, thank you [laughs].

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:48.440
Thanks. So that's how it goes.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.770
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.720
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft: Yeah.

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.020
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: OK.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.320
Another question.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.620
&gt;&gt; Denise Lauder: Hi.

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:58.040
I am Denise Lauder [assumed
spelling], longtime friend

00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:03.540
of Barbara's but I've
wanted to ask all of you

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.760
if today's climate especially--

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.480
well, we'll start with
the younger generation

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.780
here [laughs].

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.890
But someone who is
using the online medium

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.930
and I really think you
could go back, Barbara,

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.800
and do what you do online.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.150
They're business models
for something like that.

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:23.370
My son is making money
and I don't know what

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:26.900
in the heck is [inaudible]
[laughter].

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.470
I'm off topic.

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:34.320
Does today's climate, you know,
politics and the vitriol that's

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:38.800
on the internet affect
or impact--

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.770
you know, what is on the
internet or not affect

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:45.540
or impact the work that
you and the words--

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:48.570
the pictures that you want to
draw and what you want to say,

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:52.550
does it diminish it or
does it fire you up?

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:54.720
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: I think
that that it totally has

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.070
and I think that there is this--

00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:59.560
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
Fired you up?

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.240
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Well, I think
that it has impacted for sure.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.140
Like I think that
now illustrators--

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:07.330
especially because you're
responding in real time

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.230
and it feels like
almost distorted

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:12.400
to then post a nice
picture of a flower

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.180
when a school shooting
has happened, right.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.720
So like I think that there--

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.260
because illustrators and
cartoonists are so much

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.330
in dialog with our audience,
it's very intimate relationship.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:26.450
Like in a weird way you're
like you're kind of--

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:28.340
it can be tough because you
end up being like if you feel

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.700
like you're entertaining for
free or you're like some sort

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:35.630
of like online buddy to like
30,000 people or whatever.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:39.510
And so I think-- and I
think that now because a lot

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:42.060
of the people that
really infuses new energy

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:44.150
into illustration are
younger and more political

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:46.610
and more diverse, I
think there is a demand

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:50.550
to question and comment.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:56.080
And it doesn't exist
in a vacuum.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.050
I think that that increasingly--

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.230
it feels very out of
touch if somebody thinks

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:02.580
like their work is not
connected to the world

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.670
and it doesn't respond to
the world, then I think some

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:09.020
of that is the current
fashion of thinking as well

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:13.690
but I don't-- I kind of
agree, you know what I mean?

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:17.850
It doesn't exist in a vacuum and
if you don't respond that means

00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:20.950
that you're privileged enough
to not have to respond, so yeah.

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:22.640
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Or
maybe you just want

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.520
to be a little more thoughtful--

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:25.820
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.120
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: --
before you respond.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.420
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:29.720
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
That will be novel.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:31.020
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
Yeah [laughter].

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:32.320
&gt;&gt; Barbara Brandon-Croft:
The whole world.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.620
&gt;&gt; We have time for
one more question.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:34.920
We've got a gentleman here.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.220
&gt;&gt; Sorry. Hi.

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.520
So there's some really
great hashtags trending

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.380
on Twitter right now for women
in illustration and kidlit women

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:44.930
and part of that is also a big
conversation about, you know,

00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:48.570
the kidlit industry is--
there's a lot of women working

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.660
in that industry, right,
and even in that very,

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.970
very high levels but there are
still some inequality in terms

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:56.000
of the awards, especially
in the illustration side.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.060
I'm just wondering if you
have any particular thoughts

00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:00.650
about that conversation and
just to make sure people know

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:01.990
about these hashtags
because there's a lot

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.980
of great stuff being promoted.

00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:09.020
Kidlit women and
women in illustration.

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.320
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Yeah.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.730
I mean-- well, I have a
new picture book out so I'm

00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:14.320
like sort of thinking
about this and running

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.840
in that circle a lot right now.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.420
And it's again, like I sort
of said at the beginning,

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:23.810
it's fascinating because it's
a matriarchy in some ways.

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:25.560
But some of those
persistent problems,

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:29.060
it's just when powers starts
like coming into it for example.

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:34.290
I am super interested to know
that, you know, a lot of young,

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:39.380
hot, attractive men
get these are perceived

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.990
to get ahead in this way.

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:42.630
And you're just like
that's so disappointing

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:47.380
that that is just a flip of
like this power thing [laughs].

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:53.290
But it's-- again, a lot of it
is tied into any other industry

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:55.440
like what-- like of me too.

00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:58.120
You know, it's like kids that's
having this me too moment

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.270
and people are somehow shocked.

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.220
But it's an industry,
it's money, it's power,

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.970
it's influence, it's
fame, all these things.

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:08.720
And once you've put that into
the mix, it's like all the--

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.590
Those patterns just recur.

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:18.700
But I don't know, it's-- I think
that sometimes this is a very

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.110
like nebulous industry.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:24.570
It's like how do
you become popular?

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:28.150
How do you get a book deal?

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.370
How do you become
book to do speaking?

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:31.970
How do you-- Where
do you get invited?

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:33.270
All these becomes just like--

00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:35.780
and it's like there's
a lot of socializing

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:37.080
and there's a lot of, you know--

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.780
that's how the industry of
publishing kind of works

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:44.440
and that can favor certain
types of people and then

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.840
and it all gets like
kind of gray zoned.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.520
There's a lot gray zone
in a lot of publishing.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.820
Maybe that's all industry

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.680
but that gray zone can be really
frustrating because you have

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:58.310
to be able to navigate
it, to thrive and then

00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:01.750
but also to stay sane, so.

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:05.300
&gt;&gt; Whitney Sherman: I was going
to say hashtags are great.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:09.820
It's a great way to find stuff
if you're looking on the web

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:15.680
or on social media but
in a way it's endemic

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.650
of where we are right
now, politically.

00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:23.500
It's this burgeoning industry
of recognizing women in a way,

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.120
if you know what I mean.

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:29.430
It's like a thing to do and
I hope that we get past that,

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.220
that we survive this trend.

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.920
I don't want to be a trend.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.520
I want to be just
part of the whole.

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.200
And so the hashtagging
is great if you want

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.300
to sense the community, right,

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.220
as you can see how many
other people are using

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:47.660
that same hashtag.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:52.500
It's a way to connect in with
certain very specific topics,

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.730
whether it's children's
literature

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:57.080
or generally women
in illustration.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:59.110
They're kind of two
different things.

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:05.410
But I just have this
great hope for a future

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:10.500
that doesn't need a hashtag
like that for it to be vital.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:11.970
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki: Well,
I think the kidlit women

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:14.820
in particular is
a response to some

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:20.800
of that recent me too
stuff, #metoo stuff.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.610
I do think it also deserve
as like an educational tool

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.700
for people that are starting
and they don't know the way

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.440
that it works and
now they're quickly--

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.780
so maybe that's good and that
it helps people prevent falling

00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:37.320
into these traps or these bad
situations before their career

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.760
is at that point,
so I don't know.

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.060
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Yeah.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.360
No. That's terrific.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.660
I mean over a hundred--

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:46.500
This sort of is a good ending
point I think perhaps [laughs].

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.010
&gt;&gt; Jillian Tamaki:
Hashtag learning.

00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:51.550
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: From
hashtags to, you know,

00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:55.920
over a hundred years ago,
Cecilia Beaux dreamed of a time

00:58:55.920 --> 00:59:00.440
when the notion of women
and art would become strange

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:06.960
as mentioning men in art,
so we're moving toward that.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.840
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So how
about we all agree today.

00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.090
It's been a terrific panel

00:59:11.090 --> 00:59:14.510
and we have been
privileged to hear--

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:23.070
[ Applause ]

00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:28.400
We have been privileged to
hear from terrific artists,

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.230
terrific illustrators,
terrific cartoonists, period.

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.030
Thank you.

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:39.090
[ Applause ]

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:40.390
All right.

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:41.830
So I'm going to call on some of
my colleagues from the Prints

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:43.480
and Photographs Division.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.930
As you head out the door in
groups, if you do have time

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:49.550
to go to the graphics
arts gallery and see some

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.210
of the original artwork,
it's fantastic experience,

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:57.060
and conveniently located next to
the library's gift shop filled

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.430
with souvenirs but most
specifically the book

00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:00.730
"Drawn to Purpose".

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.140
Thank you for your time today.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.440
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Thank you.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:05.310
[Applause]

01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:08.970
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
