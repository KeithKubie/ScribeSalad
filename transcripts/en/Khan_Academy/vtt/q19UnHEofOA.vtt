00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.680
Let's figure out what 11 and
12/16 minus 5 and 8/16 is.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.430
And then we might have
to simplify it down

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.010
to lowest terms.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.620
So the way I like to do these
is to kind of separate out

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.050
the whole number
part of the mixed

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.950
numbers from the
fractional part.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.510
So I can rewrite this
number right over here

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.260
as 11 plus 12/16.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.612
And from that, I am
going to subtract--

00:00:23.612 --> 00:00:25.320
and I'll put parentheses
here because I'm

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.170
going to break this part open.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:34.800
I'm going to
subtract 5 plus 8/16.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.410
5 and 8/16-- same
thing as 5 plus 8/16.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.580
But I have to remember,
I'm subtracting it.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.280
I'm subtracting
this whole thing.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.030
So I could rewrite it as--
I'll rewrite this part--

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.990
11 plus 12/16.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.050
And I'm subtracting 5 plus 8/16.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.560
So I can distribute
the negative sign.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.710
So it's going to be minus
5, negative 1 times 5.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.470
And then negative 1
times positive 8/16.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.239
So it's going to be minus 8/16.

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.110
And then I like to do the
whole number parts separately

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.882
and then the fractional
parts separately.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.340
So let's do the
whole number parts.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.470
We have 11 minus 5.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.020
I'll write it here, 11 minus 5.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.870
We'll do that part.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.390
That's the whole number part.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.660
And then we have plus 12/16.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.896
Let me do this in pink maybe,
plus 12/16, minus 8/16.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.220
And 11 minus 5 is 6.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.267
And I have 6 plus.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:45.100
And then our denominators
are the same here,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.118
so we're going to get
something over 16.

00:01:47.118 --> 00:01:50.380
And 12 minus 8 is 4.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.670
So this is the same
thing as 6 plus 4

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.265
over 16, which is the
same thing as-- writing it

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:58.455
as a mixed number-- 6 and 4/16.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.070
And this is the right quantity,
but we can simplify it.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.000
4/16 can be simplified.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.419
Both the numerator and the
denominator are divisible by 4.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:10.690
They both have the factor 4.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.420
So let's divide both the
numerator and denominator by 4.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.680
Divided by 4.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.222
Divided by 4.

00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:16.846
Since we're dividing
by the same thing,

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:18.330
we're not changing its quantity.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.630
And so this is
equal to-- we still

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.470
have the whole number part,
6, but the fraction part

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.790
is now 1, 1/4.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.400
So we get 6 and 1/4.
