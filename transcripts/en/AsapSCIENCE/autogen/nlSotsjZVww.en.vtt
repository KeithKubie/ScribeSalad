00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.370
 Beauty stems from the eye of the beholder, but because the continuation of humanity is driven by sexual selections 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.010
 We often try to highlight what makes us unique. Well what exactly exists 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.180
 In make-up products? Should we trust its components to put in our bodies? 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.749
 Does makeup really hurt you? 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.749
 Historically, the ancient Egyptians carved metal materials consisting mainly 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.669
 Of lead sulphide and put it around their eyes to get the look of an attractive, ignorant Kelopatra 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.679
 Lead is a strong neurotoxin which can lead to learning difficulties and behavior 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.930
 In children, the fertility rate decreases in both men and women. Recently in 1891, creams and lotions 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.809
 The red ingredients containing radioactive radium components were also sold to women 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.170
 In Europe, which is considered a bright youth - until the discovery of harmful radiation effects 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.379
 But make-up has come a long way and now holds small amounts of lead 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.679
 In our products. Lead is found in nature and is an unintentional contaminant from industrialization. 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:06.579
 The Food and Drug Organization examined 400 cans of lipstick and found different concentrations of 0.026 million 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:13.790
 To 7.19 million of lead. Which are within Canada's health limits of "10 million". 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.070
 Lipstick contains 47% of oils, 36% of dyes, 17% of wax, 5% of other ingredients including 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.020
 Preservatives. Oils based on castor oil, extracted from beans, which contains 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.229
 Resin protein - one of the most toxic substances on the planet which is used 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.719
 As a vital weapon. However, the process of extracting castor oil depends on heating 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.259
 Which disintegrates the ricin and makes it inactive. 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.950
 Dyes are now used in industrial dyes because of the cost and efficiency of production although the conventional way 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.039
 In the extraction of red dyes are from dried and pollinated cinnamon insects. Some blue dyes 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.390
 It is made of ferrocyanide iron, high-risk cyanide but in this product 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.180
 The cyanide compound is associated with a strong bond with the iron. As a result, it is unable 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.109
 To be our Sam in the shadows of the eyes. 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.950
 When talking about the mascara, we recommend removing the container after three months of opening it. 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.860
 Where he discovered the growth of harmful streptococcus bacteria and types of fungi by 36.4% 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.310
 In cans of mascara. This is important for contact lens repellents, where bacteria can 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.180
 Easily enter through small scratches in the lens itself 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.060
 Paraben was a major concern as well as used in beauty products 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.709
 Paraben mimics the action of estrogen and can bind to estrogen receptors. This can cause 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.040
 Change in gene formula and change communication between cells .. In addition to 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.840
 It can lead to the growth of breast cancer cells. However, a lot of products are going to be 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.769
 Free of paraben - and we still need a lot of studies to come up with results 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:03:01.370
 Conclusive
