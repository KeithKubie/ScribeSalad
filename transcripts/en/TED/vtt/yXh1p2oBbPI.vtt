00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.603
When I was 13,

00:00:14.627 --> 00:00:17.467
I lost my grandfather
to a silent heart attack.

00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:22.366
What happened to be more
shocking was that at 75,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.848
grandpa was really normal,
healthy and energetic,

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:29.132
but he was diabetic.

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:32.465
Learning all of this was so painful

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.499
that I decided to go out on a war
against this deadly killer

00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:37.999
and see what could be done.

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.429
It was shocking to discover
the results of recent studies

00:00:42.453 --> 00:00:46.225
that have shown an estimate
of nearly eight million people

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.116
who die from heart attacks every year.

00:00:49.854 --> 00:00:52.412
Heart attacks occur for many reasons,

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:57.017
but most often, they occur
when arteries get clogged,

00:00:57.041 --> 00:00:58.515
blood flow is cut off

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.780
and oxygen-starved cells
in the heart muscles start to die.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.681
You may know the common
symptoms of a heart attack:

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:11.840
chest pain, arm pain, shortness
of breath, fatigue, et cetera ...

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.922
but there is a type of heart attack
that is quite common,

00:01:15.946 --> 00:01:17.415
just as deadly,

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.174
but harder to detect
because the symptoms are silent.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.054
People having silent heart attacks
just don't realize what's happening,

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:30.973
so they're not seeking medical attention,

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:35.922
which means they're less likely
to receive the treatment that they need

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:37.399
at the critical moment.

00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:41.797
And even if they do
get to the hospital by chance,

00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.557
either before or after
they are struck by a heart attack,

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:51.232
they might have to go through one or more
of these time-consuming, expensive tests

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:52.407
and treatments,

00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:54.913
which are currently considered
the gold standards

00:01:54.937 --> 00:01:56.706
of heart-attack diagnosis.

00:01:57.148 --> 00:01:59.065
The greater concern, however,

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:03.229
is that these silent heart attacks
account for nearly 45 percent

00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:04.677
of all heart attacks.

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:09.978
Patients with diabetes and similar
disorders suffer from nerve damage

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:13.295
that prevents them from feeling
the sort of pain

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.794
that usually signals to someone

00:02:15.818 --> 00:02:19.521
that he or she may be having
a heart attack.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.469
Which means they suffer
the damage of a heart attack

00:02:24.493 --> 00:02:27.400
without even knowing or feeling anything.

00:02:28.652 --> 00:02:34.359
These already at-risk patients
suffer from nerve damage,

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:37.603
and they do not get
immediate medical care.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.490
They do not know anything before
an unlikely event is about to occur.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.960
My grandfather
was an at-risk patient, too.

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:50.841
I probed this issue further --

00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:53.706
read as much as I could
to understand the heart,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.419
met researchers
and worked across labs in India.

00:02:58.257 --> 00:03:02.704
And finally, after three long years
of persistent research,

00:03:02.728 --> 00:03:06.727
what I have to share with the world today
is a promising solution.

00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:11.379
A noninvasive device that is inexpensive,

00:03:11.403 --> 00:03:16.895
portable, wearable by at-risk
patients at all times.

00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:20.687
It greatly reduces
the need for a blood test

00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:26.700
and works 24/7, collecting
and analyzing data at preset intervals.

00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:31.052
And all this data is collected
for a single purpose:

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:33.727
detecting heart attacks as they occur.

00:03:35.151 --> 00:03:39.933
This is a very promising solution
that might help us in the future.

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:44.381
You may not know how intelligent
your heart really is.

00:03:45.423 --> 00:03:50.443
It tries to communicate to your body
multiple times before failing,

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:52.929
by indicating symptoms like chest pain.

00:03:53.835 --> 00:03:57.600
These symptoms are triggered
when the heart loses out

00:03:57.624 --> 00:03:59.752
on oxygen-rich blood flow.

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.261
But remember I told you
about the nerve damage.

00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:07.967
It silences these symptoms
before a silent heart attack,

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:11.540
which makes it even deadlier.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.834
And you may not even know
the common symptoms.

00:04:17.743 --> 00:04:22.116
Meanwhile, the heart also sends out
certain biomarkers --

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.313
cardiac biomarkers or proteins
that are SOS messages --

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:29.139
in the form of SOS messages --

00:04:29.163 --> 00:04:30.742
into your bloodstream,

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:33.381
indicating that the heart is at risk.

00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:36.084
As it gets riskier and riskier,

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:39.688
the concentrations
of these cardiac biomarker proteins

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.612
keep increasing abysmally.

00:04:42.376 --> 00:04:45.014
My device solely relies on this data.

00:04:45.923 --> 00:04:49.306
The key is that these cardiac
biomarkers are found

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.103
in one of the earliest
stages of a heart attack,

00:04:52.127 --> 00:04:55.638
when someone is almost sure to survive

00:04:55.662 --> 00:04:58.802
if he or she gets prompt care.

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:03.625
And my device is solely based
on that basis.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.441
And here's how my device works.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.348
A silicon patch is worn around your wrist
or placed near your chest.

00:05:12.243 --> 00:05:17.103
Without having to prick your skin
for a biomarker blood test,

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:23.835
this patch can spot, isolate and track
a heart-attack specific biomarker

00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:25.940
called H-FABP,

00:05:25.964 --> 00:05:31.626
and alerts you if and when it reaches
a critical level in your bloodstream --

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.319
a process that's much simpler, easier
and cheaper than conventional methods

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:39.530
of heart-attack diagnosis.

00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:44.647
By checking on biomarker
concentration data,

00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:49.838
a system like this,
with advanced research in the future,

00:05:49.862 --> 00:05:54.294
could significantly reduce the need
for an at-risk patient to go to a doctor

00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:55.656
for a biomarker blood test,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.014
because the device
could be worn at all times,

00:05:59.038 --> 00:06:02.171
sensing biomarker elevations in real time.

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:08.520
Thus, if the device senses the biomarker
levels going beyond the critical point,

00:06:08.544 --> 00:06:13.025
the at-risk patient could be warned
of an impending cardiac arrest

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:15.835
and that he or she needs
immediate medical attention.

00:06:16.621 --> 00:06:20.253
Although the device may not be able
to provide the patient

00:06:20.277 --> 00:06:23.223
with the complete analysis
of the cardiac injury,

00:06:23.247 --> 00:06:25.341
it might be of immense help

00:06:25.365 --> 00:06:29.247
in actually indicating
that the patient is in danger,

00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.343
so that the patient can be alarmed

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:34.499
and know that immediate care is crucial.

00:06:35.473 --> 00:06:40.241
Every at-risk patient will now receive
more time to survive

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:41.849
and reach out for medical help.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.124
Consequently, they don't have to go

00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:48.442
for expensive and invasive
medical treatments

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:51.358
that would otherwise be necessary
after a heart attack.

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:56.611
When I got my device tested
on at-risk patients under observation,

00:06:56.635 --> 00:06:59.620
results from the clinical validation tests

00:06:59.644 --> 00:07:03.744
certified close to a 96 percent
accuracy and sensitivity.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.173
I intend to make my device available
to people in two variants:

00:07:09.197 --> 00:07:13.221
one which gives digital analysis
of the biomarker levels

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:15.802
and a simpler version
for the people in rural areas

00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:19.531
which simply vibrates when the biomarker
levels go beyond the critical point.

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:24.223
When we look at our progress
in cardiac health care today,

00:07:24.247 --> 00:07:28.352
it is more of sick care than preventative
self-care and technology.

00:07:29.224 --> 00:07:31.564
We literally wait
for the heart attack to occur

00:07:31.588 --> 00:07:35.352
and put our vast majority of resources
into post-care treatment.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.816
But by then, irreversible damage
will already be done.

00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:44.380
I firmly believe it's time
for us to rethink medicine.

00:07:44.885 --> 00:07:47.757
We must establish proactive
health-care technologies.

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:51.024
A change must be brought out
not 10 years from now,

00:07:51.048 --> 00:07:52.347
not five years from now,

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:53.526
but today.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.939
And so, hopefully, one day,

00:07:55.963 --> 00:07:57.729
with the help of these devices,

00:07:57.753 --> 00:08:02.265
someone else won't lose
his or her grandfather just like I did.

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:03.539
Thank you so much.

00:08:03.563 --> 00:08:05.024
(Applause)

00:08:05.048 --> 00:08:06.921
Thank you.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:08.952
(Applause)

00:08:08.976 --> 00:08:10.126
Thank you.
