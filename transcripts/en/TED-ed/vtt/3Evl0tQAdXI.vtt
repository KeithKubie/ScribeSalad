00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:19.157
We talk about inventions and innovation

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:20.794
as though the best things out there

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:23.520
are the Internet, iPads, or smart phones.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.815
Or perhaps more simply,

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:27.308
trains, planes, and automobiles.

00:00:27.308 --> 00:00:30.127
Which one is most important,

00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:31.808
the best, or the greatest?

00:00:31.808 --> 00:00:35.119
Which one has had the most impact on society?

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:37.047
Today the debate would probably be

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:39.751
in favor of computer technology,

00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:41.241
but is it?

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:45.597
Well, some would say, "Nope, not really, it's farming."

00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:48.946
Where would we be if we didn't have it?

00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:50.182
Give up?

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.541
We would still be hunting and gathering

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:54.803
with little time to invent anything,

00:00:54.803 --> 00:00:57.058
let alone the Internet.

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:00.577
That's right, farming is the seed of civilization.

00:01:00.577 --> 00:01:03.721
Not quite literally, but without early man's discovery

00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:05.894
of using seeds to grow grain,

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:09.239
we wouldn't have much of anything we have today.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:12.444
Growing your own food changed everything.

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:15.903
Sure, hunting and gathering worked just fine

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.202
for tens of thousands of years,

00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:20.375
but you couldn't do much else -

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.339
no time.

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:25.368
But when hunters and gatherers started planting seeds,

00:01:25.368 --> 00:01:27.249
they began to farm.

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:28.833
With farming came animals,

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.759
and with animals came settling down

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.408
and staying in one location.

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:35.702
So, how does this have anything to do

00:01:35.702 --> 00:01:38.467
with invention and innovation?

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:39.790
Everything.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.398
Anyone who's ever farmed,

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:44.984
even if it's planting a half dozen tomato plants in your backyard,

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:47.979
knows that you usually harvest way more

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.799
than you could possibly eat,

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.545
a surplus.

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:53.630
Farming yielded plenty of food,

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.216
with enough to store, trade, and eat.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:59.844
In other words, not everyone needed to be farmers.

00:01:59.844 --> 00:02:02.199
Therefore, this allowed other people,

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:04.680
non-farmers, to do other things

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.787
such as make tools,

00:02:05.787 --> 00:02:07.163
craft pottery,

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:08.714
and build homes.

00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:13.916
Farming and food surpluses led to the division of labor.

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:16.273
This is still thousands of years ago,

00:02:16.273 --> 00:02:18.046
so life wasn't easy.

00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:21.719
But with so many people contributing to the community,

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.348
small villages began to develop.

00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:26.960
As the population of villages expanded,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.231
so did the needs of the people.

00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:31.467
Things got complicated.

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:37.433
But, civilization is just that - advanced, complex societies.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.987
And without farming, they would not exist.

00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:42.912
Villages increased in size,

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.988
eventually becoming the first cities.

00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:50.614
Cities are just one of the basic features of a civilization,

00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:53.388
the others include central government,

00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:54.886
system of writing,

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:56.440
organized religion,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.973
art and architecture,

00:02:57.973 --> 00:03:02.279
urban planning of roads, bridges, and public works,

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.971
social classes,

00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:05.717
and different jobs.

00:03:05.717 --> 00:03:09.304
Developing expertise in various types of occupations

00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:12.802
allowed for innovative ways of doing things,

00:03:12.802 --> 00:03:14.250
producing new products,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.403
or making advancements in technology.

00:03:17.403 --> 00:03:20.289
As civilizations became more complex,

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.861
new ways of doing things were needed.

00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:25.498
Some were out of necessity.

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:29.002
Others because people had ideas.

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.424
The sharing of ideas and technology

00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:34.497
led to the growth of things we readily use today,

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:36.138
like the Internet.

00:03:36.138 --> 00:03:39.887
So without farming, we'd still be hunting and gathering.

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:40.855
No video,

00:03:40.855 --> 00:03:42.090
no computers,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.455
and certainly no world wide web.
