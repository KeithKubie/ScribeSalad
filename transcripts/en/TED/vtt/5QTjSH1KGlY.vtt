00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:16.494
I grew up white, secular and middle class

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:18.190
in 1950s America.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.920
That meant watching fireworks
on the Fourth of July,

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:24.548
trick-or-treating on Halloween

00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:26.799
and putting presents
under a tree at Christmas.

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:29.978
But by the time
those traditions got to me,

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.203
they were hollow, commercial enterprises,

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:34.119
which just left me feeling empty.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.900
So from a relatively young age,

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:39.753
I found myself looking to fill
an existential hole,

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:42.874
to connect with something
bigger than myself.

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:47.315
There hadn't been a bar mitzvah
in my family in over a century,

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.290
so I thought I'd take a shot at that --

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:50.628
(Laughter)

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:54.059
only to be devastated
when my one encounter with the rabbi,

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:58.830
a really tall, godlike figure
with flowing white hair,

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:01.731
consisted of him asking me
for my middle name

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:03.426
so we could fill out a form.

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:05.414
Yep, that was it.

00:01:05.438 --> 00:01:06.501
(Laughter)

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.339
So I got the fountain pen,

00:01:08.363 --> 00:01:11.215
but I didn't get the sense
of belonging and confidence

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:12.400
I was searching for.

00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:14.988
Many years later,

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:17.728
I couldn't bear the thought
of my son turning 13

00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:20.537
without some kind of rite of passage.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.815
So I came up with the idea
of a 13th birthday trip,

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:27.347
and I offered to take Murphy
anywhere in the world

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.729
that had meaning for him.

00:01:29.597 --> 00:01:32.296
A budding young naturalist
who loved turtles,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.436
he immediately settled on the Galapagos.

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:38.033
And when my daughter, Katie, turned 13,

00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:41.396
she and I spent two weeks
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.991
where Katie learned for the first time
that she was powerful and brave.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.593
Since then, my partner, Ashton,
and lots of our friends and relatives

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:53.585
have taken their kids
on 13th birthday trips,

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.606
with everyone finding it transformative
for both the child and the parent.

00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:02.798
I wasn't brought up saying grace.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.312
But for the last 20 years,

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.273
we've been holding hands
before every meal.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.294
It's a beautiful bit of shared silence

00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:13.609
that brings us all together in the moment.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.221
Ashton tells everyone
to "pass the squeeze,"

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:19.635
while she assures them it's not religious.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.123
(Laughter)

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.622
So recently, when my family asked me

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:30.120
if I could please do something
with the more than 250 boxes of stuff

00:02:30.144 --> 00:02:32.177
that I've collected over a lifetime,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.219
my ritual-making impulse kicked in.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:40.151
I started wondering if I could go further
than simple death cleaning.

00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:44.674
"Death cleaning" is the Swedish term
for clearing out your closets,

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:48.294
your basement and your attic
before you die,

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:50.447
so your kids don't have to do it later.

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:52.398
(Laughter)

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.825
I pictured my children
opening up box after box

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.319
and wondering why I'd kept
any of that stuff.

00:02:59.343 --> 00:03:00.548
(Laughter)

00:03:00.572 --> 00:03:03.980
And then I imagined them looking
at a specific picture

00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:06.495
of me with a beautiful young woman,

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.552
and asking, "Who on earth
is that with Dad?"

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:10.972
(Laughter)

00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:13.024
And that was the aha moment.

00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:16.599
It wasn't the things I'd saved
that were important;

00:03:16.623 --> 00:03:20.173
it was the stories that went with them
that gave them meaning.

00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:24.516
Could using the objects
to tell the stories

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.213
be the seed of a new ritual,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.293
a rite of passage --
not for a 13-year-old,

00:03:30.317 --> 00:03:32.656
but for someone much further
down the road?

00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:35.998
So I started experimenting.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.319
I got a few dozen things out of the boxes,

00:03:39.343 --> 00:03:40.964
I put them about in a room,

00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:43.561
and I invited people to come in

00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:46.992
and ask me about anything
that they found interesting.

00:03:48.497 --> 00:03:49.885
The results were terrific.

00:03:50.328 --> 00:03:55.378
A good story became a launching pad
for a much deeper discussion,

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.834
in which my visitors made
meaningful connections

00:03:57.858 --> 00:03:59.082
to their own lives.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.343
Derrius [Quarles] asked me
about a Leonard Peltier T-shirt

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:06.401
that I'd worn a lot in the '80s,

00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.424
that, sadly, is still relevant today.

00:04:09.924 --> 00:04:11.713
Our conversation moved quickly,

00:04:12.697 --> 00:04:16.480
from a large number of political
prisoners in American jails,

00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:18.716
to Derrius wondering about the legacy

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.670
of the Black Liberation
Movement of the '60s,

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:25.148
and how his life might be different
if he'd come of age then,

00:04:25.172 --> 00:04:27.092
instead of 30-odd years later.

00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:29.750
At the end of our conversation,

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:32.779
Derrius asked me
if he could have the T-shirt.

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:36.286
And giving it to him felt
just about perfect.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.843
As these conversations
established common ground,

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:42.767
especially across generations,

00:04:43.648 --> 00:04:45.910
I realized I was opening a space

00:04:45.934 --> 00:04:48.922
for people to talk about things
that really mattered to them.

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.751
And I started seeing myself
with a renewed sense of purpose --

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.312
not as the old guy on the way out,

00:04:56.936 --> 00:04:58.650
but as someone with a role to play

00:04:58.674 --> 00:04:59.824
going forward.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.224
When I was growing up,

00:05:03.248 --> 00:05:05.780
life ended for most people in their 70s.

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:09.359
People are living far longer now,

00:05:10.064 --> 00:05:12.211
and for the first time in human history,

00:05:12.235 --> 00:05:15.999
it's common for four generations
to be living side by side.

00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:18.254
I'm 71,

00:05:18.897 --> 00:05:20.214
and with a bit of luck,

00:05:20.238 --> 00:05:22.639
I've got 20 or 30 more years ahead of me.

00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:26.427
Giving away my stuff now

00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:31.481
and sharing it with friends, family,
and I hope strangers, too,

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:35.509
seems like the perfect way
to enter this next stage of my life.

00:05:36.704 --> 00:05:38.789
Turns out to be just
what I was looking for:

00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:41.859
a ritual that's less about dying

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.826
and more about opening the door

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.253
to whatever comes next.

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:47.295
Thank you.

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.409
(Applause)

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:49.607
Onward!

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:51.825
(Applause)
