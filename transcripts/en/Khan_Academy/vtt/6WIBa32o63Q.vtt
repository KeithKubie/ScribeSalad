00:00:01.997 --> 00:00:04.305
- [Instructor] Before we
get into electron affinity,

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:07.390
let's really quickly
review ionization energy.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.188
And let's start with a
neutral lithium atom,

00:00:10.188 --> 00:00:13.978
with an electron configuration
of one s two, two s one.

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:16.934
A lithium atom has three
protons in the nucleus,

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.898
so a positive three charge.

00:00:18.898 --> 00:00:21.228
Two electrons in the one s orbital,

00:00:21.228 --> 00:00:24.154
so here are the two electrons
in the one s orbital,

00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:26.039
or our core electrons,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.646
and one electron in a two s orbital.

00:00:28.646 --> 00:00:32.339
This is our outermost
electron, our valence electron.

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.076
The valence electron is shielded

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.473
from the full positive
three charge of the nucleus

00:00:37.473 --> 00:00:40.153
by the presence of the core electrons.

00:00:40.153 --> 00:00:41.820
So like charges repel,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.107
and these core electrons
repel this outer electron,

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:48.346
and shield it from the
full positive three charge.

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:50.474
But there still is an attractive force

00:00:50.474 --> 00:00:52.438
between the positively charged nucleus

00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:54.708
and this outermost electron.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:58.612
So opposite charges attract,
and our outermost electron

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:01.719
still feels a pull from the nucleus.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.318
Therefore, since the outer
electron is attracted

00:01:04.318 --> 00:01:06.523
to the nucleus, it takes energy

00:01:06.523 --> 00:01:08.940
to completely pull away
this valence electron

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.835
from the neutral atom.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.285
So if we pull away the outermost electron,

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:15.697
we lose our valence electron,

00:01:15.697 --> 00:01:19.066
and we're left with a lithium
ion, with a positive charge.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.255
Positive one charge, because
we still have three protons,

00:01:22.255 --> 00:01:24.507
but only two electrons now,

00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:26.570
so overall a plus one charge.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.987
Since this ionization takes
energy to rip away the electron,

00:01:30.987 --> 00:01:34.059
the energy, the ionization
energy, is positive,

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:36.706
and is measured in kiloJoules per mol.

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:39.656
Let's compare that with electron affinity.

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:42.117
So, in electron affinity,
let's say we're starting

00:01:42.117 --> 00:01:44.968
with our neutral lithium atom again,

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:47.891
but this time, instead of
taking an electron away,

00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:50.183
we are adding an electron.

00:01:50.183 --> 00:01:54.029
So, we would add an electron
to the two s orbital.

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:55.883
So we started off with three electrons

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:59.440
in the neutral lithium atom,
and we're adding one more.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.837
So the electron configuration
for the lithium ion

00:02:02.837 --> 00:02:06.015
would be one s two, two s two.

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:09.339
So still three positive
charges in the nucleus,

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.001
two electrons in the one s orbital,

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.914
but now we've added an electron,

00:02:13.914 --> 00:02:16.138
so we have four electrons total,

00:02:16.138 --> 00:02:18.221
two in the two s orbital.

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:22.903
So let me highlight the electron
that we added in magenta.

00:02:22.903 --> 00:02:24.859
So this is the electron that we added

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.619
to a neutral lithium atom.

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.117
And this electron, we know, is shielded

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.880
from the full positive
three charge of the nucleus

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.833
by our two core electrons in here, right?

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.373
So like charges repel.

00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:39.489
It's also going to be
repelled a little bit

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.908
by this electron, that's
also in the two s orbital.

00:02:43.908 --> 00:02:47.064
So this electron's going
to repel this one as well.

00:02:47.064 --> 00:02:49.331
But, there is an attractive force

00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:51.710
between our positively charged nucleus

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.166
and our negative charge on the electron.

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.138
So this electron that we added

00:02:57.138 --> 00:03:00.875
still feels an attractive
force that's pulling on it

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:02.292
from the nucleus.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.044
And so, if you add this fourth electron,

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:07.711
energy is given off.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:11.635
And since energy is given
off, this is going to have

00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:14.654
a negative value for
the electron affinity.

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:17.802
For adding an electron to
a neutral lithium atom,

00:03:17.802 --> 00:03:21.302
it turns out to be -60 kiloJoules per mol.

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:26.596
So energy is released
when an electron is added,

00:03:26.596 --> 00:03:29.121
and that is because the
electron that we added

00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:33.189
is still able to be attracted
to the charged nucleus.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.923
So if the nucleus has an
attraction for the added electron,

00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:38.589
you're going to get a negative value

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:40.733
for the electron affinity.

00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:43.905
Or that's one way to
measure electron affinity.

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.665
Note that the lithium anion is larger

00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:48.489
than the neutral lithium atom.

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.476
It's just hard to represent
it here with those diagrams.

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:53.298
So as long as the added electron

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:55.980
feels an attractive
force from the nucleus,

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.647
energy is given off.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.066
Let's look at one more comparison

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:03.003
between ionization energy
and electron affinity.

00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:06.683
In ionization energy, since
the outer electron here

00:04:06.683 --> 00:04:10.909
is attracted to the nucleus,
we have to work hard

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.886
to pull that electron away.

00:04:12.886 --> 00:04:15.802
It takes energy for us to
rip away that electron.

00:04:15.802 --> 00:04:18.047
And since it takes us
energy, we have to do work,

00:04:18.047 --> 00:04:22.495
and the energy is positive,
in terms of ionization energy.

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:25.078
But for electron affinity,
since the electron

00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:26.817
that we're adding is attracted

00:04:26.817 --> 00:04:28.854
to the positive charge of the nucleus,

00:04:28.854 --> 00:04:30.303
we don't have to force this,

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.729
we don't have to do any work.

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.450
Energy is given off in this
process, and that's why

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.527
it's a negative value for
the electron affinity.

00:04:38.527 --> 00:04:41.041
Electron affinities don't
have to be negative.

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.181
For some atoms, there's
actually no attraction

00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:45.294
for an extra electron.

00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:47.279
Let's take neon, for example.

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.283
Neon has an electron configuration

00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:52.533
of one s two, two s two, and two p six.

00:04:54.353 --> 00:04:57.107
So there's a total of
two plus two plus six,

00:04:57.107 --> 00:05:00.934
or 10 electrons, and a positive
10 charge in the nucleus

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.188
for a neutral neon atom.

00:05:03.188 --> 00:05:05.351
So let's say this is our nucleus here,

00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:07.618
with a positive 10 charge, 10 protons.

00:05:07.618 --> 00:05:10.753
And then we have our 10 electrons here,

00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:12.753
surrounding our nucleus.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.154
So this is our neutral neon atom.

00:05:16.154 --> 00:05:18.352
If we try to add an electron,

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:20.413
so here let's add an electron.

00:05:20.413 --> 00:05:23.277
So we still have our 10
protons in the nucleus.

00:05:23.277 --> 00:05:25.383
We still have our 10 electrons,

00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:27.704
which would now be our core electrons.

00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:32.574
To add a new electron, this
would be the neon anion here,

00:05:32.574 --> 00:05:35.491
so one s two, two s two, two p six.

00:05:36.638 --> 00:05:38.597
We've filled the second energy level.

00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:42.841
To add an electron, we must
go to a new energy level.

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.793
So it would be the third energy level,

00:05:44.793 --> 00:05:46.122
it would be an s orbital,

00:05:46.122 --> 00:05:48.796
and there would be one
electron in that orbital.

00:05:48.796 --> 00:05:51.596
So, here is, let's say
this is the electron

00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:52.953
that we just added.

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:57.372
So we have to try to add an
electron to our neon atom.

00:05:57.372 --> 00:06:01.124
But if you think about the
effective nuclear charge

00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:04.108
that this electron in magenta feels,

00:06:04.108 --> 00:06:06.631
alright, so the effective nuclear charge,

00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:09.849
that's equal to the atomic
number, or the number of protons,

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.173
and from that, you subtract

00:06:11.173 --> 00:06:13.454
the number of shielding electrons.

00:06:13.454 --> 00:06:17.490
Since we have 10 protons in
the nucleus, this would be 10.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.674
And our shielding electrons
would be 10, as well.

00:06:20.674 --> 00:06:23.695
So those 10 electrons
shield this added electron

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:27.695
from the full positive
10 charge of the nucleus.

00:06:28.746 --> 00:06:30.960
And for a quick calculation, this tells us

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.558
that the effective nuclear charge is zero.

00:06:34.558 --> 00:06:36.183
And this is, you know, simplifying things

00:06:36.183 --> 00:06:37.911
a little bit, but you can think

00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:40.660
about this outer electron
that we tried to add,

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.644
of not having any
attraction for the nucleus.

00:06:43.644 --> 00:06:45.734
These 10 electrons shield it completely

00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:47.716
from the positive 10 charge.

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:50.778
And since there's no
attraction for this electron,

00:06:50.778 --> 00:06:53.244
energy is not given off in this process.

00:06:53.244 --> 00:06:55.136
Actually, it would take energy

00:06:55.136 --> 00:06:58.165
to force an electron onto neon.

00:06:58.165 --> 00:07:00.114
So if you wrote something out here,

00:07:00.114 --> 00:07:02.352
and if we said, alright,
I'm trying to go from,

00:07:02.352 --> 00:07:04.363
I'm trying to add an electron to neon,

00:07:04.363 --> 00:07:06.866
to turn it into an anion.

00:07:06.866 --> 00:07:08.324
Instead of giving off energy,

00:07:08.324 --> 00:07:10.783
this process would take energy.

00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:12.240
So we would have to force,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.033
we would have to try
to force this to occur.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:17.420
So it takes energy to force an electron

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.651
on a neutral atom of neon.

00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:23.818
And we say that neon has no
affinity for an electron.

00:07:24.662 --> 00:07:28.062
So it's unreactive, it's a
noble gas, and this is one way

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:31.757
to explain why noble gases are unreactive.

00:07:31.757 --> 00:07:33.677
This anion that we intended

00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:35.631
isn't going to stay around for long.

00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:39.681
So it takes energy to force
this onto our neutral neon atom.

00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:41.868
So you could say that
the electron affinity

00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:44.223
is positive here, it takes energy.

00:07:44.223 --> 00:07:46.815
But usually, you don't see positive values

00:07:46.815 --> 00:07:49.785
for electron affinity, for
this sort of situation.

00:07:49.785 --> 00:07:51.931
At least, most textbooks
I've looked at would just say

00:07:51.931 --> 00:07:54.652
the electron affinity of neon is zero,

00:07:54.652 --> 00:07:57.230
since I believe it is hard to measure

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.430
the actual value of this.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.288
Here we have the elements
in the second period

00:08:01.288 --> 00:08:02.850
on the periodic table, and let's look

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.845
at their electron affinities.

00:08:04.845 --> 00:08:06.816
We've already seen that adding an electron

00:08:06.816 --> 00:08:08.920
to a neutral atom of lithium

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.107
gives off 60 kiloJoules per mol.

00:08:12.107 --> 00:08:14.953
Next, we have beryllium, with a zero value

00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.750
for the electron affinity.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.651
That means it actually takes energy.

00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:20.344
So this number is actually positive,

00:08:20.344 --> 00:08:23.291
and it takes energy to add an electron

00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:25.725
to a neutral atom of beryllium.

00:08:25.725 --> 00:08:28.532
So if you think about going
from a neutral atom of beryllium

00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:30.797
to form the beryllium anion,

00:08:30.797 --> 00:08:33.185
when we look at electron configurations,

00:08:33.185 --> 00:08:36.594
neutral atom of beryllium
is one s two, two s two,

00:08:36.594 --> 00:08:39.971
and so, to form the negatively
charged beryllium anion,

00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:42.515
it would be one s two, two s two,

00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:45.702
and to add the extra electron, it must go

00:08:45.702 --> 00:08:49.702
into a two p orbital,
which is of higher energy.

00:08:50.616 --> 00:08:53.713
And so, this is actually the
same thing, or very similar,

00:08:53.713 --> 00:08:56.646
to neon, which we just discussed.

00:08:56.646 --> 00:08:59.609
For neon, the electron
configuration was one s two,

00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:04.155
two s two, two p six, and
to add an extra electron,

00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:06.521
we had to go to the third energy level.

00:09:06.521 --> 00:09:08.575
We had to open up a new shell.

00:09:08.575 --> 00:09:11.346
And the electron that we
added was effectively screened

00:09:11.346 --> 00:09:15.404
from the full nuclear charge
by these other electrons.

00:09:15.404 --> 00:09:18.512
And a similar thing happens
here for the beryllium anion.

00:09:18.512 --> 00:09:21.320
To add this extra electron,
we have to open up

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.492
a higher energy p orbital.

00:09:23.492 --> 00:09:26.702
This electron is, on average,
further away from the nucleus,

00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:29.217
and is effectively shielded
from the full positive

00:09:29.217 --> 00:09:33.142
charge of the nucleus, and
therefore, there's no affinity

00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:35.365
for this added electron.

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:37.424
So there's no affinity for this electron,

00:09:37.424 --> 00:09:41.347
so it takes energy to
form the beryllium anion.

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:44.823
And that's why we see this
zero value here for beryllium.

00:09:44.823 --> 00:09:47.405
Beryllium has no value
for electron affinity,

00:09:47.405 --> 00:09:49.663
or, it's actually a very positive value,

00:09:49.663 --> 00:09:51.868
and we just say it has a zero value.

00:09:51.868 --> 00:09:53.612
Next, let's look at boron here.

00:09:53.612 --> 00:09:56.836
So this gives off -27 kiloJoules per mol.

00:09:56.836 --> 00:09:59.434
And we can see a little
bit of a trend here,

00:09:59.434 --> 00:10:03.601
as we go from boron to
carbon to oxygen to fluorine.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.787
So as we go across the
period on the periodic table,

00:10:10.117 --> 00:10:13.969
more energy is given off, and therefore,

00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:17.959
fluorine has the most
affinity for an electron.

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:20.444
So as we go across a
period, we get an increase

00:10:20.444 --> 00:10:22.462
in the electron affinity.

00:10:22.462 --> 00:10:25.392
So the negative sign just
means that energy is given off,

00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:27.630
so we're really just
looking at the magnitude.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.694
More energy is given off when you add

00:10:29.694 --> 00:10:32.925
an electron to a neutral atom of fluorine,

00:10:32.925 --> 00:10:37.111
than if you add an electron
to a neutral atom of oxygen.

00:10:37.111 --> 00:10:39.000
And we can explain this general trend

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.933
in terms of effective nuclear charge.

00:10:41.933 --> 00:10:45.665
As we go across our period,
we also have an increase

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:48.931
in the effective nuclear charge.

00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:51.644
And if the added electron
is feeling more of a pull

00:10:51.644 --> 00:10:54.375
from the nucleus, which
is what we mean here

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:57.589
by increased effective nuclear charge,

00:10:57.589 --> 00:11:01.820
more energy will be given off
when we add that electron.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.962
So this idea explains the general trend

00:11:04.962 --> 00:11:08.606
we see for electron affinity,
as you go across a period,

00:11:08.606 --> 00:11:11.626
we get an increase in
the electron affinity.

00:11:11.626 --> 00:11:14.912
We've already talked about
beryllium as an exception,

00:11:14.912 --> 00:11:18.867
neon as an exception, but
what about nitrogen in here?

00:11:18.867 --> 00:11:21.009
We can see that nitrogen
doesn't really have

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:24.016
an affinity for an
electron, and you'll see

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.853
many different values for this one,

00:11:25.853 --> 00:11:28.047
depending on which
textbook you're looking in.

00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:30.230
But if we look at some
electron configurations

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.322
really quickly, we can
try to explain this.

00:11:33.322 --> 00:11:37.001
So, for nitrogen, the
electron configuration

00:11:37.001 --> 00:11:40.834
is one s two, two s two,
and then two p three.

00:11:42.287 --> 00:11:44.371
So if we draw out our orbitals,

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:46.548
let's just say this is the two s orbital,

00:11:46.548 --> 00:11:49.350
and then these are the
three two p orbitals.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.262
So we'll just do these electrons here.

00:11:51.262 --> 00:11:53.429
Two electrons in the two s orbital,

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:56.692
and then we have three
electrons in the p orbital.

00:11:56.692 --> 00:11:58.353
So let's draw those in there.

00:11:58.353 --> 00:12:02.778
If we try to add an electron
to a neutral nitrogen atom,

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:05.479
we're adding an electron
to one of these orbitals,

00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:08.019
which already has an electron in it.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:12.049
So adding an electron to one
of these orbitals, right,

00:12:12.049 --> 00:12:14.221
the added electron would be repelled

00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:16.895
by the electron that was
in there to start with.

00:12:16.895 --> 00:12:19.521
And this is the reason that
you usually see in textbooks

00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:22.054
for the fact that this
does not follow the trend.

00:12:22.054 --> 00:12:26.221
Nitrogen doesn't have an
affinity for one added electron.

00:12:27.283 --> 00:12:28.942
So after going through all of that,

00:12:28.942 --> 00:12:30.766
it's obvious that electron affinity

00:12:30.766 --> 00:12:34.062
is a little more complicated
than ionization energy.

00:12:34.062 --> 00:12:36.692
In ionization energy, we
had a pretty clear trend,

00:12:36.692 --> 00:12:39.274
and it was a little easier to explain why.

00:12:39.274 --> 00:12:42.297
For electron affinity,
going across a period

00:12:42.297 --> 00:12:45.631
on the periodic table, we
see a little bit of a trend,

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.572
but there are many exceptions to this,

00:12:47.572 --> 00:12:51.381
and perhaps our explanations
are a little bit too simplistic

00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:54.234
to explain actually what's going on.

00:12:54.234 --> 00:12:57.465
But across a period, you do
see a little bit of a trend.

00:12:57.465 --> 00:12:59.502
Going down a group is much harder.

00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:02.650
You see more inconsistencies,
and it's not really even worth

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.109
going over a general trend for that.
