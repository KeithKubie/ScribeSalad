00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.238
It's now time
for tonight's #HashtagWars.

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.206
(cheering)

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.777
Well...

00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:14.147
it is after midnight,
which means it is now officially

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.283
and technically Star Wars Day!

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.486
-(cheering, applause)
-And let me...

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.722
let me be
the first person on television

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:24.658
to say,
"May the Fourth be with you!"

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.493
Now, last year on Star Wars Day,

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:28.495
I met the famous
Mos Eisley cantina band,

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.163
Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes.

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:32.366
-(whooping) -Uh, I used
to be their lead singer

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.368
until I went solo. Hey-yo.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.370
Uh... we're gonna come up
with some jams

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.739
from a long time ago
in a galaxy far, far away

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.674
with tonight's hashtag
#StarWarsSongs.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.143
Examples might be:
"Wind Beneath My X-Wing,"

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.512
and "Get Out of My Dreams,
Get Into My Carbonite."

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.948
I'm gonna put 60 seconds
on the clock, and begin.

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.751
-Randy.
-"Yoda One That I Want."

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.052
-Points!
-(laughter, applause)

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.788
Oh, that's... fantastic.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.156
Points. Josh.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.092

HARDWICK:
Oh, goddamn it.

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.665
No points.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:06.733
-(laughter)
-I take that personally!

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.302
I've touched a lady.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:09.870
Uh... Randy.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:12.105
Uh, "Trap Queen Amidala"

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.576

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.244

Really Loved a Woman?"

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.183
(bleep)

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:24.618
Son of a bitch.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.120
I'll give you points,
but I don't like it. Randy.

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.156
"Obi-Wan Is
the Loneliest Number."

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.557

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.164
Kyle.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.966

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.768

-(laughter)

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:58.018
