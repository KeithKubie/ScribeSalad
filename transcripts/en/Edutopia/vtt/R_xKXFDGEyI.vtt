00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:02.776
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Guys, I know-- just
take a deep breath, you guys.

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.086
Just give us a few minutes, okay?

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.366
Justin, could you stop please?

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.856
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen..

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Having trouble
managing your classroom?

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.746
Here are some of our
favorite tricks of the trade.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.136
&gt;&gt;Filipe: Are you going to play?

00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:20.946
Okay.

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:25.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kindergarten teacher,
Filipe Lara, uses sign language

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:28.446
to answer individual questions
while maintaining focus

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:30.086
on the class lesson.

00:00:30.086 --> 00:00:31.506
&gt;&gt;Felipe: Well when
they ask me a question,

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:33.576
then I'll either answer
"Yes," or "No."

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:37.176
It helps me figure out--
it's less interruptive.

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:39.626
And then if I see a kid in
the back and I go like this

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:42.476
and he only sees me, then no one else
is going to ask me to have a drink

00:00:42.476 --> 00:00:43.956
of water or go to the bathroom

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:46.316
because they don't
know what he asked.

00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:48.276
So when they ask, it's
less interruptive,

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:50.666
and there's no break
in the instruction.

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.556
So that's-- all my kids know
to give me a sign language

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:57.166
when they have a question, or
if I'm working with an adult,

00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.446
or if they want water, or to go to
the bathroom, so that's what that is.

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.656
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Share one of your tricks
with fellow teachers on Edutopia.
