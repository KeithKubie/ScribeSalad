Monday morning podcast,
I'm going to do a little read here.

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,020
I know you're probably thinking,
dude, what the fuck is this?

5
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:19,210
This isn't how we normally stats it.
Well,

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,020
I didn't take a break during
the next interview, so I got,

7
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:26,200
I got to read this thing down now if I
can fucking find it, where the hell is it?

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,520
Yes, this is the most
unprofessional beginning of any

special edition of the Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,

40
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:33,440
Monday morning podcast and a, I
have a guest, a very special guest.

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,830
One of, uh, one of my, uh, I dunno,

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,830
just the biggest fan of this guy and
all the bands that he's played in just

43
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:42,320
going to get right to it.
It's got a brand new album out.

44
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,420
Mr Duff Mckagan how are you sir? Bill,
how are you? I'm doing great. You know,

45
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:52,100
I uh, got the email saying that you
wanted to be on here. I said, you know,

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,760
the tough had made a new
album, a solo album, you know,

47
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:58,100
when he wants to come on and promote it.
And I got to tell you,

48
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,850
you just came off that giant tour.
You're like,

49
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,620
I'm all tangled up in
the fucking wires here.

50
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,930
I told you this was going to
be a bare bones operation here.

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,620
How did you get the time? You
know, cause I, I'm such a uh,

52
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,320
a pussy where I go on the road for like
a week and I'm like whining to my wife

53
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,210
Linda. Good. I miss my kid and everything.

54
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:17,800
And I know you guys had
breaks and everything,

55
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,510
but he did two and a
half years on the road.

56
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,290
How do you come out of that and
be like, you know what, I'm,

57
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,770
I'm ready to a sit down and write
an album. You're not like fried.

58
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,410
Well, um, I think, well that's
two questions and I do that a lot.

59
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,880
Yes. And so, so the, the being
able to tour, like, I mean,

60
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,160
I saw some tours when I was a kid.

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,210
I saw the clash before London
calling and I saw this like,

62
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,200
I mean they were as exotic
as led Zeppelin were,

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,750
but they were one of us.
Right.

64
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,660
And they made that known.

65
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,900
Like there's no difference
between the crowd and the band.

66
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,870
We're all in this together.
That was an early influence.

67
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,320
And then seeing Henry
Rollins like get prepared.

68
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,260
My first Gig ever was
opening for black flag books.

69
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,250
Ron raise of a singer to
singers before at Rollins. Okay.

70
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,530
So when Rawlins probably came into
black flag, there was a lot of talk.

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,920
You got to step up. That's a big
position to be the singer black flag.

72
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,290
And my band, again, there
was a different band,

73
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:24,870
but we opened for black flag when Henry
came in for like five shows. Right.

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,250
And seeing this guy, he was super
intense. He's still pretty intense guy,

75
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,700
but this is,

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,720
I mean I'm like 17 years old and he's
just has gym shorts on and you know,

77
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,670
and he,
he's pacing this is that sound check?

78
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,580
Yeah, I've seen him do standup
comedy and he just, he just like,

79
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,390
they introduced so many, just like 45
degree angle right out to the Mike.

80
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,900
Stan takes the mic out and wraps the
cord around. His arm was like, all right,

81
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,070
this guy's keys going in.

82
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,951
That's what,

83
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:56,720
so seeing that like preparation he
did for a show that kind of like,

84
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,290
that was at the state of my head.

85
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:03,290
And I though it was a couple of things
that made me decide to be a lifer.

86
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,140
Right. You don't have a choice
in this anymore. Like what,

87
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,940
how did you start playing music? I don't
know. I didn't have a choice. Right.

88
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,810
It's just, and then, you know,

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,580
so touring all these years now turning,
I'm 55,

90
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,660
you know, like you have to really like,
do you have to train like an athlete,

91
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,410
you have to like do all those things.
You have to pace your days and,

92
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,350
and uh, our shows are not
short in our shows. Yeah. Um,

93
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,120
so three and a half hours of, and you've
seen the size of our stage is this,

94
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,960
you know, so you're probably running five
miles a night with a base on, you know,

95
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,180
um, but to, to get to the, to
the writing of the songs thing.

96
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,200
I was in a position,
you know,

97
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,430
one that I didn't realize how much was
missing in my life until we kind of the

98
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,434
three of

99
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,530
excellent slash myself talked some
stuff out and we decided like,

100
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,810
let's, we were offered to Coachella,
let's, okay. I mean, we could do this,

101
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,200
you know, nobody else knows
about it except us three.

102
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,830
And we talked about all these kinds of
things that were hanging there in the air

103
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,590
for years. And, and we,

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,340
the way we approached it with our
kind of chess out and heads up and,

105
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,240
and with honesty and,
and a rigor, you know,

106
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:29,720
and it was so cleansing and going
out and touring and then like,

107
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,820
well we can go keep,
we can keep going,

108
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,510
we can do all of North America and
we can keep going. And I had this,

109
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,060
you know, right. I think at that time.
But when we're rehearsing for that,

110
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,410
that we rehearsed for three months for
that tour and we were like six hours a

111
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:46,244
day,
you know.

112
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,050
Um, how were you guys the first time you,
you, the first time you counted it off,

113
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,050
you hadn't played together in that long,
did it come right back?

114
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:55,220
Was the like riding a bike?

115
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,580
I didn't just go into rehearsal.
I'm going to spend a month in my,

116
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,100
my basement, you know, that's so cool.

117
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:06,030
So you actually went back and listened
to all your own stuff first time probably

118
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:10,740
ever like, okay. You know? Yeah. I
did the pre work and I know slack,

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,460
we all did the pre award. The young, you
stumped the older you will a few times.

120
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:17,250
Like what the hell was this?
No, I mean it's all in my bones.

121
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:20,100
It's all muscle memory of course.
Played a bunch of

122
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,290
these songs in other bands and whatever.
So it wasn't too far out.

123
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,190
But there was some stuff like a strange,
I hadn't, hadn't played coma, you know,

124
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:31,970
like, oh wow. Yeah. What will you know,

125
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,100
what kind of drugs were
we doing to the right?

126
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,630
Oh my. Yeah, I know. But also
that weird thing where you've,

127
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:39,510
I've played this song around the world
and I don't remember how it goes.

128
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:43,170
That's gotta be crazy. [inaudible]
and it is in your, you know,

129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,890
you play and once you play you play.
Yeah.

130
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,130
But once you play on drums,

131
00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:53,390
a song a few times, it's,
it's going to be there where,

132
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,400
you know, your, your body
remembers it. So, um,

133
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,120
but I had this,
I went during the rehearsals,

134
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:05,470
I got sucked into that things. I
think we all did. I was watching,

135
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,390
like it started very simply,
a friend of Susan Nights,

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,380
the guy who actually set us up on a blind
date, he used to write for Thrasher,

137
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:19,030
he got into politics,
became campaign managers for people.

138
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:20,710
Um,

139
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,600
and with John K six campaign
manager for that presidential bit.

140
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,430
And he, he like texted me, he goes,
Hey, watch my guy John Casick.

141
00:08:30,431 --> 00:08:33,640
There was that first debate
of like 12 republican

142
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,060
nominees or wherever the guys who were
running and people were that were running.

143
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,380
And I watched John Kay sick.

144
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,320
Am I going to say real centrus
he's done a lot pro Ohio.

145
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:46,060
And cause I had a backstory.

146
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,720
So I'm watching him and I see this kind
of screaming and shouting and stuff

147
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:52,180
going down and because this is a mass,

148
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:57,150
but it got me into the news and I
started watching all news and it's fun.

149
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,990
You know, I started following
people on my Twitter, my Twitter.

150
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:05,880
I originally got to follow the Seattle
Seahawks. The mariners are awful.

151
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:09,840
They are. And like a few of
like people that I, you know,

152
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,920
respect comedians or rock guys.
Um,

153
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,840
but I started following all these
other things that just don't do it. Um,

154
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,420
and I went down a rabbit hole and I'm
smart enough. I read enough history. I,

155
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,520
it's all like done since I was sober
and sober for 25 years. It's just,

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,560
I read history.
I'm a total book nerd and some Watson,

157
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,453
this news are,
they,

158
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,520
they're Britain start bringing on panels
that are all yelling over each other.

159
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,150
I'm like,

160
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,320
this is an interesting way to keep
people that they know what they're doing.

161
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,960
They're polling like they're watchers,
you know,

162
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,620
this must be working because they're
in the business of selling ads.

163
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,783
I'm smart enough,

164
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,470
but I'm still down the rabbit hole and
I'm looking at my Twitter and wake up in

165
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:53,460
the morning and looking at,

166
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,670
go to the news first thing in the morning
and I get wrapped up in this whole

167
00:09:56,671 --> 00:10:01,290
thing to divide. There's sort of
divide out there. Wow. I mean,

168
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,560
I've been traveling this
country for a long time, man.

169
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,520
I didn't know it was there where,
where if I bet isn't in a way.

170
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,440
Okay.
So,

171
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,560
so it isn't, it's, it's you watching it
on TV and it gets, that's why I stopped.

172
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,600
Nothing that was ever
the most informed guy,

173
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:19,270
but I stopped watching it when it just,

174
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:21,580
the way they were spinning it
and then it was just, he came up.

175
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:25,030
The same reason why I don't watch those
real housewives shows is I don't want to

176
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:27,250
watch or listen to a bunch of people
screaming and yelling at each other.

177
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,580
I grew up with that and you start,

178
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,870
it's if it affects like my mood and then
I also think it's all bullshit anyway,

179
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:37,150
so I, I don't watch it.
So you went to, I'm sorry,

180
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,740
you went down that
rabbit hole you started.

181
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,470
Yeah, I remember I went down the
rabbit hole. I mean, I, and I knew,

182
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,000
I knew I was going down a rabbit
hole and I, and uh, so the, uh,

183
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,590
one point in rehearsal,

184
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:52,670
like we would talk about rehearsal
one point I just right before,

185
00:10:52,671 --> 00:10:57,671
right when we started playing Coachella
and then we went to Mexico City and then

186
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:02,360
we went, came back to the STA. I
turned off the news before all that.

187
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,490
I just stopped,
just stopped.

188
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,550
I stopped having Yahoo is my home screen
cause I used to be because you get to

189
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:14,540
sports pretty quick. That's
the only reason. Yeah. Y'All
who was just filling up,

190
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,320
you know, the important stuff,
the important stuff. Um,

191
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,880
I muted everything on my Twitter except
for the Seahawks and the mariners.

192
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,590
And I've done this for the last,
since again, since I've been sober,

193
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,250
I read about all this history and
I go to the places I read about.

194
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,430
So I'll plan and this is a stadium tour.

195
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:39,431
So we have kind of a day and a half off
and every city or you have travel days

196
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,750
in Boston. So I would plan my
travel and my bus like, okay,

197
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,320
DC to Atlanta.
What's in between Monticello,

198
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,100
let's go then get the
bus driver a room there.

199
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:56,620
I'm going to Mazzella a little big horn
that's between Minneapolis and Denver.

200
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,590
Uh,
world war one museum is a Kansas City.

201
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,240
I want to go on the air boat with the
guy in Louisiana and see alligators.

202
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:07,720
I do this stuff every day off.

203
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,770
And what happens when you do these things,
these activities,

204
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,790
you've talked to people.

205
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,900
And oftentimes I go to Monticello
between DC and Atlanta guns.

206
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,020
[inaudible] roses was playing nowhere
near there. So I can go in undetected,

207
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,570
I can go to a little big horn can.
People just are not expecting, you know,

208
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,670
a few people go, Whoa, duff, you know,

209
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,200
but it's not like I kind of tried to
not go to the places in the cities I'm

210
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:38,980
playing if I can help it sometimes.
Like when I saw you in Paris,

211
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,820
I just came from Normandy.
I did a whole thing.

212
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,060
Dda. How crazy is that? Yeah.
I went down there the, uh,

213
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,720
the next day,
uh,

214
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,570
in the morning I drove a van down because
that's all they've rented us as this

215
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,020
big stupid van. And I went down there and
I got lost. Oh, you did? But I didn't,

216
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,870
but I made it there. I made it. That
just couldn't get back to my hotel.

217
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,270
I couldn't find it because you
just walk the beaches of yourself.

218
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,220
I went and I smoked a cigar,
sat on the Bay beach in the morning and I,

219
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,900
I couldn't believe how moving it was.
Yeah.

220
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,660
And we took this incredible tour with
this piece with the creators. Yeah.

221
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:13,000
And that, and the guy, uh, um,

222
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,330
looks guy from Scotland and he took us
all into, but he did it all the papers.

223
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,121
Yeah.
Yeah.

224
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:23,020
And they had this bunker where I guess
Hitler had gotten gassed or something or

225
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,480
saw people get gassed in the, uh,
in World War One. Like when they,

226
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,920
when before they, that whole,
let's not try it, you know,

227
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:31,540
the poisonous gas shoot at people.

228
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,740
So he had showers installed in case,
you know,

229
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,350
any of the troops got,
you know, if they use gas.

230
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,090
So that was the weirdest
thing was just like, Oh wow,

231
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:41,830
that guy actually cared about something.

232
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,450
Right. I want to, I don't think I saw
that kind of rang a bell with you.

233
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,420
It was one of the German bunkers and
then was like, right as you walked in,

234
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,830
there was a little like a shower
thing that like, I guess if,

235
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,240
if whatever they spray you, if
you hosed it off you, I mean,

236
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:58,060
it's pretty ironic that he was
concerned about that. Consider, yeah,

237
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,820
no, I could see that, that, that, that
like, oh, oh yeah, actually, okay.

238
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,990
He was looking out for somebody other
than himself. Yeah, sorry. Anyways,

239
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,480
um, but I, I'm going to all these places
and I'm talking to people and, um,

240
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,780
you know, thinking there's
this big divide and you know,

241
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,240
red states and blue states and, you
know, make a joke out of this bite,

242
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,040
travel from state to state and I
don't notice a red one or a blue.

243
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,140
It's all the same.
And it was,

244
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,900
it's been the same since
I've been traveling since
the 80 [inaudible] punk rock

245
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:32,160
bands 82 and 83 throughout
all of this traveling,

246
00:14:32,161 --> 00:14:35,010
I've traveled the whole
time and, um, raised,

247
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,360
we've raised our daughters who are now
1821 to be world citizens because that's

248
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:43,120
what we all fucking are.
You know, let's face it. Um,

249
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,120
I'm an American and proud American.

250
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,420
I make no bones about that.
I'm,

251
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,090
I'm super proud to be American. My
Dad fought world war two, you know,

252
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:56,240
my parents grew up in the depression,
but two of my brothers are in Vietnam.

253
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,760
We went to this amazing, uh,
I've got seven siblings. I mean,

254
00:15:01,761 --> 00:15:05,180
the variety in our family is stunning,
you know,

255
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:09,200
and the things that I got to see because
I had this super cool mom, you know,

256
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:13,580
Martin Luther King March when he died
and all of these kind of epic things that

257
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:15,080
I wish I was older when I did.
Um,

258
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,400
but I'm traveling to America at first
and talking to people, I'm like, oh,

259
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,730
this to buy, oh, it's another selling
tool for the news. And it's politics.

260
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,220
Dude.
You read enough to know better,

261
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,780
like he fell down as stupid rat
like the guy and you know Louisiana,

262
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:36,890
you know once people you would
think where are the other, you know,

263
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,140
I mean he was alligators
like marshmallows. Who Knew?
Right then he, you know,

264
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,390
one thing he commented,

265
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,700
he's been doing it for 45 years and it
goes to the marshes are disappearing.

266
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,893
But what do you mean?

267
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,910
Because they are disappearing at an l
like I used to be able to go through this

268
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,750
channel right here. We can't, as you
see, we got to turn around and go in.

269
00:15:56,751 --> 00:16:00,710
Our whole trip was this like
circumnavigating old paths.

270
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,390
He used to go and he goes,

271
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:07,391
it's like 900 cubic yards
per 30 minutes or something.

272
00:16:07,731 --> 00:16:11,840
Like some, he gave me some stat. So
you find out more about your country.

273
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,170
And I what I found out that
the thing that being, you know,

274
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,220
getting back together with the band and
those guys and that's kind of talking

275
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,180
through things and getting on this back
to this place where we're friends and

276
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,140
we're able to go out like seriously
kick some ass and be like,

277
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,590
we never phone it in man.

278
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,870
It's back to that real thing and that
brotherhood and it gave me like this

279
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:36,860
intellectual sobriety or whatever
clarity to go out and just,

280
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,220
I was relaxed and able to talk to
people and put things together.

281
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,470
And I started writing while you out
on the road. Yeah, I started writing.

282
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,450
I thought maybe I was gonna write a book,

283
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,960
but I was reading hillbilly elegy
by JD bands where I was out there.

284
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,020
I read Sarah Canto whores
viewed from the fiber country,

285
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:58,550
read some book and I thought, is there
great books everybody should read them?

286
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,230
And I thought, well, should I put
another book out of like my observations?

287
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,090
Is that too much information?
Too many observations. And, uh,

288
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,120
I've wanted to do like a
really as a sidebar to this.

289
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:17,410
I've, for the last 20 something
years, I've wanted to do a record.

290
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,500
It's really toned down like Mark Atlantic
and Johnny thunders acoustic type of

291
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:27,400
record and I just didn't
really have the time or the,

292
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,323
the,

293
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,510
the intent to do as a
record like that I guess.

294
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,560
And I was writing all of these words
like chapter beginnings basically.

295
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,760
And uh, I carry acoustic guitar
on the road with me always.

296
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,140
And in a rare moment that I was in a
hotel room, I was looking at my computer,

297
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,270
it's just like, you have
yours out. I had my computer,

298
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,950
my guitar in my lap and I'm
strong strumming e major in, uh,

299
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,300
in a B minor seven chord.

300
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:01,230
And I was reading the words
too. Uh, it's not too light.

301
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,410
Will turn out the song. Everybody's
lying. Yeah, I need some truth.

302
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,720
Everybody is trying to push
you to the abuse. Um, and uh,

303
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,380
the whole idea of like,

304
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:15,710
maybe I'll make that that austere
record now and get these ideas across.

305
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,110
Well, I've got to tell you, you
said a lot of things that IB,

306
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,750
the like heard people that have respect
say like on this album, you know,

307
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,490
you've kind of talking about everything.
Uh, first of all, the sound of it, Kevin,

308
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,590
if I already said this to you
or if I said this down on the,

309
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:36,220
on the podcast or I sit in the driveway
as you came up, but like first of all,

310
00:18:36,221 --> 00:18:38,870
the sound of it is, is complete
departure from anything that hurts,

311
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,330
heard you do in a great way.

312
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,900
It's a record that I kind of felt like
I wanted to go for a drive when I was

313
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:48,490
listening to it and it
reminded me of like, um,

314
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,040
it's Kinda got that timeless vibe to it,

315
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,020
which is what I like and
what you're talking about.

316
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,300
He talking about everything about
the drug epidemic, homelessness. Um,

317
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,840
there's that great line in there where
you say a go for a walk and find my

318
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,460
better man or something like that,

319
00:19:03,461 --> 00:19:06,400
which is literally something I've been
doing just trying to deal with. Uh,

320
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:11,200
you know, the big demon in my family
tree is like rage issues, you know,

321
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,910
and just how that way yeah.
Wears on people. Yeah.

322
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,260
It just wears on people and Shit. So, um,

323
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,910
I I just threw one,
listen to this really connected.

324
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,650
Yeah.

325
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,810
With this stuff and it's,

326
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,820
it's kind of the stuff that I've
been kind of saying as far as like,

327
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,570
they're sitting there going after you
for Caitlyn Jenner joke and meanwhile

328
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,400
you're out there talking to some guy
who's trying to go through a marsh and

329
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,920
you're saying to 900 something yards,

330
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:38,980
square footage or whatever
is disappearing every day.

331
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,400
And every once in awhile you'll see some
anorexic looking polar bear and you're

332
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:44,740
like,
I think this is the priority.

333
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,300
And they got everybody screaming and
yelling at each other about just complete

334
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,940
nonsense. And then when you go on the
road, red state, blue state, this country,

335
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:58,660
that country, I just find everybody
who's just walking around, you know,

336
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,900
they're cool. They want to make sure
they have enough money for food,

337
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,110
they want to find love. It's
really basic. It's pretty basic.

338
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,500
But then you put it on TV, it's
like, ah, everybody's just screaming,

339
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,480
acting like the world is ending
because of these other fucking issues.

340
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,400
And it's like, no, this is the real shit
that's happening over here. And I don't,

341
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,110
I don't know.
It's that I,

342
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:25,330
I call it the support the
troops like Zombie mode.

343
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:29,710
They got everybody in, which I just love
that expression, support the troops.

344
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:33,670
Like why wouldn't you, you know, so
it's like, do you support the troops?

345
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:36,460
There's only one answer. Yes.
That's like, there you go.

346
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,850
But it's almost like a bill where there's
all this other shit attached to it.

347
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:43,330
And then that supporting
troops makes it like,

348
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:46,990
you can't question where you send them,
how long they're there, how they're,

349
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,640
when they come back, who's making
money, reasons why you go over there.

350
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,240
And the second I found once
that kind of took hold,

351
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,490
any sort of intelligence discussion went
from just support the troops America.

352
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,340
And if you said anything in the other
way, it's like, oh, you're a socialist.

353
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,480
Get the fuck Outta here.

354
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,160
His is a, is the truth of, of that, um,

355
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,940
presidents, kings, Queens,

356
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,710
warm makers have never made a
chase that's impacted our lives.

357
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,020
The people that make the
change to the good art are us.

358
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,270
Right.
Um,

359
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,040
my friend,

360
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,920
what do you think about cause World War
Two seems like there was definitely,

361
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,660
you know,
obviously that had to happen.

362
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:34,350
I mean if they were going
fucking what I'll be going down.

363
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:35,550
I mean it had to be stopped.

364
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:38,790
So it's at some point like I'm not
saying all war is bad. Do you feel,

365
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:39,590
do you feel that?

366
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,550
Well I, I was getting to a point
actually was like support our troops.

367
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,110
Like a friend of mine in US helping
each other instead of like the slogan

368
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:51,340
support your troops. You know that my
friend is a mountain climber who's a guys,

369
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:56,370
it was this biker guy got a really
bad accident back is in a cage.

370
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:59,770
Just put, they're going to chop it
up and he decides to climb Everest.

371
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,620
And he goes through this hell and,
and as personal Holly gets to Everest,

372
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,560
climbs it,
and he's coming back for whatever estate,

373
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,610
gets on a plane from India to Germany to
Manheim than any kid gets on the plane,

374
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,940
just came back from Afghanistan.
It got his leg blown off,

375
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:19,720
went to Walter Reed and in Madison,
you know,

376
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,320
and my buddy Tim says, this guy's
kids there at the airport together.

377
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,700
He's talking to the guy, he's got
a, uh, you know, kind of, uh, uh,

378
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,820
temporary prosthetic leg
and Tim's talking to him.

379
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,500
He's got a cage around his back.
My buddy Tim and his foots hanging on,

380
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,910
you know, by like just some clue and
stuff. And he's talking to this kid,

381
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,850
this pattern, marine kid,
this kid, 21 years old thing.
When you meet him there, kid,

382
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:48,010
he's like, what are you going
to do? Is like, I, I don't,

383
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,360
maybe I sit on my mom's couch and either
I don't know what to do. You know?

384
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:57,220
So Tim's like, you want to climb a
mountain? And he started one guy,

385
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:02,221
but one guy and he got a bunch of us
involved and we help train these guys.

386
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,360
You know what I'd done?

387
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,720
My friend Tim now has got better veterans
up all seven highest mountains in the

388
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:14,860
world.
Legless armless one guy missing two legs.

389
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,250
They did Kilimanjaro,
two legs missing.

390
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,510
So he had these little climbing
prosthetics for Tim's figured it all out.

391
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,403
Like how,

392
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:29,130
and it created this whole now network of
these guys who find those hopeless guys

393
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,530
who just gotten back right now
and they get them into this,

394
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,840
this climbing club.
I call it a gang.

395
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,560
Uh, but you know, that's
how you support your troops.

396
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:45,440
You follow the lead of a friend,
uh, like a guy like my friend Tim.

397
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,690
Oh, you mean you shouldn't just say that
on Twitter and on, you're done. Like,

398
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,670
so I hear all this. You hear on the
news a little American flag Emoji

399
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,270
and then you've done your part
of it puts perspective on the,

400
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,350
like the social media side of,
you know, help our or our trips.

401
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:05,210
Like Tim's just doing it like a ton
of people. This is in Hollywood,

402
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:05,450
you know,

403
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,160
people are jumping in and helping and
doing raising money and do these climbs

404
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:14,030
aren't cheap and, and come in and
help train these guys. And that's,

405
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,250
that's how you do it.
And that's the America I know,

406
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:20,780
not the one I see on the news,
not the one I see on social media.

407
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:21,700
You know.

408
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,480
What do you think I remember like
when I first like hung out with you,

409
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:26,314
hung out with you.

410
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,010
Uh,

411
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,720
two things that blew me away. One, you
tell a great street joke. Yeah, you too.

412
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,990
And uh, you already, you had me
laughing in the setup because they,

413
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:36,940
maybe it was something,

414
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,260
some joke when some guy went
to a hotel and then you just,

415
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,800
I could see off the top of you head and
you decided to pick a hotel and you said

416
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:46,010
it was this hotel and you described
the architecture is as an aside,

417
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:50,960
you already had me laughing.
And then secondly, we were
somehow talking about, um,

418
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:53,910
uh,

419
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,630
all that, the high end fashion that
women were into. Do you remember that?

420
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:01,050
And I was just like, I remember as a kid,
like I had never heard of Louis Vuitton.

421
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,390
If you wanted to get it,

422
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,870
you gotta be at a total fashion nerd and
you don't have to go to like New York

423
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:11,430
City, like, uh, fifth avenue, I would
think. Or maybe had to go to Paris.

424
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:14,370
I had no idea. Seattle, they
probably didn't have any of them. No.

425
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,350
And now it's like I was doing some,

426
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,790
tore through the deep south and I was
in somewhere Alabama and they had a

427
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:25,350
fucking mall and there was the same
bags that you saw like in Paris.

428
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:29,640
And I was like, I'm just, I know
you're smart with money and shit.

429
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:32,460
It's just like people,
just regular people going out and buying,

430
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:34,130
like spending money on bags like that.

431
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,230
It was sex in the city and made that
change, dude. Yeah, do a theory.

432
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:42,030
But when that came on and my
wife's watching all their friends,

433
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,720
they're talking about shoes like Manolo
Blahniks. I'm like, what is that?

434
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,320
Their shoes,
Jimmy child's shoes and bags and stuff.

435
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,610
And that's when that whole
culture changed for American,

436
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,380
like purchasing. Uh, yeah cause you think

437
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,130
you will kills me is I spent like,
I always joke, I spent like 15,

438
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:03,680
20 years in the back of the plane Sunday.
By the way,

439
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm going to buy a fucking headphone
cord long enough that okay,

440
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,620
they got to chances for that. Bill Berg
got a guitar soon. Just get her Stacy.

441
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,740
I know. Probably Radio Shack other
than they don't have that anymore.

442
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,070
I know. I I they used to have one
right down the street and I didn't,

443
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:18,900
I didn't go but um,

444
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,300
okay.

445
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,060
Uh, I literally just fell out with
saying we were talking about the,

446
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:27,090
did I tell you what, when my friend
though I live down the street from me,

447
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,283
him and his wife,

448
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,550
they live in the apartment and he's
become really good friends with his next

449
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:35,430
door neighbor guy lists by himself.
[inaudible] guys. They'd been friends,

450
00:26:35,431 --> 00:26:37,500
really good friends with the
past like year and a half.

451
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,090
And my friend with his wife,
he was watching TV last
night and it's living room,

452
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,550
gets a text from its next door neighbor.
Hey Man, I, um, I'm really sorry.

453
00:26:48,551 --> 00:26:49,800
I got to be honest.
I've been,

454
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,010
I've been banging your wife for the
last few months, but it, but it's over.

455
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:57,840
I've stopped. So my friend put down
his phone, he went in the other room,

456
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:02,760
got a gun and shot his wife and it
came back and sat down and sofas. Like,

457
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:07,020
what did I just do? My God.
And there's phone buzzes again.

458
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,770
It's this his friend next door and like,
oh, sorry, I met Wifi. Got them autos

459
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,770
that was going to go, you can
cut that out if you want. No,

460
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,490
come on man.
You've listened to me play drums.

461
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:26,520
I can listen to you tell
a fucking joke. Um, but I,

462
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:31,090
that's what struck me when I met you.
I was like, this guy like that remind,

463
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:33,910
that's like something a comedian does,
like looks at something and just how you,

464
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:38,310
you put it together in like,
uh, like, uh, with music.

465
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,090
But like I even when you were saying that
to me, I was, I was actually thinking,

466
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:46,650
fuck, why didn't I think of that?
Because that would be a killer bit.

467
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,250
And because it always be,
like I was saying, oh, now
I remember, I thought I was,

468
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,510
I spent like 15 years in the back of the
plane. Yes. Working my way up, you know,

469
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:58,120
I always say the blast row then trying
to get the exit row poor man's first

470
00:27:58,121 --> 00:28:03,060
class. Right. That's actually
sometimes can be better. Better. Yeah.

471
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,750
And then getting finally
getting up to the front. Um,

472
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,620
so now I get them to pass the front. It
was like, whoa. Yeah, these people are,

473
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:14,040
these people do. Yeah. And they'd be
on the phone or they'd be writing shit.

474
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:18,960
They own banks and stuff. Yeah. And, and
for Y'alls, you still riding in the back.

475
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:22,380
All they do in the front of the plane
is just treat you like a human being to

476
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,670
give you.
That's all it is.

477
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:26,250
They just give you a seat that
actually fits a human being.

478
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,390
They'll come by frequently and ask if
you want water or food as opposed to jam

479
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,720
and you in the back. So
what has struck me over, uh,

480
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,580
is the amount of people that I've
seen that will come on the plane,

481
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,590
you know, and you just, you know,
a comedian, I just, you know,

482
00:28:40,591 --> 00:28:42,650
I'm always like looking at people and
stuff and I'll see something come up with

483
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:45,280
a Louis Vuitton bag. I'm like, oh this
person is probably sitting next to me.

484
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,810
And you'd watch them go into the back
of the plane and you just start thinking

485
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:53,760
of like priorities.
Like as far as like,

486
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:56,130
I guess the bag maybe that is worth more,
you could sell it.

487
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:57,990
I'm just thinking like why the fuck,

488
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,930
it's like the person who buys the flashy
car before they buy a house and they're

489
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:02,880
still like renting.

490
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,300
And I think that like beyond the sense
sex in the city that now the whole like

491
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:14,610
social media where everybody is,
is they're doing their own,

492
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:18,270
like almost like new cycles. Spin
that of, of the, I'm crushing it.

493
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,110
You hold the camera up,
see look like 30% better looking.

494
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:26,130
You got all this money and you just
live in and all you're doing is you're

495
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:30,570
taking snapshots of the coolest
parts of your month. Yeah.

496
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,890
Not the one where you're fucking
crying during a breakup or a,

497
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,650
you lost your job.
None of that shit is on there.

498
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:42,220
So it just kind of makes you
feel like everybody is leaving

499
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,030
you behind and that you need
all of this stuff. And um,

500
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,110
I think we're still learning how like,
it's funny because again,

501
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,210
back to my girls,
18 and 21 so we had to,

502
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:58,810
you're raising a kid, right? And I'm a
rookie here, two and a half years. Okay.

503
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:02,590
So our kids got to,
let's say seven and 10.

504
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:06,430
That's when social media was
just starting to like be a thing.

505
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:12,030
And so now you've got to raise your kids
through this social media thing too.

506
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,600
How did you do that by the way?

507
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,860
We had to figure it out and
crushing blows, you know,

508
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:21,300
just school kind of like bully,
like, uh, you know, social media,

509
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:25,510
bullying from school, like, okay girls,
you know, it's not real. It's just like,

510
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,070
they would never say that to your
face. So you've gotta and then, but,

511
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,420
but I lost you there.

512
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,500
So they would be getting bullied on
social media from somebody at school,

513
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,900
like a different group of girls or
something, you know? And so you have to,

514
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:43,840
you know, the girls are crying or
something will happen like that. Right.

515
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:47,650
And you have to talk to them. Like, would
they ever said that to your face? No.

516
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,450
Okay. So you've got to look at this as
like kind of, uh, uh, pussies, way out,

517
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,020
you know, so how does that work? The
next day at school? It's like they said,

518
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,730
I'll let shit, you don't
confront them. Like,

519
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,540
I don't know how it works with kids
today. Yeah, you'll, you'll figure it out.

520
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,230
But I think what's happened, like it
started off with the bowling and then,

521
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,110
and then these kids became smarter.

522
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,980
They're also aware of what's going
on outside as well. You know,

523
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:16,270
they know the school shootings
way more real to them than,

524
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:20,320
than us because it's happening and could
happen at school to that. Right, right.

525
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,500
Um, they're aware of things more
visceral. They're there, they're in it.

526
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,220
They're social media
geniuses more than us.

527
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:35,190
We follow dumb shit and like, you
know, you can't say that they're,

528
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,280
they, it's been part of them. So now
they're, there's weeding it out there,

529
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:43,480
weeding it out, and now they're starting
to take the pass way more than we can,

530
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,010
the way smarter on social
media than we are. And uh,

531
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,970
like the insta life, the Instagram
life, you know, pies seam,

532
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
that's more like 25 and above the
pupil that Instagram life is fabulous.

533
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:02,830
Right. You know, the kids younger,
this is my observation, right.

534
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,000
Take it for what you will.

535
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,350
Now I'm listening to this because it's
something that worries me because I think

536
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,710
now like my daughters and their friends,
boys and girls,

537
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,640
like we know all of their friends very
well. We were like the house sets.

538
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,560
It's cool to come hang out and let
some really astounding kids and,

539
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,890
and uh, they're taking the
pass right now and they're,

540
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:29,060
they're kind of sitting there silently.
She see Emma Gonzales ever speak up.

541
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,860
The parkland,

542
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,860
like those kids who spoke like through
this thing and then we're smarter than

543
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:38,500
you, you know, that is kind of this
new generation that's coming up.

544
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,490
It's just Imogen's Alice and the Parkland
kids who kind of stood up and said,

545
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,560
okay, hold on a second. Right. We do have
something to say and here it goes, right?

546
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,850
Uh, blown away by their
intellect in like, okay,

547
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,380
if everybody's as smart as that
18 we're in good hands and it,

548
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,370
the kids I observe or are just like that
and they're just kind of waiting like

549
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,160
they have now 18 they can vote.

550
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:05,883
[inaudible]

551
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,700
um, what are you guys going to do
with that we're going to take over?

552
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,660
No, that's the answer I get.
Every generation think that my,

553
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,290
my problem is I feel like there like a,

554
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,283
okay.

555
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,420
Like their hands are like bound,
you know what I mean?

556
00:33:20,421 --> 00:33:24,380
By the time you get to a certain
level as a politician, like

557
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,250
th th th th the way the money is set
up. Like they are there already. All,

558
00:33:29,251 --> 00:33:31,840
all of these people's favors and just the,
I don't want to get,

559
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:35,340
I also don't get why, where it's like,
Hey, do you want cleaner drinking water?

560
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:37,650
And everybody goes yes.
And then they,

561
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,660
they get to attach all of this other shit
to it. I don't know. I don't understand.

562
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:43,411
Well,
why can't,

563
00:33:43,411 --> 00:33:46,770
the thing that we're saying yes to
just be the thing that you're doing,

564
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,810
because I think we have to do it, not
the politics. It's always been that way.

565
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,060
We have to do it like my friend Tim,
and it is mount climbing things. We have

566
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,970
to do it. Yeah, that makes sense
to me. But being able to let go,

567
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,870
so if they're saying they're gonna
take over by doing shit like that,

568
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,060
if there's anybody young listening,

569
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,800
that's the only way I
think to make change is,

570
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:12,570
uh, is you have to start it and
do it at a, at a small level.

571
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,940
But if you,
like I remember when Trump,

572
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:17,130
we became president and he
said something like, you know,

573
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,890
I'm going to come in here and
I'm going to drain the swamp.

574
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,010
And I just laughed when I heard that.
It's like,

575
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:26,040
and what do you think they're going to
do? Just sit there and be like, well,

576
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,450
I guess he got us.
It's like,

577
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,320
no one's going to work with you if you're
saying you're going to go in here and

578
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:35,460
you're, you're gonna, you're gonna expose
all, uh, like political corruption.

579
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,380
Um, like at that level,
it's just so walled off. Um,

580
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,061
I dunno,

581
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:46,410
I just Kinda got back from Europe and I
just felt a weird vibe when I was over

582
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:48,990
there and I, I forget what
country I was in. I was just like,

583
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,600
are you guys going to
start this shit up again?

584
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,950
And it kind of got a weird laugh and
then something in the back when, yeah,

585
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,830
like just the vibe over there was,

586
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,060
it's not the place I went to for the
first time 10 years ago or now it's just

587
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:07,650
becoming like, uh, like look at like
fucking Paris and mean Jesus Christ.

588
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:11,610
It's like, that's a fucking, it's like
a mosh pit over there every other day.

589
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,720
Like something crazy like a,

590
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,910
the yellow vest protestors.
Yeah,

591
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,720
that and then wage thing.

592
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,230
And when I went to Sweden there was these
other people protesting and I was just

593
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:22,280
like,
what's going on here?

594
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:24,650
And I talked to a couple people over
there who are Muslim and they just like,

595
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:28,670
yeah, racism is kind of like a, it's
not the way it is in the United States.

596
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:30,380
We have like such a long history of it.

597
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:35,330
So people really like overt with it over
here and just, and I don't know. Yeah, I,

598
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:36,830
I don't want to like tell you what,

599
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,430
what I saw cause your album I thought
is really positive and I don't want,

600
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,890
I want to put my awful world view into it,

601
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,880
but I kind of came away from it with
the positive of just like, look,

602
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,410
I'm just going to try
to be a better person.

603
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,490
Try to be cool with the people that are
in my life and just try not to be a dick

604
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,980
because other than that,
this stuff is so big and overwhelming.

605
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,070
I mean, I think what you just said
it, that's the answer. You know,

606
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:04,100
I too have traveled to European countries
that I've gone to says shit man,

607
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:07,270
before the wall went down,
you know,

608
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,760
many years before the wall and then the
wall going down. And then, you know,

609
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:16,160
opening up of a tech Czechoslovakia
became the Czech Republic. And,

610
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:21,250
and seeing like all of this that I
remember part Perestroika and you know,

611
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,050
the opening up of USSR and,

612
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:29,051
and after that glass nose and Perestroika
and then the wall going down and then

613
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,640
seeing those countries themselves,
chase Italy and republic and what's, Oh,

614
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,430
what's going on here now?
You guys were,

615
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,480
we're super stoked and now there's kind
of another vibe going on instead of the

616
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,090
five.
Talk to people.

617
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,130
Why does that always happen?

618
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:49,680
Um, there's, I think, you
know, I read so much history,

619
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:52,830
so there's cycles, man. Like,
and, and we've gone through,

620
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,720
we're going through a cycle right now.
There's

621
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:03,060
what I've learned from reading so much
history is, again, man, the politicians,

622
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,440
American politicians, European
politicians, they don't chase.

623
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:09,870
They run to get into the office.
And that you're right,

624
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,810
there's so many favors to be repaid
and that point and that, you know,

625
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,020
man of the people are a woman
of the people. That ship
has sailed by that point.

626
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,000
Um, and it's always been like the people
that made a change. There have been

627
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,840
just in really small than a ways.

628
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,070
There was a small little ways and that's
the positivity that we pick up from

629
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:33,400
other people.
They you,

630
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:38,130
you got to kind of bring it
local into your own neighborhood,

631
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,160
you know, if you go got and
try to solve huge problems.

632
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,110
I always wondered like I was sitting
there thinking like with Evan,

633
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,000
everybody stopped watching the news.
Then how would we behave?

634
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:54,470
And it's like, well before television
there was still all kinds of brutality.

635
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,620
What's then made me think like, well then
how did they get their view out there?

636
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:05,840
It seemed like back then what they would
do is they would send people out to get

637
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:08,840
slaughtered so then they could just
be like, do you see what happened?

638
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:12,230
Like sort of like what the native
Americans where they would just make these

639
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:16,070
treaties like, okay, we're
just going to go to here. And
then they tell, hey people,

640
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,920
there's free land beyond here. And
they, they, they tell them something,

641
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,040
then they would go out and get slaughtered
and then we had to go get her revenge,

642
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:26,900
which was really them just using people
to go fight the native Americans and

643
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:31,670
then just take more of the
land. Um, I don't know.

644
00:38:31,671 --> 00:38:34,970
I have this odd sort of like I,

645
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,190
I dunno where I am now in a world
holistic, it's a little bit,

646
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:43,170
but I'm also like super positive locally.
Like I,

647
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:48,171
I'm just kinda like just person to person
is a real positive experience for me.

648
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,150
But it's why I don't like when you though
those school shootings and all that

649
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:52,810
type of stuff,

650
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:57,250
I stopped watching those because what
I hate about it is I don't want to know

651
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:02,251
that fucking person's name and I feel
like the same way somebody watches you

652
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:07,120
guys in a band makes them
want to be in a band.

653
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:10,510
I feel like school shootings are like,

654
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:15,250
that's like keeping up with
the Kardashians for psychos
and then they want to

655
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:19,060
watch it and all those women who young
girls who aspire to be like a car Dashi

656
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,770
in an all glamorous psychos,
watch that and go like, oh,

657
00:39:23,771 --> 00:39:25,900
that's,
that's what I want to do.

658
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,120
I don't disagree with you
on anything you just said.

659
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:34,130
No, I don't hear that a lot.
Thank you. Yeah. I usually
get a lot of pushback. Yeah.

660
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,150
The Shit I say,

661
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,620
you know,
uh,

662
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,000
I mean I've got involved in a few
things because when I wrote these,

663
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,200
if it was going to be a book and there
was going to be a social action involved,

664
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,820
now that's a record. The song
social action involved, right?

665
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,980
It's small things.

666
00:39:51,981 --> 00:39:56,981
Like I got involved homelessness
in Seattle's super gnarly.

667
00:39:57,231 --> 00:40:02,030
It's super visible like in La because
street camping is legal, right?

668
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,940
RV camping is legal.

669
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,800
You can have four grams or under of
heroin and not get arrested. Seattle,

670
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:14,480
they tried this social experiment.
It's not really working.

671
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,700
It's makes homelessness
very visible there. And, um,

672
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,400
I had a brother in law that went through,
he was a,

673
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:23,720
it was my oldest brother in law.

674
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,900
He ended up homeless on the street and
when I was in punk rock bands and I would

675
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:31,490
see him down town when
they're all sketchy, you know,
punk rock clubs and stuff.

676
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,140
Um,
is my brother in law man.

677
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:38,510
And this guy is a guy helped raise me
when my dad left, like my brother in law,

678
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:42,560
Dexter buzz taught me how to run sprint
and do all this catch with football and

679
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:44,150
all this stuff.
And now I'm seeing him,

680
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:48,110
I'm 17 years old and his eyes
are yellow jaundice and you know,

681
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:53,230
alcoholism and 1983 82 and like
help try to help Dexter out.

682
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,530
Like,
uh,

683
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,280
and he helped somebody
out in that situation.

684
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,290
Like my friend had a punk rock club, like,
Hey, can my brother and I texted her,

685
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,220
like, make some money sweeping up or
whatever. That's how you help. Like,

686
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,620
but he, but he was, uh, receptive to it.

687
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,580
Text her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you know,

688
00:41:14,581 --> 00:41:17,880
he helped me one time I was downtown
and I got surrounded by a group of these

689
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:20,730
dudes who are homeless,
you know,

690
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:25,710
street and suddenly like out of nowhere,
like leave that guy alone lungs,

691
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:27,210
my brother in law and there comes decks,

692
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,480
drop out of the stairs and
like he know night. And uh,

693
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,990
I thought I was going to get the shit
beat out of me or worse, you know. And,

694
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,120
and uh, so he looked out
after me too as well. Um,

695
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,710
we're brother-in-law's, you know, I was,

696
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:47,510
he was 20 something years
my senior. Right. Uh,

697
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,610
what is the age difference in your
20 20th, so yeah, you're the baby.

698
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,530
Yeah. So I'm 55. My oldest
brother, 75. Is that right?

699
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,240
Yeah. Wow. So he was burned.

700
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:04,180
My oldest brothers and sisters were
born during World War II at the army

701
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,030
cause I was, cause I was reading, you
know, Park next, our per view book.

702
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,000
It was saying how, uh, you know
when you were like in high school,

703
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:15,520
like two year brothers were in Vietnam.
And I was trying to like, wait a minute,

704
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,140
what, what is, what is, what is
this the spread on that yet? How,

705
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,890
how old were you when they,

706
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,870
like when your brothers went away and how
long went off to war and how long were

707
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:26,740
they away at war?

708
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,470
I wasn't born yet.
When my first one went off.

709
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,270
Oh, so he wasn't there right
after [inaudible] took over
from the France. Right,

710
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:34,104
right.
Okay.

711
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,480
Like 63 or 64 maybe. I was just born. Um,

712
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,610
so he went over for, you know,
so he went and right at 18.

713
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,090
Yeah, it could because there was
so many brothers in our family.

714
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,380
I think at the beginning of the Vietnam
war there was sort of like still this

715
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:55,520
kind of, well, I'll do my, do my bed,

716
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,940
there's told me brothers, we'll
get drafted anyhow. Right.

717
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:03,560
I'll be able to choose where I go if I,
if I sign up right.

718
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:05,750
Dad and signed up for World War II.
So there was,

719
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,220
our grandfather was a world war one, so
there was this kind of thing like, okay,

720
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:14,530
this is what you do. Uh,
my s second brother, uh,

721
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,350
the second oldest brother mark
did the same thing. Signed up,

722
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:21,640
thought he could get in, I'll get in
the navy or something. And they, they,

723
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,590
they put them in the army. He
was in, he was in the shit.

724
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:27,890
He never talked about ever in his life.
How does that work?

725
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,590
I thought if you enlisted,
you got to choose. Yeah.

726
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:33,710
Well I think he thought he was able
to choose and I think they needed more

727
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,630
people in the,

728
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:39,570
in the army and they kind of just put
them someplace and so he's building

729
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,110
forward, forward, uh, uh,

730
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,490
I know he was building those
forward arm positions, you know,

731
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,500
and then had to hold it down and
tells they could fill it. Um,

732
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,950
he did that for a couple of years.
He got his Gi bill used it.

733
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:00,260
But the school is a math genius in a
park at Hanford and then at Boeing.

734
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,350
It never talked about his
experience in the war.

735
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:05,540
He just died of cancer
a couple of years ago.

736
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:09,950
He did work a hamper for a couple of years
and he was in Vietnam for a couple of

737
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,910
years and that doctors, you know, kind
of put some things together, you know,

738
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,890
but Hanford also nuclear. Yeah.
I'm not that bright a guy.

739
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:22,790
He can produce a nuclear. So you need
to do that a lot during this pocket.

740
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,940
Hampers and nuclear.
This is a state and you know,

741
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,200
but uh, uh, what we was any out. So my,

742
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:36,480
my brother died downtown Seattle,
my brother in law, Dexter,

743
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,760
uh, Union Gospel mission was just placed
where that he used the services when my

744
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:46,470
sister that was married to him,
she also died just a couple of years ago.

745
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,800
Jesus. Yeah. Yeah.

746
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:56,070
So she all, she wanted all of
her, she died suddenly. Um,

747
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,670
so we see in her will like all every
like donations or whatever it goes to the

748
00:45:01,671 --> 00:45:05,100
Union Gospel mission. Like, I
better check out this place.

749
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:10,101
My brother in law and then my sister and
I'm seeing homelessness and I do a trip

750
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:15,570
down there to Union Gospel mission.
I've seen it, you know, it's scary.

751
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,000
It's the things I talk about in the song,
like I'm not going near there. Right.

752
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,900
Um, but I went in and the
first time I went with,

753
00:45:22,901 --> 00:45:26,010
with my wife and she just
had just done a news thing.

754
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:31,260
She was all dressed up and she's
like, I want to go. I'm like,

755
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,360
well, you're looking pretty, you
know, like, uh, you know, uh,

756
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,840
you look like you look really,
you live really indoors and it's like,

757
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,210
what are you doing here? Yeah, yeah.
But, but you know, we travel a lot,

758
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:44,100
so we do see a lot and we,
you know,

759
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,270
when we travel as much and see
the things we see, we grow at a

760
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:52,620
layer of empathy I guess.

761
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:57,270
Like you're not afraid to go some
places because you understand people are

762
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,240
pretty much cool everywhere you go. Even
that scary homeless guy that's yelling,

763
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:04,560
you know,
if you read Elyn,

764
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,820
Saks is the center cannot hold your
understand more about schizophrenia.

765
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:10,830
Like that guy's not screaming at you.

766
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,670
He's screaming at some
thing that he doesn't. Yeah,

767
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,220
no, they just went to Israel for the first
time and I thought it was going to be

768
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:20,670
everybody just shooting guns at each
other. He was just chilling, chilling.

769
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:24,390
It was cool. Yeah. So I'll
say the Palestinian people
protesting and they were,

770
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:27,930
they were civil, the whole thing.
I was like, oh, this is like,

771
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:30,030
and it was right on the Mediterranean
Sea. It's like, this is beautiful.

772
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,030
That's just not how I pictured it.
Because whenever they show it,

773
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,840
it's after something horrible
happen. Yeah. Or are they,

774
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:40,440
it's like they don't even talk about
it over here until something happens.

775
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,660
European people, if you've
noticed, you've traveled to Europe,

776
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:48,010
are terrified to come to us because what
they see as the guns and the shooting

777
00:46:48,011 --> 00:46:52,510
and stuff, I'm not going
there, you know, so it's,

778
00:46:52,511 --> 00:46:57,370
it's whatever you perceive something
else to be. Right. Um, right.

779
00:46:57,371 --> 00:47:01,570
So, so we went to the Union Gospel
mission and they said, do you want to,

780
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:04,330
we're going to go on a run right
now I'm running, what's that? What?

781
00:47:04,331 --> 00:47:06,850
We're going to go into the jungle,
which is

782
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,050
arguably the worst homeless
and cabinet in America.

783
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,020
If they called it the jungle,

784
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,330
it wasn't going to be something
that's been there for a long time.

785
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:20,050
These guys have an MTI,
Mti out part of it. Um,

786
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,690
cops won't go in there.
The city,

787
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,310
how are they going to go on
there but not the cops. The cops,

788
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:29,680
like we're not going in there,
you know, cause they, uh, so,

789
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:33,310
but these guys from the Union Gospel
mission who have lived in the jungle and I

790
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:38,311
went to Rehab and now run the Union
Gospel mission and we lived here and they

791
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:41,830
tell me my point to all of this. They,
they, we, I started asking him like,

792
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,730
how would people get here? How do
people get to that tent on the street?

793
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:50,260
How do people get to the jungle?
Like living in the bushes,

794
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:54,160
like underneath the freeway.
Like it's like, well, you know,

795
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:58,060
it's 85% drug and alcohol addiction.
Okay.

796
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:01,270
I kind of took it, but there's
a number. Okay, thanks.

797
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:04,360
But like I was, you know, I mean,

798
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,730
my fear of living on the street even drew
my whole, my addiction, I'll call you,

799
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:10,090
like kept me off the street.

800
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:14,770
I'd worked like nine times as hard to be
able to trace. You paid the rent, right?

801
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:17,110
Yeah. Nine Times. He's like, yeah,

802
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:20,630
but did you have like abuse as a kid?
No.

803
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,460
Yet did you could, you know,
go through foster care note?

804
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:28,970
Did you get abused multiple
times? No I didn't. None of that.

805
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,000
He goes that 85% number of drugs now
I'll call coincides almost directly with

806
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:40,181
the amount of child abuse that
these and the guy I'm talking to,

807
00:48:41,811 --> 00:48:45,050
I won't say his name right. It
happened to me, it happened to,

808
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:49,670
my brother happened to this guy right
here sitting next to us bad and,

809
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,760
and we got stuck in this cycle that it
took me 50 years of my life to finally

810
00:48:58,041 --> 00:48:58,730
get out of,

811
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:03,730
I didn't know how I'd know
means it goes to the t like the,

812
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,530
there's a ton
Linda Bennington,

813
00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:11,531
Chester's wife since since his untimely
passing got hooked up to this thing,

814
00:49:12,591 --> 00:49:13,670
the five signs,

815
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:19,660
the five signs to recognize something's
wrong and this starts very young,

816
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,560
these five signs and I think the five
signs should be putting in like school

817
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,320
like yes, right. Like, cause we
remember going to elementary school,

818
00:49:33,321 --> 00:49:35,480
there was the guy that,
well that guy's a little rapey.

819
00:49:35,481 --> 00:49:39,540
You knew it like in the fifth grade,
you know what I mean? Like I said,

820
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,580
she's going to grow up and not going to
be cool with checks because something's

821
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:45,170
going on the little rapey
that guy's a little, you know,

822
00:49:45,171 --> 00:49:50,171
you could tell like at a young age like
we knew there was some guys weird like

823
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,550
weird. That's all you had. Was it weird?
He just killed his family's cat, you know,

824
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,260
staying away from that guy, you know.
Uh, there's, there's signs, you know,

825
00:50:00,261 --> 00:50:03,770
as a young kid and if we had like,
and this one starts,

826
00:50:03,771 --> 00:50:07,400
one person like to Linda started stinking,
I'm into it.

827
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:11,060
I'm have a propeller thing with my
record that you can get involved.

828
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,280
I'm going to make tee shirts from my tour.

829
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,810
They had the five signs on the back of it.
Oh that's great.

830
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,680
All I do is come on podcasts
and bitch about shit.

831
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,920
You actually doing something about it.

832
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:24,950
I need to to get fans involved and like
if we can just like one person at a time

833
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:29,630
, um, you know, it start
with the, you know, sure.

834
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:34,250
You hear about a guy getting radicalized
on Facebook and it goes and shoots up

835
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,680
is in place.
But sure.

836
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:40,160
What allowed that guy to
get radicalized on some,

837
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,830
the rest what you said there

838
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,870
about the jungle, right? Yeah.

839
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,750
I know everybody is going to give me
shit for not bringing up your song,

840
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,490
but I'm not going to do

841
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:50,650
well.
They had a sign that said no trespassing.

842
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,790
They have at Union Gospel mission is
great. It says no trespassing sign.

843
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:59,980
When somebody back in the day eighties
late eighties spray painted like gang

844
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:04,630
writing, welcome to the jungle and that
was assigned to get into the jungle. Wow.

845
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,420
And they have, I took
a picture of it. Yeah.

846
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:12,550
I'm saying like how that if I was to
drive by that not having not talked to you

847
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,550
[inaudible] my first thought
would be, you know, I want it.

848
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,390
I've got to get the fuck out here.
I'm not saying it still wouldn't be,

849
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:25,360
I would be afraid, but I'm now seeing
those people is like, that's some,

850
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,010
that's,
those are hurt kids grown up,

851
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,700
which humanizes them as
opposed to looking at it like,

852
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,631
cause I have to be honest with you,

853
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,110
like I see a lot of homeless people out
here in La and there's that thing where

854
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:40,310
you like, I definitely, you know,
as much of an asshole as I am,

855
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:43,250
I am empathetic and I,
and I do want to try to help out,

856
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:47,720
but it's just how to go in and
approach without getting fucked up.

857
00:51:47,721 --> 00:51:50,960
Like I would just went by a drug
store the other day and this actually,

858
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:52,430
I almost said something to this kid.

859
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:57,380
There was a guy who clearly so many people
have just like, like mental problems.

860
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:02,390
Right. You know, and
this guy was just like,

861
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,280
he was still going on some,
you know,

862
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:08,240
schizophrenia fucking riff about,
uh,

863
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:13,580
something about hobbits or something and
the way he was moving it freaked me out

864
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:18,500
in this younger kid out. And at some point
we both kind heard what he was saying,

865
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:22,580
which was comical. On a base level if
he wasn't living the life he was living.

866
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,720
But then I saw the younger kids start
smiling and then he takes his phone out to

867
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:31,610
film them. And I'm just looking at like,
dude, this is like, cause they shut down.

868
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:36,020
Mental hospitals is now going to become
your content for your Instagram page.

869
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:39,650
And I almost said something to him.
Um,

870
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:46,020
but then there was just like, alright,
have an Iwatch, shit like that on you.

871
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,000
Now I'm kind of a hypocrite because I
remember when bumfights first came out,

872
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,510
I remember that these guys would pay
bumps to beat the shit out of each other.

873
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:57,890
And I was the age I was at,
I was way too old to find that funny.

874
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:01,340
But I was also still trying to
find my voice as a comedian.

875
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,400
And there was that whole thing
amongst comics where like, you know,

876
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:08,600
you gotta like you can't be softy,
everything's gotta be funny.

877
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:12,320
So I watched Saturn and entertainment
level, so I just, I quickly was just like,

878
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:15,410
all right, what? I'm going to be a
parent to this 20 something year old.

879
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:19,900
I'll feel like a fucking hypocrite.
And I didn't say anything, but my,

880
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,971
my problem is,

881
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:24,840
is I always go to anger and what it should
have went to was more like, hey man,

882
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,780
this guy's, he's, his life is hard
enough, man. You don't need a blow.

883
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,010
I should have gone like that.

884
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:33,750
And it's my default emotion
would be like, you know, hey,

885
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,450
fuck had you know this guy.
You know, I would, you know,

886
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,430
and who listens after hey fuck head.
Who listens to your true

887
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:46,790
Yo, my phrase, yes. Come on. Excuse
me. Fellow American. Yeah. Um,

888
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:51,530
yeah, I, I read this, you're talking about
the guy yelling at something. I mean,

889
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:54,470
we could go on forever bell.
I gotta tell you, I'm like,

890
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,250
there's levity in this and there's hope
like in the record that, that, that,

891
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:02,060
that's what I liked there.
There, there is. But I read,

892
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:05,570
I read a lot and there's this book,
I brought it up earlier.

893
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,700
The center cannot hold,
was written by this woman.

894
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:11,780
She's currently the head of school
psychology at USC. If you've heard,

895
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,340
we've heard of this school,
it's a big school.

896
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,240
I hear about them when
they win championships and
scan that stuff. But she,

897
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:22,440
she's a schizo frantic and she wrote
this book. She did admit it to,

898
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:27,210
she would live this like kind
of solo life until she was,

899
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:30,930
she has schizophrenia and wrote
a book. Was it, I mean she's,

900
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:35,700
the head of the joke there was, it was
an uneven, she's, she's brilliant but,

901
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:40,280
but to start her story,
you know, she's, she,

902
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,560
she gets scholarships to Cambridge
and yell law and all of this stuff.

903
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:48,590
Meanwhile going off on these
schizophrenia tirades of like,

904
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:51,930
I've killed a million people
and a million people killed me.

905
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:53,160
I've been killed a million times.

906
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,710
Her and her friend stopped and
then they would like, what are you,

907
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,340
what's going on? Oh, I was joking like,

908
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:03,110
but it still was able
to contain it like that.

909
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:08,070
We went into a hospital in England
for a year, the, but over there,

910
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:12,870
the professor recognize what was going
on. She's brilliant. No, she's brilliant.

911
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,400
He put her in this place.

912
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:18,530
They don't chain you down in the
mental hospitals and they use velcro.

913
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,020
They don't. They actually
done. Uh, but she got,

914
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:25,470
she had her stories.
You should just read the book,

915
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:29,520
but I wanted to tell you about the,
her beginnings of that. Like she,

916
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:30,690
when she was nine or 10,

917
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:35,790
she always thought there was a man outside
their door at night. And she's like,

918
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:36,624
well what,

919
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:41,830
what nine or 10 year old kid doesn't
kind of think that like the boogeyman and

920
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:46,680
she's like 1516 mark and home from high
school to houses would talk to her,

921
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:52,620
but everybody else seems to
be handling it well. Right.

922
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,230
The houses must be talking to everybody.
They're talking to me,

923
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,950
but I'm looking at other kids on the
street. They're not freaking out on it,

924
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,250
so I'll just, I won't
either. I'll just hold it in.

925
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:06,900
And it progressed and progressed and
progressed to where she was on the roof of

926
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,580
that.
They'll know about it.

927
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,640
But after doing a hundred
graduate screaming and you know,

928
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,320
blacked out like screaming map Kelda
million people had been killed a million

929
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:17,154
times and

930
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,420
I was going to ask, so she doesn't
remember saying that. Some of it she does,

931
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:24,160
she talks very real,
very real.

932
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:27,400
She would have these moments where
suddenly it all came to her like, ah,

933
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,020
I've killed.
But she would,

934
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,770
she also writes in that I
would never harmed anybody.

935
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,750
That's what's so misunderstood.

936
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,980
Like schizophrenia means a million
different things where they put a label on

937
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,200
sort of one thing just to
kind of get it in a group.

938
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,710
But I read this book all the way to its
end. She's now 60 maybe or something.

939
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,840
She was the head of school psychology
at USC and I drove past a guy on sunset

940
00:56:52,541 --> 00:56:57,040
and vine. He's on the corner screaming,
chanting the top of his lungs,

941
00:56:57,041 --> 00:57:00,660
like the guy you saw and several of
them parking lot of where it was right.

942
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:05,170
I suddenly had empathy for, I understood
it a lot more. And I think, um,

943
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,210
uh,

944
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:12,210
reading and educating yourself if you're
interested in your fellow man and it's

945
00:57:12,461 --> 00:57:17,461
just interested in how we've gotten here
and what's in the future and cycles of

946
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:19,511
things.

947
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:23,710
I just read a lot and it's so interesting
and like even current administration's

948
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,070
don't bother me cause it just passes,
you know,

949
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:32,320
we go to Europe and stuff, we see how
administrations affect other countries,

950
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,380
how they think about
us. You know, there was,

951
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,870
I mean we've been traveling
through a few wars, you know,

952
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:45,090
I don't travel the way you like, I,
I've, I do a little quick little runs.

953
00:57:45,091 --> 00:57:48,480
You guys would go and live
there. Yeah, we're there.

954
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,271
Um,
yeah,

955
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:55,150
we've been traveling there and staying
in Europe would go there and stay for it.

956
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,020
How did you like when when you
guys were always blows my mind.

957
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,450
I understand like when you
get to a certain level,

958
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:04,050
you can afford a business manager who
can handle your mail and your bills and

959
00:58:04,051 --> 00:58:07,800
all of that shit when you will come up
and you just touring around in a van.

960
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:12,930
Yeah. Okay. And there's taxes to be
paid and there's the cable and yeah,

961
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,440
like money. So like you guys. Oh yeah.

962
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,080
It's just the sheer that see you basically
homeless in Flores and yeah. You,

963
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,123
you know,
like

964
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:28,110
I always, I had such as my parents
grew up in the end, the depression.

965
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:31,830
So I grew up with depression era values.

966
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:36,300
Like we'd hear these horror stories
of the depression. Like I'm never,

967
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:40,830
there was one time on, I was 18
years old, I was on a punk rock tour.

968
00:58:40,831 --> 00:58:45,270
I was starving, literally
shaking, starving, and a guy said,

969
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:49,300
you can go down to the, I'd
had jobs as cooks. I paid tax,

970
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:53,670
I've done construction. I've done
every kind of job. There was this tour,

971
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,170
I had to stop for two weeks,
my construction job and go on tour.

972
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,600
I didn't have any money. I had
apartment paid this, you know,

973
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:05,730
the taxes, you pay pad of Europe, they
take it out of your paycheck, you know.

974
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:11,190
Um, but I was starving, penniless and
starving in San Francisco and they said,

975
00:59:11,191 --> 00:59:15,810
you can go down to the
emergency food stamps. Oh.

976
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:22,280
But I was so hungry. I didn't
have a choice. I wasn't
going to fucking panhandle.

977
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:26,210
I wasn't, I didn't have it. I didn't,
there was no safety net in my family.

978
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:29,390
You know, like you can't, what
they mom, why aren't me some cash?

979
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,700
My mom didn't have any
money, you know. Um,

980
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,070
so I went to this line and I,

981
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:39,710
I'd maybe it happened for a reason and
went to the welfare line and you can get

982
00:59:39,711 --> 00:59:44,390
$80 in emergency food stamps and
it was women with babies, but six,

983
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:48,170
you know, and there's me,
I'm an able bodied, you know,

984
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:52,070
18 year old bumps. Fucking
starving man. If I didn't eat,

985
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:56,750
I hadn't eaten for like three days, you
know, and I just needed something to eat.

986
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:01,490
So I waited there and I got,
and I went into a store and I bought,

987
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:03,060
yeah,

988
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:06,090
bunch of like a loaf of bread and
some Bologna and some cheese. I still,

989
01:00:06,091 --> 01:00:10,080
so I still had like $70 of food stamps
and I gave, I gave him five bucks left.

990
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:14,520
Yeah. So I gave that, I get food stamps
to, to a woman that was in the store.

991
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:18,900
And you want these. And I never
had that experience. Like,

992
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,260
I'm never going to be homeless.

993
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,610
I'm never going to be homeless and
I don't want it. I paid that back,

994
01:00:26,611 --> 01:00:31,240
that 10 bucks I got from the welfare a
million times. I Oprah paint, you know,

995
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:32,790
I met my taxes and everything,

996
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:37,820
but how do you know later on when I
started making money and stuff like a and

997
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,570
getting mail, so you have
to have an address for that.
The gas, right. So, you know,

998
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,003
uh,

999
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,740
I got a buddy of mine, a comedian, he
actually, he so living out in the woods,

1000
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:52,270
he tried to legally see if
he could stop getting mail.

1001
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,250
Oh. And just like he just,
that's the level that he
wants to just not be involved.

1002
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:02,110
And they were like, no, you have to, you
have to have a mailing address, a SPEC.

1003
01:01:02,111 --> 01:01:06,340
We kind of have to know where you are
just in case you do some crazy shit.

1004
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:09,760
We know where to start
looking for you, I guess. Um,

1005
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:11,860
I went down that,
you know,

1006
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:14,800
like 10 years ago I got totally into
like conspiracy theory and shit.

1007
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:16,570
And I was buying like fucking
powdered food and all,

1008
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,630
it's not how I ended up learning how
to fly a helicopter because I got so

1009
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:21,220
fucking scared of living out here.

1010
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,550
Like what happens when the dollar
collapses in the shit hits the fan.

1011
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,400
How the fuck do you get out? It takes
like nine hours to get out of here.

1012
01:01:27,401 --> 01:01:32,401
Even when it works in up and out
was the only way I'd never took into

1013
01:01:33,011 --> 01:01:35,310
consideration how expensive
a fucking helicopter wasn't.

1014
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,290
You can't land it in anymore. So
you know how to fly one. Yeah.

1015
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:42,790
That's not an easy thing to do.
It's no flying. It's not hard.

1016
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:45,460
It's all the shit you need to know so
you don't fuck up when you're up there.

1017
01:01:45,461 --> 01:01:50,080
That's, it's the, the ground school is,
is, is the hard part. But like, you know,

1018
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,680
I mean if you could drive a stick shift,
you know,

1019
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:58,890
I mean it's like four stick shifts
once, isn't it? No, no we're not. It's,

1020
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,040
it's this, this is up and down. This here
is where you want it go movies. Yeah.

1021
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:07,210
Yeah. So like the emergency
brake, if you want to go up,

1022
01:02:07,211 --> 01:02:10,200
you go like this, they're right now,
can't see this. What are you doing?

1023
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,010
If you want to go down
and you go like that,

1024
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:14,590
you just went down with his
hand and then the cyclic,

1025
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:17,680
the stick between your legs.
He just Kinda, you know,
whichever way you want to go,

1026
01:02:17,681 --> 01:02:19,730
like a stairwell and then,
uh,

1027
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,870
fly a helicopter.
Now you can show me how to do that.

1028
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:22,820
Basically it,

1029
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,910
well if you're ever in a helicopter
and then you just got your pedals,

1030
01:02:25,911 --> 01:02:28,610
that kind of keeps your ass and you
know, is where you wanted to be. I mean,

1031
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:29,061
it's very,

1032
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:32,210
it putting it all together is a little
about pat and you had rubbing your

1033
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:36,350
stomach, but you know, I, when you know,

1034
01:02:36,351 --> 01:02:41,351
you play bass and can be
singing like in [inaudible],

1035
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:46,250
what do they call that? Uh, like a
I'm poly rhythmic kind of thing. Yeah.

1036
01:02:46,251 --> 01:02:49,100
Where it's like,
I always wanted how the guys can play,

1037
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:53,000
can play guitar and sing where it's
like the phrasing is different.

1038
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:57,820
Just once things stuff. Yeah. Yeah.
You that takes a lot of practice.

1039
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,773
Yes,

1040
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:01,000
but that is way fucking harder.

1041
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,400
That is way fucking harder
than the helicopter.

1042
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:09,550
Helicopter is more the fear like
am I going to fucking kill myself?

1043
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:13,470
That's indeed. Yeah. You don't think
that playing bass singing songs

1044
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,760
when I was getting really hammered,
I want it.

1045
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:19,790
I was the best idea was my
friend talking me out of it.

1046
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:23,510
This is like 91 height of
my drink and I need to,

1047
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,610
I'm going to learn how to try to get,

1048
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:31,220
I'm going to get a helicopter in my
face like, yeah, not a good idea.

1049
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:36,290
Oh Man. We can go up to lake
arrowhead. Big Bear. Yeah,

1050
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,950
like 10 minutes man.
Fuck traffic it probably not a good idea.

1051
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:42,920
What was your drink of choice?
You've got like 18 guns.

1052
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:46,460
You think the mailman is gonna you
know, probably not a good idea. Yeah.

1053
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:50,770
I was paranoid and like what was your
drink of choice? Oh, I had everything up.

1054
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,380
Why do you got my drink of
choice was just straight vodka.

1055
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:58,040
They fuck up. I was, I quit
drinking last November.

1056
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,470
I still have some bottles of booze here,
Bruce,

1057
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,300
cause they're high end shit
and I'm not throwing them out.

1058
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:03,590
And I'm also not giving them away.

1059
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:08,900
I just keep them with special friends
come by or whatever. I haven't, but I,

1060
01:04:08,901 --> 01:04:11,240
I uh,
I'm more of a,

1061
01:04:11,241 --> 01:04:16,070
I was a whiskey bourbon guy and yeah.
And I,

1062
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,840
and I started buying the high end stuff.
So then you don't think you're,

1063
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:23,450
you're kind of a drunk. You just think I'm
a connoisseur. Right. But I'm more of a,

1064
01:04:23,451 --> 01:04:27,680
I'm just a binge drinker because I went
to a couple of AA meetings and like this

1065
01:04:27,681 --> 01:04:32,000
fucking stories there. I was just like,
my jaw was on the ground and they like,

1066
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:34,610
build, do you want to share? I was
like, I can't fucking follow this.

1067
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,960
You're thinking of it as a bit like,
dude, I don't have any. Like, I mean,

1068
01:04:38,961 --> 01:04:41,750
I come home, my wife yells at
me, come to bed and I fall.

1069
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,030
I fall asleep and wake
up in sports center's on.

1070
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:48,860
I mean that's about as bad as the
gut. Um, I was just doing it too much.

1071
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,090
Uh, I just, I kind of learned,

1072
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,880
like I keep saying this on
my podcast because I hope,
you know, cause some people,

1073
01:04:52,881 --> 01:04:56,460
I think a like me and you can kind of,
I kind of like if,

1074
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:01,100
if a doctor saw how much I was drinking
would say you are an alcoholic and it's

1075
01:05:01,101 --> 01:05:05,090
Kinda like a lot of people don't realize
that just 30 pounds overweight can see,

1076
01:05:05,091 --> 01:05:08,090
you know, your height is in there too. But
like if you're about my size, five, nine,

1077
01:05:08,091 --> 01:05:12,410
five, 10, if you're 30 pounds overweight,
you're obese. People think obese is like,

1078
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:13,101
you know,

1079
01:05:13,101 --> 01:05:16,700
you fucking thighs are rubbing together
and you're wearing ray on slacks and

1080
01:05:16,701 --> 01:05:19,920
nobody wants to bang you, right?
It's just like, no, it's just,

1081
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:22,030
it's just 30 pounds.

1082
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:26,410
And I learned that from my buddy who was
about my size and he went up to a buck

1083
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:29,620
95 and he went in for a physical
and the guy was like, look,

1084
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:34,000
I'm not going to write you up but just
to let you know you're five pounds over.

1085
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:37,840
And he was just like, write me up for
what? And he was like being obese.

1086
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:41,080
And like it blew his mind who my mind too,

1087
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:44,450
but not as much as him cause he was
actually being called obese. But um,

1088
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,530
I just saw a thing on.
So I do watch this.

1089
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:52,630
I watch local morning news in Seattle.
Right.

1090
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:57,040
And here in La there was access. So it's
just like local stuff. Right, right.

1091
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:57,993
You don't get the,

1092
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:02,440
and I pick what news station I
watched it just as local stuff.

1093
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,150
I want the weather, you know, like
maybe a little story about something.

1094
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:10,800
Yeah, some old lady who jars around
on jam in the end makes you feel good.

1095
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,090
You know,
rescued a dog.

1096
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:16,740
I bet there was a story on the news this
morning talking about obesity and uh,

1097
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,010
one of the rear admiral somebody
came out today and said,

1098
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:23,941
uh,
uh,

1099
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:28,941
majority of American kids wouldn't
qualify it for the military today cause of

1100
01:06:30,901 --> 01:06:35,770
obesity and mental
issue. I was like, whoa.

1101
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:40,490
I rewound the story. I just hear that.
Right. Anyone who said they wouldn't,

1102
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:46,070
wouldn't be able to do like
regular just jobs or our college.

1103
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:49,460
It was a, it just reminded me the
thing you said about obesity obstacle,

1104
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,350
look into that more.

1105
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,360
I thought you was.
Yeah he was also talking like physical,

1106
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:57,361
I saw a thing about like
some school between here and
San Diego like way back in

1107
01:06:57,761 --> 01:06:58,330
the day,

1108
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:02,700
I can't remember if they came up with
the president's physical fitness thing

1109
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,420
that did as a kid.
Yeah as a kid.

1110
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:07,450
Like they probably don't do this now
because it makes kids feel bad about

1111
01:07:07,451 --> 01:07:08,284
themselves.

1112
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,530
But they used to be this thing called
the the the president's physical fitness

1113
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:15,110
test and you had to be able to do a
certain amount of pushups in a minute sit

1114
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:15,700
ups.

1115
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,450
And the one that blew my mind was a pull
up cause I had never done a pull up.

1116
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:22,840
And if you've never done a pull up you
can barely do one because you'd never use

1117
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:23,680
those muscles.

1118
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:26,680
Like for some reason a chin up I guess
cause you're picking stuff up and you're

1119
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:27,640
using your bicep.

1120
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:31,590
It did not pass one of them.
And still be okay. Right.

1121
01:07:31,591 --> 01:07:36,030
So it was Paula was your weakness or
push up? I think you could not pass one.

1122
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,310
Yeah.
I remember doing that every year as a kid.

1123
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,440
30 30 sit ups in that in a minute.

1124
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,260
I've been doing pull ups ever since,

1125
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,410
since I have you til I
fucked up my shoulder and I,

1126
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:45,750
I've been the last two years I have,

1127
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:48,970
I had a bet with my buddy
200 bucks that when I'm 70,

1128
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:52,320
I'll be able to do 10 of them.
And right after I made the bet I don't,

1129
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,490
my wife showed me some,

1130
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:57,970
one of her crossfit fucking exercises
and I was trying to do it and I just felt

1131
01:07:57,971 --> 01:08:02,710
this pinch and I had this rotator cuff
fish. Oh No, I know. So now I don't know.

1132
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,590
I don't know what I gotta do here.
So I'm taking a few months off.

1133
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,340
Yes. Those little, uh, so those
little stabbing, just a little pinch.

1134
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,380
Like now I'm 55.

1135
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:15,980
I'll get a little pinch where
when I was 30 something.

1136
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:19,550
Just be a little page. Yep.
Shut off that little pinch.

1137
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:22,430
I think I just bulged my
disc in my l four l five.

1138
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:25,660
You Ready? Sure. You gotta
get like a Jedi misuse.

1139
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:28,250
That's what I ended up finding
somebody to hook me up with somebody I,

1140
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:30,580
a nerve issue and she,

1141
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,910
I remember I was in my left leg that
was fucked up and she just sat there

1142
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:37,120
listening to me for like a half hour
asking me questions and I was going like,

1143
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,120
the fuck are we doing here? So
he goes, all right, let's go.

1144
01:08:40,121 --> 01:08:43,130
And then she took me in back in was
my left leg when I was feeling pain.

1145
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:46,450
She started with my right shoulder
and I was thinking, all right,

1146
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,500
either she doesn't know what she's
doing or she's at some jet eye level.

1147
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:55,060
And it turned out, fortunately
it was the jet eye level. And uh,

1148
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:59,610
I just, through all the years of playing
sports, it was fucked because the,

1149
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,790
when the, the pain takes you back
to when like you ever say, hey guys,

1150
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:06,910
I'm pasty as health sis, I'll get like
bruises on me. My wife would be like,

1151
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:11,800
what happened? And I'll be, I dunno. And
what I do is I push on it and are Oh yeah,

1152
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:14,530
yeah, I was walking through, I banged
into the door, it's fucking weird.

1153
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:17,560
So she was doing that with my leg and
it was like the history of my life.

1154
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:20,380
Like all my brother used to
give me charley horses. Oh,

1155
01:09:20,381 --> 01:09:23,530
I used to play pick up
hockey and not wear any gear.

1156
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:26,290
I fell on my fucking leg
and she went all the way.

1157
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:29,740
Like it took like three months
too. I was like, come on,

1158
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:33,580
ray lived your life in that, the painful
moments. Yeah. That's great. No, no, no.

1159
01:09:33,581 --> 01:09:37,000
This was three months, three
months of slowly. She was like,

1160
01:09:37,001 --> 01:09:39,280
there's three levels of your
muscle were on the surface.

1161
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,960
And then I was psyched
that we got to the moon,

1162
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,150
but every time she would start a new
layer, like, dude, I'm telling you,

1163
01:09:43,151 --> 01:09:46,360
I was like coming up off the table.
And she was like, give me numbers,

1164
01:09:46,361 --> 01:09:49,780
give me numbers. And I was like, I'd
be like, all right. I was like six six.

1165
01:09:49,781 --> 01:09:54,520
And she goes, well, you're
Irish. So that's probably an
eight guys. Can't fucking,

1166
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,750
you know, communicate like pain
or shit like that. So, um, do,

1167
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,270
we've talked for almost
second hour and when,

1168
01:10:00,271 --> 01:10:02,940
I haven't even talked about like
the over an hour. Jesus Christ,

1169
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:05,920
the how great the album, what's the
name of the APP was a tenderness,

1170
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:07,390
it's called tenderness,
tenderness.

1171
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,030
So I wrote the song, we did begin
with this, I wrote these songs on,

1172
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:16,310
on the road, uh, during this
tour. I'll make observations,

1173
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:20,260
we're going down again. I was at,
at, uh, at peace with like, uh,

1174
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:25,400
my old bandmates and, and
proud there's really, and um,

1175
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:31,160
I was able to observe and I, and I got
them to thank for it, for that being in,

1176
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:34,370
being in that place and, and
my wife of course, and my,

1177
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:38,270
my kids growing up into
like the strong young women,

1178
01:10:38,271 --> 01:10:42,980
I wasn't worrying so much about, ah,
your kid at school and this and that.

1179
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:48,290
And I was just really observing and living
in life, being adults that you saw us.

1180
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:51,230
I was traveling just like my
wife would come with me. Like,

1181
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:53,730
we're tough and we're not worrying
about the kids at Humbard.

1182
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,870
Like got this next level and um,

1183
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:01,610
kids are on their own, they're cool. Uh,

1184
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,590
we're going to go out and together
and see stuff and, and have some fun.

1185
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:10,650
And, and I was able to go and talk
to just a ton of people. Not only, so

1186
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:13,740
how did you, how did you put together?
Who's who singer? Who on this?

1187
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:19,270
I did. That's your voice?
Yeah. What? Yeah, so I had, I,

1188
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,000
I'm saying for a long time,

1189
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:24,630
this is the first time I was saying
it like in a lower register. Um,

1190
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:29,910
but so I wrote the songs. Um, Gotcha.

1191
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,250
La showed, I got to see the,
I know I'm going to be, I'm,

1192
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:33,540
I got an acting Gig in New York

1193
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,450
this summer. I heard,
are you going to revive?

1194
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:40,380
Told me because my wife had instructed
me to set up something with you guys.

1195
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:41,630
And then the first thing your wife said,

1196
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:44,600
are you guys coming in New York at
all this summer? When do you leave?

1197
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,440
Can you say that on there? No, cause
there's too many Weirdos. Yeah. Uh,

1198
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:52,410
we'll talk about later.
As soon as I said that,

1199
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:55,430
I already said I probably shouldn't have
said that I'm going to be in New York,

1200
01:11:55,431 --> 01:12:00,240
but it's a, it's a big enough place. New
York state. Uh, yes. Albany. Yeah. I'll,

1201
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:03,770
I'm going to be in a little couple
of John's town of Poughkeepsie.

1202
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:09,020
Uh, Lake Ontario. I'll be up
there. Yeah. At the play her lakes.

1203
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,840
Beautiful up there by the way.
Um,

1204
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,510
have you ever looked at a
map and just started like,

1205
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:19,010
I, I wish I did that from the beginning
of my career, all the little towns and,

1206
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:21,640
and, and colored in all the
roads that I've been on. A,

1207
01:12:21,641 --> 01:12:26,050
I wish I would've done that because I
would think like as much the way musicians

1208
01:12:26,051 --> 01:12:30,910
travel and certainly, uh, I mean, I think
that's how I got the sciatic nerve thing.

1209
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:34,570
I think it was all those years of
sitting in a fucking car and this leg not

1210
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,270
moving and my knee got fucked up. Just
being in this stationary position. Yeah.

1211
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:43,210
Will, will screw you up. Yeah. Not,
not a stretch or anything like that,

1212
01:12:43,211 --> 01:12:46,360
but I always wished, you know, it was
a big thing for me. When I finally did,

1213
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:51,430
I got all 50 states. Wyoming was the
last one and I didn't have a good show.

1214
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:54,340
Oh Wow. I think I weirded
him out. I came out,

1215
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:57,820
I was excited to be there and
they would just, you know,

1216
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:02,780
like the vibe of your, this album
that you have that's sorta like,

1217
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:06,220
you know, uh, that was their vibe.

1218
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:11,470
And I came out more like
whatever you guys close with,

1219
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:14,120
with goods at Paradise City.
I came out on,

1220
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:19,210
I came out with that and they were like,
the fucks with this guy.

1221
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:20,500
And then I was thinking like,
what are these?

1222
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,060
Just a bunch of country
hillbillies or whatever.

1223
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,830
And then I went to their local club,

1224
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,780
the dance club or whatever and slash
watering holes, like all in one area.

1225
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:33,310
And I went there and there was like troops
there. They were gays couples there.

1226
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,400
And it was just, yeah, it was like all
total mixed up. And I was just like,

1227
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:41,560
that was that moment. Like, oh, I was the
asshole. I was the, I was thinking like,

1228
01:13:41,561 --> 01:13:45,490
what'd you call? Just get off your
fucking ranch. And it's just like, no man,

1229
01:13:45,491 --> 01:13:49,090
we came out here to laugh and you fucking
came out with like steam coming out of

1230
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:52,830
your ears. It wasn't a really
bad show, but it was, uh, I, I,

1231
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:58,360
I never stopped in addressed. It
was all I needed to say, like, wait,

1232
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,220
can you guys out? You
know, I never did that.

1233
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:05,000
We all prejudged alright. Don't
feel bad about it. All right. Uh,

1234
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:09,690
the, the map, we were talking, oh, so
shooter, um, I wrote these songs. I,

1235
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:14,500
I put them on, all my crappy demos
are on garage band, on my Mac.

1236
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,363
Right.
Uh Huh.

1237
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,930
And I back him up by sending
them a copy to my manager.

1238
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:22,510
So that's my backup hard
drive. Right. So I have like,

1239
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:24,700
and I might send it to my wife,

1240
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,190
so I have like two backup hard
drives of my crappy. Yeah.

1241
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,330
Demos.
How was she as far as like when you,

1242
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:32,540
cause I bounce jokes off of
Nia and she's Kinda like,

1243
01:14:32,541 --> 01:14:36,590
she's so honest that like I, I kinda
use the risk like, all right, if I,

1244
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:39,500
if I can make her laugh. Cause
she, her dad managed Comedians,

1245
01:14:39,501 --> 01:14:40,700
so she grew up around comics.

1246
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:44,200
Is Does your wife like that
with music where she's from

1247
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:49,340
Ohio. So she, she has this very
like, you know, if she's like,

1248
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:52,070
I like that, you know,
that it's like, okay,

1249
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:56,330
that kind of covers like a pretty big
area. She'll be, if she doesn't like,

1250
01:14:56,331 --> 01:15:00,500
like my band loaded superhard
my adult poke rock band. Right.

1251
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,350
So you'd be like,
Whoa,

1252
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:08,460
she wouldn't say super aggressive.
Ah,

1253
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:16,330
ah, there's so much in
that. Whoa. Yeah. Hey,

1254
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,620
I like this next to that guy.

1255
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:21,800
He's a pill to like
just a very small group.

1256
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:26,810
I'm pretty sure just by my wife's
reaction, um, this, this record, however,

1257
01:15:26,811 --> 01:15:29,100
like she,
her,

1258
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,360
her reaction to these songs and she knew
she was with me experiencing all this

1259
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,310
stuff so she knew where
the words are coming from.

1260
01:15:34,311 --> 01:15:38,240
She was just finishing her novel
at the time when we were traveling.

1261
01:15:38,241 --> 01:15:40,410
So she was writing a lot and,
and um,

1262
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,580
my manager when I sit,
I don't think I just want to make that,

1263
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:49,570
that austere record now.
And he said, I think, uh,

1264
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,320
I'm going to look for somebody to uh,
to work with. And he said he goes,

1265
01:15:54,321 --> 01:15:56,670
what about shooter and shooter?

1266
01:15:56,690 --> 01:16:00,440
Jennings is a guy I've known since
he moved here in 2001 he was in a,

1267
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:04,370
he was 21 he was in a band that
opened for my van loaded. Right.

1268
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,890
They were called star gun and there,
you know,

1269
01:16:06,891 --> 01:16:10,700
like I think you could still to this
deck and it says 10 young musicians.

1270
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,430
I can pick out that one
that's going to be a lifer

1271
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:17,960
nine or just kind of like that back. Let's
plan to do that with Comedians, right?

1272
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,030
The comic and an open mic can be like,

1273
01:16:20,031 --> 01:16:25,031
all right that person I get more be like
as far as potential like I can see like

1274
01:16:25,161 --> 01:16:26,210
the,
if that person,

1275
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:30,980
it's just something about they have that
five and I'll meet people after shows

1276
01:16:30,981 --> 01:16:33,380
and they won't say I'm a comedian,
they'll just have this five. I'd be like,

1277
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,660
are you a comic? It'd be
like, yeah. That's like, yeah,

1278
01:16:35,661 --> 01:16:37,400
you seem like you seem like one.

1279
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,330
It always makes them stand up a little
bit cause I can see that awkwardness

1280
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:46,380
sorta like looking down kind of that
can't even describe the community young,

1281
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:49,210
the young comedian vibe though.
Dude,

1282
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:52,880
I'm a shit and Dick joke
jackass, but they, they, they,

1283
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:55,520
there's,
there's a social awkwardness,

1284
01:16:55,640 --> 01:17:00,640
a unique social awkwardness that a
comedian has gone back to that back bar at

1285
01:17:00,641 --> 01:17:05,320
the, at the comedy store that's
just for the or whatever. Yeah.

1286
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:09,230
That's a weird room. Sometimes
that's a, it's a cause. It's a very,

1287
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,300
the comedy store has always been a
very transient place where if you,

1288
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:17,300
it was one of those places I
shouldn't, I, I'm not going to say it.

1289
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:20,750
I'll say it because it's just
one of those people pass through.

1290
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,650
Sometimes the sinks in your head built,
don't have to come out your mouth. I know.

1291
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:26,320
Yeah,

1292
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,710
I know you're right.
But I usually only do like an hour,

1293
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:33,940
an hour and 15 and I just want
to make sure that we say all the

1294
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:38,050
stuff, where can we, where can
we get the album and all that.

1295
01:17:38,051 --> 01:17:40,480
We haven't even said that yet.
Oh, I'm just hearing your manager.

1296
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:45,010
Taryn is fucking hair out. Yeah. Work.
Where can they, they can download this.

1297
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:49,520
Uh, yeah. I mean there's vinyl
records come in. Actual vinyl records.

1298
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:53,090
I've got a stereo right over, there
you go. Uh, it comes up May 31st,

1299
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:57,390
it's called tenderness.
It's on universal music. Uh,

1300
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:01,880
they'd been wonderful about my
social action with this thing.

1301
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:06,740
And um, yeah, we start touring
in Philly and on May 30th,

1302
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:11,720
they, before the record comes
out. So hopefully like in
two days after they fill,

1303
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:14,360
it would be like three people.
Like, yeah, what are you doing?

1304
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:17,810
And then the next day. So hopefully
by the time we get to New York,

1305
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:22,620
June 3rd and we're playing at Irving Plaza
there, some people know the song, Oh,

1306
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:27,260
I get it. Um, Chicago, Nashville,
Austin, up up the west coast.

1307
01:18:27,261 --> 01:18:30,140
And then, uh, guns is doing some stuff.

1308
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:35,990
That's my main priority. And this is,
this is, this is not an ego project.

1309
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:37,840
This is not anything close to it.
It's

1310
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,300
something like this is a legit album.
I love it.

1311
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:45,550
It's the top topics are important.
What my daughters to know, like,

1312
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,530
what did you do when,
you know,

1313
01:18:47,531 --> 01:18:52,531
and this is my little piece of what I
did when and that's getting active and

1314
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:57,550
talking about stuff openly and, and kind
of like assuring people I beat, you know,

1315
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,120
these things you might be worried about,
they're going to pass,

1316
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:05,140
but we gotta be in this together
just like after nine 11, you know,

1317
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:07,840
and just like when America's been great,
you know,

1318
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,920
the hurricane two years ago in Houston,
the fires in California,

1319
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:12,581
but come together,

1320
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,240
we don't ask who the fuck you vote for
and come together and we help. You know,

1321
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:20,560
and that's the America I choose to see.
And the,

1322
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,630
they been acknowledged as opposed to the
crazy shit on t puck that turn it off.

1323
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:28,580
Yes man. Yes. Thought I
did and I don't even know.

1324
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:34,100
It's kind of fun walking around. It's
like a crazy old person. But um, anyways,

1325
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:36,080
I absolutely love the album.
It's called tenderness.

1326
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:40,880
It's on iTunes for a youngsters.
All of those areas where you can get it,

1327
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:45,700
please pay for the album.
And if you don't, cause I
was joking with duff earlier,

1328
01:19:45,701 --> 01:19:48,200
I hate when people like they send
you the fucking emails being like,

1329
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:52,010
I downloaded it illegally. Hahaha. But
just want to let you know I enjoyed it.

1330
01:19:52,011 --> 01:19:54,670
And it's just like, man, it doesn't
matter what standup up specials anymore.

1331
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:57,680
It gets at this part because I'm not
selling my fucking DVDs. But anyways,

1332
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:01,430
the great duff mckagan has got a
new album out called tenderness,

1333
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:05,780
comes out May 31st he'll be on a Philly,

1334
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,430
Philly, DC, Boston, New York,

1335
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:12,930
Chicago, Nashville, Austin, Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Portland, Seattle.

1336
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,780
Then you go check them out on the
road and check out his new album.

1337
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,130
It's better day.

1338
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,490
Leave it all behind you.

1339
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,810
Nothing left to say.

1340
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:37,680
It's all been shot through

1341
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:44,663
living

1342
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:55,060
other fool. Look up

1343
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:58,360
Scott's blue.
Never

1344
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:07,683
[inaudible] the truth.

1345
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:21,963
[inaudible] scanning.

1346
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:26,790
Tell soon the Nadis come through.

1347
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,420
Never know.

1348
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,513
[inaudible]

1349
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:43,390
Hey, what's going on? It's
built burn. It's the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

1350
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:46,000
May 16th,
2011.

1351
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:51,010
Another beautiful week in the month of
May. Has the nice weather hit you yet?

1352
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:56,350
Go outside Cheryl. It's so
fucking nice out. Oh my God.

1353
01:21:56,351 --> 01:22:00,670
I was out there and my fucking
flip flops I had on a wife beater.

1354
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,010
My fucking left titty was hanging
out right. And I went down,

1355
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,820
I went down to the fucking post office.
I saw Kevin,

1356
01:22:09,821 --> 01:22:13,390
I saw mark.
Um,

1357
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:16,690
I am beyond punchdrunk.
I uh,

1358
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:21,900
I'm in the midst of a two week absolute
fucking terror of a travel schedule.

1359
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:27,700
Um,
basically in 15 days I have six flights.

1360
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,980
All right. I just pause there. So
all my travelers out there could,

1361
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:36,970
could just go la dude, what the fuck? Yes.

1362
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:42,130
Six flights, six flights. It was
seven, but then something worked out,

1363
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:43,750
worked out where I uh,

1364
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:46,660
stayed an extra day when I was
shooting an episode of Glee.

1365
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:50,200
I really hope you guys like my
episodes ugly glee because a,

1366
01:22:50,201 --> 01:22:52,460
I was getting a little self conscious
with some of the shit that they were

1367
01:22:52,461 --> 01:22:56,650
sending, making me wear, by the
way. And this is just an acting gig.

1368
01:22:56,651 --> 01:23:00,070
This has nothing to do with
me as a comedian. All right,
so I don't want to hear,

1369
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:05,080
dude, you're fucking sold out. Has
nothing to do with my acting. I mean Mike,

1370
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,260
my like stand up comedy
that I'm on that show.

1371
01:23:08,261 --> 01:23:12,600
All I can say is I'm glad that
I stopped boozing because a,

1372
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,080
I'm not going to say I
was wearing a half shirt,

1373
01:23:14,081 --> 01:23:19,030
but let's just say my shirt didn't
quite reach my genes. You know, the,

1374
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:23,170
the sizes run a little bit
small over there. But anyways,

1375
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,031
anyways,
yeah,

1376
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:28,780
we were shooting out in fucking New Mexico
for this peewee Herman thing that we

1377
01:23:28,781 --> 01:23:31,810
were doing, the Mexican hat
dance, little little number there.

1378
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:36,700
Suppose this so fucked right.
So I basically,

1379
01:23:36,701 --> 01:23:39,190
last week I went la to New Mexico,

1380
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:44,191
New Mexico to a fucking Washington DC
and then back to lax and like an asshole.

1381
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,770
Here's a little travel tip
for all you peoples out there.

1382
01:23:50,771 --> 01:23:54,400
For those of you who don't
follow me on Twitter, um,

1383
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:59,080
when you fly into DC,
do yourself a favor.

1384
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:02,470
Fly into Ronald Reagan airport.
Reagan,

1385
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:04,180
that's the one you want to fly into.

1386
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:07,600
Don't fly in to Washington Dulles.

1387
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:11,980
Do not repeat.
Do not fly into Washington Dulles.

1388
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:16,180
I don't give a fuck how much you save.
All right?

1389
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:20,590
It's a fucking $60 cab ride. It's
like, it's, I don't know what to say.

1390
01:24:20,591 --> 01:24:24,880
It'd be like if you flying to New York
City and you flew into his slip instead

1391
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:28,270
at five o'clock and hit fucking rush hour,

1392
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,280
I forget it every goddamn time
I go to DC every fucking time.

1393
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:34,990
And even as I'm landing, I'm going. Yeah,

1394
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,480
it's kind of like a house isn't
only a half hour cab ride. No,

1395
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:43,810
it's like a fucking 50 minute cab ride
and that's with no traffic whatsoever.

1396
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:48,730
So do yourself a favor.
Do that. Fly into Reagan.

1397
01:24:48,731 --> 01:24:53,140
You come right in, goddamn buzzed.
The fucking White House, you know,

1398
01:24:53,141 --> 01:24:58,030
federal reserves right down
the street and a you land.

1399
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:01,450
You're right fucking there and everything
is all good. But for the love of God,

1400
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:06,250
do not. I repeat, do not go to
Washington, Dallas. It is a motherfucker.

1401
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:10,180
All right.
Flying to Washington Dulles.

1402
01:25:10,181 --> 01:25:13,300
If you actually want to go
to Philadelphia, that, that
would be my suggestion.

1403
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:14,800
But other than that, it
was, it's a nightmare.

1404
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:18,220
So this week I got the
second half of that episode.

1405
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:24,160
So this week I fly La to Mexico,
help Albuquerque, New Mexico.

1406
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:28,720
And then I fly to Albuquerque,
New Mexico to New York City.

1407
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:31,840
I do four days of Caroline's comedy club,

1408
01:25:31,841 --> 01:25:36,730
and then I fly all the way back across
the country on Monday. All right.

1409
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,200
And then guess what?

1410
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:43,330
I'm fucking out in La for a week
and then I'm on vacation vacation.

1411
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:47,830
Just like Axl fucking Foley vacation.
I am on vacation.

1412
01:25:47,831 --> 01:25:52,150
I'm getting my fucking Mumford fucking
sweatshirt out and fuck everybody.

1413
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:57,270
I've gone on vacation. All right.
I'm going up to a Goddamn Lake.

1414
01:25:58,110 --> 01:26:00,460
Uh, put my little touch,
sees in the fucking water,

1415
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:05,540
hang in there with Nino and my
fucking dog and I'm not doing shit.

1416
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,680
I'm going to go on youtube,

1417
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:10,010
learn how to fish cause I grew up in the
goddamn suburbs and even know how to do

1418
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:14,510
that. So feel free to
send me some emails, Dude.

1419
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:17,570
Oh my God. You know the fish. No,

1420
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,090
I doubt I don't.

1421
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:23,510
That's like me saying to you will you
didn't know who was an express train.

1422
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:28,370
You fucking moron.
Stay up the middle platform.

1423
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,080
Your idiot. It's fucking easy. Right?

1424
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,160
Is that a way to teach them my
peaking on my levels here? God dammit.

1425
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:37,010
I swear to God.
In this upcoming year,

1426
01:26:37,011 --> 01:26:40,830
I am going to get somebody
to help me with my mixer. Um,

1427
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:45,170
by the way, speaking of which, um, if you
want to send me any emails, all right?

1428
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:47,690
You want some advice for me?
I don't know why you would,

1429
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:50,670
I know why you would because you're not
going to take it, but you like the way I,

1430
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,280
I give out advice. You're like, wow,

1431
01:26:52,281 --> 01:26:55,730
at least I'm not as dumb as
him and my own fucked up way.

1432
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,100
I make you feel better about yourself.
Right?

1433
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:02,480
If you want to send me a list
of underrated, overrated and uh,

1434
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,950
Yada, Yada, Yada, all that bullshit,

1435
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:09,970

all the emails to that fucking thing.

1436
01:27:11,511 --> 01:27:13,020

The gentleman who helps

1443
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:33,800

1444
01:27:35,110 --> 01:27:35,943

1447
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:45,940

1448
01:27:46,030 --> 01:27:48,850
I actually have a donation button. All

01:27:57,570 --> 01:27:58,403

How about that?

1455
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:09,833
MMM.

1456
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:12,940
Oh, you fucking bastard.
Where's this information?

1457
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:20,140
I'm the worst. I really am. The worst.
Why do you guys listen to this shit? Is,

1458
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:23,700
is this, is this the fucking entertaining
part where bill makes you feel smarter?

1459
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:26,790
Huh? That go fuck yourself. Whatever.

1460
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:29,610
Go to the Amen podcast.com I'm
show they have the link there.

1461
01:28:33,630 --> 01:28:35,940
See, and I wonder, I
have the balls to wonder.

1462
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,250
I have the balls to sit there and watch
TV and be like, why aren't, why aren't,

1463
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:42,450
why aren't I where that guy is?
You know,

1464
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:47,310
because you're disorganized, Bill
and you stutter. Other than that,

1465
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:52,740
you should be taking this
business by fucking storm. Um,

1466
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:54,900
all right, so what are we
going to talk about this week?

1467
01:28:54,901 --> 01:28:58,500
Let's talk about my fucking
unbelievable weekend. I, um,

1468
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:04,550
I got to work with Jim Norton Breuer
and Dave Attell at constitution hall.

1469
01:29:04,561 --> 01:29:06,210
I told you guys that Eddie Murphy,

1470
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:10,110
speaking of Axel Foley and Mumford
sweatshirts a, he did delirious there.

1471
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:11,700
Chris rock did bring the pain,

1472
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,560
only two of the greatest
specials of all fucking time. Um,

1473
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:20,950
I got to perform on that stage,
man. And I, I can't even tell you,

1474
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:25,290
I can't even explain it. It'd be like,
you guys, do you ever do that shit?

1475
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:30,030
You ever get to take a tour of like a
baseball stadium and they let you down on

1476
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:32,760
the field for half a second.
You can't fucking believe you down there.

1477
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:35,400
It was the same thing.
It was just stand up version of that.

1478
01:29:35,401 --> 01:29:39,270
As I was doing my set was kind of
looking around the stage and I'm like,

1479
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:43,920
you know, oh right there. That's where
he dropped the microphone when he said,

1480
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:46,050
it's hot up here. And so he
said, take your clothes off.

1481
01:29:46,051 --> 01:29:48,990
And he dropped the mic and laughed.
I remember that walking away,

1482
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,570
I could barely concentrate on my act.

1483
01:29:51,571 --> 01:29:56,250
I had all I could do to not
say goonie Google. Huh? Gus,

1484
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:59,440
your wife is a fucking big
foot. Gus. What a fucked.

1485
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:01,290
And I think to say that
just out of nowhere,

1486
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,290
just to see if anybody would've
got it. Um, but anyways,

1487
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:08,640
I had a great time out there in DC.
As always popped into the Improv.

1488
01:30:08,641 --> 01:30:13,080
I did a quick little guest spot.
I saw my good friend from back in the day.

1489
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:15,300
Bob fucking Molly.

1490
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:17,110
Yeah.

1491
01:30:17,110 --> 01:30:20,230
Beast of a comic that I started
out with. And uh, I had a great,

1492
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:24,900
I had just had a great time out there.
Everybody crushed as always. And a,

1493
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:29,560
we actually went over to the
Pentagon, all four of us. And we, uh,

1494
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:33,820
went in there, we met a wound,
the wounded warriors sick.

1495
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:37,810
The men and women over went over to
Iraq and Afghanistan and got hurt.

1496
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:38,711
We got to talk to them.

1497
01:30:38,711 --> 01:30:41,770
We gave him some tickets to come out to
the show and I got to tell you stuff to

1498
01:30:41,771 --> 01:30:46,480
meeting those soldiers. You
know, everybody over there,

1499
01:30:46,481 --> 01:30:48,700
just the way they look. You
in the eye. Yes sir. No Sir.

1500
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:53,850
All though I don't think I've ever felt
like such a piece of shit as a human

1501
01:30:53,921 --> 01:30:58,720
being in my life. I was just like, I
have no discipline. I just, you know,

1502
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,960
I don't sit up straight.
These guys just,

1503
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:06,040
they would just kick in my ass straight
across the fucking board. And um,

1504
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:12,190
I really realized what a,
a pathetically insignificant life.

1505
01:31:12,191 --> 01:31:13,024
I'm leading.

1506
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:21,530
These people are down there, change
in the goddamn world. All right.

1507
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:26,270
Live in by like codes of honor.
I don't have a code of honor.

1508
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:31,470
You know what's my big thing?
Ah, don't fly in Reagan.

1509
01:31:31,471 --> 01:31:35,130
Don't fly in the Dulles
Salute to you America.

1510
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:38,060
You know what a fucking button.

1511
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:41,430
That's what I felt like a fucking bomb.

1512
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:44,880
And I can't even explain those guys.
They all, all those, all those soldiers,

1513
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:49,890
they all got that look in their
eye. You know, it's, it's, I can't,

1514
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:53,100
I can't fucking explain it. They
look at me. They could see it.

1515
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:56,400
Like this guy's soft looking at price
sleeps till 10 in the fucking morning.

1516
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:02,110
Rolling around his bed, bitching,
oh, I go to a podcast. I honestly,

1517
01:32:02,111 --> 01:32:04,180
I never felt so fucking
pathetic in my life.

1518
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:08,290
I remember reading rd Lang's book
too fat to fish and he had a caption

1519
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:12,400
underneath when he was on a plane
with a bunch of soldiers. He said,

1520
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,980
here's a picture of a bunch of guys
who are better than me. And I was like,

1521
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:19,390
oh Jesus Christ already the fuck.
Now I know what he was talking about.

1522
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:26,370
I'm a fucking loser. Everybody. So
feel better about yourself this week.

1523
01:32:26,371 --> 01:32:31,160
Everybody, um, I guess compared
to me. So anyways, yeah,

1524
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:32,130
it was great. Yeah, we went there,

1525
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:36,530
we had a great show and I want to
thank everybody for coming out. And uh,

1526
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:40,000
once again, I went on the road,
every one and I, and I, and I'm, um,

1527
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:43,530
I'm fighting the battle against you,
the bulge.

1528
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:48,450
And I'm not talking about my stomach.
I'm talking about my fucking squash.

1529
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:53,580
All right? That, that's the
big goddamn thing is a guy.

1530
01:32:53,581 --> 01:32:56,610
If you want to age gracefully.
All right,

1531
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:59,280
you got to make sure the
poundage of your head,

1532
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:03,860
you got to keep it level member last
week and I was telling you about Ebay

1533
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,710
Malmsteen how big his fucking head is now
and he's still trying to get away with

1534
01:33:07,711 --> 01:33:10,320
wearing those leather goddamn
pants and his booties.

1535
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:16,230
He looks ridiculous or he looks like,
oh he looks like a hoard up. Ah,

1536
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:18,770
ah.
What the fuck is her name?

1537
01:33:18,771 --> 01:33:22,990
That chick big head from that
Shell fish way back in the day. Um,

1538
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:25,690
best podcast sucks. You know
what? Normally I'd abandon it,

1539
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:28,540
but I don't have the fucking time cause
I have to catch 19 flights this week.

1540
01:33:28,541 --> 01:33:31,540
So you know what? We're going to plow
through it. I'm going to see it through

1541
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:36,180
like a fucking soldier going to
soldier my way through this one.

1542
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:37,530
Another rock star.

1543
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,040
I'm just going to pick on rockstars
and next week I'll pick on it.

1544
01:33:41,041 --> 01:33:44,460
You guys can give me some, give me some
actors that you've seen over the years.

1545
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:49,800
Male actors whose heads just
got fucking gigantic val Kilmer.

1546
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:53,470
Val Kilmer didn't do shit.
He just fucking eat.

1547
01:33:53,471 --> 01:33:55,030
You know was the last time he had a salad.

1548
01:33:56,150 --> 01:33:59,770
You seen that hunk of fucking roast
beef sitting on top of his goddamn head.

1549
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:05,580
It's unbelievable. Here's one for
you, Brian Setzer. Sally saves.

1550
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:07,090
Damn the guy from the stray cats.

1551
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:10,690
I don't know what the fuck happened to
his head and I'll tell you who's halfway

1552
01:34:10,691 --> 01:34:15,070
there. Is that Billie Joe Guy from
the fucking green day? You know,

1553
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:18,670
she's got the exact same build. Is that
dude? It's the fuck. It's the worst.

1554
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:23,020
Both of them full heads of hair. I'm
jealous, but none of them. They're not.

1555
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:25,230
They're not having salads.
They're out there on the road day.

1556
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,193
They're eating the fucking,

1557
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:31,060
they're eating the potato skins that had
just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

1558
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:35,590
That's why they switch every once they
switched from playing like an SG or a Les

1559
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:39,040
Paul, they go to that big, what
the the s three 30 you know,

1560
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:42,170
I like the sound of the old
Chuck Berry Song. No yet don't.

1561
01:34:42,171 --> 01:34:45,680
You got a giant fucking head and now
it looks like you're playing a Ukulele,

1562
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:47,900
so you got to go to a bigger guitar.
I see what you're doing,

1563
01:34:50,290 --> 01:34:52,830
Vince Neil,
there's another guy,

1564
01:34:53,550 --> 01:34:57,120
I saw them when they went out and they
opened for Aerosmith like five years ago.

1565
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:58,100
I was just sitting there going,

1566
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:00,410
when did his heads get as
big as fucking Nikki Sixx?

1567
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:03,920
Nikki Sixx can have a big head that
guys like fucking six foot four.

1568
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:08,600
You know what I mean?
The fuck am I talking about?

1569
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:10,640
I'm talking about old people
with big heads people.

1570
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:14,300
That's what I'm talking about and I'm
talking about how at some point you gotta

1571
01:35:14,301 --> 01:35:18,050
be man enough to eat a fucking salad
every once in awhile. That's the key.

1572
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:22,040
Just once a day, just go out.
Just get a fucking chef salad.

1573
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:26,120
If you've got to throw some Balsamic
vinegarette on it and for Christ's sake,

1574
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:31,190
eat a goddamn salad before you walking
down the street scare and children with

1575
01:35:31,191 --> 01:35:33,800
that Goddamn Jacqueline and
sitting on your fucking head.

1576
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:38,090
You know you want to win at paint ball.

1577
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:41,900
You want to stop getting knocked out early
in the game? You eat a fucking salad,

1578
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,153
private

1579
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:50,210
Jay Joe's age. Christ. What the fuck
is that on top of your head? Oh Shit.

1580
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:52,900
All right, Gina. Head that fucking bitch.

1581
01:35:53,340 --> 01:35:56,280
That right there is why I never joined
the military. There's no fuck away.

1582
01:35:56,281 --> 01:35:59,580
I could stand there and get
screamed at like that, you know?

1583
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:03,090
Then they'd slap the shit out of
me. Then I get a concussion. Right.

1584
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,680
And I'd be like one of the,
and then of course,

1585
01:36:04,681 --> 01:36:07,590
you know they make you come
back too soon in the military.

1586
01:36:07,591 --> 01:36:10,710
Forget about and fucking NFL football
over the years you've got to come right

1587
01:36:10,711 --> 01:36:15,120
back.
Put that Goddamn baret on [inaudible].

1588
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:19,890
Geez a, where did they find a fucking
Marae for that fucking squash?

1589
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:22,520
Pick it up.

1590
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:29,040
Well, it's at a toilet seat
cover. You think it's funny?

1591
01:36:29,170 --> 01:36:33,180
You think it's fun and boy slap me
in the fucking head again backing up.

1592
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,253
Okay,

1593
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:38,570
dude, why do you keep knocking it off
my fucking head? If you want me to put,

1594
01:36:38,571 --> 01:36:41,420
there's no fucking way. There's no
way. You know, my ego would tell me,

1595
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:44,030
look at this old motherfucker,
you know,

1596
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:46,550
skinny little guy with
his fucking bird chest.

1597
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:48,940
Huh?
You're white chest area.

1598
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:52,430
Do you think you're gonna yell at me and
knocked my little hat off front of all

1599
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:57,430
these fucking people that had just met.
Sorry.

1600
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:01,813
Um, anyways, is

1601
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:04,150
podcast for this week
and uh, you know, it's,

1602
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:06,970
you know what's funny about having
all the fucking free time I do.

1603
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,390
I have all these, I only, I
work every other week. People,

1604
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:13,720
I'm one of the laziest mother fuckers
you ever gonna meet in your life? Okay.

1605
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:15,130
I'm sitting here right now.

1606
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:20,200
I'm doing this podcast at four 37 La
time in the afternoon and I'm still in my

1607
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:23,580
pajamas and wearing pajama bottoms.
Yeah.

1608
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,100
All right.
For people like me to paint a picture.

1609
01:37:26,101 --> 01:37:29,520
And I got my little Tribeca film festival
tee shirt on. That's what I'm doing.

1610
01:37:29,521 --> 01:37:30,870
Drinking a little coconut water,

1611
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:35,520
which one of my listeners said that he
actually went out and listened to and uh,

1612
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,530
he fell, I forget how he
put it. Something about,

1613
01:37:37,531 --> 01:37:41,490
he felt like he was drinking out
of Momar Qaddafi's ass, I believe.

1614
01:37:41,491 --> 01:37:44,280
Is that how he, that's how he
described pure coconut water.

1615
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:46,740
I think it tastes delicious.
Hang on a second.

1616
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:52,400
Ah, oh, that's good stuff.
Oh, that's good stuff.

1617
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,710
Um, anyways, so despite the fact that
I only work every other goddamn week,

1618
01:37:59,250 --> 01:38:00,083
I swear to God,

1619
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:05,610
anytime anything cool is
happening in La and in La, in La.

1620
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:07,590
And I'm like,
I'm going to go to that shit.

1621
01:38:08,700 --> 01:38:12,690
I'm going to take a night off from this
fucking business and I'm going to go to

1622
01:38:12,691 --> 01:38:13,860
that shit every time.

1623
01:38:13,861 --> 01:38:18,690
It's always when I'm out of town and
this week is no different. All right.

1624
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:21,000
Listen to this shit.
I'm down the club the other night,

1625
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:26,100
minding my own fucking business. I want to
go down there, right? I want to go down,

1626
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:29,220
I want to tell some jokes,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1627
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,020
And somebody comes up to me and he goes,
dude,

1628
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:34,200
you're not going to believe what they
have at the fucking La sports arena.

1629
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:38,480
I'm Mike. I'm like, what?
What's, what's coming up.

1630
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:41,240
La Sports and me with a fucking
clippers used to play as like, yeah,

1631
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:46,190
evidently they're doing some UFC fight.
I swear to God this isn't a movie.

1632
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,660
All right, this is actually
real. You guys into MMA,

1633
01:38:50,661 --> 01:38:53,780
you under that type of shit
course. You are right. Who is it?

1634
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:56,270
Who doesn't like to watch
two guys with shaved heads?

1635
01:38:56,570 --> 01:39:00,700
Just beat the living shit out
of each other. Um, don't want,

1636
01:39:00,710 --> 01:39:03,740
I set one time when I was talking about
that, like the UFC style of fighting.

1637
01:39:03,741 --> 01:39:07,010
What I love about it is a, I think
I might've said this on the podcast,

1638
01:39:07,011 --> 01:39:09,650
I can't remember.
I'm going to blame it on all the altitude.

1639
01:39:10,250 --> 01:39:14,540
My dried out skin from the
fucking pressurized air. But uh,

1640
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:18,140
when I watched those UFC
fights and you see somebody,

1641
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:22,700
you see those guys where they got the
cardio there in ridiculous fucking shape,

1642
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:27,770
they can strike, they can take it down
to the ground, they can submit you,

1643
01:39:27,771 --> 01:39:31,550
they can knock you the fuck out.
And that's what I was, you know,

1644
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:33,650
I always look at that
shit and just be like,

1645
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:38,540
that dude right there on
fucking rape bubble, right?

1646
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:41,900
Who's kitten heel that, that's
the big thing. That's why you,

1647
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:44,690
you keep going in martial arts as a man.

1648
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:46,820
Do you want to be on fucking rape bubble?

1649
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:48,713
You know?

1650
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:53,570
And why is that? Because my
generation, when we first got cable,

1651
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:57,290
every other movie that was on cable,
especially Cinemax,

1652
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:02,320
always involved some fucking regular
dude go into prison for a crime he didn't

1653
01:40:04,341 --> 01:40:08,300
commit.
And then let people try to fucking,

1654
01:40:08,301 --> 01:40:11,480
they strive to try to stick
that Dixon is ash, you know,

1655
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:14,690
then he's got to fight back and blah,
blah blah.

1656
01:40:14,810 --> 01:40:18,380
And of course he always fucking
wins except Shawshank redemption,

1657
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:21,230
which is why that was such a great movie,

1658
01:40:22,610 --> 01:40:23,443
you know,

1659
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:28,640
is Tim Robbins. You know, sometimes
he won, sometimes he didn't. You know,

1660
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:31,400
Jesus Christ, think about that. You
know the expression, hey, you win some,

1661
01:40:31,401 --> 01:40:34,640
you lose some.
Now we're going onto faded.

1662
01:40:37,490 --> 01:40:40,970
But uh, yeah, the, all those fucking
movies, you know, always are about that.

1663
01:40:40,971 --> 01:40:43,910
So I said that, I said that to somebody
one time a guy yells, fucking guys,

1664
01:40:43,911 --> 01:40:46,670
you know what? Those guys out of their
fucking on rape of will they go to prison?

1665
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:51,140
I don't give a shit what you do. You come
out and stand it up. You come at him,

1666
01:40:51,141 --> 01:40:54,040
fuck. He try to shoot their legs,
they'll fuck that choke you out.

1667
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,620
You'll end up getting raped.
You know,

1668
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:03,240
it's like when the lions go after one of
those fucking one of those buffalo and

1669
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:06,330
they're pouting on and all of a sudden
that thing just whips around and the th

1670
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:10,330
the Goddamn Tiger takes a horn to his
side or the lion does and then the lion

1671
01:41:10,331 --> 01:41:12,280
dies and he's like,
wait a minute,

1672
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:16,840
I thought I was killing you and then you
fucking shank me. We got it, Bill. Fuck,

1673
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:19,780
we got to get on with it. So someone
told me the other day, I was saying,

1674
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:23,230
those fucking guys unbreakable
and this dude was like, Nah man.

1675
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:28,270
I like, what do you mean? No? How the
fuck are you going to take that guy out?

1676
01:41:28,271 --> 01:41:32,050
And he said, listen. And he goes
inside. If they want to get you,

1677
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,180
they're going to get you that Mike.
Like what?

1678
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:37,630
Why the fuck you going to get that guy?
I didn't give a shit.

1679
01:41:37,631 --> 01:41:40,240
If you've got three guys, Adam, he's
still, he's gonna fucking knock them out.

1680
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:42,850
Superman punch a fucking knee to the head,

1681
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:47,800
rear naked choke and it's over and the
guy goes, Nah. You know they, they're,

1682
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:52,780
they put stuff in your food. They
drug you that I, I can't even say it.

1683
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:56,440
Just like, uh, it just,

1684
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:01,120
it killed me when somebody said that
they, they put drugs in your food.

1685
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:04,990
It just didn't even seem fates. I
can't even explain it. It was like,

1686
01:42:05,020 --> 01:42:08,050
I looked at those guys like they were
fucking superheroes and it's like, really?

1687
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:12,190
Those guys would get fucked too.
That's brutal.

1688
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:15,730
So I had to adjust my worship
and just be like, you know what?

1689
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:19,660
All it's just going to happen.
It only happens at present,

1690
01:42:19,661 --> 01:42:23,440
but as long as you don't break the laws
or get fucking blame for some shit you

1691
01:42:23,441 --> 01:42:27,970
didn't do, you are unfucking rape bubble.
Jesus Christ. Bill, where's this going?

1692
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:30,730
I'll tell you where it's going.
So that MMA shit,

1693
01:42:30,731 --> 01:42:32,920
I've always wanted to go to something
like that, right? So this guy tells me,

1694
01:42:32,921 --> 01:42:35,770
he goes, this is what they have. And
not only are they having this MMA

1695
01:42:37,450 --> 01:42:40,900
fights down at the La Coliseum,
back with the old, uh,

1696
01:42:40,901 --> 01:42:44,440
the La Clippers used to play before
the staples center. I swear to God,

1697
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:48,570
this is the matchup.
It's cops versus cons.

1698
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:53,470
And once again, this is not a movie
starring snake plus plus skin.

1699
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:57,500
This is an actual fucking event.
There have,

1700
01:42:57,810 --> 01:43:02,810
haven't police officers fight ex
convicts MMA style in an octagon.

1701
01:43:04,650 --> 01:43:08,880
Tell me you're not fucking going to
that if you're anywhere near Los Angeles

1702
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:13,870

This guy's telling me this
shit out. I'm like, are you,

1703
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:18,300

it's May 21st of course,

1705
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:27,600
I'm at Caroline's.
So we here at the mm podcasts where like,

1706
01:43:27,601 --> 01:43:31,980
you know something that sounds
like some shit that if I can't go,

1707
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:34,410
my listeners would love to fucking go to.

1708
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:37,020
So I'm going to give you the
fucking information on this shit.

1709
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:41,700
It's May 21st La sports
arena. It's cops, verse cons.

1710
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:45,540
Go to cops,
verse cons.com listen in.

1711
01:43:45,541 --> 01:43:49,080
It's an all day event to this.
I'm telling you,

1712
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:52,480
I don't know why this isn't
being and put on Hbo it,

1713
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:55,370
they're going to have a bunch
of bunch of music down there.

1714
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:59,690
They got fucking tattoo
artists. I mean, it's just a,

1715
01:43:59,691 --> 01:44:03,980
it is a white trash.
This is like the white trash Olympics.

1716
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:08,660
And then you get to fight the cop who
busted you for fucking not paying child

1717
01:44:08,661 --> 01:44:13,370
support. The hosts are Danny. Uh,

1718
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:13,970
what did you say?

1719
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:18,710
Danny Trejo did the star of machete
and a tiny lister who played Debo from

1720
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:23,450
Fridays. It just keeps getting better.
So we actually contacted them, said, hey,

1721
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:26,120
you know what? We want to hike this
fucking thing. So he said, fine.

1722
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:28,910
Let them know where we're
at. Go to the, uh, cops,

1723
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:32,690
verse [inaudible] Dot Com there's a bunch
of different tickets, 30 bucks and up.

1724
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:36,380
You can watch cops fight convicts.

1725
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:40,760
I can't believe I'm gonna
fucking miss this. This is,

1726
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:44,320
I'm hoping this is going
to be such a huge, uh,

1727
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:47,540
a huge fucking hit that,
uh,

1728
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:51,680
that I don't fault that they got
to fucking do it again because

1729
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:56,810
I don't know. But so basically the
tickets are 30 bucks on up and if you,

1730
01:44:56,811 --> 01:44:59,570
if you buy the hundred dollar tickets so
you can get right down there and listen

1731
01:44:59,571 --> 01:45:03,650
to them shit talk or whatever. Uh,
just mentioned the m m podcast,

1732
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:07,160
the P,
and they'll give you a 25 bucks off it.

1733
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:10,270
So all it will cost is,
uh,

1734
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:15,950
just cost you 75 bucks. What the fuck is
this? Did I give out the wrong website?

1735
01:45:15,951 --> 01:45:20,480
I am really, I am the fucking worst
if I gave out the wrong websites.

1736
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:22,040
[inaudible] dot com right.

1737

1745

Whatever it's,
but it's cops.

1746
01:46:08,231 --> 01:46:11,050
It's cops fighting for convicts
that I can't believe I'm gonna Miss.

1747
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,520
This shit's really bugging
the shit out of me.

1748
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:14,650
There's gonna be a bunch of
rappers down there, too short.

1749
01:46:14,651 --> 01:46:17,800
All these guys and I'm gonna miss it.
You know,

1750
01:46:17,801 --> 01:46:21,430
they should've got down there to fucking
hosted in character would have been

1751
01:46:21,431 --> 01:46:26,320
fucking snake listing plus kid.
Who's that guy hosted?

1752
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:29,980
I mean, who's the actor who played
that? She's married to Goldie Hawn.

1753
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,180
Remember that chick private Benjamin.
She was on laughing.

1754
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:37,270
I remember looking at it going, you
know, she's riding it out. Look at her,

1755
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:39,340
she's riding it out.
She's keeping herself in shape.

1756
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:43,450
She's not going to go out and
get some fucking a bad face lift.

1757
01:46:43,451 --> 01:46:47,710
And what did she do? She went out there,
she went out and she got a face lift.

1758
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:50,190
And now the,
the nicest thing

1759
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:53,940
I could say about a face is
it looks animated. You know,

1760
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:56,610
I don't know if this is the right movie
cause I was get these movies wrong,

1761
01:46:56,611 --> 01:47:00,630
but she looks like she's in finding Nemo.
Nemo is that he say it.

1762
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:05,910
Nimo I dunno guys. I watch
sports. Okay, go fuck yourself.

1764
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,910
You could actually watch it live
if you can't make it for you.

1765
01:47:11,911 --> 01:47:15,420
MMA fans around the fucking world.
All right?

1766
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:19,350
They got a pay per view right there on

1769
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:29,380
And there's rumor that there
might be an mn podcast. Yeah.

1770
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:31,910
Banner hanging from the fucking raft.

1771
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:37,270
You liked that shit. This is what
I'm going to do on this podcast.

1772
01:47:37,340 --> 01:47:40,380
The shit that I advertise, I'm going to
tell fucking stories, make you laugh,

1773
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:43,650
slide in the fucking promo and it's
just going to be shit that I believe in.

1774
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:48,600
I believe in cops fighting cards in the,
the uh,

1775
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:52,170
the octagon. I think that that's
how they should settle it. You know,

1776
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:55,260
on the side of the road when they
do that shit where they, you know,

1777
01:47:55,261 --> 01:47:58,530
they show the video from the
state troopers thing, you know,

1778
01:47:59,550 --> 01:48:01,700
the state trooper's car and
all of a sudden the, the,

1779
01:48:01,701 --> 01:48:05,430
the regular traffic stop turns into a
fucking eight year sentence for assaulting

1780
01:48:05,431 --> 01:48:06,850
a police officer there.

1781
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:11,790
There ought to be like some sort of
signal that means not only do I disagree

1782
01:48:12,090 --> 01:48:16,950
with you pulling me over, um, I, I want
to fight you in an octagon. You know,

1783
01:48:16,951 --> 01:48:20,250
you make some sort of gesture and
then he gives you a police escort.

1784
01:48:20,251 --> 01:48:23,040
You follow them right over there
and then you guys go at it,

1785
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:26,970
you fight in the octagon and if you win,
you get no ticket.

1786
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:31,710
You get no ticket.
Hey look who just came walking in.

1787
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:35,590
If it isn't my lovely girlfriend,
how the fuck are you?

1788
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:40,950
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about? I'm
talking about that, that,

1789
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:45,870
that MMA match that I'm going to miss.
Which one? It's called cage for his cons.

1790
01:48:45,871 --> 01:48:47,650
It's over at the La sports arena.
I smoked.

1791
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:52,290
No. It's caught one of these
Monday, Monday, Monday. Yeah,

1792
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:56,730
that's exactly what it is.
No, but it's, it's, it's cops,

1793
01:48:57,390 --> 01:49:01,290
verse cons. Real cops,
real calls. Oh yeah.

1794
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,460
You've got to go away. You've got to go
that real, you know what you sound like.

1795
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:08,340
Cause I'm actually doing advertising.
We sound like we're doing like,

1796
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:10,320
like I'm selling some hunk of shit and

1797
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:16,800
that knife can cut through a cad
knowing chance. No, I swear to God.

1798
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:19,200
Uh, what do they got down there? This,

1799
01:49:19,370 --> 01:49:22,710
this is some of the matchups it's like
officers, somebody versus somebody else.

1800
01:49:22,711 --> 01:49:24,550
And it's,
this white dudes are not real.

1801
01:49:24,551 --> 01:49:29,130
Like they can't be real cops in real cons.
There's no way cause this is la.

1802
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:33,930
They're actors think so. Yeah.

1803
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:39,030
No awkward opposite Gonzalez
versus notorious brick. Slayton

I already fuck you want to see it?

1806

1810
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:08,280
and then it's the exact Sunday, Sunday,
Sunday. Listen to this shit. Here we go.

1811
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,980
Saturday May 21st couple of years.

1812
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:14,480
The event of the year versus
10 pro job breaking MMA fights.

1813
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:15,860
I'd be know a sports arena.

1814
01:50:16,010 --> 01:50:21,010
Main event versus cod fun performances
by 40 is that go room too short?

1815
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:25,000
Yes. Short. Oh, dog bounds.
St. There's something there.

1816
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:26,340
Fred was actually pretty cool.

1817
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:29,220
You want to get a tattoo
that you're going to regret?

1818
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:33,140
You know a little tramp stamp. Yeah,

1819
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:36,690
What else? What other shifts at when
is it too? I'm telling you can be,

1820
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:38,090
I'm not going to be here.
No,

1821
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:40,760
that would actually be fun to go and
then we could review it for the Mike.

1822
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:44,670
There you go. We can review it for your
listeners. Know I'm actually sending a

1824
01:50:49,771 --> 01:50:53,220

going to send my Rosebowl cruel down.

1825
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:55,800
Grew down there. That
was a great idea. It is.

1826
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:02,800
Sure. It is. No offense boys. I love

1828
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:08,070
these things that we're going
to start pumped telling you.

1829
01:51:08,071 --> 01:51:10,510
I'm taking this podcast to the next level.
I love it.

1830
01:51:10,511 --> 01:51:15,511
So I have my funniest love it drinking
buddies who were also comedians and,

1831
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,950
uh, Bart next just started
townies gigging, but I'm
going to have lie ahead and,

1832
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:20,820
uh,

1833
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:23,550
Sam Shipley's going to be the standing

1835
01:51:26,341 --> 01:51:29,010

some of the, uh, you know,

1836
01:51:29,011 --> 01:51:32,100
high Buckeye class people like myself
who it would be going down there.

1837
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:36,540
I can't fucking believe I'm not going to
be in here for this, but, uh, but anyways,

1838
01:51:37,110 --> 01:51:40,610
um, Nia, you've stopped by here and
we're, we're gonna, we're gonna,

1839
01:51:40,740 --> 01:51:42,330
you're gonna do a little
passing promo here.

1840
01:51:42,330 --> 01:51:45,420
What are we going to be doing tonight?
Okay. What am I going to go see with you?

1841
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:47,220
Cause I hadn't been in town
for the last couple of days.

1842
01:51:47,221 --> 01:51:50,040
So you guys are probably wondering
how do you keep it going? How do you,

1843
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:53,250
how do you keep them magical, you know,
you know you had to keep the spark.

1844
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:56,610
You fucking annoyed the shit out
of me today. What do you mean?

1845
01:51:56,790 --> 01:52:00,050
You know what I mean?
I was talking about earlier when you,

1846
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,130
you kept putting off
that vibe that you would,

1847
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:05,160
you were annoyed by my general.

1848
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:10,160
I was not present. Yeah you
were. I was just busy, you know,

1849
01:52:10,170 --> 01:52:14,520
I want to say I wanted to get up
and do it on the road for like five,

1850
01:52:14,521 --> 01:52:17,470
six days and I'm thinking, oh
she's gonna. I thought you want to,

1851
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:18,421
you want to kiss me?

1852
01:52:18,421 --> 01:52:21,390
Like that chick who kissed that dude
and Times Square when the war ended,

1853
01:52:22,380 --> 01:52:23,850
that's what I thought was going to happen.

1854
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:28,110
You haven't been gone that long
though. Oh Jesus. It's over. It's over.

1855
01:52:28,820 --> 01:52:29,431
No,
I just,

1856
01:52:29,431 --> 01:52:33,030
I wanted to get up and go to the farmer's
market and I had to wash my hair.

1857
01:52:33,031 --> 01:52:35,560
I had a whole thing. The only time
that you should have been mad at me,

1858
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:39,990
it was the was after I'd already annoyed
you'd like five times and at one point

1859
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:43,460
you were in the shower.
Did you say annoyed me? How
many times? Like five. Okay.

1860
01:52:43,650 --> 01:52:46,040
I just want the record to show
that you, that you annoyed. Yeah.

1861
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:50,750
Five times its full course of mourning
that you're supposedly fucking annoying.

1862
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:54,980
I didn't think of this was about me.
I thought it was about, you know,

1863
01:52:54,981 --> 01:52:57,080
it's about you being
being a jerk this morning.

1864
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:00,080
This is the only thing I will admit
that was wrong was when you were in the

1865
01:53:00,081 --> 01:53:03,500
middle of showering and I came walking
in with the cold cuts and I said,

1866
01:53:03,501 --> 01:53:06,930
hey smell this chicken. Does this
smell like it went back in the shower.

1867
01:53:07,230 --> 01:53:10,770
I love taking like baths and showers.
It's like my whole relaxation,

1868
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:15,690
like being cleaned, get to the fucking
fancy soaps and I'm in there and you know,

1869
01:53:15,691 --> 01:53:20,190
enjoying myself and who fucking barges
in the bathroom opens up the shower,

1870
01:53:20,191 --> 01:53:23,250
stall, shower, stall, door thrust,

1871
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:27,330
a package of old ass lunch meat
in my face practically is like,

1872
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:31,800
does this smooth 40,
taking a shower. Okay.

1873
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:36,690
What are you doing? I'm trying to shower.
I have a bad sense of smell. I know,

1874
01:53:36,691 --> 01:53:39,660
but you kind of have a really
bad sense of smell. Well,

1875
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:43,380
I'm doing my episode of Glee in a
couple days and I don't want to get uh,

1876
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:47,000
some Nella. I don't want to get
fucking a, yeah, well if you

1877
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:52,940
see right here so he could really
tie, came out of the shower, whatever.

1878
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:56,070
We're going to see bridesmaids tonight.
This is how,

1879
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,630
and Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph,

1880
01:53:57,820 --> 01:54:01,320
this is how long I've been out
of town that I actually agreed.

1881
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:06,210
She goes, do you want to see bridesmaid
tonight? Now of course my brain was like,

1882
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:11,040
no, it's produced by Judd Apatow.
Okay. So nick is any of that.

1883
01:54:11,070 --> 01:54:13,920
He's never in it. He's the
director. All right. Well,

1884
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,080
he didn't direct the movie
produced. All right, well,

1885
01:54:16,081 --> 01:54:18,690
any of those other guys in it,
I don't know.

1886
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:22,740
That's Rogan and fucking
Paul Rudd and those guys.

1887
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:27,090
It's just going to be a bunch of broad,
it's just like slap stick.

1888
01:54:27,091 --> 01:54:29,640
My Big Fat Greek wedding.
Is this what it's going to be?

1889
01:54:29,850 --> 01:54:32,670
Put it like this Judd
Apatow produced this movie.

1890
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:36,360
So whatever you think that it's going
to be thinking about the fact that he

1891
01:54:36,361 --> 01:54:40,370
produced it. I think the idea. All right.

1892
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:45,480
You take a sippy, a big, uh,
a big mug full of wine too.

1893
01:54:46,170 --> 01:54:50,720
You got a big mug full of something.
Have you had some questions from a no.

1894
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:53,490
You want, you want it? You want to, do
you want to do what advice one? Yes, I do.

1895
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,580
Okay, we'll do it. Advice one
and then, uh, then that'll be a,

1896
01:54:56,581 --> 01:55:00,690
that'll be the little Nini segment
here for the fucking week. Um,

1897
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:04,910
let me see if I got one that actually
involves men and women, men and women.

1898
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:07,680
Like I'm not going to see enough fucking
broad center and the goddamn movie.

1899
01:55:08,430 --> 01:55:12,420
If there's, if there's one period
joke, I'm walking out, I'm walking out,

1900
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:17,040
does this make me look fat? If somebody
cries for no fucking reason and goes,

1901
01:55:17,070 --> 01:55:20,760
oh my God, I love your guys, you
know, that's happening in act three,

1902
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:25,350
I'm walking out, all right, I'm letting
you know I'm getting up and I'm walking.

1903
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:29,420
I'm storming out and you won't even hear
me drive away cause we have a hybrid of

1904
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:32,950
the Saturday night live people
a hem. Him, I am supporting.

1905
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,480
You think they want to do that fucking
movie? They need the money. Uh,

1906
01:55:36,530 --> 01:55:38,790
I haven't seen it. So actually somebody
told me it was fucking hilarious.

1907
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:43,500
All right, where am I hair? Uh, but,
but papa, Papa. All right here. Go.

1908
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:44,731
All right,
Bill.

1909
01:55:44,731 --> 01:55:47,640
One of my best friends has been going to
church for years and previously it has

1910
01:55:47,641 --> 01:55:50,640
never bothered me at all.
Low Gg. Um, I grew up,

1911
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:57,900
I grew up Catholic and like
so many Catholics I got raped.

1912
01:55:57,930 --> 01:56:01,470
No kidding. I no longer,
I no longer attend church,

1913
01:56:01,471 --> 01:56:04,170
but it doesn't bother me in the least.
If someone else wants to go,

1914
01:56:04,171 --> 01:56:08,310
this guy is the exact mindset than I am
except by make fun of people who go to

1915
01:56:08,311 --> 01:56:10,970
church a little bit, a
little bit. A few months ago,

1916
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:15,960
my friends started asking me if I would
like to go to church with him gay. Uh,

1917
01:56:15,961 --> 01:56:19,890
I plight. I politely declared that sets
a gay thing to do and I don't mean,

1918
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:24,810
I don't mean the how is it gay to ask
the want to go to church with you because

1919
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,340
you're both going to be wearing sweaters.

1920
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:30,900
You're going to be singing songs.

1921
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:35,750
You are the
[inaudible] au Lait Lou

1922
01:56:41,120 --> 01:56:41,460
[inaudible].

1923
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:44,080
You don't get to sit there and sing with
you have your fucking friend wearing a

1924
01:56:44,081 --> 01:56:49,030
sweater and then the priest up there, God
knows what he did, is going to be like,

1925
01:56:49,060 --> 01:56:54,010
hey, add a beard and some
long, Aaron, he cured a leper.

1926
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:59,170
None of you guys can do that.
So you better give us some money.

1927
01:57:01,460 --> 01:57:02,293
[inaudible]

1928
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:06,400
yeah, who are not making fun of mass
right now. It's not great to you.

1929
01:57:06,630 --> 01:57:10,180
It's nothing. Yes. Granted there are
some things that I've seen. Like what?

1930
01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:13,940
Not None of that horse shit,
that overly Boob, ugly,

1931
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:19,690
ugly, ugly to him. Well, it's like a
call and response. I'll tell you what,

1932
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:22,810
I'll tell you what fucking sacred.
Meaning the request of question.

1933
01:57:22,811 --> 01:57:25,240
Now you're getting the answer today.
I'll tell you what sacred.

1934
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:28,750
What's sacred is how you go out in the
playoffs. The Celtics went out with heart.

1935
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:33,190
We still lost their fucking, we still got
our ass. We still got our asses kicked.

1936
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,810
We still got our asses kicked. All right?
But there was no quit in that team.

1937
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:41,210
All right? Okay. That's
fucking sacred. What?

1938
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:43,390
Sac religious is what
the fucking Lakers did.

1939
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:46,510
And I'm at disrespect in the franchise.
I'm saying what? The couple of those?

1940
01:57:46,510 --> 01:57:49,570
And it wasn't all of them. What a,
it was really what buying them did.

1941
01:57:49,571 --> 01:57:51,550
I don't even think about
autumn did was bad. All right?

1942
01:57:51,580 --> 01:57:55,090
Can you just finish reading the
question? Jesus Christ. Really,

1943
01:57:55,091 --> 01:57:57,310
all of a sudden you're dictating it.
You asked me why.

1944
01:57:57,340 --> 01:58:01,360
So he wants to go to church
with me. With him. I repeat gay.

1945
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:04,960
I politely decline. Dude,
I'm not doing that shit. Um,

1946
01:58:05,270 --> 01:58:08,740
so filling in the blanks with
your own commentary or no,

1947
01:58:08,770 --> 01:58:11,860
that's not a part of the letter because
you're presenting and then a bias

1948
01:58:11,861 --> 01:58:14,260
fashion.
Just read it and then give your opinion.

1949
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:17,740
You see the shit that is
a classic fucking broad.

1950
01:58:17,770 --> 01:58:21,190
It's like I've been doing this shit for
four years and you're telling me how to

1951
01:58:21,191 --> 01:58:25,030
run it yet you have no idea how many
more on guys are going to send him hate

1952
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:29,500
mail because of that, because not because
you're a jerk. Because some other, well,

1953
01:58:29,501 --> 01:58:31,700
there are more options.
So I don't give a chaise.

1954
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:34,650
This is fucking elitist attitude.
Um,

1955
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:39,750
since then my friend has told me he feels
it's his mission to spread the word of

1956
01:58:40,451 --> 01:58:42,610
God.
Saying it like that

1957
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:51,460
and continues to ask me to go. They
got up, he drank the fucking Koolaid.

1958
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:54,640
Now he's a Zombie and as time passes,

1959
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:57,700
he's getting more aggressive
with this sales pitch.

1960
01:58:58,990 --> 01:59:03,140
That means he's probably reaching
out and like touching his hand. Uh,

1961
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:07,540
what started off with him just slipping
it into casual conversation as loud now

1962
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:11,470
led me to receiving text
messages that say the following,

1963
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:16,300
this means more to you.
This means more to me than you know,

1964
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:21,510
God has poured out love to me and he is
reaching out to you also ignore a few

1965
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:27,100
months, but there is a lot
at stake here. Wow. Yeah. No,

1966
01:59:27,101 --> 01:59:29,770
he has a little one. Yeah.
He's buying into that.

1967
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:34,030
Jesus is coming back and this
time he's not fucking around.

1968
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:38,440
It's personnel. Yeah, he, okay,

1969
01:59:38,441 --> 01:59:43,441
so he's buying into the rapture that
this hippie is going to come back on a

1970
01:59:43,541 --> 01:59:47,710
stegosaurus and just start killing
people, killing people. What they say,

1971
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:52,300
what they say is fucking wrong.
He's going to come back RAF.

1972
01:59:52,330 --> 01:59:56,980
One of the deadly sins,
judge's judgment is mind set at the Lord.

1973
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,290
He's the son.
He's the Donald Trump.

1974
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:02,740
He's got the fuck he's got to call them
over at this point, coming out of heaven.

1975
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:05,560
He didn't make that money.
He didn't make the fucking world.

1976
02:00:05,561 --> 02:00:10,090
He's just allowed Jack ass a
fucking fuck. You know, whatever.

1977
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:14,350
Cast me into the the fucking pits.
I don't give a shit. You know,

1978
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:18,250
you think I want to hang out with
you in heaven forever. Just go it.

1979
02:00:18,251 --> 02:00:21,760
Isn't this awesome? Yeah, it is awesome.

1980
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,560
Can you please finish the
letter? All right. What started
off. Okay, so here we go.

1981
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:31,660
Uh, to be to this. I replied,
honestly, it's it, if it's my choice,

1982
02:00:31,661 --> 02:00:34,000
I don't want to go,
please stop asking me about it.

1983
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:37,150
I don't know how many more ways I
can request that. There you go. Okay.

1984
02:00:37,270 --> 02:00:40,330
He responded with, I'll
hold off, but know this,

1985
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:43,870
God loves you and will not quit.
If I do.

1986
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:49,030
Okay, well then there's no
reason to hit me two times.

1987
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:53,530
Let's just let God do it. All right.
Anyways, here comes my question. Bill,

1988
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:56,920
why does this fucking Piss me off so much?
Why do these,

1989
02:00:57,130 --> 02:01:01,060
why are these cults do? Uh, what
do these cults do to these people?

1990
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:06,010
He's involved with the Church that people
do joke around with and call a cult.

1991
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:08,470
What would you do if you
were me at this point?

1992
02:01:08,471 --> 02:01:11,980
I don't even want to talk to this guy
cause he's conversations are infuriating

1993
02:01:11,981 --> 02:01:16,830
me. Um, yeah, I would, I would cut
this guy out of your life. Yeah,

1994
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:21,070
it's annoying. This is what I feel
that way. No, but this is his friend.

1995
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:24,420
This is his friend, his
friend and he, and he won.

1996
02:01:24,490 --> 02:01:26,050
He wants to get them out of the cult.

1997
02:01:26,051 --> 02:01:30,070
So the thing is is if you go to him
and you try to get them out of it,

1998
02:01:30,190 --> 02:01:32,140
you just going to drive
them further into it.

1999
02:01:32,141 --> 02:01:36,970
So what you do is just say he just
stopped being friends with them, you know,

2000
02:01:36,971 --> 02:01:40,580
and hope that that'll help because they're
not going to go out of that then he's

2001
02:01:40,581 --> 02:01:45,470
not going to leave it if you ask them to
leave it. Yeah. You never, you never know.

2002
02:01:45,471 --> 02:01:48,380
But yeah, he needs to just kind of
mouth cause yeah, there's no, you can't,

2003
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:53,570
unless he wants to spend the rest of his
time with this guy debating Catholicism

2004
02:01:53,571 --> 02:01:56,030
or whatever, which I'm sure he
doesn't want to do. And then yeah,

2005
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:59,240
he should just cut them off. Personally,
I would still hang out with them.

2006
02:01:59,450 --> 02:02:01,900
You would just so you could
get into debates with him? No.

2007
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:07,060
And I would just do unbelievably Shay
titanic and it can be a bit annoying shit.

2008
02:02:07,770 --> 02:02:10,220
I've good idea. I would, I
would, maybe you should do that.

2009
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:14,030
I would always have like shout
at the devil playing, you know,

2010
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:15,890
or maybe just that beginning cheesy thing.

2011
02:02:15,891 --> 02:02:19,460
She didn't invite you to call my women
to a restaurant and it turns out to be

2012
02:02:19,461 --> 02:02:22,160
like a strip club and see what he does.
Yeah,

2013
02:02:22,161 --> 02:02:26,300
but you're going to see the titties on
the outside gentleman's club. That's true.

2014
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:28,100
No, I wouldn't do that shit. I would just,

2015
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:30,440
I would hang out with
him and hang out with,

2016
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:34,010
I would keep saying I want to get involved
in the church and I would keep going

2017
02:02:34,011 --> 02:02:36,350
to events and I say we're going,
you know,

2018
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,640
I just feel so filled up with God's love.
I would then be a,

2019
02:02:40,641 --> 02:02:41,720
you want to talk about filled up.

2020
02:02:41,721 --> 02:02:45,530
I would fucking jerked off into this
chick's mouth less. I'm telling you,

2021
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:49,040
William Burns,
she had a big bass miles and I don't know,

2022
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:52,490
maybe it was a couple of days since
the last time I fucking, you know,

2023
02:02:52,491 --> 02:02:56,900
let them loose. But I right up to the
brim. She was a champion. She swallow.

2024
02:02:57,170 --> 02:03:02,090
I'm sorry, what were you saying?
This is why you're going now.

2025
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:07,730
Oh, why don't you pray for me? I will.
These fucking people, these people. Yeah.

2026
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:12,180
All, all those, all those things
are like, uh, they're just there.

2027
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,750
I don't know. It's, it's, it's a
cult. It's a fucking cult. I mean,

2028
02:03:17,751 --> 02:03:22,340
if it works for you, you know, I think
they just like wearing those old clothes.

2029
02:03:22,370 --> 02:03:25,280
You know?
It must be nice to drive a bicycle.

2030
02:03:27,610 --> 02:03:32,450
Talls banging against the fucking seat.
When you were growing up, did you never,

2031
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:37,150
I was an altar boy. I was an altar
girl. Yep. I was an altar boy. Yeah.

2032
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:40,730
That's the name of Mike. My mind,
my new book. Second Schuster.

2033
02:03:40,731 --> 02:03:44,750
I was an altar board. Yeah. And,
uh, I remember I used to do,

2034
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:48,290
I'd sit there and I would
ring the bells. Yup. You know,

2035
02:03:48,291 --> 02:03:52,580
I have to do the incense where you have
to take that ball that's on a string.

2036
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:55,550
It looks like one of those
medieval torture devices,
you know? And it's so, yeah.

2037
02:03:55,551 --> 02:04:00,050
I wish I, you know what it was I did
that chick, I was so bored in mass,

2038
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:03,200
you know, I wanted to be involved.
I wanted to get up on stage.

2039
02:04:03,650 --> 02:04:06,050
I wanted to say something.
That's engine. Hallway. Yeah.

2040
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:09,440
Potentially fucking an altar
boy. Yeah. I have one priest.

2041
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:11,270
He used to do the fucking homily.
Then he would ask,

2042
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:15,830
he would give us a lecture about
some shit about the, the uh, uh,

2043
02:04:15,831 --> 02:04:20,290
I used to craniums or whatever the
Crista cranium, the woo do these,

2044
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:21,343
you know,

2045
02:04:21,650 --> 02:04:24,500
these fucking people from a long time ago
and he'd be giving you this speech and

2046
02:04:24,501 --> 02:04:29,240
going out, God, he's going to ask me
questions on this. And he would be like,

2047
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:31,580
he would just be doing the homily.
Then we,

2048
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:36,020
he be doing the homily and he just be
like, and ms to what is it blow you?

2049
02:04:36,021 --> 02:04:36,890
Just start quizzing you on them.

2050
02:04:36,910 --> 02:04:39,710
Fucking crowd would be laughing when
I fucked up the jokes and I look,

2051
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:42,370
I'm not the jokes that the
questions and I loved it.

2052
02:04:43,300 --> 02:04:46,540
Beat the shit out of sitting there,
standing, kneeling, doing all that.

2053
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:51,740
And, um, and I really bought
into it when I was younger.

2054
02:04:51,741 --> 02:04:54,440
I really bought into and I thought it
was good at that it was the right fucking

2055
02:04:54,441 --> 02:04:55,274
thing to do.

2056
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:56,670
And uh,

2057
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:59,730
then I got older and I started reading
and I traveled and I realized this is

2058
02:04:59,731 --> 02:05:02,060
just a bunch of bullshit at a,

2059
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:05,880
I read into the history of the
church and I was like, wow,

2060
02:05:05,881 --> 02:05:10,350
these guys aren't exactly what
they say that they are, you know,

2061
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:14,280
it's kind of like a lot like Taco
bell who doesn't like Taco Bell.

2062
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:18,900
Then I do my little shoot out
there in New Mexico and uh,

2063
02:05:18,901 --> 02:05:22,230
there was some big strike they had out
there because they're not paying any of

2064
02:05:22,231 --> 02:05:26,010
those fucking workers that
pick the goddamn tomatoes
that go into it. Okay. Okay.

2065
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:27,660
Did you go to a Catholic school?

2066
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:32,520
When did this become inside bill studio?
Did I go to Catholic Schools?

2067
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:34,560
Had this whole thing
is inside bill studio.

2068
02:05:34,561 --> 02:05:38,520
I didn't know you run a Yap
for like 90 minutes. No,

2069
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:42,840
I just went off on like a monologue for
five minutes. You just go and go and go.

2070
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:48,360
Um, no, I was asking cause
I went to Catholic school.
So yeah, it's a whole thing.

2071
02:05:48,510 --> 02:05:53,400
It's too complicated again too, but
yeah. So what was that? That's it.

2072
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:55,970
That's it. That's why you stopped the
whole point. You know, what is the,

2073
02:05:56,160 --> 02:06:01,140
you just like talking into a microphone.
That's what it is. Fun. Okay,

2074
02:06:01,290 --> 02:06:04,650
well listen, I have to get on with the
podcast here. Are you kicking me out?

2075
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:05,790
I'm not kicking you out.

2076
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:10,650
I'm asking you politely to leave so I
can go back to running my yet finished

2077
02:06:10,651 --> 02:06:14,460
dinner. Anyway. Good. Thank
you very much everybody.

2078
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:15,840
Thank you for coming by.

2079
02:06:16,290 --> 02:06:19,620
That segment was brought
to you by my bowls.

2080
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:25,320
All right. Uh, all right, so I read that
one. Here's another one. All right, Bill,

2081
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:27,960
just to give you some background.
I'm a 36 year old

2082
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:32,870
Asian woman. I read this one last week
with the fuck is wrong with me. Um,

2083
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:34,350
I wanted her to send me a picture.

2084
02:06:35,530 --> 02:06:37,270
I no,
anyways,

2085
02:06:37,580 --> 02:06:41,160
built a first thank you for the labs
on your weekly podcasts. Beep adopted.

2086
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:45,070
Dupo um, all right, I want to cut.
I want to comment on your drinking.

2087
02:06:45,670 --> 02:06:50,650
By the way, today marks the
seventh month. I have not boost.

2088
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:55,390
You understand what that means? I am
closer to a year that I am to not a year.

2089
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:58,600
All right. That was for those of you
out there are not good at math. Do you?

2090
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:02,520
Don't realize that there's 12
months in a fucking year and a,

2091
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:04,220
Ugh,

2092
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:07,700
I don't know when it's gonna happen
that when it does,

2093
02:07:08,510 --> 02:07:09,710
when I was in the Pentagon,

2094
02:07:09,711 --> 02:07:13,520
I was thinking about drinking because
I went to the gift shop. Yeah,

2095
02:07:13,521 --> 02:07:17,120
they do have a gift shop at the Pentagon.
And you know what else was awesome?

2096
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:20,150
No one there seemed to know
how many floors there were.

2097
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:25,070
They said there's rumored to be
like another five below the ground,

2098
02:07:25,071 --> 02:07:28,820
but nobody really knows. You
know? I'm sure. I'm sure the, uh,

2099
02:07:29,360 --> 02:07:32,190
one of the big generals were there.
I'm sure he knows I,

2100
02:07:32,290 --> 02:07:34,580
and what happens when you get all
the way down to the bottom layer?

2101
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:39,610
Like who the fuck is down there? You
know, but it's a bunch of bankers.

2102
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:43,990
I bet there's like an underground subway
from the Fed reserve right over to that

2103
02:07:43,991 --> 02:07:48,460
lower level of the Pentagon
is a little office in there.

2104
02:07:49,750 --> 02:07:53,810
And uh, that's where the people
from the Federal Reserve Go, uh,

2105
02:07:53,950 --> 02:07:56,830
when they want to yell at the president
and the president comes over on his

2106
02:07:56,831 --> 02:07:59,290
little private subway because
it's also close together. Right.

2107
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:02,890
He comes over and then he sits outside
their office. I'll fucking nervous,

2108
02:08:02,891 --> 02:08:07,390
like wringing his hands going, Oh God,
did I, did I not say it right? Um, anyway,

2109
02:08:07,391 --> 02:08:08,500
so let's plow ahead here.
Bill,

2110
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:11,710
I want to comment on your drinking and
if anyone could stick with any kind of

2111
02:08:11,711 --> 02:08:15,370
schedule. Oh, when I asked if anyone
could stick to any sort of schedule,

2112
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:19,060
because I've been thinking about going
back to drinking and just like one day

2113
02:08:19,061 --> 02:08:22,750
every month,
just getting absolutely hammered.

2114
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:27,340
Having October fest every
month is basically what I'm
thinking about. Oh, I know.

2115
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:28,860
I actually, I forgot. So it was,

2116
02:08:29,010 --> 02:08:33,580
I'm in the gift shop at the
Pentagon and they had these,

2117
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:38,470
these drinking glasses and they had this
giant one that had the marine corps, um,

2118
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:41,980
shield or insignia, family, crest,
whatever the fuck you call it.

2119
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:43,630
And the second I saw it,
I was like,

2120
02:08:43,631 --> 02:08:48,550
I want to fill that up with some beer and
have like nine of those. Um, so anyways,

2121
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:51,340
uh, I asked if it was possible to do
something like that. The Guy said,

2122
02:08:51,341 --> 02:08:56,341
I just turned 25 and I've
never had a sip of alcohol,

2123
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:01,270
smoke cigarettes or taking any kind of
illegal drug, never, not even by accident.

2124
02:09:01,271 --> 02:09:04,720
And it's been Ben by choice and
nothing religion affiliated.

2125
02:09:05,170 --> 02:09:09,010
My friends slash coworkers
also poke fun of me for not,

2126
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:14,140
I'm often saying that they'd be able to
get me to drink at least one. In general,

2127
02:09:14,141 --> 02:09:17,950
everyone has the same reaction.
Jesus Christ hardy, unwind,

2128
02:09:18,010 --> 02:09:20,710
you must be boring, et
cetera. Well, anyways,

2129
02:09:20,890 --> 02:09:24,640
I guess that what I'm saying is it
is possible to not drink with all the

2130
02:09:24,641 --> 02:09:28,240
opportunities out there that are in the
world and the stress of life in general.

2131
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:33,360
It can be possible to get it to get at
least to at least get it down to drinking

2132
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:36,000
only one day a week.
Um,

2133
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:40,480
congrats on your streak and if not
drinking and thanks for the last. Um,

2134
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,500
well that's different
because you've never drank.

2135
02:09:44,590 --> 02:09:46,870
I wanted to hear from a drinker.
See,

2136
02:09:46,871 --> 02:09:51,070
the thing about you is you've
never opened Pandora's box.

2137
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:55,870
And I've said this before, but
it's, it's, it's very easy for me,

2138
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:59,860
for me not to do heroin every day because
I never did it. So I don't know what,

2139
02:09:59,870 --> 02:10:02,290
I don't know what I'm missing.
You know,

2140
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:07,840
I've never gone to Vegas and just actually
called one of those whores and hadn't

2141
02:10:07,841 --> 02:10:10,930
come to my room. So when I go out
there, I never think to do it.

2142
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:13,480
And then I don't feel like I'm
missing anything. But the thing is,

2143
02:10:13,630 --> 02:10:18,070
is when you do shit like that, when you've
done it, when you've lived that life,

2144
02:10:18,430 --> 02:10:20,200
that's when it's fucking hard.

2145
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:22,450
The other night I was
driving home from the fucking

2146
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:26,020
fuck was I coming from the comedy store

2147
02:10:27,730 --> 02:10:32,080
and I was just sick of being sober.
I was just driving going,

2148
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:36,710
I want to get fucked up. I
just want to do it. This is,

2149
02:10:36,711 --> 02:10:38,720
this is a,
this is getting ridiculous.

2150
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:44,540
I'm s I'm actually sick of thinking
clearly I can't explain it.

2151
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:48,950
It has to do with that shit though,
because I know how fun it is to get drunk,

2152
02:10:49,640 --> 02:10:50,473
you know?

2153
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:54,110
And I haven't had any embarrassing
things happen in seven fucking months,

2154
02:10:54,111 --> 02:10:57,410
so I forget how stupid it is, but, um,

2155
02:10:58,910 --> 02:10:59,840
God dammit.

2156
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:02,140
Okay.

2157
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:04,240
The only reason why I'm not drinking
is because if I don't drink,

2158
02:11:04,241 --> 02:11:05,440
and then I try to beat this streak,

2159
02:11:05,441 --> 02:11:10,320
I got to start all over again and go
seven fucking months. Oh, Jesus Christ.

2160
02:11:10,321 --> 02:11:13,290
What the fuck am I talking about? I
don't even go. I don't even know. Um,

2161
02:11:14,460 --> 02:11:17,160
let's move along. Let's, let's go with
underrated overrated for this week.

2162
02:11:17,161 --> 02:11:21,330
Everybody, uh, bill
new fan of the podcast,

2163
02:11:21,331 --> 02:11:24,900
I'm going to skip all the ass kicking ass,
kissing a,

2164
02:11:24,901 --> 02:11:28,770
I've noticed you do a lot
of overrated, underrated. So
here's mine. Overrated bars.

2165
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:29,970
Speak of the devil bars.

2166
02:11:29,971 --> 02:11:33,090
They just turned 21 and I'm
starting to check out the bar scene.

2167
02:11:33,091 --> 02:11:33,990
What a fucking joke.

2168
02:11:33,991 --> 02:11:37,950
A bunch of drunk tool bags and
filthy Ho was as you would say,

2169
02:11:38,370 --> 02:11:40,770
what happened to sit around
drinking with your friends.

2170
02:11:40,980 --> 02:11:44,130
I'd rather have a beer with some close
friends and go out to a crowded bar

2171
02:11:44,131 --> 02:11:45,000
filled with people.

2172
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:49,410
I want nothing to do with spending all
my money on watered down drinks. Anyways.

2173
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:53,160
Keep doing what you're doing. You're
the man. Thank you. Um, all right.

2174
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:55,290
Did you go out to the bars?
If you want to try to get laid,

2175
02:11:55,291 --> 02:11:57,870
that's basically the only reason why
to go out and do it. Other than that,

2176
02:11:57,871 --> 02:12:00,450
you're absolutely right.
If you're of legal drinking age,

2177
02:12:00,451 --> 02:12:03,330
just buy some booze and go home.
Go to a house party,

2178
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:07,770
watch a game with your friends, cook
out, have a great fucking time. Uh,

2179
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:10,020
play the music at the level
you want to play it at.

2180
02:12:10,021 --> 02:12:13,500
But the reason you go out to
the bars is because of the,

2181
02:12:13,501 --> 02:12:17,140
who is this because of the lady?

2182
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:18,780
That's why you go out to them.

2183
02:12:19,860 --> 02:12:24,660
Plus they have a larger selection of the
booze. But a dude, you're only 21. I mean,

2184
02:12:24,661 --> 02:12:26,250
I don't know,
maybe a really mature,

2185
02:12:26,380 --> 02:12:30,910
you'd be one of those people is like
married by 23 and has a kid, you know,

2186
02:12:31,050 --> 02:12:35,080
when a fucking wheel barrel. Do you
know I finally learned how to say that,

2187
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:38,860
that it was wheel barrel,
like roll out the barrel.

2188
02:12:38,861 --> 02:12:43,000
It's Barrow and I don't even know why,
but that's what the fuck it is. Um,

2189
02:12:43,001 --> 02:12:47,860
I'll give you an underrated for
this week. I'm underrated. Would be,

2190
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:52,300
uh, the kinks. I just downloaded
some of their music, their,

2191
02:12:52,510 --> 02:12:57,250
their fucking ridiculously underrated.
Um, I know that they get credit,

2192
02:12:57,790 --> 02:12:59,410
they sort of get like half credit.

2193
02:12:59,411 --> 02:13:03,940
They kind of get lost in the wash
between the Beatles and led Zeppelin.

2194
02:13:04,780 --> 02:13:09,280
And I don't know why. I don't know
why. Because as far as I can tell,

2195
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:13,570
those guys can, right. Yeah. Any
type of song you want, great lyrics.

2196
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,860
They can write about heavy shit.

2197
02:13:14,861 --> 02:13:17,230
They can write about light
shit that could fucking rock.

2198
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:21,940
They can actually do a ballad that is in
fucking cheesy, actually downloaded, uh,

2199
02:13:22,120 --> 02:13:26,530
give the people what they want. I bought
that on on vinyl when it first came out.

2200
02:13:27,010 --> 02:13:27,830
And you know what,

2201
02:13:27,830 --> 02:13:32,830
it still holds up still fucking holds up
to me and with my guitar playing skills

2202
02:13:32,941 --> 02:13:36,660
that can figure out some of
the songs. Um, all right,

2203
02:13:36,661 --> 02:13:39,890
we're getting to the end
of the podcast here. Um,

2204
02:13:40,210 --> 02:13:43,230
what was the last fucking thing I wanted
to tell you guys? Oh, wait a minute.

2205
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:48,170
I've got two big topics
to talk about. One, uh,

2206
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:52,550
Bruins verse Tampa Bay lately.
Um, how the series went,

2207
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:54,860
the first game we lost three
to fucking or whatever,

2208
02:13:54,980 --> 02:13:57,530
wasn't three to one of those like emptying
it bullshit at the end of the game.

2209
02:13:57,531 --> 02:14:01,100
But like, that's exactly what I
was afraid of. And I, you know,

2210
02:14:01,420 --> 02:14:05,990
sometimes I'm so sick of these fucking
non hockey towns having great hockey

2211
02:14:05,991 --> 02:14:09,710
teams, you know, it's a fucking waste

2212
02:14:11,490 --> 02:14:13,020
to get it off.
It's a fucking wait.

2213
02:14:13,020 --> 02:14:15,300
It's like Kevin a boat and you
live in the middle of Nebraska.

2214
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:19,410
There's no reason to have a fucking
hockey team or then amazing hockey team.

2215
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:23,610
They're fucking great team in easily
the best team we've played and come up

2216
02:14:23,611 --> 02:14:24,660
against so far.

2217
02:14:25,340 --> 02:14:28,740
They're just a great fucker team and I
easily think that those guys could win

2218
02:14:28,741 --> 02:14:32,350
the Stanley Cup. Our guys on the other
hand, I don't know, I think we got a shot,

2219
02:14:32,490 --> 02:14:37,150
but like Tampa Bay, I think Tampa,
I, if I had to put my money on it,

2220
02:14:37,180 --> 02:14:39,760
I picked her up a bay because
Vancouver and San Jose,

2221
02:14:39,910 --> 02:14:43,840
they're too fucking and
consistent. They'll play like
lights out fucking hockey,

2222
02:14:43,870 --> 02:14:47,440
three games in a row and
then just fucking, hey man,

2223
02:14:47,470 --> 02:14:50,950
let's make it interesting and they'll
lose like the next fucking two,

2224
02:14:50,951 --> 02:14:55,270
three in a row. I don't believe in those,
those teams, she can't fucking do that.

2225
02:14:55,270 --> 02:14:58,680
Eventually that kind of play in is
going to bite in the ass and considering

2226
02:14:58,980 --> 02:15:02,200
they're going to knock each other out.
Um,

2227
02:15:03,340 --> 02:15:06,490
everybody thinks the champions coming
from the West. I got news for you.

2228
02:15:06,610 --> 02:15:09,340
It's coming from the
east and I swear to God,

2229
02:15:10,450 --> 02:15:15,450
if Tampa Bay wins second fucking Stanley
Cup during the time of this Bruins

2230
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:17,733
drought,

2231
02:15:18,250 --> 02:15:22,750
that white trash piece of
shit city that nobody goes to,

2232
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:27,820
you know,
it's like one level above Jacksonville.

2233
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:33,340
More people go to Orlando, then
go to Tampa, people go to Miami,

2234
02:15:33,370 --> 02:15:37,850
they go to Fort Lauderdale,
bunch of fucking rednecks go out today.

2235
02:15:38,440 --> 02:15:42,730
Toner for the Daytona 500 we start with
the fucking super bowl. Super Bowl,

2236
02:15:42,731 --> 02:15:47,320
Nascar driving baby, right?
Nobody goes to Tampa.

2237
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,313
Mm.

2238
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:51,000
I was, you know what I was
doing yesterday? I was,

2239
02:15:51,001 --> 02:15:54,630
I was tweeting twittering during the
fucking game and all I was doing was just

2240
02:15:54,631 --> 02:15:55,500
shitting on Tampa,

2241
02:15:55,620 --> 02:15:59,760
just shitting on the city trying to annoy
people and of course people are taking

2242
02:15:59,761 --> 02:16:03,150
it seriously, which makes
it fun. And I said Tampa,

2243
02:16:03,210 --> 02:16:07,590
that's the type of city you go to when
you like abandoned your family. You know,

2244
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:11,130
we just got divorced. Just
the, there was, you know what?

2245
02:16:11,150 --> 02:16:16,150
There was a life altering moment in your
life where you just got kicked so hard

2246
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:19,290
in the balls.
You've just decided to say fuck it.

2247
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:21,900
That's when you moved to a city
like Tampa. If you've quit,

2248
02:16:24,100 --> 02:16:28,790
that's what Tampa's for
Tampa is for quitters and all
you people down there with

2249
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:32,080
the a new lightning fucking
jerseys or even worse,

2250
02:16:32,081 --> 02:16:36,130
the free fucking tee shirt that you
got from the local radio station.

2251
02:16:36,810 --> 02:16:40,330
All right.
No wonder you finally fill in the arena.

2252
02:16:40,331 --> 02:16:42,790
You finally want to see what a winner
looks like. Isn't that what it is?

2253
02:16:43,590 --> 02:16:46,000
They're all those fucking years of losing.

2254
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:48,473
Yeah.

2255
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:51,460
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

2256
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:55,020
Bunch of fucking losers.

2257
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:58,930
The fucking devil rays.

2258
02:17:00,260 --> 02:17:01,093
Huh?

2259
02:17:01,250 --> 02:17:04,790
Devil rays just like your
lives. Tampa, Tampa Bay.

2260
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:09,980
Odians just like your fucking lies. Oh
I think it's going to add. No, it is it.

2261
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:15,410
Yeah. I had to put three balls through
the hoop to when the teddy bear, you lose

2262
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:22,070
Virginia's for lovers.
Tampa is for losers.

2263
02:17:22,640 --> 02:17:27,440
There's no fucking way done. The hockey
gods are going to allow this to happen

2264
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:32,210
even though you have way
more firepower than us.

2265
02:17:32,350 --> 02:17:35,810
You've got a great goaltender and you
play in your one three one that you didn't

2266
02:17:35,811 --> 02:17:38,570
even show us in the first fucking game.
Go Fuck Yourself.

2267
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:42,790
Do you know the Strip mall
was invented in Tampa?

2268
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:46,083
It was,

2269
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:52,480
cause they were too fucking stupid to
know how to enclose a mall. You know,

2270
02:17:52,510 --> 02:17:55,180
they'd start to build an enclosed
mall and then you know what they do,

2271
02:17:55,181 --> 02:17:59,590
they fucking quit. Then they would just
left with this weird looking structure.

2272
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:05,530
You know, like what kind of,
well it's sort of a mall,
what should we call it? Well,

2273
02:18:05,590 --> 02:18:10,300
in tribute to all the whores that live
here in Tampa, we'll call it a strip mall.

2274
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:12,190
You know,
the,

2275
02:18:12,650 --> 02:18:17,650
all these fucking cracked out whores
walking around half of fake tits hanging

2276
02:18:18,161 --> 02:18:22,120
out some fucking eight year old kid
still breastfeeding on it. You know,

2277
02:18:22,121 --> 02:18:23,530
I know you guys think I'm being harsh,

2278
02:18:23,531 --> 02:18:27,850
but this is the shit you see down in
Tampa. They don't deserve the lightning.

2279
02:18:30,850 --> 02:18:32,200
I think that's when,
you know,

2280
02:18:32,710 --> 02:18:36,520
your city sucks is when one of
your teams is named after. Whether,

2281
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:38,613
you know,

2282
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:43,210
I really should say it because the thunder
just fucking advanced to the western

2283
02:18:43,211 --> 02:18:44,510
conference finals.
Huh?

2284
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:48,130
Look who's watching Hoop Nika watch
hoop because the Lakers are out of it.

2285
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:52,660
I love it. I fucking
love it. Truly enjoy it.

2286
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:55,870
Truly fucking and enjoy that.
So anyways,

2287
02:18:56,800 --> 02:19:01,630
I flew virgin airlines in
the way back from Washington,
Dallas, everybody. And uh,

2288
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:03,580
like a smart son of a bitch.

2289
02:19:03,581 --> 02:19:08,581
I got there like two hours early and I
show up in computers are down and this is

2290
02:19:08,621 --> 02:19:13,621
fucking gigantic fucking line and it was
an absolute nightmare trying to check

2291
02:19:15,461 --> 02:19:18,670
in for the flight.
And it was so bad when I got to the gate,

2292
02:19:18,671 --> 02:19:23,140
the captain was actually helping people
get seating assignments and at one point,

2293
02:19:23,141 --> 02:19:26,140
you know what he said? He
goes, well, you know, he goes,

2294
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:31,590
this is how it was before
computers and nobody

2295
02:19:33,300 --> 02:19:34,470
blinked. And I, when he said that

2296
02:19:36,690 --> 02:19:38,970
this is not the way it
was before computers,

2297
02:19:39,150 --> 02:19:43,230
this is how it is now because
of computers. You fucking moron.

2298
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:49,600
Jesus Christ. We used to go to
the airport, he just walked up.

2299
02:19:50,140 --> 02:19:53,290
You walked up to the stern line,
but you fucking walked up

2300
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:57,220
and you just, you gave,
you gave me information,

2301
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:58,840
he had your fucking ticket
and you went through,

2302
02:19:59,740 --> 02:20:03,000
didn't take two hours and then another
hour at the gate to get your seating a

2303
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:04,390
salmon.
You fucking idiot.

2304
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:08,500
I lost all confidence in that guide is
ability to fly a fucking airplane at that

2305
02:20:08,501 --> 02:20:10,210
point. And then I got on there, right?

2306
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:13,930
Virgin Airlines is where they've got
like this, this club lighting, you know,

2307
02:20:13,931 --> 02:20:17,740
like this Jersey shore sort of
look on the plane, you know, like,

2308
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:21,250
like there's going to become
stains on the seats or something,

2309
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:26,230
but it was actually a very enjoyable
flight and they have new airplanes and uh,

2310
02:20:26,231 --> 02:20:29,740
I highly recommend that airline and the
guy gave nice, smooth fucking landing.

2311
02:20:30,370 --> 02:20:33,490
They had all kinds of video games
and movies and all that type of shit.

2312
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:34,370
And you know what?
I realize,

2313
02:20:34,370 --> 02:20:37,030
I don't think I've said anything
funny in like fucking 20 minutes.

2314
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:42,610
What happened to this podcast?
Everything was going great. Do it.

2315
02:20:42,611 --> 02:20:45,850
I'll tell you what it is. You not boozy
and drinking fucking coconut water, dude.

2316
02:20:46,780 --> 02:20:47,770
That's what it is.
Huh?

2317
02:20:47,800 --> 02:20:51,130
What are you going to do next to have
a jank cucumber and fucking swallow it

2318
02:20:51,131 --> 02:20:55,140
whole you fucking queer.
Um, all right. Is that it?

2319
02:20:55,141 --> 02:20:58,870
Is that it for the
podcast to my fucking dog.

2320
02:20:58,930 --> 02:21:01,330
Smells like a fucking dog.

2321
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:05,620
I just gave it a Goddamn Beth. I don't
know what's going on. You know what it is.

2322
02:21:05,730 --> 02:21:09,640
I've been hiking a lot
lately and you know I have,

2323
02:21:09,641 --> 02:21:12,880
I lost enough edge for you. I
don't booze. I drink coconut water.

2324
02:21:12,881 --> 02:21:17,710
I'm recommending eating salads and I
go hiking every day and I have a beard.

2325
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:19,623
Okay,

2326
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:24,010
that's just write down the
checklist of complete fucking pussy.

2327
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:26,110
What's The matter you Colin?
Doggin

2328
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:31,870
oh cause cause it's all windy out.
Yeah.

2329
02:21:31,930 --> 02:21:36,760
We have a vicious pit bull that's
afraid of the wind. Cleo, C'mon in here.

2330
02:21:37,530 --> 02:21:41,080
Look a walking with their head down
low. Oh my God. What's going to happen?

2331
02:21:43,490 --> 02:21:47,360
Cleo? Come here. She's truly freaked out.

2332
02:21:47,361 --> 02:21:50,060
Look at her tail between her legs.
Clear?

2333
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:54,640
Yeah. Okay. Now I can't
pet you in this moment.

2334
02:21:54,730 --> 02:21:57,580
This is something I learned from the
dog trainer. If I pet you right now,

2335
02:21:57,581 --> 02:22:01,000
when you're all freaked out, you're
being rewarded for being freaked out.

2336
02:22:02,020 --> 02:22:05,620
Jesus Christ. Look at the fucking thighs
on you. You've been hiking with me, Huh?

2337
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:09,010
All right. You know what? Fuck this
podcast. This is the end of the podcast.

2338
02:22:09,011 --> 02:22:12,460
Everybody. My predictions, my predictions.

2339
02:22:12,940 --> 02:22:16,430
I like a, all right, we're going to,

2340
02:22:16,431 --> 02:22:18,470
we're going to go with my heart first bro.

2341
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:22,820
And slot at the fucking
Tampa Bay lightning.

2342
02:22:23,710 --> 02:22:27,090
All right, we're going to win that in. Uh,

2343
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:31,800
my fucking dog is standing
there shaking right now. I'm

2344
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:38,940
clear. What are you doing?
All right. Fuck it. Alright.

2345
02:22:39,330 --> 02:22:44,280
The Bruins are gonna win in. Um, I
actually, for some reason I think,

2346
02:22:44,310 --> 02:22:48,750
I think six games, the Bruins are going
to win. This is my heart talking. Uh,

2347
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:53,100
my brain says Tampa and seven.
Let's go across the fucking lake here.

2348
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:57,900
I like, uh, all right. This is the deal.

2349
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:02,960
What's weird in the sports world right
now is San Jose in Dallas and the Dallas

2350
02:23:03,030 --> 02:23:06,000
Mavericks are both not choking.
There's no fucking way.

2351
02:23:06,001 --> 02:23:10,020
Both of them are going to
win a championship this year.
One of them is going down

2352
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:15,930
and I don't think it's going to be San
Jose. I say San Jose Beats Vancouver.

2353
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:18,510
I think they finally fucking
pushed through this year.

2354
02:23:18,511 --> 02:23:22,200
Joe Thornton is finally acting like
a captain. I think it's gonna happen.

2355
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:26,550
Both teams are very streaky. Roberta
Lovango. I don't know if he gets the Yips,

2356
02:23:26,551 --> 02:23:27,420
they're going to be in trouble.

2357
02:23:27,421 --> 02:23:32,421
I'm taking San Jose and the fucking
West San Jose in the fucking West is

2358
02:23:33,631 --> 02:23:36,000
probably going to be Tampa,
San and San Jose.

2359
02:23:36,360 --> 02:23:40,800
I hate to fucking say it in the Goddamn
finals. The Bruins make it to the finals.

2360
02:23:40,890 --> 02:23:44,720
We're going to win it. Ah. It gives a
shit bill. No one gives a fuck about you,

2361
02:23:44,730 --> 02:23:48,610
God damn predictions. Yeah. Will I
do? I do. He don't do I give a five.

2362
02:23:48,630 --> 02:23:52,020
I give a fuck up enough about you
that you're driving to work right now.

2363
02:23:52,021 --> 02:23:56,200
This is an hour in. You're almost at work,
aren't you? Thanks to me. You laughed.

2364
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:59,640
You giggled. You had a good fucking
time. You spilled your coffee.

2365
02:23:59,790 --> 02:24:04,050
You dropped something in between the seat
and the console. You reach down for it.

2366
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:05,250
You stop short.

2367
02:24:05,251 --> 02:24:09,300
You broke the bridge of your nose and
you're still sitting there laughing. Cleo,

2368
02:24:09,330 --> 02:24:13,050
you have to fucking relax. All right.
You're freaking me out. Clear. Hey,

2369
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:19,560
not Jesus Christ, that dog.
I swear to God. Yeah, you,

2370
02:24:19,710 --> 02:24:24,450
you're retarded. All right.
Basketball real quick. Um,

2371
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:27,330
as much as I love Oklahoma,
I got to go. Dallas.

2372
02:24:27,331 --> 02:24:30,390
Dallas is going to make the finals and uh,

2373
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:32,550
all right,

2374
02:24:33,580 --> 02:24:37,680
Tampa is going to win the cup
and I hate to fucking say it.

2375
02:24:40,290 --> 02:24:43,170
No Mavericks will when
I get a bad feeling,

2376
02:24:43,240 --> 02:24:46,110
the heat is going to go to the finals.
I'm rooting for Chicago.

2377
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:52,030
I Love Dallas and I love Oklahoma.
I got to go with Oklahoma cause fucking a,

2378
02:24:52,060 --> 02:24:56,010
I love Durant and I also
like a Kendrick Perkins

2379
02:24:57,570 --> 02:24:59,580
and uh, yeah. And that's it.

2380
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:02,160
And that's the podcast and the whole
fucking thing just whittled down to a

2381
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:04,470
goddamn halt. All right.
What are we going to do here?

2382
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:07,020
How could I hit my dates and then we're
going to get the fuck out of here. Huh?

2383
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:09,660
What'd you guys like to hear that?
If you shut this fucking thing off yet,

2384
02:25:10,470 --> 02:25:14,340
God knows I would have. Um,

week. I thought, I hope you
guys all had a good time.

2424
02:28:01,260 --> 02:28:05,730
I all, my dog stops shaking. She's sitting
here panting, freaking the fuck out.

2425
02:28:05,731 --> 02:28:09,000
So you guys probably wondered what do
you do with the dog right now when your

2426
02:28:09,001 --> 02:28:13,230
dog gets like that, don't pet it
cause you're rewarding it going. Yeah,

2427
02:28:13,231 --> 02:28:15,150
I want you to be freaking out.
You don't want to do that.

2428
02:28:15,270 --> 02:28:19,650
When I'm going to do is I'm going to get
up off my age and I'm going to take it

2429
02:28:19,651 --> 02:28:23,900
for a walk and just get that energy out
of her and then I'm going to bring a

2430
02:28:23,901 --> 02:28:26,930

happened when she's chilling out.

dog for the rest of the night.
