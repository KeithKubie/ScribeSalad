00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.800
Another way of thinking of this is
that tracking is just an induction,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.860
a process, right?

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.899
An induction, like for math is if I know
how to do n then I know how to do n + 1.

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:14.450
When you show what the sum of a
geometric series is or things like that,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.750
you tend to prove these things by
induction or something like that.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500
So for induction,
you have to have a starting case,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.120
a base case so you have some
guess as to how things start.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.670
Maybe for our tracking,
we have some distribution.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.990
It could be a very
uncertain distribution.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.390
And then, with that first frame,
we take a measurement, y zero and

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.550
then we would correct our estimate.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.290
And then we just keep
iterating through this.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.220
Right?
So,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.870
At every time t, we make a prediction
for time t plus 1, take a measurement,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.660
and we correct for time t plus 1.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.680
And somebody spent a lot of time
designing these beautiful arrows, so

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.560
I wanted to make sure you saw them too.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.840
And if you go take a look all over
the internet, you'll find these arrows.
