we we certainly want to be as

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200
we we certainly want to be as
 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.640
we we certainly want to be as
comprehensive as possible so we hope

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650
comprehensive as possible so we hope
 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.620
comprehensive as possible so we hope
that that all publishers continue to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630
that that all publishers continue to
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.089
that that all publishers continue to
index and allow us to index their

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099
index and allow us to index their
 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.640
index and allow us to index their
information but I think there are just

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
information but I think there are just
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.749
information but I think there are just
there are so many different sources that

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759
there are so many different sources that
 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.140
there are so many different sources that
are out there depending on what it is I

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150
are out there depending on what it is I
 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.829
are out there depending on what it is I
think they're just so many different

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:27.839
think they're just so many different
 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:29.419
think they're just so many different
ways to get out that information again

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
ways to get out that information again
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.070
ways to get out that information again
unique information that that's not

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
unique information that that's not
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.450
unique information that that's not
available within Google that that's not

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460
available within Google that that's not
 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.090
available within Google that that's not
good for us I would also argue because

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
good for us I would also argue because
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.650
good for us I would also argue because
of the value that we deliver publishers

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
of the value that we deliver publishers
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.090
of the value that we deliver publishers
is probably not a great outcome for them

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
is probably not a great outcome for them
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.950
is probably not a great outcome for them
too so I think it's it's I think we it

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
too so I think it's it's I think we it
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290
too so I think it's it's I think we it
really is a symbiotic relationship that

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
really is a symbiotic relationship that
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.689
really is a symbiotic relationship that
there's there's there's value for us and

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699
there's there's there's value for us and
 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:48.830
there's there's there's value for us and
being able to have that information on

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
being able to have that information on
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.209
being able to have that information on
our side and there's value for them and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
our side and there's value for them and
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.970
our side and there's value for them and
in helping us in having us direct people

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
in helping us in having us direct people
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.350
in helping us in having us direct people
over over to their to their sites

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360
 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.050
no I mean look these these relationships

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060
no I mean look these these relationships
 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.300
no I mean look these these relationships
that we have with publishers that really

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310
that we have with publishers that really
 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.930
that we have with publishers that really
scan it spans just a sort of a wide

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940
scan it spans just a sort of a wide
 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.850
scan it spans just a sort of a wide
areas of interactions with Google we

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860
areas of interactions with Google we
 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.580
areas of interactions with Google we
work with publishers certainly there's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590
work with publishers certainly there's
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.260
work with publishers certainly there's
the new set of things and and the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270
the new set of things and and the
 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.370
the new set of things and and the
traffic and the distribution of the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
traffic and the distribution of the
 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.410
traffic and the distribution of the
content but we have strong partnerships

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420

with with these publishers whether it's

technology or any number of different
 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.850
technology or any number of different
ways so I mean we value these these

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860
ways so I mean we value these these
 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.380
ways so I mean we value these these
relationships and I think we certainly

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390
relationships and I think we certainly
 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.990
relationships and I think we certainly
want to continue to work with them I

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000
want to continue to work with them I
 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.760
want to continue to work with them I
mean I was on the other side I mean I

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770
mean I was on the other side I mean I
 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.190
mean I was on the other side I mean I
sort of was used to working with Google

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200
sort of was used to working with Google
 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.530
sort of was used to working with Google
and you know there's certainly you know

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540
and you know there's certainly you know
 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.790
and you know there's certainly you know
trying to figure out how Google works

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800
trying to figure out how Google works
 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.740
trying to figure out how Google works
and how to navigate the organization

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750
and how to navigate the organization
 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.510
and how to navigate the organization
that can be challenging for somebody who

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520
that can be challenging for somebody who
 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.889
that can be challenging for somebody who
works at Google much less somebody from

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899
works at Google much less somebody from
 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.440
works at Google much less somebody from
the outside and that's a large part of

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
the outside and that's a large part of
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.109
the outside and that's a large part of
my job is to try and sort of take that

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119
my job is to try and sort of take that
 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.790
my job is to try and sort of take that
publisher perspective and one that I

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800
publisher perspective and one that I
 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.260
publisher perspective and one that I
brought in a brought to the table when I

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270
brought in a brought to the table when I
 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.300
brought in a brought to the table when I
came to the job but also just leave this

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310
came to the job but also just leave this
 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.650
came to the job but also just leave this
in the ongoing discussions that I have

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660
in the ongoing discussions that I have
 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.450
in the ongoing discussions that I have
to try and you know make sure that we

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460
to try and you know make sure that we
 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.870
to try and you know make sure that we
can I think sort of tie across all the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880
can I think sort of tie across all the
 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.010
can I think sort of tie across all the
different ways that you work with Google

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020
different ways that you work with Google
 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.210
different ways that you work with Google
and so to make it a little bit of an

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220
and so to make it a little bit of an
 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.180
and so to make it a little bit of an
easier interaction it's there's just so

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190
easier interaction it's there's just so
 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.469
easier interaction it's there's just so
many different things there and on the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479
many different things there and on the
 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.300
many different things there and on the
product side of it we really try and be

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310
product side of it we really try and be
 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.130
product side of it we really try and be
as nimble as possible and have these you

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140
as nimble as possible and have these you
 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.470
as nimble as possible and have these you
know not have this overarching

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
know not have this overarching
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.699
know not have this overarching
bureaucracy that sort of slows us down

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709
bureaucracy that sort of slows us down
 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.380
bureaucracy that sort of slows us down
but the partnership side of it sometimes

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
but the partnership side of it sometimes
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.360
but the partnership side of it sometimes
that can present challenges so you know

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370
that can present challenges so you know
 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.800
that can present challenges so you know
how do we better engage with publishers

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810
how do we better engage with publishers
 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.970
how do we better engage with publishers
how do we present that more of a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980
how do we present that more of a
 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.340
how do we present that more of a
holistic view of you know what can we do

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350
holistic view of you know what can we do
 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.750
holistic view of you know what can we do
together and just you know leave that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760
together and just you know leave that
 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.699
together and just you know leave that
sort of somewhat of white space to say

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709
sort of somewhat of white space to say
 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.020
sort of somewhat of white space to say
what and what are the things what are

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
what and what are the things what are
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.190
what and what are the things what are
the important things that we can think

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200
the important things that we can think
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.110
the important things that we can think
about how can we innovate together how

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
about how can we innovate together how
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.700
about how can we innovate together how
can we grow this space

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710
 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.770
you
