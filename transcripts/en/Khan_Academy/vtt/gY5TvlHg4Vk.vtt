00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.160
In this video, we're going to
learn how to rationalize the

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.410
denominator.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.610
What we mean by that is, let's
say we have a fraction that

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.570
has a non-rational denominator,
the simplest one

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.400
I can think of is 1 over
the square root of 2.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.440
So to rationalize this
denominator, we're going to

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.910
just re-represent this number in
some way that does not have

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.630
an irrational number
in the denominator.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.350
Now the first question
you might ask is,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.710
Sal, why do we care?

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.160
Why must we rationalize
denominators?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.030
And you don't have to
rationalize them.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.260
But I think the reason why
this is in many algebra

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.230
classes and why many teachers
want you to, is it gets the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.270
numbers into a common format.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.150
And I also think, I've been
told that back in the day

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.360
before we had calculators that
some forms of computation,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.170
people found it easier to have
a rational number in the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.600
denominator.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.200
I don't know if that's
true or not.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.070
And then, the other reason
is just for aesthetics.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.430
Some people say, I don't
like saying what 1

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.640
square root of 2 is.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.180
I don't even know.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.900
You know, I want to how
big the pie is.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.330
I want a denominator to
be a rational number.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.420
So with that said, let's learn
how to rationalize it.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.260
So the simple way, if you just
have a simple irrational

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.030
number in the denominator just
like that, you can just

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.490
multiply the numerator and the
denominator by that irrational

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.100
number over that irrational
number.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.670
Now this is clearly just 1.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.610
Anything over anything or
anything over that same thing

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.410
is going to be 1.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.480
So we're not fundamentally
changing the number.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.610
We're just changing how
we represent it.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.470
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.170
The numerator is going to be 1
times the square root of 2,

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.620
which is the square root of 2.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.230
The denominator is going to be
the square root of 2 times the

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.640
square root of 2.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.180
Well the square root of
2 times the square

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.130
root of 2 is 2.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.460
That is 2.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.180
By definition, this squared
must be equal to 2.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.030
And we are squaring it.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.400
We're multiplying
it by itself.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.630
So that is equal to 2.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690
We have rationalized
the denominator.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.950
We haven't gotten rid of the
radical sign, but we've

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.680
brought it to the numerator.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.120
And now in the denominator we
have a rational number.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.610
And you could say, hey, now I
have square root of 2 halves.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.860
It's easier to say even,
so maybe that's another

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.370
justification for rationalizing
this

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.840
denominator.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.040
Let's do a couple
more examples.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.750
Let's say I had 7 over the
square root of 15.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.320
So the first thing I'd want to
do is just simplify this

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.930
radical right here.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.250
Let's see.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.920
Square root of 15.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.530
15 is 3 times 5.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.570
Neither of those are
perfect squares.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.310
So actually, this is about as
simple as I'm going to get.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.770
So just like we did here, let's
multiply this times the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.490
square root of 15 over the
square root of 15.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.720
And so this is going to be equal
to 7 times the square

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720
root of 15.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.590
Just multiply the numerators.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.690
Over square root of 15 times
the square root of 15.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.590
That's 15.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.020
So once again, we have
rationalized the denominator.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.350
This is now a rational number.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.840
We essentially got the radical
up on the top or we got the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.510
irrational number up
on the numerator.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.190
We haven't changed the number,
we just changed how we are

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.700
representing it.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.920
Now, let's take it up
one more level.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.900
What happens if we have
something like 12 over 2 minus

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.080
the square root of 5?

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.940
So in this situation, we
actually have a binomial in

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.460
the denominator.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.950
And this binomial contains
an irrational number.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.000
I can't do the trick here.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.230
If I multiplied this by square
root of 5 over square root of

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.380
5, I'm still going to have an
irrational denominator.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.460
Let me just show you.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.210
Just to show you
it won't work.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.720
If I multiplied this square root
of 5 over square root of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.730
5, the numerator is going
to be 12 times the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.300
square root of 5.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.170
The denominator, we have
to distribute this.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.670
It's going to be 2 times the
square root of 5 minus the

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.820
square root of 5 times the
square root of 5, which is 5.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.180
So you see, in this situation,
it didn't help us.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.570
Because the square root of 5,
although this part became

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.110
rational,it became a 5, this
part became irrational.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.900
2 times the square root of 5.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.370
So this is not what you want
to do where you have a

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.120
binomial that contains an
irrational number in the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.780
denominator.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.019
What you do here is use our
skills when it comes to

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.170
difference of squares.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.209
So let's just take a
little side here.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.470
We learned a long time ago--
well, not that long ago.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.570
If you had 2 minus the square
root of 5 and you multiply

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.900
that by 2 plus the square root
of 5, what will this get you?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.670
Now you might remember.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.630
And if you don't recognize this
immediately, this is the

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.790
exact same pattern as a minus
b times a plus b.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.040
Which we've seen several
videos ago is a

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.770
squared minus b squared.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.470
Little bit of review.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.900
This is a times a, which
is a squared. a

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.430
times b, which is ab.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.630
Minus b times a, which
is minus ab.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.840
And then, negative b
times a positive

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.150
b, negative b squared.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.070
These cancel out and you're
just left with a

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.980
squared minus b squared.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.710
So 2 minus the square root of 5
times 2 plus the square root

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.480
of 5 is going to be equal to
2 squared, which is 4.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.260
Let me write it that way.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.920
It's going to be equal to 2
squared minus the square root

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.690
of 5 squared, which is just 5.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.345
So this would just be equal to
4 minus 5 or negative 1.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.520
If you take advantage of the
difference of squares of

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.080
binomials, or the factoring
difference of squares, however

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.920
you want to view it, then
you can rationalize this

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.240
denominator.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.840
So let's do that.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.750
Let me rewrite the problem.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.280
12 over 2 minus the
square root of 5.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.810
In this situation, I just
multiply the numerator and the

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.270
denominator by 2 plus the square
root of 5 over 2 plus

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.600
the square root of 5.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.580
Once again, I'm just multiplying
the number by 1.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.960
So I'm not changing the
fundamental number.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.020
I'm just changing how
we represent it.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.780
So the numerator is
going to become 12

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.010
times 2, which is 24.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.125
Plus 12 times the square
root of 5.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.470
Once again, this is
like a factored

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.560
difference of squares.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.200
This is going to be equal to 2
squared, which is going to be

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.450
exactly equal to that.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.330
Which is 4 minus 1, or we
could just-- sorry.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.040
4 minus 5.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.750
It's 2 squared minus square
root of 5 squared.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.610
So it's 4 minus 5.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.720
Or we could just write that
as minus 1, or negative 1.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.900
Or we could put a 1
there and put a

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.590
negative sign out in front.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.720
And then, no point in even
putting a 1 in the

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.170
denominator.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.120
We could just say that this is
equal to negative 24 minus 12

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.140
square roots of 5.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.250
So this case, it kind of did
simplify it as well.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.930
It wasn't just for the sake
of rationalizing it.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.770
It actually made it look
a little bit better.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.490
And you know, I don't if I
mentioned in the beginning,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.540
this is good because
it's not obvious.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.190
If you and I are both trying to
build a rocket and you get

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.200
this as your answer and I get
this as my answer, this isn't

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.260
obvious, at least to me just by
looking at it, that they're

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.500
the same number.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.450
But if we agree to always
rationalize our denominators,

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.380
we're like, oh great.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.450
We got the same number.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.320
Now we're ready to send
our rocket to Mars.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.910
Let's do one more of this, one
more of these right here.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.900
Let's do one with
variables in it.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.060
So let's say we have 5y over
2 times the square

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.700
root of y minus 5.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.530
So we're going to do this
exact same process.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.640
We have a binomial with an
irrational denominator.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.690
It might be a rational.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.920
We don't know what y is.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.020
But y can take on any value, so
at points it's going to be

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.570
irrational.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.270
So we really just don't want a
radical in the denominator.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.050
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.180
Well, let's just multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:15.780
by 2 square roots of y
plus 5 over 2 square

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.100
roots of y plus 5.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.150
This is just 1.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.690
We are not changing the
number, we're just

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.860
multiplying it by 1.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.260
So let's start with
the denominator.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.570
What is the denominator
going to be equal to?

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.940
The denominator is going to
be equal to this squared.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.409
Once again, just a difference
of squares.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:35.880
It's going to be 2 times
the square root of y

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.830
squared minus 5 squared.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.630
If you factor this, you would
get 2 square roots of y plus 5

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.630
times 2 square roots
of y minus 5.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.440
This is a difference
of squares.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.770
And then our numerator is 5y
times 2 square roots of y.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.360
So it would be 10.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.330
And this is y to the first
power, this is

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.080
y to the half power.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.370
We could write y square
roots of y.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.430
10y square roots of y.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.380
Or we could write this as y to
the 3/2 power or 1 and 1/2

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.300
power, however you
want to view it.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:15.820
And then finally, 5y times
5 is plus 25y.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.550
And we can simplify
this further.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.250
So what is our denominator
going to be equal to?

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.490
We're going to have 2
squared, which is 4.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.410
Square root of y squared is y.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.800
4y.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.870
And then minus 25.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:40.140
And our numerator over here is--
We could even write this.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.690
We could keep it exactly the
way we've written it here.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:43.600
We could factor out a y.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.840
There's all sorts of things
we could do it.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.540
But just to keep things simple,
we could just leave

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.340
that as 10.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.100
Let me just write
it different.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:53.520
I could write that as this is
y to the first, this is y to

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.970
the 1/2 power.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.200
I could write that as even
a y to the 3/2 if I want.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.240
I could write that as y to
the 1 and 1/2 if I want.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.650
Or I could write that as 10y
times the square root of y.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.900
All of those are equivalent.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.080
Plus 25y.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.990
Anyway, hopefully you found
this rationalizing the

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.110
denominator interesting.
