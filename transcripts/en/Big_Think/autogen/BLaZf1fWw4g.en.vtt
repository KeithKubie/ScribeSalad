years ago I my legs were twisted around

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
years ago I my legs were twisted around
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.689
years ago I my legs were twisted around
I would have been disabled from the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699
I would have been disabled from the
 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.590
I would have been disabled from the
get-go and I probably would have just

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600
get-go and I probably would have just
 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.849

had some accident when I was four or

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
had some accident when I was four or
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.560
had some accident when I was four or
five and would have been dead so

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570
five and would have been dead so
 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.510

healthcare they put my feet in the cast

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
healthcare they put my feet in the cast
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.040
healthcare they put my feet in the cast
for the first six weeks of my life I'm

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050
for the first six weeks of my life I'm
 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.400
for the first six weeks of my life I'm
incredibly nearsighted I'd probably have

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410
incredibly nearsighted I'd probably have
 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.780
incredibly nearsighted I'd probably have
even I was born yeah I probably would

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
even I was born yeah I probably would
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.330
even I was born yeah I probably would
have run into a tree by now or fallen

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340
have run into a tree by now or fallen
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.650
have run into a tree by now or fallen
under a horse or something so that to

under a horse or something so that to

some extent we're now evolving to be

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
some extent we're now evolving to be
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.709
some extent we're now evolving to be
much less physically fit than even a few

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
much less physically fit than even a few
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389
much less physically fit than even a few
hundred years ago simply because life is

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399
hundred years ago simply because life is
 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.630
hundred years ago simply because life is
much easier the the real question of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
much easier the the real question of
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.819
much easier the the real question of
course is how much will we now be making

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
course is how much will we now be making
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.340
course is how much will we now be making
would amount to eugenic decisions and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
would amount to eugenic decisions and
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.310
would amount to eugenic decisions and
that's that's an interesting and scary

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
that's that's an interesting and scary
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.039
that's that's an interesting and scary
thought I've it's happening minutes in

thought I've it's happening minutes in
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.390
thought I've it's happening minutes in
its own way it's happened in China

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
its own way it's happened in China
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940
its own way it's happened in China
simply in favor of boys and that's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
simply in favor of boys and that's
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.800
simply in favor of boys and that's
creating all kinds of social disruptions

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
creating all kinds of social disruptions
 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.179
creating all kinds of social disruptions
because there are too many men and not

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
because there are too many men and not
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.450
because there are too many men and not
enough civilizing women if I can say

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
enough civilizing women if I can say
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.859
enough civilizing women if I can say
that so we're now in many cases weeding

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869
that so we're now in many cases weeding
 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.020
that so we're now in many cases weeding
out certain easily testable things that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
out certain easily testable things that
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.270
out certain easily testable things that
you can do in amnio testing for

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
you can do in amnio testing for
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580
you can do in amnio testing for
especially in people who have some kind

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
especially in people who have some kind
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.520
especially in people who have some kind
of family history of Down syndrome or

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
of family history of Down syndrome or
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.880
of family history of Down syndrome or
whatever will we be yeah and there's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890
whatever will we be yeah and there's
 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.830
whatever will we be yeah and there's
even now because in the old days

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840
even now because in the old days
 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.060
even now because in the old days
physical prowess mattered more I think

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070
physical prowess mattered more I think
 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.469
physical prowess mattered more I think
you didn't have as much kind of

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
you didn't have as much kind of
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.630
you didn't have as much kind of
intelligence assortment mating or

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
intelligence assortment mating or
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.699
intelligence assortment mating or
something like that so you know we're

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
something like that so you know we're
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.490
something like that so you know we're
already changing how things are evolving

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
already changing how things are evolving
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.410
already changing how things are evolving
with

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
with
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.339
with
using genetic information and it's again

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349
using genetic information and it's again
 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.600
using genetic information and it's again
people are going to face more and more

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610
people are going to face more and more
 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.309
people are going to face more and more
ethical decisions about how much don't

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319
ethical decisions about how much don't
 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.890
ethical decisions about how much don't
want to control what kind of kid I have

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900
want to control what kind of kid I have
 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.500
want to control what kind of kid I have
its and that's quite apart from all this

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510
its and that's quite apart from all this
 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:41.530
its and that's quite apart from all this
creating new life and stuff like that at

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540
creating new life and stuff like that at
 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.130
creating new life and stuff like that at
23andme for example I mean again I it's

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140
23andme for example I mean again I it's
 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.420
23andme for example I mean again I it's
hard to argue with a statement of fact

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
hard to argue with a statement of fact
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.750
hard to argue with a statement of fact
that I think is true so what do you do

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760
that I think is true so what do you do
 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.590
that I think is true so what do you do
about that fact well to some extent you

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600
about that fact well to some extent you
 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.780
about that fact well to some extent you
say 11 goal of 23andme is to do various

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
say 11 goal of 23andme is to do various
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.270
say 11 goal of 23andme is to do various
correlation tests and it's it's not very

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
correlation tests and it's it's not very
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.780
correlation tests and it's it's not very
useful to have a a very limited

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790
useful to have a a very limited
 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.360
useful to have a a very limited
population so what we will do is work

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370
population so what we will do is work
 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.490
population so what we will do is work
with foundations and other things and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500
with foundations and other things and
 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.770
with foundations and other things and
offer free or very cheap tests to

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
offer free or very cheap tests to
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.270
offer free or very cheap tests to
selected populations with a certain

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280
selected populations with a certain
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.430
selected populations with a certain
condition like you know Alzheimer's or

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440
condition like you know Alzheimer's or
 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.220
condition like you know Alzheimer's or
whatever and we over time would love for

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230
whatever and we over time would love for
 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.140
whatever and we over time would love for
this stuff to be cheaper and it will be

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150
this stuff to be cheaper and it will be
 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.530
this stuff to be cheaper and it will be
because the the real cost is in the lab

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540
because the the real cost is in the lab
 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.020
because the the real cost is in the lab
that's a per-unit cost the cost of our

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030
that's a per-unit cost the cost of our
 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.440
that's a per-unit cost the cost of our
website and the information goes down

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450
website and the information goes down
 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.650
website and the information goes down
per person as the number of members goes

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660
per person as the number of members goes
 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.500
per person as the number of members goes
up so over time this will all get

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510
up so over time this will all get
 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.750
up so over time this will all get
cheaper most good things are pretty

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
cheaper most good things are pretty
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.729
cheaper most good things are pretty
expensive when they start out and I I

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739
expensive when they start out and I I
 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.759

don't think that's immoral what I think

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769
don't think that's immoral what I think

is immoral is when a government doesn't
well what's the most immoral the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700
well what's the most immoral the
 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.430
well what's the most immoral the
government is corrupt and steals from

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440
government is corrupt and steals from
 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.740
government is corrupt and steals from
its citizens but a good government

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750
its citizens but a good government
 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.840

representing as people will educate them

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850
representing as people will educate them
 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.530
representing as people will educate them
all and make sure that they have the

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540
all and make sure that they have the
 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.390

education and the capability to be
 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.190
education and the capability to be
productive and then they can afford to

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200
productive and then they can afford to
 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.220
productive and then they can afford to
take care of themselves and by genetic

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230
take care of themselves and by genetic
 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.340
take care of themselves and by genetic
tests in the meantime especially in

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350
tests in the meantime especially in
 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.659
tests in the meantime especially in
emerging markets the government also has

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669
emerging markets the government also has
 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.039
emerging markets the government also has
to be much more involved in healthcare

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049
to be much more involved in healthcare
 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.190
to be much more involved in healthcare
and things like that so it's the fact

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200
and things like that so it's the fact
 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.160
and things like that so it's the fact
that things are expensive is not immoral

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170
that things are expensive is not immoral
 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.920
that things are expensive is not immoral
the fact that people are prevented from

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930
the fact that people are prevented from
 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.320
the fact that people are prevented from
fulfilling their capabilities and are

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330
fulfilling their capabilities and are
 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.220
fulfilling their capabilities and are
stolen from by their governments and

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230
stolen from by their governments and
 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.510
stolen from by their governments and
cheated and humiliated is what's immoral
