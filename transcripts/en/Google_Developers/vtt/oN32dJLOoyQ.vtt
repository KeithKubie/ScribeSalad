DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.890
I'm Daniel Sieberg with
Google Developers

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.320
Live here at I/O 2013.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.860
And I'm joined right now by
Shalini Agarwal, who is a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.985
product manager with Gmail.

00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:14.900
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yep.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.990
DANIEL SIEBERG: Gmail, which
obviously for a lot of folks

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.350
has become indispensable
on the consumer side.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.020
But what we're going to talk
about is not just the changes

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.990
people are going to see in their
inbox, but how the team

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.080
has thought what can other
companies do to really make it

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.369
more manageable and easier for
people to get through all of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.600
that information that
they get every day.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.540
So tell me about some of the
announcements that were made

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.322
here first of all at I/O.

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:38.810
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.120
Great.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.700
So yesterday we announced that
we were launching four

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.950
different types of actions
in the inbox.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.620
And really, the motivation
behind it was that users have

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.240
a lot of email to process.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.750
And each email takes a lot
of steps, a lot of

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.910
time to really manage.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.630
So anything you want to do
involves a lot of steps.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.880
We really wanted to bring those
steps and those actions

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.940
directly to the top level of the
inbox, so users can manage

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.010
their iterations with their
services much more quickly,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.600
much more easily, and get
through the things that they

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.630
need to do.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.777
DANIEL SIEBERG: So the idea of
these Quick Action Buttons or

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:16.820
however we want to describe
them, you don't

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.010
have to open the email.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.810
They're right there.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.410
We've had the chance to
test it internally.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.040
And I feel like I've only
scratched the surface with

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.990
what you can do with them.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.190
But it's right there as a button
within the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.770
SHALINI AGARWAL: It's
right there.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.090
The button is right there
at the top of the inbox.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.980
For certain cases when you need
more information, you can

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.380
click on it and it opens up a
nice overlay with the key

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.980
information that you need
and the key actions.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:39.510
And that's it.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.020
It's really quite simple and
quite fast for users.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.150
Well, let's see it in action.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.500
SHALINI AGARWAL: All right.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: You've got
a demo here for us.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.830
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.410
DANIEL SIEBERG: You're going to
go into your virtual inbox,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.890
we should say.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.152
This is kind of your email.

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.220
SHALINI AGARWAL: It is.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.520
The first action that we'll
take a look at is RSVPing.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.060
So when your friends invite
you to events, or birthday

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.080
parties, or whatnot, you usually
get an email telling

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.270
you about the invitation.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.820
And now with the action in the
inbox, you get a button on the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.830
right-hand side, this RSVP
button right here.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.900
And when you click on it, you
get the key information.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.420
Here I can find out that
OK, it's a Taco Night.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.750
The event was hosted
by Google Calendar.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.990
And it's on Sunday at 7:00 PM.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.520
And there's one other
person going.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.150
If Clarence had entered
a location, that would

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.470
also show up here.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.650
So with one click, I
open this overlay.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.290
And another click, I hit yes.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.680
Now he knows I'm going.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.170
So that's it.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.200
Gmail on the backend has sent
information to Calendar.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.810
So if you want, we can
take a quick look

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.360
over at Google Calendar.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.690
And here it is--

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.530
Taco Night.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.460
And there it is.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.150
Yes, I'm going.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.840
This is Google Calendar,
but this could work

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.220
for any event service.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.390
For example, Paperless Post is
one of our launch partners.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.860
So when we launch this
feature, we'll be

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.770
launching it with them.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.290
DANIEL SIEBERG: And so they
would choose to have this

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.196
added to their email campaign,
or whatever--

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:00.694
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:01.690
DANIEL SIEBERG: --they were
going to do with it.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.830
It's something they build into
the email itself when they

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.720
send it out, essentially?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.050
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.670
So it's actually very simple.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.940
Our goal was to make it
extremely easy for developers

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.730
to do this.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.440
So all they have to do is add
markup to their emails.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.060
We've been working with
schema.org to try and get this

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.290
markup standardized and reviewed
by other parties out

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.780
there, other email clients.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.170
And it's that simple.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.730
They add some schema, that word
"markup," tell us about

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.980
the event, tell us about the
action, tell us where to send

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.310
the response once the user
takes it, and that's it.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: And I hope too
obviously is that there would

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.800
be increased engagement with
people because it's so

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.500
convenient for them
to actually--

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.930
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.930
DANIEL SIEBERG: --just one
click and they're in.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:42.255
Great.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:42.580
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.920
When you host a party,
you want to know

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.730
if people are coming.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.130
You want people to quickly
figure out if they can come

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.060
and respond.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.360
And not just that, when I get
invitations to parties, I

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.590
first want to see the
information about the party.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.550
Then later on, I might decide
if I'm going or not.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.530
And then on the day of the
party, I'll go back and find

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.000
the email to get the key details
of like what time is,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.670
where it is.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.380
SHALINI AGARWAL: So we wanted
to make all of those steps

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.190
really, really easy.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.950
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.290
Now you've got a few
more things you can

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.150
show us here, right?

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.720
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.110
So the second type of action
is what we call

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.180
the One-Click Action.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.820
And really, it's just
one button to

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.410
take a specific action.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.029
So in this case, Google Offers
has already started marking up

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.170
their emails with this schema.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.900
So when I get the daily
email from them--

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.440
today's happens to be from
Michael's Stores,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.930
which I shop at a lot.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.150
I get picture frames
done there.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.490
So with one click, I
can say, get offer.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.720
And, looks like it
didn't work.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.600
But normally what would happen
is when I click a button, I

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.290
would go over to Google offers,
and it would show up

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.460
right there.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.310
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.770
SHALINI AGARWAL: But clearly,
we had a little

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.570
demo breakdown here.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.150
DANIEL SIEBERG: It could easily
be a connectivity

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.170
issue, which I think it is.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.850
I see down on the
right there--

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.150
SHALINI AGARWAL: There it is.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.900
Yeah.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.555
DANIEL SIEBERG: --that we've
lost the Wi-Fi, so.

00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:56.586
SHALINI AGARWAL: Let's
try it one more time.

00:04:56.586 --> 00:04:57.040
Reload here.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.550
DANIEL SIEBERG: Here we go.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.230
Here we go.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.360
SHALINI AGARWAL: Now,
let's try again.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.210
I click the button.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.035
There it is.

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:02.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: This
looks promising.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.200
SHALINI AGARWAL: Gmail.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.920
DANIEL SIEBERG: There you go.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.040
SHALINI AGARWAL: Sent the
message to Google

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.550
Offers, so I go here.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.030
I reload this tab also.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.280
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.540
SHALINI AGARWAL: And--

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: There it is.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.290
SHALINI AGARWAL: There it is.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.090
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very nice.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.810
SHALINI AGARWAL: One click.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.870
Didn't have to open email.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.120
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.317
SHALINI AGARWAL: Didn't have
to leave the inbox.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:18.131
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:19.300
SHALINI AGARWAL: And
I can keep going

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.140
on to the next item.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.710
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
fantastic.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.080
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.530
DANIEL SIEBERG: And then, the
next one, now these-- so tell

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.270
me again, which ones were
announced here and which ones

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.540
are coming soon?

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.020
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.620
So we announced four.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.070
We announced the RSVP that we
saw, the One-Click button--

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.750
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.810
SHALINI AGARWAL: Rate and
Review, and a Go To action,

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.920
which is really for complex
actions that can't be achieved

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.580
from the inbox.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.490
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.990
SHALINI AGARWAL: So for those,
you actually need to go off to

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.290
a site, a deep link, and
complete your actions.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.670
Those were the four that
were announced.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.120
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.366
And is the next one one of the
Rate and and Review ones you

00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:51.470
can show us?

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.600
SHALINI AGARWAL: The next one
is the Rate and Review.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.080
Yeah.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.040
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.220
SHALINI AGARWAL: So again, we're
working with Seamless as

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.250
one of our life partners.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.920
And so when you order through
them, you order food from a

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.080
restaurant, they can send you an
email that asks you to rate

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.830
your experience.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.430
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.280
SHALINI AGARWAL: And
that's important,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.470
because you want to tell.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.000
When you rate your experiences,
you get better

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.120
suggestions.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.920
So your experience about
the service is

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.670
better down the road.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.150
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.700
SHALINI AGARWAL: So with the
Review option, similar to

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.880
RSVP, you get the key
information you need--

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.590
the name of the restaurant,
whoever you ordered through, a

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.540
picture of whether
it's a product.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.150
Here it's food.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.560
It could be a product,
a movie, anything.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.770
And you can quickly rate
and review, right

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.540
in this little box.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.200
So you say hey, solid meal.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.120
Will order again.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.020
And that's it.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.980
You can see that Gmail is
sending the rating to

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.590
Seamless, and that's it.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.010
DANIEL SIEBERG: Does it get
posted anywhere, or shared

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.610
anywhere else?

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.975
SHALINI AGARWAL: At
seamless.com.

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:53.460
DANIEL SIEBERG: It goes
to seamless.com.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.860
OK.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.150
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.410
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.820
That's great.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.820
SHALINI AGARWAL: It goes
to seamless.com.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: I think
from a convenience

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.915
standpoint, that's awesome.

00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:00.630
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.240
DANIEL SIEBERG: Sometimes you
just are a little reluctant to

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.860
go into your email and then
go to the site, and

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.410
so on, and so on.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.850
For Seamless or any other
company, this is obviously

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:08.690
going to be a big
win because--

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.130
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.390
DANIEL SIEBERG: --now they're
really going to get that kind

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.180
of people actually responding
to these things rather than

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.710
just deciding not to.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.580
SHALINI AGARWAL: It's
kind of amazing.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.200
I counted the number of steps
it takes to actually do this

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.100
without the button.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.540
And it takes six steps.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.230
DANIEL SIEBERG: I believe you.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.690
I am not surprised.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:23.930
SHALINI AGARWAL: And that's
if you remember your login

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.430
information and all
that stuff.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.815
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:07:25.815 --> 00:07:26.200
Yep.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.290
It's a deterrent for
some people.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.840
It just is.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.440
OK.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.520
Now the next one, can we talk
about the dial feature here?

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.000
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.360
This is another--

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.840
it's the same thing as the One
Click Action that we saw from

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.560
Google Offers.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.470
But the really cool thing, I got
to say that the One-Click

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.970
action is my favorite, because
you can do so many different

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.930
kinds of things with it.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.280
Any type of use case that
is just a one click

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.310
action can be done.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.510
So in this case, it's an email
that's actually from

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.130
[? Esna, ?]

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.066
which is a communication service
that's letting me know

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.390
that I missed a call
from Claudio.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.400
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.480
SHALINI AGARWAL: And so they've
enabled this One-Click

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.620
Button, so when I dial it, so
when I click the button, Gmail

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.070
tells us now, OK, the
user clicked the

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.910
button that you added.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.810
And what they do on the backend
is dial, is connect

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.930
the call between
me and Claudio.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.310
So the moment I click it, both
our phones start ringing.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:11.710
DANIEL SIEBERG: Got you.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.940
OK.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.390
SHALINI AGARWAL: I could click
it now, but then Claudio's

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.440
phone might be ringing, and
I don't know where he is.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.660
He might be in a session
somewhere.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: And then the
next one after that, this is

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.660
not available just
yet, the next.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.870
SHALINI AGARWAL: The two
that are available as

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.000
of today are the--

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.960
or actually, sorry, as of
yesterday-- are this Go To

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.200
Action, which is the sort of the
short cut to a deep link

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.530
on another site, and the Button
Action, which is what

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.980
you see here with Dial
and Get Offer.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.179
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yep.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:37.890
OK.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.940
SHALINI AGARWAL: The ones that
are coming soon are RSVP and

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.590
Rate and Review.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:41.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.430
So the Check In one for flight,
that's actually

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.070
available today.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.800
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah,
it's available today.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.160
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.520
That's great.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.375
So show me what will
be involved here.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.630
SHALINI AGARWAL: All I would do,
so this button is actually

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.640
not going to work.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.840
But all would do is I click--

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.750
when you receive this email,
what do you want to do?

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.990
You want to check in
for your flight.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.830
It's not that you need to
necessarily open the email.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.276
It's not that you need to, but
if you do decide you want to

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:06.800
open the email, what we will
have is a beautiful flight

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.660
card at the very top, similar to
the cards you see in Google

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.850
Search and Google Now, at
the top of the email.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.900
And it will give you the
key information--

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.750
your connection times, your
flight details, the airport

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.770
information, and also if the
flight's on time or not.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.660
I can't tell you how many times
I've gone to the airport

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.950
to find out that my flight
was delayed.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: Delayed or
cancelled all together.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.390
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.040
So here, when you get the Check
In email, you'll also

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.060
get this beautiful card.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.890
It's not launched yet, but
it'll be launched soon.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: So there
is a tie-in then with

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.140
Now and with Search.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.330
I mean, we should point out that
this is all part of what

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.060
we're talking about, right?

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:37.440
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.200
Yeah.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.510
It definitely is.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.360
For example, if here we have
a oceanic airlines.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.200
But if any airline were to
mark-up their emails, their

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.090
confirmation emails, or check-in
emails, with schema.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.624
That same information
will feed many

00:09:52.624 --> 00:09:54.130
products, if you will.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.970
So today, it'll enable
experiences in Gmail, and into

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.510
Google Now, and Google Search,
and potentially other

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.730
experiences across the way.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.396
So that users can get the
information that they need,

00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:09.220
that they are getting from
via email, at the

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.950
best time and place.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.780
This all seems to be tied into
the theme of getting the

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:18.900
information you need quickly,
sort of at a glance, and then

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.690
moving on to whatever else
you need to be doing.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.050
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.590
Exactly.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.570
DANIEL SIEBERG: Now tell me, it
feels like there's so much

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.030
potential for this.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.020
Can you tell us what's on the
horizon here, where you see

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.570
this going?

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.050
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.040
I mean this is--

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.350
we're really excited
about this.

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.230
And it's really just
the beginning.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.390
Over time, we'll be adding
more types of actions.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.770
Over time, we'll be adding more
types of social data.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.980
So I talked about the Flight
Card, but also we'll have

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.320
things for events and hotels.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.420
And we'll be expanding those
experiences across Google.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.270
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.910
What's the response been from
the merchants and the

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.080
companies that you've
talked to?

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.920
And maybe you can, I know you
mentioned a few of the

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.630
partners like Seamless, but if
you wanted to run down maybe a

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.900
few that have been really
actively involved in this.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.960
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah,
definitely.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.560
So we've gotten a
lot of response.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.770
Because at the end of the day,
companies and services care

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.190
about user engagement.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.100
And so they're sending their
users emails because they want

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.860
to tell them something
or do something.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.060
And so it's been pretty exciting
as we demo these

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.950
types of features for partners,
and the different

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.660
kinds of use cases they
come up with.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.960
So every partner we have, we
start the conversation by

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.780
saying, tell us about the things
that you do with your

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.800
users and what communications
you have with them over email.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.910
SHALINI AGARWAL: Because the
types of things, it can be

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.850
anything from, for
example, Spotify.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.470
When you subscribe, so I use
Spotify and I listen to my

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.330
brother's playlist.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.140
I subscribe to them.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.360
So every time he adds music,
which is actually pretty often

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.890
which is fun, they
send me an email.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:52.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: You get a
notification-- an email.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.500
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.570
And so now, I can, now those
emails have a button on the

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.490
right-hand side that say,
listen to the song.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.780
And when I click that button,
it opens a tab.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.790
And if my player's installed,
it just starts playing.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
very clever.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.150
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.980
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.760
And some, I can see some of
these businesses would

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.400
actually want to do multiple
versions of it.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:11.430
I mean--

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.790
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: You could get
one like an airline might want

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.310
a review, as well as to remind
you of your flight.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:17.070
SHALINI AGARWAL: How
was your flight?

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:17.540
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.550
DANIEL SIEBERG: Exactly,
because I get

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.370
those emails too.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.070
So it's a bit of both.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.146
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:12:23.146 --> 00:12:24.920
DANIEL SIEBERG: You talked a
bit about the motivation

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.330
behind all of this, but maybe
you can kind of expand on that

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.160
a little bit, just in terms of
what people have to deal with

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.640
in their inbox.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.290
I mean, we're all coping with

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.460
information overload sometimes.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.420
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.660
DANIEL SIEBERG: I imagine the
team really thought hard.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.550
In some ways, this feels
really intuitive to me.

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.510
It almost feels like this hasn't
been there before?

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.870
Like it feels like something
that just makes sense.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.920
Can you reveal a little bit of
the thinking in all of this?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.120
I think it's really neat.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.330
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah, so it
basically boils down to each

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.940
email today looks the same,
but really it contains all

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.485
sorts of different types
of information.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:57.980
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.200
SHALINI AGARWAL: And so, it
should be more tailored.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.890
It should be easier to figure
out what is it you want.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.240
It should be more structured.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.620
Email is extremely unstructured
today.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.080
So everything you do, you
have to figure out.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.140
The user has to do the work, to
figure out what it is that

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.830
they're being asked to do, what
information is in there,

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:21.230
and dig for it, and open
different tabs, and it's like

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.735
a funnel type of process.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:23.050
DANIEL SIEBERG: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.530
Right.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:25.860
SHALINI AGARWAL: And
it's frustrating.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.380
And so often times, you probably
know this as a user.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.220
I feel it.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:29.820
We see it.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.200
A lot of emails go unanswered
or unopened.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:32.880
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.250
SHALINI AGARWAL: But that
doesn't mean the user doesn't

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.270
want to do those things.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.360
It's just too painful.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.370
DANIEL SIEBERG: I think that's
an excellent point, because I

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.400
think there's best intentions
perhaps on both sides--

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:44.750
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.560
DANIEL SIEBERG: --but not enough
of a sort of an easy

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.272
bridge between the requests
and the action

00:13:49.272 --> 00:13:50.520
to actually do it.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:50.770
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.100
DANIEL SIEBERG: And now, if
you're just asking somebody to

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.680
click one button, it
doesn't get much

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.105
simpler than doing that.

00:13:55.105 --> 00:13:55.500
SHALINI AGARWAL: No.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.290
No.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.630
DANIEL SIEBERG: Anything else
you want to mention in terms

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.080
of what's coming?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.350
SHALINI AGARWAL: So I would just
say that we definitely

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.260
want to add more actions.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.850
We're really excited about this

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.800
concept of In Place Actions.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.510
So we are going to work closely
with our existing

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.405
partners and we want to
hear from developers.

00:14:12.405 --> 00:14:14.640
DANIEL SIEBERG: I was going to
say, I imagine you're going to

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.350
discover a lot of ways that
it can be used that--

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.530
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: --hadn't
been thought of before.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:18.490
SHALINI AGARWAL: Exactly.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.190
And we already did, you know,
through the process, we've

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.070
already come up with a few
actions and we want to add

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.530
over the coming months, because
they will be good

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.740
platforms for lots of
different cases.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.050
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:29.920
SHALINI AGARWAL: And help users

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.310
connect with their services.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:32.355
DANIEL SIEBERG: And this
is all measurable, I

00:14:32.355 --> 00:14:33.030
mean, by the companies.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.630
They could really see the kind
of engagement attraction that

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.080
they're getting from people
looking at this.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.230
SHALINI AGARWAL: Yeah, I mean,
they can track their links.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.160
They can track when you
just click on links.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.390
They can track when the servlets
on a backend are hit.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.620
So when we send them a
response, they know.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.300
And so they can easily
track that.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:51.980
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.470
All right.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.390
Well, Shalini, thank
you so much.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:54.600
SHALINI AGARWAL: Thank
you, Daniel.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.040
DANIEL SIEBERG: This
has been a great--

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.190
I've learned a lot.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.540
I mean I use Gmail all the
time, but I think this is

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.210
going to be a fantastic
addition to it.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.620
SHALINI AGARWAL: We hope so.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.310
We're pretty excited.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:04.690
Thank you so much.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:05.030
SHALINI AGARWAL: Thanks.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.340
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.060
That's going to do it
for now here on

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.200
Google Developers Live.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.290
Stay tuned for lots more
content, right here.
