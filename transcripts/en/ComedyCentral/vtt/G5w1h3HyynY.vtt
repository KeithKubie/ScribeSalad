00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.634
I know you're armed
to the teeth.

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.036
I'm saying though,
what if we flip it

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.071
and now you have a bandolier
of throwing harmonicas.

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:06.272
I do.

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.441
Which you can play them
kind of like...

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:09.776
Wait you already have those?

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.077
Well, you can throw them.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.779
Yeah. The key is like,
here's a harmonica,

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.680
see now, if you look
at the front of it,

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:17.250
it's kinda almost like a blade,
these are the corner,

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.453
that's the business end
right there, you just wanna
(swish)

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:21.854
give it a nice
little flat throw.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:23.356
What if you just ended me
right now,

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:24.557
just right between the eyes.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.192
He goes,
“And let me tell you something,

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.127
I'm razor precise
with this thing.”

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.395
Eh, I used to be.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:31.264
And I owe Jay
something from '09.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:36.903
We went to the documentary,
'Swiped',

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.137
We ain't though it yet.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.605
Yeah, we ain't through it.
It's gonna be a two-parter.

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:40.840
But we're having fun with it.
Fo sho.

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.443
Turns out a lot longer
than we thought we were.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:44.977
Were you trying to be popular?

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.980 line:0%
I was desperately trying
to not be seen in eighth grade

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:49.348 line:0%
and you're saying
all camera ready.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.551 line:0%
I was trying to be liked
by everybody.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.785
They are all camera ready.

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:55.788
But I wasn't like...
I just hoped everyone liked me

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:58.825
and then my friends were kinda
like the bad kids

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.260
so I just didn't want
to get bullied by them.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:04.497
I just think there was a thing,
a part of growing up that would,

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.867
people went too far
with everything obviously.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.136
There was gluttony
in everything, but I mean,

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.206
bullying in the loosest usage
of the term

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.675
just sort of regulated things.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.876
Well I tell yeah what didn't.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.144
It also drove me
towards passions.

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.779
Like if everybody...

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:22.615
If you're a fat kid I don't know
if it's important for everybody

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.317
to go it doesn't matter,
you're beauti-,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.818
you're an amazing person.
It doesn't matter.

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.955
Oh, but also for your health,
you should probably not be fat.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.457
Christine brought that up with
the plus size model industry

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.192
where they're like praising
these women that are,

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:34.827
you said,
dangerously overweight.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.062
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.565
They are moderately hot pigs.
Every one of 'em.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:40.733
You said what, Christine?

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.768
I saw an ad the other day
that got me really upset.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.638
I think it'd be like putting
an anorexic woman up

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.740
as a model and saying,
"This is beautiful."

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.275
No, this is a sickness,
this person needs help.

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:50.476
Yeah.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.845
You know, or a drug addict,
like, it's crazy.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.113
Yeah, but you also don't,

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.315
I mean, with an anorexic girl
you are like sad and bummed out,

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.050
but with like a really heavy
girl you're probably like,

00:01:58.083 --> 00:01:59.519
"God damn that food though."

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.521
I see, now you know
what she really needs?

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.256
A little shot in the chops.

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.591
I mean what was ...

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:07.260
Oh that's when everybody goes,
"Obese girl?

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.395
You know what she needs?
"A little boobettes”

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:10.997
I like- Popper just steps
in and he goes,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.198
"I know how to heckle anyone."

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.799
Dude, that's one of
the funniest things ever.

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.402
I thought about that twenty
minutes after him leaving,

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.337
I was still laughing at that.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.540
Any female, he goes,
"You can heckle..."

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.475
You can heckle
Florence, watch.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:23.843
"Oh my little..."
You're fat!

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.111
Yeah.

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.779
When I hear that buzzing
in my noise,

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.515
it's a bully
calling me fat!

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.084
We never really went in
to that cause John walked in.

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:33.352
No, there was so much...

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.654
Yeah, this ad upset me.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:35.888
That ad.
Yeah, this ad upset me.

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:37.123
Do you have... ew.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:38.357
Yeah, that's dangerous.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.959
It's dangerous.
It's absolutely dangerous,

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:42.828
and it's somebody promoting,
sickness is beauty.

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.864
I wanna see a pillow case
full of dimes.

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:48.367
Can you take me to the bank?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.436
And you're like ," Ah man..."

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.138
Is she trying to find
a Coinstar machine

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.506
to get rid of all that?

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:54.674
It's an ad for clothes.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:55.908
It's like a clump suit.

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.944
It's zero zero to forty,
which is fine,

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.612
it's not like women
that are size forty

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.447
shouldn't have clothes to buy,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.683
it's just a weird thing
to normalize.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.985
Her cankles are the thinnest
thing on her body.

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:07.687
But yours, yeah, you're saying
they show this

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.088
and they're like,"
Hey, this is..."

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:11.490
They should pose that with like,
"Hey do you need help?

00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:14.460
Do you have a food addiction?
Like call this number."

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.629
It shouldn't be modeled as like,
you know...

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:20.333
Yes bitch. Be big. Be bold. Be.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:22.769
Have tingly feelings
in your arms.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.504
Yeah, diabetes.

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:28.241
Yeah girl, get the bottoms
of those feet round.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.109
Heart failure... Sexy.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:33.212
Do you like having strokes
in your thirties?

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.448
Then be big you bad bitch.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.517
Do you sweat butter?
Then you'll love it.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:41.020
Do you have memory loss
cause your heart is over working

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.755
and you flash
and you pass out?

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:45.625
Be bad you big bitch.

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:50.896
Do you like chocolate so much
you don't give a shit

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.164
about the right side
of your face?

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:54.234
Yeah. Have you woke up
driving a car?

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:57.403
Be big and beautiful.

00:03:58.103 --> 00:03:59.806
Are your utensils
not big enough?

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.709
Does your piss smell
like a bag of sugar?

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.480
Are you in 24-7 ketosis?

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.715
You're right, dude!

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:10.916
It's like there is a point,
right?

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.318
This is fucked up!
It's sick!

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:14.253
It's all just like
everybody is ...

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:15.521
It's like the way booze,

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.056
like beer commercials
eventually in the nineties

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:18.291
had to start being like,

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.558
"Please drink responsibly."

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.460
Yeah, I was just
hot chicks and ...

00:04:21.493 --> 00:04:24.330
Have you ever thought, "Why
don't they make socks wider?"

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.401
Do you find sweat pants
suffocating?

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:34.207 line:0%
Be big, you bad bitch. You big,
beautiful, bad bitch.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:38.311
Did you Christopher a dog?

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:43.382
Because you didn't realize that
your bichon frise was on the
couch?

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:46.219
Did your niece ...
Are your cats in your folds?

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:49.255
Did you find a remote in a fold?

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:51.223
Be big, be beautiful.

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:52.458
Did your niece run out of thread

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:54.360
trying to make you
a friendship necklace?

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:57.496
Yeah. But it is man, it's like
the way the beer commercials

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.931
were back
in the eighties, like,

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:01.967
"Spuds McKenzie!
Even the dog gets drunk!"

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.436
And then in the nineties
they are like,

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.271
"Please drink responsibly,
turns out this shit

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:06.539
just rots your liver."

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.174
Don't get the dog drunk.

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.209
Stop feeding alcohol
to party animals.

00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:11.844
There is no such things
as a party animal.

00:05:11.877 --> 00:05:13.079
All doing Jagermeister?

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.714
They can't process alcohol
the way we can.

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:17.249
When Jagermeister called me
on that tour to say,

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:19.518
"No jokes about
drinking irresponsibly,

00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:23.756
or anything sexual
and alcohol related."

00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:26.459
That's how Guinness was
when I worked for Guinness.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:29.128
I can do sex jokes,
but if I go...

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:32.565
if I even went, "She came over,
we had a few drinks... "

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:35.534
Like just something like that,
they are like no no no.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.103
Yeah they did a thing where...

00:05:37.136 --> 00:05:38.738
You can fuck this girl
in this joke all you like

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.239
but do not give her alcohol.

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:42.241
You do it, she better
be stone sober.

00:05:42.274 --> 00:05:44.310
You better enjoy
the ride of Jager,

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:45.644
but she better be stone sober.

00:05:45.677 --> 00:05:48.481
I'm like, "What? Do these things
go together a lot?"

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:51.083
Why, have you found too much
alcohol and sex

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:52.819
to be problematic?

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:56.589
We straddle a billion dollar
fine line.

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.023
It's been a thing.

00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:01.327
It's been a problem, but we
can't, but drink responsibly!

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.695
Cinco de Mayo!

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:03.963
Cinco de Mayo!

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.932
It was weird to work
for a large alcohol company,

00:06:06.965 --> 00:06:08.134
cause they were like,

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.969
“Here's what you can
and can not say.

00:06:10.002 --> 00:06:11.771
Like, you can not say this
or you will lose your job.”

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.372
And I wasn't trying to go
back to waiting tables.

00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:15.541
I know but it's like
only their one thing.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.376
You're like, “Can I draw
a picture of Muhammad?”

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.711
And they're like,
"Yeah, that's fine, sure."

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.112
Yeah, oh absolutely,
do you want to like, fuck it?

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:21.347
You should probably fuck it.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.648
A bunch of people
are probably like,

00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:23.983
"I don't think I want
to do that at all."

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.184
And they go

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:27.720
Draw Muhammad,
squeezing tits and just fuck it.

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:30.856
Fuck it. Make him have
a big old dick and big titties.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.192
And you like, "Okay, can I say
like I've had too many,

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:35.127
I had so many Guinness
he looked... "

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.962
Do not say that.

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:38.464
Do not say you
drank enough Guinness

00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:40.900
to fuck the cartoon trans ...

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:44.336
How about I drank enough
Guinness to draw Muhammad,

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:45.571
yeah still, no.

00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:46.906
No. Sorry.
It has to be a sober act.

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.174
Sorry dude.

00:06:48.207 --> 00:06:49.442
I would never do that sober.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:52.111
When you're drinking Guinness,
you just better be in a nice,

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:54.346
fog covered field in a wagon.

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.049
In an itchy sweater
with two of your Irish friends.

00:06:57.983 --> 00:06:59.418
Laughing and drinking.

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:01.787
Ah dude. It's so funny
to see who's like,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.190
cause there's people
that are like, into Guinness.

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:06.526
And I was like
Guinness ambassador.

00:07:07.893 --> 00:07:09.962
Can you look up a list
of Guinness myths?

00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:11.263
There's so many great ones.

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:13.098
They say there is
fish gel in it.

00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:14.366
They said that like,

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.535
I always heard that there's meat
in the bottom of the barrels.

00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:17.770
There ain't no meat.

00:07:17.803 --> 00:07:19.638
It's rats in the barrel,
Hell yeah.

00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:20.940
... that make it to be
a certain way.

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:24.210
When I met Furgo Murray,
the Brewmaster of Guinness,

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:25.611
and it was quite a time...

00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:28.314
He was covered in rats
like a Tori Amos video.

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:30.483
He was all rats in a mans suit.

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:34.687
What if I told yeah that
they came together like Voltron?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.956
He was made of seven
hundred rats.

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.224
Fun fascinating fact.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.125
That's actually
the new Guinness point.

00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:41.827
The old point.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.028
These are the myths?

00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:44.563
Yeah, but they're not...

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:46.866
Guinness is good for you,
well, it's alcohol.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.200
Guinness is black. I knew that.

00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:50.236
It's not actually. It's amber.

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.537
I knew it wasn't black.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.805
Yeah dude, it was pretty crazy.

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:54.273
I was more for like,
"Guinness cures cancer.",

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:55.474
or something like that.

00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:57.042
Aw, no. It's funny see
all their, you know,

00:07:57.075 --> 00:07:58.310
we were talking
about commercials.

00:07:58.343 --> 00:08:00.579
This is what led us to here, but
all the old commercials ones.

00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:02.314
Look up,
"Old Guinness Commercials."

00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:04.917
Cause they are like, "Guinness
gives you strength." That's how
they marketed it. 

00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:08.254
They are like, "Did you have
a long day at work?

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.855
Drink a couple Guinness."

00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:14.226
The Irish work force
has alcoholism out of control.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:16.128
I'm not stupid to think,

00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:17.830
wasn't there like ads
for cigarettes

00:08:17.863 --> 00:08:19.431
saying there are benefits
for you?

00:08:19.464 --> 00:08:20.966
Yeah, back in the thirties
and forties and shit.

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:22.134
Mm-hmm.

00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:24.503
They said smoking... Look it up!
It's what Beau said.

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:26.005
Like finding out
your therapist has a Twitter.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:29.241
You start hacking up
and coughing

00:08:29.274 --> 00:08:32.478
and having a lot of stuff
pretty few months into smoking.

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:36.315
Did anyone ever make an ad for
it months into it that was like,

00:08:36.348 --> 00:08:38.183
"Oh guys, you know what, like
I don't know if good for you

00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:39.418
but it's not feeling good."

00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:40.686
Look at the print ads.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:41.954
Oh, when you start smoking,
you're like...

00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:43.188
Well, I'm saying.

00:08:43.221 --> 00:08:44.657 line:0%
How many months in
before you're like, "Whew.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.059 line:0%
I actually am feeling smoking."
Not many.

00:08:47.092 --> 00:08:48.794
And so to have commercials
at all that are like,

00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:50.863
"This is good for you."
It goes, "No.

00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:53.232
If you're smoking
you already know this sucks."

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:55.100
Within five years of smoking.

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:57.102
No matter how many
commercials are on.

00:08:57.135 --> 00:08:58.737
You feel it when you breathe.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.973
And you go,
"It's a problem now."

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:03.275
But, was this the mind frame
different, where they're like,

00:09:03.308 --> 00:09:04.944
"It's not a problem.
That's actually strength.

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:06.211
Those are strength wheezes."
See look.

00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:07.513
There it is,
Guinness for strength.

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:08.747
Guinness for strength.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.749
So just drink this
and get strong. There's uh ...

00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:11.951
If you drink enough of it

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:13.786
you think you can lift
anything though.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:15.554
Christine, can you look up
which country,

00:09:15.587 --> 00:09:20.993
I believe it might be
in Bermuda or something,

00:09:21.026 --> 00:09:24.129
where there is a myth where if
you drink Guinness extra stout,

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:27.366
it's good for your potency,
for your cum.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.071
Like make a shot on the nuts
and a pint of Guinness

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:33.973
will make any load
bear you a strong boy.

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.574
If you drink enough
you'll cum Guinness.

00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:37.343
I go, "Alright now,
I'm gonna drink this Guinness,

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:39.511
and you just smack me
in the nuts. Ready. Go."

00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:41.246
I'll tell ya why I hate it.

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.482
I don't like any beer
that's not carbonated.

00:09:43.515 --> 00:09:45.384
I don't even
understand it.

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:46.852
Oh what, you mean
that swamp water

00:09:46.885 --> 00:09:48.220
that they had me drinking
for two years?

00:09:48.253 --> 00:09:49.455
I don't understand, uh...

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:50.856
No, it was actually delicious.
I enjoyed it.

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:52.157
Guinness?

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.127
Dude, I enjoy. I like Guinness.
So I was fine with it.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.795
There did get a point
where I didn't like it.

00:09:56.828 --> 00:09:58.197
Do you like it to?
It's like a meal.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.431
I didn't like it.
It's flat!

00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:01.834
I was drinking three a night,
three shows a night.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:03.035
Yeah.

00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:04.503
So that's nine Guinness.
Sure.

00:10:04.536 --> 00:10:05.938
And then it was going out
drinking with the crew

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.339
afterwards.

00:10:07.372 --> 00:10:08.540
Guinness. More Guinness.

00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:10.409
Uh, no dude.
I would sneak Bud heavies.

00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:11.744
Really?

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:15.414
Yeah. I got caught
by my boss at Guinness.

00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:16.649
Like a Budweiser,
original.

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:17.850
Oh.

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:20.119
I went to the bar at the hotel
in Ireland,

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:22.054
when we were there
drinking in Dublin,

00:10:22.087 --> 00:10:25.791
and I went down and had a shot
of Jack Daniels and Budweiser

00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:28.260
and the guy from Guinness
came out

00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:29.628
and was like,
“Oh, what are you doing?”

00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:32.765
I was like, “Ha ha, I was just
seeing how shitty it is.”

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:33.999
It's like, “I have to check
and see

00:10:34.032 --> 00:10:35.634
if the other one sucks
as much as I remember.”

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:36.935
Oh this is gross-ass rice beer

00:10:36.968 --> 00:10:38.170
and then the whole time
I was like,

00:10:38.203 --> 00:10:39.838
“This is so sweet
and delicious.”

00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:41.106
Like a gerbil
at a water thing.

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:42.408
You just take
a little bit of it,

00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:43.609
he goes “You have a shot.”

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:46.745
And he goes, “Aw, disgusting.
It's just terrible.

00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:48.113
I can't even believe
I'm doing it.”

00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:49.715
Mm, oh my God,
I'm punishing myself.

00:10:49.748 --> 00:10:51.450
I'm so sadomasochistic.

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:54.386
And each time you take a little
bit more of the shot.

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:56.522
"Oh God, it's so gross.
I'm not savoring it or anything.

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:58.357
I'm relishing
in how gross it is."

00:10:59.591 --> 00:11:01.960
When I tried quitting
drinking one time,

00:11:01.993 --> 00:11:04.763
and I got like five weeks,
and I felt really good about it.

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:06.331
And this was before
I read the book,

00:11:06.364 --> 00:11:07.733
The Easy Way to Quit Drinking.

00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:11.737
It was like, I felt really great
about it and then they are like,

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.606
"Hey, Guinness wants you
to do ten more cities."

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:19.478
And you know that point, where
you're making money off comedy,

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:21.980
but if you don't have
another side job it's hard.

00:11:22.013 --> 00:11:23.182
It's like really hard.

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:24.650
So I was at that point
where I was headlining,

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:26.518
not making a lot of money
at all on the weekends,

00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:27.753
and then trying
to do this thing.

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:30.089
I was like, alright,
I'll do ten more cities,

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.457
but I'll try not to drink.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.292
For some reason I thought
I didn't have to drink.

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:34.560
I was like...

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:36.028
Gonna put some ice tea
in my cup.

00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:39.865
No, just do a fake sip.
Just like take it and be like...

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:45.270
The first night we're in Boston
I do the three shows...

00:11:45.303 --> 00:11:47.206
You shotgun it?

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:50.442
Dude, this is how much I just
completely jump back in

00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:51.977
and I'm so wishy-washy.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.912
We go out, the president
of Guinness shows up,

00:11:53.945 --> 00:11:55.347
this Irish guy
who just took over.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.349
And he's like, “I'd like
to have a pint with ya.

00:11:57.382 --> 00:11:59.084
Let's go out and talk.”

00:11:59.117 --> 00:12:01.286
We're just at this bar
and he puts down two beers

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:03.255
and I'm like,
well I have to drink this beer,

00:12:03.288 --> 00:12:04.523
cause this dudes in front of me.

00:12:04.556 --> 00:12:06.125
So I drink the beer
and then I'm like,

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:07.693
“Let's have another one.
Can we have another one?”,

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:09.094
and then I'm like,
“Do you want to do a shot?”,

00:12:09.127 --> 00:12:10.863
and he's like,
“I would love to do a shot!"

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.465
I go out and get fucking
hammered with this guy,

00:12:13.498 --> 00:12:14.800
like fucking hammered.

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:16.368
I hadn't drank in five weeks
and I was like,

00:12:16.401 --> 00:12:18.637
"Do you got a pack of cigarettes
on you? What's up dude?”

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.372
I was like,
“You fucking tiny Mick!",

00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:21.573
by the end of it.

00:12:21.606 --> 00:12:24.810
I go, "This sausage finger fuck
is my new best friend."

00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:28.814
I go, "He runs Guinness anyways.
I'm the ambassador.

00:12:28.847 --> 00:12:30.549
Suck my dick!"

00:12:31.616 --> 00:12:34.253
Dude, it became...
I started blacking out,

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:36.155
I'm gonna be at the DC
Draft House this weekend.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:38.590
I can't go to DC
without thinking about

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:41.527
when we did the Guinness shows.
I got blackout drunk

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.763
and just smoked cigarettes
in my hotel room,

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:45.898
like it was the seventies.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.933
And then a week later
I called the hotel

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.003
and I did my best official
white guy voice.

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:52.604
There's an odd charge
from my card.

00:12:52.637 --> 00:12:54.339
Yeah! I called, I go,
“There's a strange charge.”,

00:12:54.372 --> 00:12:55.574
and all I did was say this.

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:57.042
The guy goes,
“it was a cleaning fee.

00:12:57.075 --> 00:12:58.277
I think you smoked
in your room.”

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.711
I go, “That's funny,
I don't smoke.”

00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:01.780
And he goes,
“Oh, that's weird.”

00:13:01.813 --> 00:13:03.081
It got put back
on my credit card.

00:13:03.114 --> 00:13:04.583
It's a catch 22, they always
have to give it back.

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:05.784
They always have
to give it back.

00:13:05.817 --> 00:13:07.319
If you call them out like,
“I didn't smoke in my room.

00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:08.520
Be like...”

00:13:08.553 --> 00:13:09.754
Yeah, now you're calling me
a smoker.

00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:17.462
You're saying I'm a smoker.
You're gonna call me a smoker.

00:13:17.495 --> 00:13:18.831
How dare you.

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:21.133
Hang on, cause you're stressing
me the fuck out, hang on...

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:23.869
Let me get a cigarette,
I mean, I don't even smoke.

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:26.038
Um...
Yeah, it was bad.

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.006
You call me a smoker,
right to my ears.

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:29.808
And then I was taking that
drinking energy on the road

00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:31.043
when I was doing comedy.

00:13:31.076 --> 00:13:32.211
Danny Suds Mackenzie?

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.445
Dude. Hell yeah.

00:13:33.478 --> 00:13:34.913
Duffman. That's what
all my friends called me.

00:13:34.946 --> 00:13:37.983
Just a fucking knapsack full
of Hawaiian shirts and jams.

00:13:38.016 --> 00:13:39.819
And I go, "Dude,
you ready to party?

00:13:40.418 --> 00:13:43.155
All you need is a Miller Lite."

00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:45.290
You know the best thing
about Hawaiian shirts?

00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:47.726
It's day gear
and sleep gear.

00:13:47.759 --> 00:13:51.830
Yeah, it's pajama-jams
and day-jams. It was a...

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:54.967
You can't see puke
on a weird landscaped shirt.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.769
Guinness is owned by
this company named Diageo,

00:13:57.802 --> 00:14:01.039
and they are like
a major alcohol company.

00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:04.543 line:0%
They own Johnny Walker,
Jose Cuervo, Smirnoff.

00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:06.411 line:0%
They own most major brands.

00:14:06.444 --> 00:14:09.548 line:0%
They have an office
over on 45th and 5th,

00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:12.317
and if you are an employee
they have a full bar.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.886
Lou, don't jizz
in your pants.

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.455
You can walk in and you are not
allowed to tip the bartenders.

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:18.190
Do they need an engineer?

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.193
And you can drink
whatever you want.

00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:22.494
So, I would be like...

00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:23.695
Always?

00:14:23.728 --> 00:14:25.397
If you are an employee
of Diageo,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.766
you can go have a drink
at the bar when you want.

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:29.001
Of anything.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:31.871
So I just went and had a Johnny
Walker Blue,

00:14:32.804 --> 00:14:34.773
like at the bar.
Just like, "Alright."

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:37.142
And by the way it was when
I was doing a Monday night.

00:14:37.175 --> 00:14:38.577
Christine
just creamed her jeans.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.279
Yeah! But it was a Monday night

00:14:40.312 --> 00:14:41.880
when I was doing a show
at Caroline's,

00:14:41.913 --> 00:14:43.882
and I showed up drunk
to Caroline's.

00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:45.784
I was like,
"What time am I on?"

00:14:45.817 --> 00:14:48.287
And the are like, "It's nine.
How are you this drunk?"

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.023
I was like, "I went by Diageo
at like five o'clock."

00:14:52.223 --> 00:14:54.359
And you don't tip.
You just sit there.

00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:56.561
The most awkward time
of my life was,

00:14:56.594 --> 00:14:58.363
and you'll know this
as a cigarette smoker,

00:14:58.396 --> 00:14:59.598
was leaving to go smoke
a cigarette

00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:00.832
and then trying
to get back in

00:15:00.865 --> 00:15:03.202
without looking like
a raging alcoholic.

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:06.238
Cause I left and I was like,
“Alright bye everybody!”

00:15:06.271 --> 00:15:08.774
And then I'm just downstairs,
and I'm like,

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.742
“I'm gonna go back up and
fucking have a Guinness Black

00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:12.478
and another shot of...”

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.113
And then trying to get
back in like,

00:15:15.146 --> 00:15:15.847
This fucking rules!

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.383
“Yeah, is Christine here?”

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:20.686
That was the girl I knew
that worked there. Kristen.

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:23.088
And I was like,
"Can I talk to Kristen?"

00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:25.190
Do you? She's totally cool.

00:15:25.223 --> 00:15:26.926
"Let me back in."

00:15:27.492 --> 00:15:29.294
Trying to grab the door...
"Just let me back in."

00:15:29.327 --> 00:15:30.529
Yeah, she tries to close it

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:31.863
but you put you
your foot back in.

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:35.033
"No no, just wait. I'm saying
her name right. Kristen?"

00:15:35.066 --> 00:15:37.169
"Did I say something mean
to Andy the bartender

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:38.837
I thought we were friends.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.605
I told him I was gonna smoke,
he said it's be cool."

00:15:40.638 --> 00:15:42.140
I think I left my wallet inside.

00:15:42.173 --> 00:15:45.678
Do you mind if I smoke
in the stairwell?

00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:47.779
What?

00:15:47.812 --> 00:15:49.681
Give me one thing!

00:15:49.714 --> 00:15:51.616
Give me one thing?

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:52.918
Just do one thing for me!

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:54.319
Just do one of the things
I'm asking!

00:15:54.352 --> 00:15:55.887
Why won't you do
one of the things for me?

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.222
I'm meeting you halfway.

00:15:57.255 --> 00:15:58.557
The most pathetic weekends
of my life

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.791
were where I was on the road

00:15:59.824 --> 00:16:01.393
and I was like,
“I'm not drinking this weekend”"

00:16:01.426 --> 00:16:03.261
And then you're talking
like that and they're like,

00:16:03.294 --> 00:16:06.164
“You have media in four hours.”
And you're like “ ... your
media.”

00:16:06.197 --> 00:16:07.799
You're the one who's
fucking the media up.

00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:09.868
Whatever. I'm gonna wake up
fresh as a daisy.

00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:11.703
Then you wake up and everything
is sideways until ...

00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:13.872
I'm gonna go puke this, okay?

00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:15.841
I wanna love you and I wanna
move to Syracuse

00:16:15.874 --> 00:16:18.110
and be with you.
I think we should be together.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:20.212
Let's just take over this
little radio station

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.480
together me and you,
he goes,

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:24.516
"Ah, sorry, our guest
seems to be a little weird.

00:16:24.549 --> 00:16:27.085
This is Woody
and The Scooch on so..."

00:16:27.118 --> 00:16:29.221
And he goes, "Why don't you guys
just turn these microphones off

00:16:29.254 --> 00:16:30.455
and lets just be together."

00:16:30.488 --> 00:16:32.624
Can we talk like we did
when I walked in?

00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:34.259
Ah, we're getting a little
uncomfortable here.

00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:36.528
Fifth caller is gonna get
free tickets to Dan's show.

00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:38.163
He goes,
"I don't even wanna do a show.

00:16:38.196 --> 00:16:40.032
I wanna get a little cottage
with you two."

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:41.767
Can I show you me?

00:16:44.502 --> 00:16:46.638
Coming back with the five,
tickets for Dan Soder.

00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.206
He's gonna be
at The Funny Bone.

00:16:48.239 --> 00:16:50.709
Don't know what his acts about.
You've seen him on Geico

00:16:50.742 --> 00:16:52.344
and he's a little out
of it right now.

00:16:52.377 --> 00:16:53.779
Can I show you me? What is that?

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:55.614
Can I show you. Me?

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:57.616
I wanna show you.
I wanna be with you though.
