&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:18.250
[ Silence ]

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.840
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.410
I want to welcome you to the
Library of Congress here today.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.870
I'm Betsy Peterson,
and I'm the Director

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.020
of the American Folklife
Center, which is a relative,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.340
or I guess you might say,
the Veterans History Project.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.800
The two organizations or divisions
work very closely together.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.160
Thank you for coming and
for our wonderful Book Talk,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.960
featuring Cecilia Garcia-Akers,
who will discuss her new book,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.540
"The Inspiring Life of
Texan Hector P. Garcia."

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.350
Before we get started though, I
would like you to take a moment

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.340 position:56%
of silence to honor the memory of
another member of the Garcia family,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.750
Cecilia's uncle and veteran of
our country, Dr. C.P. Garcia,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.650
who passed away last month
on Sunday, April 24th.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.700
He was the last surviving brother
to Dr. Hector P. Garcia and,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.360 position:56%
like his brother, he too also served
his community in medical practice,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.590
Civil Rights activism, and as a
member of the American GI Forum.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.510
So, if we could just
have a moment of silence.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:45.150
[ Silence ]

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.450
Thank you.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.460
Now, the Veterans History Project
would like to take a moment

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.190
to thank the co-sponsors
of this event,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.110 position:56%
and we have a couple here today that
we're really pleased to recognize,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.990
the Library's Office of
Equal Employment Opportunity

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.860
and Diversity Programs and the
Library's Hispanic Initiative,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.380
which is a two-year
initiative headed

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.130
by the Hispanic Working Group
here at the Library with the aim

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.700
of increasing awareness among
the US Hispanic community

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.600
about the Library's programs,
services, collections,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.930
and career opportunities, in
addition to increasing programming

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.710
about the US Hispanic experience.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.750
And now I'd like to talk a
little bit more specifically

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.910
about our guest of honor.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.130 position:56%
Morning, Corpus Christi Texas,
Cecilia Garcia-Akers is the daughter

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.860
of Dr. Hector P. and
Wanda F. Garcia.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.140
She holds a bachelor's degree in
biology from St. Mary's University

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.840
in San Antonio and a
graduate from the University

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.270
of Texas Medical Branch
in Galveston, Texas,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.680
with a degree in Physical Therapy.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.400
Currently, she is in private
practice in San Antonio, Texas,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.220
where she specializes
in geriatric orthopedics

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.830
and neuromuscular rehabilitation.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.310
Her first job was as a medical
assistant to her father,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.480
the man we are here to commemorate
today, Dr. Hector P. Garcia,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.600
and she worked with
him for ten years prior

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.160
to completing her studies
in physical therapy.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.480
She has served on the Texas State
Board of Physical Therapy Examiners

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.600
and as Board Chair, appointed

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.770
by Texas Governors Mark
White and Ann Richards.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.410
Among many other professional
accomplishments, in 2012,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.800
Ms. Akers founded the Dr. Hector
P. Garcia Memorial Foundation

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.760
and is presently serving
as Board President

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.570
and Chair of the Foundation.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.830
In 2015, she delivered
a presentation titled,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.500
"Dr. Hector P. Garcia as a
Father, Physician, and Role Model,"

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.160
at the Texas State Historical
Association's Annual Meeting

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.090
in Corpus Christi.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.780
Just last week, on May 12,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.170
she received her most
recent recognition,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.810
which is very relevant I
think to today's presentation,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.670
and certainly in line
with her father's legacy.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.360
She received the American
GI Forum of South Texas

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.460
"Standing Up for Veterans" Award.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.880
So, congratulations on that.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.610
Currently, she resides
in San Antonio, Texas,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.650
with her husband Jimmy, who
is also here with us today

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.640
and is the proud mother and
grandmother to her daughter Melina

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.520
and to her two grandchildren,
Savannah and Noah.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.510
The book Ms. Garcia-Akers will
discuss is her first book,

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.220
"The Inspiring Life of
Texan Hector P. Garcia,"

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.180 position:56%
which is published by History Press.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.130
It was released on April 4, 2016,

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.980
and it's already in
its second printing.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.990
Very impressive!

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.170
After the discussion,
please stay for a Q and A

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.840
and to see Ms. Garcia-Akers donate
her father's original World War II

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.940
photographs to the Veterans History
Project, which collects, preserves,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.200
and makes accessible the personal
accounts of American War Veterans

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.720
so that future generations may
hear directly from veterans

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.730
and better understand
the realities of war.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.080
You may also purchase
a copy of the book

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.070
and get Ms. Garcia-Akers'
autograph as you leave.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.660
So, please stay around afterwards,
but in the meantime, please join me

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.570
in welcoming our guest,
Cecilia Garcia-Akers.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.370
Ms. Aker.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.460
[ Applause ]

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.140
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: Well,
thank you all for being here.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.540
I'm just overwhelmed to be
here at the Library of Congress

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.630 position:56%
and discussing my father, my beloved
father, and his accomplishments.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.330
And first of all, I want
to introduce my family

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.850
that made the trip
here to support me.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.740
My husband Jim Akers is here,
and my sister, Susie Garcia,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.540
and her partner Nell
Hahn [assumed spelling].

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.600
[ Applause ]

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.020
I want to thank the Library of
Congress for hosting me today.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.040
I just never expected such
a historical day for me

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.670
and my father's legacy
and to have written a book

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.110
about my father was
certainly not planned.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.910
After I gave my lecture
in Corpus Christi in 2015

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.870
at the Historical Commission, I
got a call from the History Press,

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.410
and they asked me,
"Have you ever thought

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.710
about writing a book
about your father?"

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.330
And I said, "Of course not."

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.870
I mean, I had not even
thought about that.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.390
So, with a lot of help
from the publisher,

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.820
which they gave me tremendous
help because they helped me

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.660
with the author proposal and how
to fill it out and send it in.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.560
Well, after I sent it in, two
days later I got a contract.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.920
So, I think they just thought
it was a good thing to do,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.220
and then they were so kind that
they only gave me six months

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.000
to write 33,000 words.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.390
So, we were struggling.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.720
We were sweating bullets the
whole time, but it was fun.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.930
And then we had, we submitted 75
photographs, and they accepted 70.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.900
So, I think it was just a
gift from above, a gift,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:38.990
and it's given me an opportunity to
give my gift to everyone who wants

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:44.440
to know about my father and his
struggles and to all the veterans

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.640
that he took care of for 50
years and how he changed the face

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.910
of this country by the laws
that he made sure were passed

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.510
in Civil Rights, in education, the
schools that he helped desegregate

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.740
in Texas, and for people not

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:07.920
to forget how important his
advocacy was for this country,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.430
for us to have a better
America today.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.570
And several people have told me
that this book is perfect timing

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.700
for what is going on
in this country,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.860
and we can never forget
our struggles,

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.080
and we have to teach our
children what the struggles are

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.300 position:56%
and how they're kind of coming back.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.050
So, I don't want my father's
life to ever be forgotten

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:38.210
because he deserves better,
and I think the book,

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.720
I wanted to write the book, not
his historical analysis of his life

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.310
because that has been done
by two previous authors,

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.350
but a daughter's perspective on his
struggles, his personal struggles,

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.440
which he had, he had many,
and the family struggles

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.610
and the financial impact
on his work,

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.060
what it did for his family,
my mother's struggle.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.820
My mother, if you think
about my mother, Wanda,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:10.130
she raised four children all on
her own, and people are really,

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.660
if you have a historical figure
like Dr. Hector P. Garcia,

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:20.910
they don't realize, people don't
realize the struggles that go along

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.520
with his advocacy, and I
think that we can all learn

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.740
from him that he never gave up.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.820
He went from one thing to another.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.260
He just never stopped.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.690
He never stopped.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.770
He was never satisfied
with his work.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.520
And so I'm hoping that the book
kind of opens people's eyes

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.090
and to understand that, you know,
he, he made this a better country.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.360
And because we are talking about
the Veterans History Project,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:01.510
I wanted to share with you a little
bit, my own research on my father,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.120
life, especially in the military

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.050
because it was certainly
interesting.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:10.450
And I knew nothing because, as
my father with his humility,

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.950 position:56%
he never talked about his struggles.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.000
He never came home and talked
about what he had done.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.920
He never talked about his struggles

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.140
when he was growing
up, but he had many.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.420
He came to this country
when he was three years old,

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.450
settled in Mercedes, Texas, to
escape the Mexican Revolution.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.550
They had ten children.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.400
His father and mother
had ten children.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:41.070 position:56%
Out of the seven surviving children,
six of them became medical doctors.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:49.140
Now, if you think about that in
the 1940s and 1950s, Dr. Hector,

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.010
Dr. J.A. and Dr. Cleo all
went to the University

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.120
of Texas Medical Branch
in Galveston.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.820
The other children went to
Medical School in Mexico.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:03.070
But there were six practicing
physicians in that one family.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.150
Now, you wonder how,
how did that happen?

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.020
Well, he had a very strict father.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.450
He went to segregated
schools, so his parents,

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.970
his father would take the
children into the basement

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.710
and teach them things like history,
English, things that they needed

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.240
to know because he wanted
his family to succeed.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.500
So, that's how they got it done.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.460
I mean, this is what we have to
teach our children, you know,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.910
you're going to have struggles,
you have to educate yourself.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:35.430
And growing up in a
segregated school system,

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.730
creating six medical
doctors, is really unheard of,

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.850
especially two of them were women.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.780
So, that was something.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:50.340
I think that when he
went to UT, Galveston,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:54.240
that was really eye-opening
because we heard not too long ago,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.450
when we were in Galveston
a few weeks ago in April,

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:02.800
that my father was the first
Mexican American graduating

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.070
from their school in
1940, the first.

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.150
So, think about, he got into 1936.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.990
They only accepted one
Mexican a year, and it was him.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.720 position:56%
Pretty remarkable life, you know, he
had to have top grades to do that.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.170
But sadly, after that big
accomplishment, no school in Texas

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.070
or hospital in Texas would accept
him for his residency, none.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.810
So, he ended up in Omaha, Nebraska,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.790
St. Joseph's Hospital,
Creighton University.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:41.540
And I remember this story, telling
me that, oh, they sent some doctors

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:46.260
down to Galveston, and we really
liked them, so we decided to go

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.040
with them all the way to
Omaha in the freezing weather,

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.530
and from South Texas this did not
go well for him, going into Omaha.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.950
But the truth was no one
would take him, no one.

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.310 position:56%
So, he went there for his two years.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:08.130
He then got called to
active military duty.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:13.890 position:56%
He had, we found out in our research
that he had lied about his age

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:18.290
to get into the Citizens'
Military Training Corps

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.370
when he was 15 years old.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.760
And I'm sure what happened with
his good looks and his, you know,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.720
tall stature that they asked him,
"Okay, how old are you, Hector?"

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.020
And he said, "Sixteen."

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.850
Okay, they wrote it down,
and "Where were you born?"

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.100
And he said, "Mercedes,"
and they wrote it down.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.320
That's exactly what's on
his separation papers,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.490
and we know none of that was true.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.320
We knew he was born in Mexico,
and he was born in 1914,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.380
so he lied about his age
by one year just to get in.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.430 position:56%
So, he was trying to escape poverty.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.840
He was, you know, trying to
prepare for the rest of his life.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:57.690
So, when he got called to active
military duty in 1940 after he,

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:11.270
1942, he was already had
been a commissioned officer.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:17.640
So, when he got called to
active military duty in 1942,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.830
he had tried to get several
promotions in the army.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:28.570
We had letters that his application
had been lost two times and,

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.330
you know, then they changed
their policy that unless he was

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.500
on active duty he couldn't
get promoted.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.100
I mean, it was just one thing after
another, one thing, one thing.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.280
So, did he give up?

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.780
No, he did not.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.080
He did not give up.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:50.320
He never gave up, and so he finally
got promoted to Captain in 1942,

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.000
after being First Lieutenant.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.130
And in 1946, he was awarded Major.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:01.200
It was after he separated from
the army, first part of 1947 is

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.590
when he was awarded Major.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.320
So, he separated from
the army in 1946,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.530
but his Major classification
didn't come

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:10.480
until after he was out of the army.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:16.430
So, I mean, I think that you look
at one man and his struggles,

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.020
and he just kept trying and
trying to beat the system and work

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.380
through it and to get
what he felt was due.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.440
And I think we can all
look at him and think, boy,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.370
what kind of person was this?

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.290
And I, I didn't know anything.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:38.550
I didn't know any of this
because he never talked about it.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.940
So, I got all his military records
and all his papers, and I had so,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:49.280
I gained so much more respect
for him because he knew,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.260
he knew there was a better life
there, and he wanted to move

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.100
up into the -- he loved
being in the army.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:00.250
And then the other thing
we found about my father,

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.610
I know everybody's going to
freak out when I tell you this,

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.710
but you know he went to
segregated schools in Mercedes.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:13.090
He went to UT Austin,
graduated top 10% of his class.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.880
Then he went to medical school
in Galveston, and then he went

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.360
to Omaha, and then he took care of
tens of thousands of soldiers all

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.180
over this world, all over the
world, for the United States

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:31.130
as a medical doctor, and he
was not even a US citizen.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.260
It's pretty amazing!

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:40.900 position:56%
He did not become a US citizen until
November 7, 1946, after he got out.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.520 position:56%
We always wondered, Jim and I always
wondered why he married my mother

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.900
in 1945 in June.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.800
My older sister was born there
in Italy, but they stayed there.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.620
They stayed there for a
year, and now we found

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.440
out he wasn't even a citizen.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.360
So, I think he waited
until last minute to do it.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.830
You know, we don't really know why,

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:04.940
but I think sometimes I think his
parents never became citizens.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:10.960
They immigrated here legally, but
they never did become a citizen.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.250
So, I don't know, if that
had some influence on him,

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.860
but he finally did it, but
everybody's kind of shocked

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:23.020
that a non-citizen would work their
way up and get educated and get

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:29.850
in the US Army, and he was so, you
know, it was so difficult for him,

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:33.280
and he was not even a
citizen of this country.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.910
And I think this says
a lot for immigrants

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.430
that are coming here
and want a better life.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.280
I think he's a role model for that.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:48.790
You know, he was just a great
physician, and I think that working

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.400
with him for ten years taught me
so many things and how he took care

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.720
of patients and how he, you
know, he never turned anyone away

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.790
because they didn't have money.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:04.900
He never said no, if you can't
pay me, you'll come back later.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.140
That never happened, and he
was just a great physician,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.320 position:56%
and he cared so much about every
single one of his patients that came

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.590 position:56%
in and all the children that came
in that he was able to take care of,

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:21.140
and that is just a part of my life

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.150 position:56%
that at the time I did not
recognize how important it was going

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.550
to be for me.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.690
Now that I'm in healthcare
and think about all the things

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.330
that he taught me that I could
never learn from a book, you know,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.460
that was just a great ten years.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:44.980
And then, as I got older, and we
would talk on the phone about cases

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.260
and medical cases and
how patients were doing,

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.310
and he would ask my opinion once
in a while, and I was like, "Oh,

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.320
my God," you know, "he's
asking my opinion,"

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.510
on things that he was working on.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.620
So, that was very important to me.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:05.260
He was very disappointed I did
not finish and become a doctor

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:11.350 position:56%
like he was, and it took a long time
for me to realize and get over that,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.320
but he was very disappointed that
I did not go to Medical School,

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.220
and I became a physical therapist.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.460
He, and I know that, but
then he finally accepted it.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.760
It took him about eight years,
but he finally accepted it

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.650 position:56%
and embraced it, and I think he just
finally understood what physical

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.270
therapists do, and it's
so important, you know,

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.690 position:56%
in rehabilitating a person's life
and getting them back on their feet.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.410
And I think all he thought
anyone could be was a doctor

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.520
or an attorney, and
that was his mindset

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.260
because he had all these
siblings that were physicians,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:53.540
and so it was a struggle for
us, you know, when I decided

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.570
to become a physical therapist.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:03.190
But I am happy that I
chose that profession

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.740
because here I am working, and one
of the things he did teach me is

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.780
to be independent, and so
that's, that's what I did.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:19.350
So, I think that we need to
look at my father's life as far

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.460
as not only his accomplishments
but his struggle,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:27.910
and that's what I wanted to do.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.620
I wanted people to finally realize,

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.060
and my understanding is not too
many books have been written

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.500
on a historical figure from
a daughter's perspective.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.140
So, I think this is a new thing.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:46.240
So, I hope that you all enjoy
the book and you like it,

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:52.320
and the book is comprehensive
in that it talks about many

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.300
of the events and his
accomplishments,

00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:00.390
the things that influenced him,
and I talk, there's a chapter there

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:05.700
on the death of my brother, and
most people didn't even know I had

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.100
a brother.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.160
So, I talk about that
and the influence

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.320
on my brother's death on him.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.090
And then there's a chapter on
my mother, her influence on him,

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:23.130
and even though she struggled a lot
because my father did not know how

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:29.360
to save money, that's for sure,
so all his money went to causes,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.800
his causes, the American GI
Form, anybody who needed money.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.260
If they couldn't come in
and pay him, you know,

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.570
he would see them for free.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:41.050
He would give, I heard from a man
the other day that said he went

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.940
in for his physical
to go to college,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.480
and my father handed him $100 to
help him to get to Del Mar College

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.310
in Corpus Christi, and this is
just the way he was, you know.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.950
He didn't care if he
didn't have any money.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.220 position:56%
He wanted everybody else to do well.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:04.750
So, I think that's a testament
to him and how he lived his life.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.470
But my husband and I go everywhere,
and we hear all kinds of stories

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.760
about my father, things
that we would never know.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.990
One thing in particular that we
didn't know, but they told us

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:19.480
that there was a young man
who got drafted to Vietnam,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:26.120
and he asked for a delay
in going to training camp,

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.080
and of course the army told him
no, you know, you have to show up.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.380
So, he left.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.250
He said, "I wanted to, I want
to be here a little bit longer

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.770
because my wife is
expecting her first baby."

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.970
And they told him no.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.750
So, his parents went to see
my father in his office,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.200
and they told him the
situation, and this man told me,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.700
"In one week I was coming
back to Corpus Christi,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.190
Texas, to stay with my family."

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.700
So, one week later the
young man was coming back

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.820
because my father had made the
effort to contact whoever needed

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.610
to be contacted to make
sure that young man was back

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:02.070
in Corpus Christi with his family.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:07.220 position:56%
So, this is, this is what he did,
and he never, he never said anything

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.110
to us, and we didn't know what he
was doing, but now I'm going all

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.930
over the places, different places,

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.430
and I hear all these remarkable
stories, unselfish acts,

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:21.690
where he took the time to help
people and not just as a physician

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:26.310 position:56%
but other areas where he would,
they would go to his office and wait

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.090
to see him, and he would
come out with something.

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:34.070
If someone told him no
the first time, you know,

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.560 position:56%
that wasn't going to stick with him.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.240
He just kept at it
and at it and at it.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:45.310
So, that's certainly a trait
of his not to ever give up

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:48.230
and to help other people,
and I think he knows that,

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.300
he knew that he was put on this
earth to help other people.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.270
He knew that.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:24:00.900
We also heard that when he married
my mother in Italy, his parents,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:08.450
her parents wanted him to stay in
Naples and practice medicine there,

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.150
and he would have done
very well there.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:16.100
He spoke Italian, and he told
my mother, my mother's family

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.020
that he could not stay
because he had a mission,

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.410
and that mission was in Texas.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.270
He had to get back.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:28.780
So, he knew back then
in 1945 that he had

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.620
to get back to Texas for a mission.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.760
And then he, shortly after that,
he founded the American GI Forum

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.770
in 1948, and then we know
shortly after the founding

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.850
of the GI Forum was the
Felix Longoria Affair

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.010
in Three Rivers, Texas.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.520
Everyone always asks me, "Do
you ever go to Three Rivers?"

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.520
and I say no because that
was kind of like his,

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:57.640
that was his first national
effort, and he got on the map

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.380
because if you have not heard
about the Three Rivers incident

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.440
and Felix Longoria,
there's a documentary

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.870 position:56%
on it called, "The Longoria Affair."

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.830
And this young soldier was
killed in World War II,

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.810
and his remains came back
to Three Rivers three years

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.040
after he was killed.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:22.540
He was a private, Private Felix
Longoria, and his poor widow went

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:29.540 position:56%
to Three Rivers and wanted to wake
Felix's body in the one funeral home

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:36.520 position:56%
that was there, and the funeral
director named Tom Kennedy told her,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.860
"No.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.810
We do not wake Mexicans
in our all-white chapel."

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.280
So, she was, of course, devastated.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.320
She was young, she was alone,
she had a young daughter,

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.780
so she was told, "Go
contact Dr. Hector Garcia."

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.080
So, she did.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.470
She went to see him, and he got on
the phone and called Tom Kennedy

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:05.060
and verified what she
had told him, "Yes.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.350
Now, we don't, we don't
let Mexicans use the chapel

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.650
because they're rowdy.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.670
They get drunk and
they get into fights."

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.980 position:56%
So, my father said, "But this young
man gave his life for this country,"

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.560
and he said that he didn't care.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.300
So, then my father had a reporter

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:28.060 position:56%
from the [inaudible] Times call the
funeral director, and he said, "No,"

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.350
you know, "they're not going to
let him wake Felix's body there."

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.730 position:56%
So, my father sent out 17 telegrams.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.480
He got one response, and
that was from Senator,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.200
newly-elected Senator
Lyndon Johnson,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.140
who told him that he would
have Felix's body brought

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:51.050
to Arlington National Cemetery
and have him buried there.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:56.760
So, that was the beginning of
my father's advocacy in 1949,

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.450
with the Felix Longoria affair,

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.590
that's how he got started
on the national stage.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.980
And Felix is buried here.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.170
He was the first Mexican
American buried

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.120
in Arlington National Cemetery.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:16.460
So, of course, Three Rivers
continues to this day to deny it,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:23.300
deny the event, my father made it
up, all this other stuff, you know.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:29.750 position:56%
We've been kind of a struggle with
some of their residents, even today,

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:34.500
but you know they even accused
my father of causing the death

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.270
of that funeral home director
14 years after the event.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:43.410 position:56%
So, I mean, they also said that my
father did the Felix Longoria Affair

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.480
because he was hoping to receive
the Presidential Medal of Freedom

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:53.550 position:56%
in 1984 when this was in 1948, which
didn't even, wasn't even created

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.970
for what my father received it for.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.880
So, I mean, we've had, we've had
some pretty big fights with some

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.370
of them, but I think we prevailed.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:05.720
We haven't heard from
them in several years.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.880 position:56%
So, yeah, it was a struggle for
him, but I think everybody can learn

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.080
from my father's life
and appreciate it

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.250
and really apply what he has
done to our own lives today.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:26.290 position:56%
I think that's very, very important,
and there's not too much written

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:30.240
about Mexican Americans
like my father,

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.420
and I think that this is a
good, this is a good start,

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.550
"The Inspiring Life of
Texan Hector P. Garcia."

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:44.610
And I'm very proud of my book,
and I hope all of you read it

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:52.080
and enjoy it, and I wanted to
read just a little bit from here

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:58.950
that I wrote about
his military life.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.990 position:56%
"Dr. Hector P. Garcia would
achieve a high rank in the military,

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.820
but he would never forget
about the soldiers who fought

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.570
with him in World War II.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:12.060 position:56%
He felt an obligation to all the
military members he would encounter,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.540
to the organization he
founded, the American GI Forum.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.880
This was clearly evident
during the Vietnam War.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.300
He was very saddened by all the
soldiers who were being returned

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.510
to Corpus Christi to their families
after being killed in this war.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:30.140
He made efforts every day
to comfort the families.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.800
He would be notified when one of
these young men would be returning

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.980
to his family in a coffin.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.140
He would make arrangements with
other American GI Forum members

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.150
to meet the returning soldiers

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.780
at the Corpus Christi
[inaudible] station or the airport,

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.170
regardless of the time of day.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:51.340 position:56%
If needed, my father would refer
the families to a local funeral home

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.620
for interment and funeral
services at a very low cost.

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.450
The funeral home was happy
to assist these families

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.400
at my father's request.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.630
My father would attend the
funerals of these young men

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:06.460
and would often speak
at their services.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.460
I asked him one morning
why was he going

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.910
so early to greet these soldiers.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.750
He had been working an 18-hour day,
well into the night and morning,

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.520
taking care of his patients.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.400
He replied, "Because I have to go.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.900
It is the least that
I can do for them."

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:28.520
There was always a sadness in his
eyes when he was getting ready

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.720
to leave to greet the soldiers
every morning for the services.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.740
He would not miss any of them.

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.640
He felt it was his obligation
to make sure the soldiers

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.950
and their families would be
taken care of at this sad time.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:47.710
Reviewing y father's military
records was a very tedious process.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:52.650 position:56%
I am elated that I was able to study
and understand this important aspect

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.830
of his life, though in his
determination to succeed,

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:02.050
helped me understand how complex
an individual he really was.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.730
He would never take
no for an answer.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.750
I saw this time and
time again in my life.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.270
We can all look at Major Hector
P. Garcia, MD, as a role model

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:16.050
for the youth and ourselves,
someone who can serve

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:22.510
to instruct our children about the
benefits of a higher education.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:26.000
We can all learn from his
determination to succeed.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.250
His life in the military is just
one example of a person who desired

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:37.630
to achieve the American Dream,
took responsibility seriously,

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.440
and never made excuses for himself
or what was occurring around him.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:47.270
I have definitely learned in my
lifetime how to persevere and try

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.160
to be an example for others.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.600
He had achieved independence
in his life but was also able

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.040
to develop lasting
relationships around him.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.830
He understood the values of trust
and love for his fellow man; yet,

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.740
he never forgot that he was called
to serve all the people around him

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.870
through his medical practice
and by assisting veterans

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:14.470
through the organization he
founded, the American GI Forum."

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.110
So, that's what I wrote about him.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:20.360
There's so much about his
military career and records,

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:24.470
and I want to thank you for today.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.920
Sometimes, it's hard for me to
stand up and talk about my father

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.230
because I loved him very much,
and I learned so much from him,

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.760
but thank you so much
for being here.

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.560
Thank you.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:43.480
[ Applause ]

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:47.640
And I have some incredible
photographs here that I want

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.970
to donate to the Veterans
History Project.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.800
They're original photographs
from World War II,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:58.460
and I hope that you
enjoy them and use them,

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.040
and thank you so much
for this opportunity.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.180
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Oh, thank
you, thank you very much.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.480
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers:
You're welcome.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.300
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: On behalf of
the Veterans History Project,

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.560
we are very proud to receive
this photographic collection

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:17.040
from Ms. Garcia-Akers and
to receive these photographs

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:19.280
from Hector P. Garcia.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:25.130
These photographs will be stored,
catalogued, and made available

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:30.390
in the Library of Congress
and saved for perpetuity.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:31.690
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: Thank you.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.690
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: So that future
generations can come and see

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.910
and learn from Mr.
Garcia's experience.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.360
I want to thank you.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.220
I also want to say that the
Veterans History Project has

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.840
over 1100 collections from
veterans who identify as Hispanic,

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.770
and of those over 1100 collections,

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:56.920
roughly 340 are digitized
and now available.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.550
When donating a collection to
the Veterans History Project,

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:06.800
as with all participating veterans
and individuals that are a part

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.060
of the collections here, we
encourage those who are Hispanic

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.150
to identify themselves as Hispanic.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:20.610 position:56%
By doing so, the historical
evidence is your personal experience

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.660
becomes evident.

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.450
It won't be lost, and it is
more accurately reflected

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:29.140
in the historical record,
and we need that.

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.700
It's very important.

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.720
So, Cecilia, again, on behalf
of the Library of Congress

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.670
and the Veterans History Project,

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:38.650
thank you for this
incredible collection.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:39.950
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers:
Thank you so much.

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:41.750
Thank you.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:46.480
[ Applause ]

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.780
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers:
I didn't know

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.340
if anyone had any questions they
want to ask me about the book

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.870 position:56%
or my father's life or anything that
I'll do my best to try to answer.

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.670
Does anyone have any questions?

00:34:55.670 --> 00:35:01.200
[ Silence ]

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.920
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that you've
gotten his military records.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.240
Did you go to other areas, other
libraries, or other institutions

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.090
to get more information
on your father?

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:16.040
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: Well,
fortunately, fortunately, in 1990,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.630
he donated, my father
donated his entire collection

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.330
to Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:27.520
So, they are in possession of,
you're not going to believe this,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.820
7000 photographs, and
over the length

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.210
of a football field in documents.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:39.080
Now, he never threw away anything,
so as you can tell, but he would,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.050
what he would do every
morning, he would go

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.860
and buy the Corpus
Christi Colored Times.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.890
He would buy like three
copies, and he would go and mark

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.730
with a felt pen each article.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.390
Like he would say, file under
John Kennedy, or Lyndon Johnson,

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:57.520
or Civil Rights, whatever that
article was he was interested in,

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.060
and they would make
scrapbooks and so on.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:06.130
And you're talking about, yeah,
I think at one time he had wanted

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:10.510 position:56%
to take care of this cataloguing it,

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:14.190
but it's so massive
that he had to donate.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.940
He didn't have the
resources, not only financial,

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.030
but you have to have certain people
to be able to handle these old --

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:27.250
I mean, these pictures that
I've donated are from the 1940s,

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.310
and my mother, fortunately,
saved everything also.

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:35.980
So, we have hundreds of photographs
at the house, when they were dating

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:40.010
and when they got married, just
beautiful photographs that,

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.310
you know, I intend to
do something with later.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:45.750
But fortunately, I was
able to go to A &amp; M

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:50.920 position:56%
and pull all his military
documents and look at them that way,

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.810
and separation papers
were very interesting,

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:58.970
and that's where I found
his US citizenship papers.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.600
And I knew that he had
fibbed about that one year,

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.120
but because the citizenship papers
were different form the Army

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.670
Separation papers, the
dates and where he was born.

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:13.400
So, thank, you know, thank God,

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.200
I had those resources
to research his life.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.180
I didn't do a whole lot.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.820
I mean, I did all his
military records

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:28.540
and also the discrimination
case, CCISD, in Corpus Christi

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.320
because that was a
big struggle for him.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.470
It took about eight
years, so there was lots

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.040
and lots of information on that.

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.600
So, that's, and that's how I
did it, and that's what he did.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.710
He just clipped articles, and he,

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:43.240
lots of times he had young children
work in his office, young teenagers

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.780
that were getting through high
school, and he would put them

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.310
to work, and he'd come
in with the newspapers,

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.480
and they would start cutting them
out and putting them in scrapbooks.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.240
There were no computers
back then either, you know.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.540
Yes?

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:00.230
&gt;&gt; There was no congratulations for
producing the manuscript and all

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:01.800
that research in six months.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.100
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: Yeah.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.400
&gt;&gt; Printing process.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.700
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: It was.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.000
It was. I don't know how we did it,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.030
but thank goodness my
husband was here to help me.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.970
&gt;&gt; And I was just wondering if you
had any advice for somebody else

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:18.040
who might want to write a book
about a family member, a memoir,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.060
if you have any advice at
all about that process?

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.510
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: Well,
I, you know, you have to,

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:27.650
it has to come from your heart, you
know, and what I did was, you know,

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:31.550
my business is I'm in the car
driving around to patient's homes

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.980
about ten hours a day, so I
had a lot of time to think.

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.400
Turn the radio off.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.680
But on Sundays, I would just start
writing, one chapter at a time,

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.850
write, write, write, you know,
whatever I could remember.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:47.080
And then, my dear husband would
type it up for me, and so a couple

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.760
of days later I would go and
correct it or add things to it.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.060 position:56%
But in the car, I would write little
notes or what I wanted to change

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.310
or ask myself a question,
what about this?

00:38:58.310 --> 00:39:02.560
You know, memories started coming
back to me as I was writing.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.870
I think the hardest part of
writing a book is the organization,

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.430
how you want to organize
the chapters.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:14.170
And of course, the History Press
had their own manuscript guidelines

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:19.950
like how many spaces and how
many words and, you know,

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:25.310
they were very strict about that,
and it had to be on a certain file,

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:28.950
and we had to, you know, send
everything in, and photographs had

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:33.360
to be a certain way, and they had
to be 6 and 1/2 inches in length,

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:39.140
and they, you know, they
wouldn't take any small ones.

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:42.710
So, a lot of them I wanted to use,
a lot of the photographs I wanted

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.490
to use, they wouldn't accept
them because they were too small.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.320
Some of them were too grainy.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.520
So, I think it's just, you know,
if you get more than six months,

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:54.190
I think you'd probably do a good
job, but they were in a hurry

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:59.500
to get this book published,
and it was published April 4th.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.610
So, I think it just has to come
from here, to answer your question,

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:07.730
and to organize your thoughts.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.030
Yes?

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.730
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if you
could tell us a little bit

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:16.950
about his relationship
with LBJ, and did he know

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:21.380
about [inaudible] veterans because
I believe they were both involved

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:26.100
in the Civil Rights Movement?

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.740
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: Lyndon
Johnson, you know, they started,

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.610
of course, my father was a lifelong
Democrat, you know, he just,

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.910
that's just the way he was,

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:40.410
and he supported every Democratic
candidate that ran for President.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:42.920
Lyndon was, of course, from Texas,

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.950
and they became close during
the Felix Longoria Affair

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.690
because he was the only
one that would respond

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:50.200
to my father's telegram
about getting some help.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.140
And he told my father that he
has, he cannot control what goes

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:58.090
on in a private funeral
home but that he was going

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:02.670
to have Felix buried in Arlington,
if his widow would accept it.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:06.280
So, that's how they
developed a relationship.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:12.160 position:56%
He became close to him, of course,
after John Kennedy was assassinated.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.530
He was going to the
White House all the time.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:21.170
He was, as we say today, in
Lyndon Johnson's face, you know,

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:28.450
about certain things, like Civil
Rights, and they became very close,

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.290
and my father was not
shy about telling him,

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:31.950
"You're doing a terrible job."

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:36.220
I mean, they had terrible fights,
but they respected each other,

00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.280
and Johnson finally came around.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.880
You've seen that famous speech that
he gave on the Congressional floor

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.650
about his first job was a
school teacher in Kutula, Texas.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:51.730
You've seen that, haven't you?

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:57.880
And then he says that, he says that
he saw the sadness and the hunger

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.640
in his students' eyes every
day as they showed up.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.980
And he would spend his own money to
help give these children breakfast

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.850
and take care of them, and
he said, "I never thought

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:13.230
that I would one day have the
chance to help those children

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.880
as President of the United States."

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.640
They were from Kutula, Texas.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.370
And I think my father had
a big influence on him,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:25.420
and they had high respect for each
other, but my father never shied

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:28.660
from telling him off,
you know, he never did.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.960
He never did.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.520
And Martin Luther King, a lot
of people ask me about that,

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.650
and I just think that they
never really crossed paths,

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:40.570
and a month before Dr. King was
assassinated there was a telegram

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.970
that he sent my father telling
him, "I know that you're, you know,

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:47.230 position:56%
involved in Civil Rights," and he
wanted to set up a meeting with him.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:50.400
It was a month before the
assassination, so they never did,

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.000
they never did have that meeting.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.240
I think my father followed
his career

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:57.670
and followed what he was doing,
but you know my father was

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:02.150
in a different direction as far as
the veterans and Mexican Americans

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.700
and Hispanic Civil Rights.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.510
So, I don't think they
really crossed paths.

&gt;&gt; I have one.

most like your father?

My sister's laughing.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.060
&gt;&gt; I can tell you that.

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.030
&gt;&gt; I'm going to let, I'm going

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:31.070
to let my husband answer
that question, right.

I'm going to let him answer for me.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.860
&gt;&gt; Jim Akers: Cecilia always,
she'll get so mad at me

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:42.170
for using this analogy, but most
everyone has heard the saying,

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.030
"The apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree."

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:49.610
Well, Dr. Hector was the
tree, and here's the apple.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.030
You know, her memory
is like Dr. Hector's.

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.330
He never forgot anything.

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.850
I mean, he just, you know, he
always remembered people's names,

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:58.360
all this stuff, and
she's the same way.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.310 position:56%
I have to be very careful about what
I tell her for the last 40 years

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:05.030
because she remembers everything.

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:10.840
But you know, I think he had a
very big influence on her life,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:14.150
and their work ethics
are a lot alike.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:17.080
They don't know when
to stop and, you know,

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.850
she doesn't know what rest is.

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:21.490
It's, you know, seven
days a week and, you know,

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:24.130
I'm going till I can't go
any further, and then figure

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:26.410
out some way to keep going.

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:28.180
But she's a product of her father.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:34.020
There's no doubt about that, and
it's a mostly good product, so.

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.320

He said mostly.

good than, a lot more good than bad,

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.600
but you know, it's a great, it's
great for her to be honored,

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.530
to be able to do this and write
this story about her father.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:53.240
And you know, he was such an
influence on her life and a lot

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.530
of other people's, but
she's really taken this

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:01.950
and done a great job of
promoting his legacy.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:06.100
And this all got started by
a promise we made her mother

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.680
that we would not let his legacy go
untold, so we tried to keep it up.

In the book,

I do describe how we got started.

our life privately and, you know,

my mother is at San Antonio

serious health problems,

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.180 position:56%
and I felt that I could help her
better there than in Corpus Christi,

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.590
which, you know, it
was not an easy time

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:37.220
to move her three different times.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:41.630
So, she was very difficult
to take care of,

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:45.670
so we did our best, you know.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:49.460
But she ended up having
six surgeries in two years,

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:53.350
so you know it kept us busy.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:46:00.030
But one day she calls me up,
and she's crying on the phone,

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:02.880
and I go, "Momma, what's wrong?"

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.840
And she said that she had received
the American GI Forum Newsletter

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.140
called, "The Forum."

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.770
They were sending out a
quarterly newsletter at the time,

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.460
and it was in March, the
founder's month, and she says,

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.350
"There's not one picture of papa."

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:17.650
She called him papa.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:19.750
"There's not one picture
of papa in this book."

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.320
I said, "Well, let
me come over there."

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:24.300
So, we went over there,
and she just lived

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.810
about seven minutes from my house.

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.940
She had a beautiful apartment
that we set her up in

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.440
and was well taken care of
till the end of her life.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.590
But we went over there, and to
see your 84-year-old mother crying

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:43.700
like that, and she wouldn't stop.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:49.030
And that, I think that really
impacted me because she was saying,

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:50.650
"No one knows who papa is.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.200
No one knows what he
did for this country.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.500
No one knows about him,

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.010
and the American GI Forum
was not promoting him."

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:01.000
So, that day, we made
a promise to her

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.240
that we would do whatever we
needed to to have my father

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.190
at the historical level
that he needed to be.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.700
And so that's how we got started,
that one phone call from her.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:20.940 position:56%
And to our credit, really, it really
needed to be done by the family

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:24.660
because we knew it needed
to be done correctly.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:30.590
But you know, he really needs to
be at a different level than he is

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:35.450
and recognized because of
everything that he did.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:41.630
And there's a bio in the back about
all his accomplishments to date,

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.820
and so one thing we didn't put
in there, but it should be,

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.290
by the end of the year, he's
going to be on the Points

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:51.720
of Light Monument, probably
by the end of this year.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.430
So, that's something else that
we're going to be working on,

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.840
Points of Light Monument.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.000
But that's how we got started,
and it's a promise to momma,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.590
and I think we've done
a pretty good job.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:06.890
Yes?

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.350
&gt;&gt; Are there any other questions?

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:10.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:11.900
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: Yes.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:20.960
&gt;&gt; We had a meeting on at a
very interesting moment now

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.320
with policies, alias.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.620
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: Yes.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:33.240
&gt;&gt; What would be your father's
point of view or [inaudible]

like you said, he [inaudible].

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:39.260
So, what would be your father's
if you see him now if you brought

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.690
up any of these candidates?

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:46.170
What would be their [inaudible]
to like he was [inaudible]?

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.090
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: I
think, you know, if you ask,

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:51.000
if you ever have a chance
to look at the documentary,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.250
"Justice for my People,"
they did a really good job

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.790
about my father's life,
and they had some clips

00:48:55.790 --> 00:49:01.280
of him attacking the Superintendent
of Corpus Christi's School District

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.020
and saying that he had to go.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:07.170 position:56%
I mean, he was not shy about what he
thought, but I think as far as this,

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:10.700
all this, this fear
about immigration

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.370
and the immigrants are taking jobs
away, and I think, I think he,

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:16.800
I mean, he is an immigrant,
and so was my mother.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.910
And I always point that out,
they were both immigrants

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.750
to this country, and look
how they lived their lives.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:26.530
I mean, it's like the fear that
people are getting away with,

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.740
putting it to the residents,

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.720
the citizens of this
country, is just so unfounded.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.370
He would, I can assure
you he would be

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:39.640
on national news every single day
attacking whoever he needed to

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.560
and clearing up what was
right and what was wrong.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.100
He would be doing that
every single day.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.640
He wouldn't, he would be, he
had great, from back then,

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.850
he had great media coverage, and
that's what he would be doing.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:56.780
He would be meeting
individually with Donald Trump,

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.390
he would, and Hilary Clinton.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:00.410
He would be there, and I'm sure

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:02.220
by now he would have
had multiple meetings

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:04.040
with President Obama, I'm sure.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.660
I am sure of that.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:12.020
So, I think that he knew the
right path for this country,

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.300
and I think he would be
right now very disappointed

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.600
in the way it's going.

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:19.370
Yes?

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:22.620
&gt;&gt; I'd like to talk
about the GI Forum.

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:27.230
I appreciate it has more to do
with veterans groups like GI Forum.

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.650
Younger veterans today
tend to stay away

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:34.460
from traditional organizations
[inaudible] American Legion.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:37.970
Do you see a role for those
[inaudible] organizations today,

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:41.800
or do you think they sort of
outlived their usefulness in terms

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.460
of advancing the veterans'
interests?

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.830
Not only Mexican Americans,
but overall?

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:49.120
&gt;&gt; Cecilia Garcia-Akers: I
think you made a good point.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.870
I don't think that they've
outlived their usefulness.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:56.450
I think they're direction
is not like the same as,

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:58.470
especially the American GI Forum,

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:03.970
they don't really recruit new
members from more recent wars.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.600
They kind of stick
with the old guard.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:13.060 position:56%
I don't see a whole lot of new
members signing up, which is a shame

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:14.730
because they have different needs.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:18.270
You know, I have had many, many
patients coming back from the war.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:22.470
They're just, I mean, they're
injuries are just so profound that,

00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:26.360
you know, I'd never seen them
before on older patients,

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:29.290
and I think they're
not addressing that.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:32.620
I don't think they're addressing
their educational needs.

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:37.180
I think since my father died,
American GI Forum, they've just,

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:40.890
they have not really
developed any strong leadership

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:44.250
on a national level,
and they're broke.

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:45.780
They don't have any money.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:51.090
And you need money to really
promote an organization to do well.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:55.910
But I, you know, I just
think that [sigh] it's more

00:51:55.910 --> 00:52:00.140
like a social organization, you
know, where they have hamburgers,

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.780
sell them, or whatever,
that kind of thing.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.620
But you don't really see
them advocating for veterans

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.580
on a national level, and
I think that's a shame.

00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:11.410
And I think, I think,
no, they're not done,

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:17.260
but I think their problem lies
in not having strong leadership,

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:21.150
educated leaders, to
take up the cause,

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:22.950
and I think that's
been their problem.

opinion, but I've seen it, so.
