00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.060
Strawberries have a lot of DNA, because they're

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.120
an example of a really cool phenomenon called polyploidy.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.820
Ploidy is how many copies of every chromosome you

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.610
have. So, polyploidy is when you end up with

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.980
a lot more copies than normal. For example, humans

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.000
have two copies of every chromosome. They get one

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.850
from mom and one from dad. So we're considered

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.830
to be diploid. Di, meaning two. But strawberries have

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.610
eight copies of every chromosome, which makes

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.070
them octoploid. Octo, meaning eight. They get

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.520
four copies of every chromosome from each parent. So, if we wanted to use

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.680
a sample for our extraction that has a lot of DNA, which of the following would

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.170
we want to use? An organism that's triploid, tetraploid, hexaploid or octoploid?
