foreground service let us say you're

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069
foreground service let us say you're
 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.399
foreground service let us say you're
using a navigation app and you have

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409
using a navigation app and you have
 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.189
using a navigation app and you have
requested turn-by-turn directions from

benefits of targeting q SDK is that if

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020
benefits of targeting q SDK is that if
 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.280
benefits of targeting q SDK is that if
your app needs location permission only

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290
your app needs location permission only
 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.379
your app needs location permission only
when the app is in the foreground you

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389
when the app is in the foreground you
 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:12.560
when the app is in the foreground you
can choose to request only this location

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570
can choose to request only this location
 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.840
can choose to request only this location
permission from the user and get

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850
permission from the user and get
 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.779
permission from the user and get
location when the app is in use in other

recommend developers to utilize this

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080
recommend developers to utilize this
 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.850
recommend developers to utilize this
capability and always ask only for the

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860
capability and always ask only for the
 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.900
capability and always ask only for the
permission needed for the app another

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:38.910
permission needed for the app another
 

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.850

key benefit of targeting q SDK is that

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:42.860
key benefit of targeting q SDK is that
 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.860
key benefit of targeting q SDK is that
your app can now make incremental

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:45.870
your app can now make incremental
 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.379
your app can now make incremental
location permission requests and

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:48.389
location permission requests and
 

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.060
location permission requests and
incremental permission requests are

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070
incremental permission requests are
 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.570
incremental permission requests are
incredibly helpful in presenting the

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580
incredibly helpful in presenting the
 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.460
incredibly helpful in presenting the
location permission dialog whenever the

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:55.470
location permission dialog whenever the
 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.879
location permission dialog whenever the
user accesses the feature gain as the

user accesses the feature gain as the
 

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:01.850
user accesses the feature gain as the
best practice we recommend developers to

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860
best practice we recommend developers to
 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.159
best practice we recommend developers to
show the permission dialog when the user

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:04.169
show the permission dialog when the user
 

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:06.890
show the permission dialog when the user
accesses the relevant feature so that

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900
accesses the relevant feature so that
 

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.219
accesses the relevant feature so that
the user can understand why an app is

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:10.229
the user can understand why an app is
 

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:13.040
the user can understand why an app is
asking for a certain permission or even

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.050
asking for a certain permission or even
 

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.800
asking for a certain permission or even
for a certain level of permission let us

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:15.810
for a certain level of permission let us
 

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.830
for a certain level of permission let us
say your app needs to access location in

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840
say your app needs to access location in
 

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.870
say your app needs to access location in
the foreground or in the band or in the

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:20.880
the foreground or in the band or in the
 

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.689
the foreground or in the band or in the
background users are much more likely to

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699
background users are much more likely to
 

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:26.210
background users are much more likely to
grant the level of access needed for

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220
grant the level of access needed for
 

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.550
grant the level of access needed for
your app when users are requested to

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560
your app when users are requested to
 

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.469
your app when users are requested to
evaluate these permissions requests

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479
evaluate these permissions requests
 

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:33.140
evaluate these permissions requests
separately and at the time they are

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.150
separately and at the time they are
 

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.750
separately and at the time they are
accessing the relevant feature let's

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760
accessing the relevant feature let's
 

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.120
accessing the relevant feature let's
take this example of my train commute
