00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.830
You’re on the trail of a werewolf

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.810
that’s been terrorizing your town.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.780
After months of detective work,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.640
you’ve narrowed your suspects to 
one of five people:

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.500
the mayor,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.390
the tailor,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.200
the baker,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.295
the grocer,

00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:22.645
or the carpenter.

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:25.350
You’ve invited them to dinner 
with a simple plan:

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.410
you’ll slip a square of 
a rare werewolf antidote

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.110
into each of their dinners.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.850
Unfortunately, your pet goat
just ate four of the squares,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.210
and you only have one left.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.110
Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.340
and the minimum effective dose 
is 10 grams.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.593
If you can precisely divide the 
square into fifths

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:48.763
you’ll have just enough 
antidote for everyone.

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:52.253
You’ll have to use a laser-cutting tool
to cut up the square;

00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:55.613
every other means available to you
isn’t precise enough.

00:00:55.613 --> 00:01:00.973
There are 8 points that can act 
as starting or ending points for each cut.

00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:04.193
To use the device, you’ll
have to input pairs of points

00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:07.503
that tell the laser where to begin 
and end each cut,

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:11.273
and then the laser executes
all the cuts simultaneously.

00:01:11.273 --> 00:01:14.883
It’s okay to cut the square 
into as many pieces as you want,

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:18.693
as long as you can group them
into 10 gram portions.

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:21.853
But you can’t fold the square 
or alter it otherwise,

00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:25.273
and you only get one shot 
at using the laser cutter.

00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:26.763
The full moon is rising, 

00:01:26.763 --> 00:01:30.563
and in a moment someone
will transform and tear you all apart

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:32.903
unless you can cure them first.

00:01:32.903 --> 00:01:35.953
How can you divide the antidote 
into perfect fifths,

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:39.483
cure the secret werewolf, 
and save everyone?

00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:43.673
Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:44.843
Answer in 3

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:45.963
Answer in 2

00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:47.913
Answer in 1

00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:51.083
When it comes to puzzles that
involve cutting and rearranging,

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:54.043
it’s often helpful to actually 
take a piece of paper

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.883
and try cutting it up to see what
you can get.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:02.033
If we cut BF and DH we’d get fourths,
but we need fifths.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:06.843
Maybe there’s a way to shave a bit off
of a quarter to get exactly one fifth.

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:10.243
Cutting BE looks good at first, 
but that last cut

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:12.193
takes a off a quarter of a quarter,

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:17.143
leaving us with a portion of 3/16: 
just smaller than a fifth,

00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:19.673
and not enough to cure a werewolf.

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:22.603
What if we started with BE instead?

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:24.433
That would also give us a quarter.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.433
And is there a way to shave
just a bit more off?

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.703
Both DG and CH look promising.

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:33.753
If we make one more cut, from A to F,

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.293
we may start to notice something.

00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:40.453
With these four cuts—from B to E, 
D to G, F to A,

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:43.563
and H to C—we’ve got four triangles

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.103
and a square in the middle.

00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:48.203
But the pieces that make 
each triangle can also be

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:51.383
rearranged to make a square
identical to the middle one.

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:55.803
This means that we’ve split
the antidote into perfect fifths!

00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:58.003
What’s interesting about this 
sort of problem

00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:01.583
is that while it’s possible to solve 
it by starting from the geometry,

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:06.033
it’s actually easier to start 
experimenting and see where that gets you.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:10.333
That wouldn’t be as viable if the square 
had, say, 24 cut points,

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:14.823
but with just 8 there
are only so many reasonable options.

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:17.423
You secretly dose each of the townspeople

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:19.823
as the full moon emerges in the sky.

00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:23.223
And just as you do, 
a terrible transformation begins.

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:26.613
Then, just as suddenly, it reverses.

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:28.263
Your measurements were perfect, 

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:31.903
and the people and animals of the 
town can rest a little easier.
