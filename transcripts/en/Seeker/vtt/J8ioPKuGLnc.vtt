00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.790
When whales launch themselves out of the water,
what are they thinking about?

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.370
What are they DOING out there?

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.820
whale watchers
In September 2015, a humpback whale breached

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
in Northern California and nearly squashed
two casual kayakers into jellyfish.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.449
They survived without a scratch, and Professor
Joy Reidenberg from Mount Sinai University

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.449
told The Guardian she believes the way the
whale breached and turned showed it saw them,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.120
was surprised, and tried to protect them!

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.739
She said quote, "I think you..

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.260
survived because the whale cared about trying
not to hit you."

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.039
Whales are beautiful, majestic, and completely
and utterly massive; both in scientific and

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.580
hyperbolic meaning.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.489
Humpback whales can weigh more than 40 tons
(35 metric tons) and be up to 52 feet long!

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.070
For perspective, a fully grown humpback is
the weight of TWO city buses and extends twelve

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.289
feet longer!

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.450
But why would something so huge throw itself
out of the water like that?

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.130
Whales, like some other marine animals, breach,
the most famous are Spock's favorite, the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.130
Humpback whale.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.230
By observing whales, marine researchers found
they usually shoot out of the water, twisting

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.190
in mid-air and splashing down on their back
or side in spectacular fashion.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.020
Scientists have a number of different hypotheses
as to WHY whales breach, because to be honest,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.020
we don't know.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.190
It's not like we can ask them, yet.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.270
For example, when they come down on their
skulls, they could attack, or ward off other

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.970
whales… they could even do it to impress
and compete for mates.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.261
Another hypothesis, is they're jumping to
create the smacking sound on the water, to

00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:39.920
attract the attention of or warn off other
whales.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.570
This is supported by humpback's unexplained
lobtailing behavior -- which is when they

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.310
slap the surface with their tail, creating
a very loud smacking noise.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.780
They do the same with their fins, perhaps
to warn the rest of their pod.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.040
Yet another hypothesis, is when they hear
a ship approaching they pop up to take a look

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.110
around, simultaneously warning the ship of
a pod in their presence.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.520
And still ANOTHER hypothesis is the breaching
helps move food through their digestive system

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.090
when they're mass feeding!

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.810
Researchers following pods of whales often
look for DNA evidence of the identities of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.890
the whales they're tracking, and they discovered
debris and DNA in the water after a breach;

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.390
this got them thinking…

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.390
Perhaps breaching is part of a self-cleaning
behavior!

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.860
Barnacles attach and grow on surfaces in the
ocean.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.380
They're famously attached to boats, piers,
rocks and of course, sometimes humpback whales.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.110
One humpback whale, can host as many as 1,000
pounds of barnacles; and though scientists

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.220
don't think they harm the whale they may get
annoying, itchy, or could cause drag in the

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.220
water.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.850
So, another hypothesis says, whales breach
to clean barnacles off!

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.510
It's not like they have thumbs to grab a scraper,
so by breaching and slapping their 80,000

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.220
pounds back onto the surface, they strip away
some of their barnacle buddies and exfoliate

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.550
dead skin; which is where the DNA and debris
come from!

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.480
Though they're slower, it's fairly easy for
the humpbacks to breach, with only a few strokes

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.420
of their powerful tails, they can accelerate
to 26 feet per second (8 m/s) throwing nearly

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.760
their entire body out of the water.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.069
According to marine biologists, slower whales
tend to breach MORE, not the faster ones,

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.780
and yet another hypothesis purported by whale
watchers is that humpbacks are breaching for

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.150
the fun of it; though scientists think it's
more about display, communication, or dominance

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.630
than enjoyment.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.330
Whatever reason these intelligent mammals
have for hurling themselves skyward, it's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.510
beautiful, and part of the spectacle of nature.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.240
But next time, hopefully, there won't be a
kayak too close.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.630
Have you ever seen a breaching whale?

whalesabreachin.com or babygothumpback.com

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:13.790
or perhaps whalewhalewhathavewehere.com, humpback.lol,
or whales.cool… because they are.
