00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.450
Welcome to the
presentation on units.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.570
Let's get started.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.180
So if I were to tell you -- let
me make sure my pen is set up

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.700
right -- if I were to tell you
that someone is, let's say

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.893
they're driving at a speed
of -- let's say it's Zack.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.170
So let's say I have Zack.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.100
And they're driving at a
speed of, let me say,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:38.680
28 feet per minute.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.430
So what I'm going to ask you is
if he's going 28 feet in every

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:55.890
minute, how many inches will
Zack travel in 1 second?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.460
So how many inches per second
is he going to be going?

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.570
Let's try to figure
this one out.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.700
So let's say if I had 28, and
I'll write ft short for feet,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.210
feet per minute, and I'll
write min short for a minute.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.330
So 28 feet per minute, let's
first figure out how many

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.770
inches per minute that is.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:28.010
Well, we know that there are
12 inches per foot, right?

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.790
If you didn't know
that you do now.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.590
So we know that there
are 12 inches per foot.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.800
So if you're going 28 feet per
minute, he's going to be going

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.800
12 times that many
inches per minute.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:47.120
So, 12 times 28 -- let me do
the little work down here -- 28

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.920
times 12 is 16, 56 into 280.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.930
I probably shouldn't be
doing it this messy.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.620
And this kind of stuff it would
be OK to use a calculator,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.260
although it's always good to
do the math yourself,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.510
it's good practice.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.870
So that's 6, 5 plus 8 is 13.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.350
336.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:21.280
So that equals 336
inches per minute.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.420
And something interesting
happened here is that you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.080
noticed that I had a foot in
the numerator here, and I had a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.730
foot in the denominator here.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.890
So you can actually treat
units just the same way

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.730
that you would treat actual
numbers or variables.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.550
You have the same number in the
numerator and you have the same

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.080
number in the denominator, and
your multiplying not adding,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.150
you can cancel them out.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.010
So the feet and the feet
canceled out and that's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.020
why we were left with
inches per minute.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:53.730
I could have also written
this as 336 foot per minute

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.380
times inches per foot.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.180
Because the foot per minute
came from here, and the inches

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.280
per foot came from here.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.580
Then I'll just cancel this
out and I would have

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.000
gotten inches per minute.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.620
So anyway, I don't want
to confuse you too much

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.710
with all of that unit
cancellation stuff.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.650
The bottom line is you just
remember, well if I'm going 28

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.930
feet per minute, I'm going to
go 12 times that many inches

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.580
per minute, right, because
there are 12 inches per foot.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.380
So I'm going 336
inches per minute.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.940
So now I have the question, but
we're not done, because the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.230
question is how many inches am
I going to be traveling

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.030
in 1 second.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.320
So let me erase some of the
stuff here at the bottom.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:09.820
So 336 inches -- let's write it
like that -- inches per minute,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.390
and I want to know how
many inches per second.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.010
Well what do we know?

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.730
We know that 1 minute -- and
notice, I write it in the

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:23.790
numerator here because I want
to cancel it out with

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.970
this minute here.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.760
1 minute is equal to
how many seconds?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.370
It equals 60 seconds.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.640
And this part can be confusing,
but it's always good to just

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.360
take a step back and think
about what I'm doing.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.370
If I'm going to be going 336
inches per minute, how many

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.380
inches am I going to
travel in 1 second?

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.235
Am I going to travel more
than 336 or am I going

00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:53.640
to travel less than
336 inches per second.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.650
Well obviously less,
because a second is a much

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.400
shorter period of time.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.475
So if I'm in a much shorter
period of time, I'm going

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:02.140
to be traveling a much
shorter distance, if I'm

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.360
going the same speed.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.910
So I should be dividing by a
number, which makes sense.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.090
I'm going to be dividing by 60.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.020
I know this can be very
confusing at the beginning, but

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.840
that's why I always want you to
think about should I be getting

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.370
a larger number or should I be
getting a smaller number and

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.800
that will always give you
a good reality check.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.830
And if you just want to look at
how it turns out in terms of

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.390
units, we know from the problem
that we want this minutes to

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.630
cancel out with something
and get into seconds.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.890
So if we have minutes in the
denominator in the units here,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.910
we want the minutes in the
numerator here, and the seconds

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.250
in the denominator here.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.950
And 1 minute is equal
to 60 seconds.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.540
So here, once again,
the minutes and the

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.090
minutes cancel out.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:51.275
And we get 336 over 60
inches per second.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.440
Now if I were to actually
divide this out, actually we

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.910
could just divide the numerator
and the denominator by 6.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.850
6 goes into 336,
what, 56 times?

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:14.330
56 over 10, and then we can
divide that again by 2.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.290
So then that gets us 28 over 5.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:30.150
And 28 over 5 -- let's see, 5
goes into 28 five times, 25.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.680
3, 5.6.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.775
So this equals 5.6.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.530
So I think we now just
solved the problem.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.580
If Zack is going 28 feet in
every minute, that's his

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:56.240
speed, he's actually going
5.6 inches per second.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.850
Hopefully that kind
of made sense.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.400
Let's try to see if we
could do another one.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:16.750
If I'm going 91 feet per
second, how many miles

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.730
per hour is that?

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.210
Well, 91 feet per second.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.080
If we want to say how many
miles that is, should we be

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.480
dividing or should
we be multiplying?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.640
We should be dividing
because it's going to be a

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.560
smaller number of miles.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:44.820
We know that 1 mile is equal to
-- and you might want to just

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.950
memorize this -- 5,280 feet.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.430
It's actually a pretty
useful number to know.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.520
And then that will actually
cancel out the feet.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.150
Then we want to go from
seconds to hours, right?

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.760
So, if we go from seconds to
hours, if I can travel 91 feet

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.190
per second, how many will I
travel in an hour, I'm going to

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.950
be getting a larger number
because an hour's a much larger

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:09.530
period of time than a second.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.500
And how many seconds
are there in an hour?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.080
Well, there are 3,600
seconds in an hour.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.870
60 seconds per minute and
60 minutes per hour.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:26.090
So 3,600 over 1
seconds per hour.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.880
And these seconds
will cancel out.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.960
Then we're just left with, we
just multiply everything out.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:42.030
We get in the numerator,
91 times 3,600, right?

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.950
91 times 1 times 3,600.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:50.880
In the denominator
we just have 5,280.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.750
This time around I'm actually
going to use a calculator --

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.860
let me bring up the calculator
just to show you that I'm

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.960
using the calculator.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:13.180
Let's see, so if I say 91 times
3,600, that equals a huge

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:31.160
number divided by 5,280.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.730
Let me see if I can type it.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:44.520
91 times 3,600 divided
by 5,280 -- 62.05.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:52.380
So that equals 62.05
miles per hour.
