there's a principle in physics called

the Pauli exclusion principle it states
 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.770
the Pauli exclusion principle it states
that no more than two electrons with

that no more than two electrons with
 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.540

opposite spins can occupy the same
 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.490
opposite spins can occupy the same
energy state so what happens is when you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.040

squeeze matter tighter and tighter to

higher and higher density there are
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.699
higher and higher density there are
fewer and fewer energy states available

the lowest-lying energy states are
 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.479
the lowest-lying energy states are
filled first so an electron is forced to

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489
filled first so an electron is forced to
 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.850
filled first so an electron is forced to
move very very fast and it can't it

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860
move very very fast and it can't it

density goes up the faster they move
 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.300
density goes up the faster they move
faster and faster and that exerts
