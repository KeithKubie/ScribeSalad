00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:10.546
&gt;&gt; You can underline what's
covering the polar bear.

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:11.706
Mm-hmm, you're right.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:15.396
&gt;&gt; At Forest Lake Elementary
School, technology is

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:17.046
at the core of the
learning process.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:17.826
&gt;&gt; Do you wanna use the pointer

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:19.866
and make it go up
a little bit more?

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.876
&gt;&gt; I'm creating a battle on
the game code Medieval Two,

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:27.176
and we have to research what
kind of people they had there,

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:30.356
and like the terrain
of the land and stuff.

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:33.936
&gt;&gt; In history class,
Ian uses game software

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:37.866
to recreate Revolutionary War
battles and a Blackboard account

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.636
to make daily journal entries.

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:42.466
Technology also provides
a window

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.086
on the classroom for parents.

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:47.456
By accessing her son's
Blackboard account at home,

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:50.786
Ian's mom can see what he's
doing in class every day.

00:00:51.586 --> 00:00:54.006
She can also check on
upcoming assignments,

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:56.066
and his teachers'
recommendations

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.296
for extra credit work.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.746
&gt;&gt; Right now I'm on my son
Ian's Blackboard account.

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:01.926
He's my fourth grader.

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:04.106
He likes me to read what
he's written sometimes,

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:05.506
and this is just an example.

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:07.216
It's a little, I guess, blog.

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.516
And he's just talking about
all the different things

00:01:09.516 --> 00:01:12.316
that they did today with
their particular group.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:14.176
"We are at peace with the
French and the Swedish,

00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:16.836
and the Dutch want to be allies
with us, but we haven't decided

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:18.366
if we want to be
allies with them yet."

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.656
So that's actually other
groups in their class,

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:22.996
and he's just kind
of writing down,

00:01:23.356 --> 00:01:26.316
"One of our most important
seas is off the Gulf of Mexico.

00:01:26.316 --> 00:01:28.016
We need to transport
goods from Florida."

00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:30.776
It's amazing, you can see
the facts that are woven in,

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:32.206
just from him writing
this journal.

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:35.326
So I love to get on and
read that kind of thing.

00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:37.676
And then also, here's
an example.

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:40.396
Study Island is a really fun
place that they can study

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:42.506
for their different
reading and grammar skills.

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.186
You'll see here, it says,
"Online Learning, Extra Practice

00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:48.106
and Early Finishers," so this
is a place where their teacher,

00:01:48.106 --> 00:01:50.746
Mr. Durden, has placed
several links.

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:52.346
Also, if he forgets
an assignment,

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:54.656
he can go on Blackboard
and find out what it is,

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:57.536
instead of having to bother
the teacher or call a friend.

00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:59.306
He can just go right
online and find it out.

00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:02.046
&gt;&gt; Blackboard accounts
cost just two dollars

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:04.166
and fifty cents per
student for the year.

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:08.066
They're paid for by the school
district, which also contracted

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:11.496
with a local web team to
design a special portal just

00:02:11.496 --> 00:02:12.236
for parents.

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:13.626
&gt;&gt; It's pretty easy.

00:02:13.626 --> 00:02:14.916
You can sign into the account

00:02:14.916 --> 00:02:16.436
and you can keep up
with their grades.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.136
And it's a nice way
to keep track

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:20.196
of how your children are
doing, and not let it get away

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:21.216
from you, where you don't find

00:02:21.216 --> 00:02:24.406
out till a week before the
nine weeks ends, "Oh no,

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:27.166
they're making a C
or a D or whatever."

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:31.126
So, and they actually email me
any time a new grade comes up,

00:02:31.246 --> 00:02:32.926
so I can go on there.

00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:37.556
I probably go on there, maybe
three or four times a week.

00:02:37.556 --> 00:02:41.336
Maybe more than I should, but
it makes it very easy to be able

00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:42.616
to see how your children
are doing.

00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:46.796
