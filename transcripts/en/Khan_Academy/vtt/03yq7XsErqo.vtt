00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.360
Evaluate 3x squared
minus 8x plus 7

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.420
when x is equal to negative 2.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.830
So to evaluate this expression
when x is equal to negative 2,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.700
everywhere that we
see an x, we just

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.800
have to substitute
it with a negative 2.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.950
So it would be 3 times,
instead of x squared,

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.010
it would be 3 times negative
2 squared minus 8 times--

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.300
instead of 8 times x, 8
times negative 2 plus 7.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.850
And so what does this give us?

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.150
So we have 3 times
negative 2 squared.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.855
Well, that's just positive 4.

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:36.520
A negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:44.170
Minus 8 times negative
2 is negative 16 plus 7.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.760
So 3 times 4 is 12.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.940
From that, you're
subtracting negative 16.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.880
Subtracting negative
16 is the same thing

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.650
as adding positive 16.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.700
So it's 12 plus 16 plus 7.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.940
And so this is equal
to 12 plus 16 is 28.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.620
And then if you add
7 to 28, you get 35.
