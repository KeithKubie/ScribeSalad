00:00:00.894 --> 00:00:03.471
- [Voiceover] Two spheres,
one with radius seven,

00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:06.629
and one with radius seven,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:13.362
and one with radius four
are tangent to each other.

00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:15.684
If P is any point on one sphere

00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:17.704
and Q is any point on the other sphere,

00:00:17.704 --> 00:00:20.409
what is the maximum possible length of PQ?

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:21.941
So, let's think about this.

00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:24.809
So, let me draw the
sphere with radius seven.

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:25.668
And obviously the sphere is

00:00:25.668 --> 00:00:26.806
a three dimensional object.

00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:27.827
And I'm going to try and draw it

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.209
in two dimensions.

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:31.066
So, a circle you can kind of use

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.469
a cross section of it.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.861
So, this right over here,

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:38.960
cross section at its
widest point of the sphere.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.061
So, it has radius seven.

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:42.849
So, it has radius seven

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:46.100
and it is tangent to another sphere

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.166
that has radius four.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.568
So, it has radius, it has radius four.

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:52.595
So, the other one might look something

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:53.609
like this, once again.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.306
It's a cross section.

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:57.302
It's tangent at exactly this point.

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:58.568
And I've just drawn circles,

00:00:58.568 --> 00:01:01.528
but then you can imagine
these are actually spheres.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.221
I'll try to give it some actual depth,

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:06.218
so that you recognize
that these are not just,

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:09.898
you can imagine balloons
or balls of this shape.

00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:13.079
Now, P is any point on one sphere

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.006
and Q is any point on the other sphere.

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:17.386
And we want the maximum length of PQ.

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:18.779
So, we want to get these points P and Q

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:21.600
as far away as possible from each other.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.003
So, if I was just
dealing with two circles,

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:27.056
I'd stick P right over
here, all the way here.

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:29.146
And I would stick Q,

00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:32.420
I would stick Q all the way over there

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.161
on the other circle.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.297
And so the distance
between them is going to be

00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:39.664
essentially the sum of the two diameters.

00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:41.335
So, it's going to be,

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:44.435
it's going to be 14 plus,

00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:49.102
14 plus eight and 14 plus eight,

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:54.102
14 plus eight is going to be equal to 22.

00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:55.998
And so, if I can do that with two circles

00:01:55.998 --> 00:01:57.913
of these radii, I could obviously do these

00:01:57.913 --> 00:01:58.784
as spheres as well.

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.281
You could imagine these
are the cross sections

00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:01.419
of those spheres.

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:03.323
So, I can get to a distance of 22,

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.738
but am I sure that that's
the furthest distance?

00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:08.756
Well, you could reason
through it that look

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:11.872
if you were to try to
bring P out a little bit

00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:15.176
more unto the surface
here, on the surface,

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.149
yeah there's going to be
a little bit of distance

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.541
now that it's kind of
going out of the page,

00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:22.060
if you're going out of
the surface right here.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.500
But, it's getting closer,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.239
essentially, along the page.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.166
So, maybe those two things trade off,

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.383
or maybe this really is
the maximum distance.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:31.927
And if you're taking this
on a standardized test,

00:02:31.927 --> 00:02:34.377
this could become a very
involved thought process.

00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:35.736
And you start saying,
"well, how do I prove

00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:38.440
"that this is absolutely
the furthest distance?"

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.005
But, many times, the
test itself is designed

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:43.164
so that you don't have to prove it.

00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:44.789
Because notice, we could definitely find

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.449
a distance of 22.

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.574
This we can definitely
find between two points

00:02:48.574 --> 00:02:50.245
on these two surfaces.

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:52.103
And notice, that is the largest of all

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:53.705
of your possible choices.

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:55.864
So, we would go with the largest

00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:58.047
of all of their possible choices.

00:02:58.047 --> 00:02:59.242
This would be a little bit more confusing.

00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:00.647
You would have to be a little bit more

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.169
rigorous with yourself and say,

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:03.732
"Well, do I really know that."

00:03:03.732 --> 00:03:06.150
If they had a choice that said 23

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.367
or a choice that said 22 times

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:11.223
the square root of two,
or something like that.

00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:13.046
But, the fact that you can definitely

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:17.120
can get these points to be
22 away from each other,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.082
and that is the largest
of all of the choices.

00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:20.684
That's a pretty good clue that that is

00:03:20.684 --> 00:03:23.900
the maximum possible length of PQ.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.466
And in a future video, I
can do a more in depth proof

00:03:26.466 --> 00:03:29.888
that this is actually
going to be the case.
