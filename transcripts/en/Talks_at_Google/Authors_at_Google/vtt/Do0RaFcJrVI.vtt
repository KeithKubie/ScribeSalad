00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.610
MALE SPEAKER: Good morning.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.810
Welcome to Authors@Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.280
Today, it's my great pleasure
to introduce one of the most

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.130
interesting and successful
people I know,

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.540
Hank Phillippi Ryan.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.680
Hank is the Anthony-, Agatha-,
Macavity-award-winning author

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.850
of five mystery novels--

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.747
"Prime Time," "Face Time," "Air
Time," "Drive Time," and

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:34.210
now "The Other Woman," which
is front of you, her first

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.407
recent hardcover, which went
back for a second printing, I

00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:39.186
think, the first week.

00:00:39.186 --> 00:00:42.000
So it's been highly
successful.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.920
More than an author, which would
be enough, Hank has also

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.920
been an award-winning
investigative reporter at

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.392
Boston's Channel 7
for 27 years--

00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:54.690
no, 30 years.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.460
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Yesterday
was my 30-year anniversary, in

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.050
Boston, only.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.403
MALE SPEAKER: You started
at age 5?

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:01.760
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN:
Aw, thank you, Sam.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.720
Get this guy another book.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.709
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.372
MALE SPEAKER: And she has almost
as many Emmys as she

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:09.827
has years at Channel 7--

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:14.290
28 Emmys, and those are real
Emmys, not Daytime Emmys or

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.186
Golden Globes.

00:01:15.186 --> 00:01:16.640
So they mean something.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.670
Before Channel 7, she
was a reporter.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.460
I know she'll talk
about those days.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.662
She toured the country with
the photographer Richard

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:27.645
Avedon and Hunter S. Thompson.

00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:30.545
I told her just now, you haven't
written a book about

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:31.525
touring with Thompson.

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:34.906
And she said, nobody
would believe it.

00:01:34.906 --> 00:01:37.540
I think we should demand
it here, today.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.480
America wants to
read this book.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.746
But without further ado,
Hank Philippi Ryan.

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:45.189
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Thank
you, thank you so much.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:45.670
Thank you.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.330
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Thank
you so much for

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.580
inviting me here today.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.520
The Hunter Thompson story
that I cannot tell

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.190
is we went to Florida.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.280
We were doing a series
of stories on the '76

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.990
presidential election, and we
were interviewing all the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.600
possible candidates for the
Democratic nomination.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.290
And we went to Florida
to interview--

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.000
I can't even remember
who it was.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.560
I was a kid, I was 21 or
something like that, so this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.720
is pretty interesting.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.170
So it was Hunter Thompson
and Pat Caddell.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.680
Do you remember Pat Caddell from
the political campaign?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.590
And Bob Shrum.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.250
And we all went to a hotel
room in Florida.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.960
And Hunter taught me how to
inhale lighter fluid and then

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.160
light it on fire, so you
could breathe fire.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.290
Do not try this at home.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.030
And I couldn't do it now
if you asked me to.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.730
But here we are in, like, the
Hilton or something like that,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.310
playing with lighter fluid
and lighting it on fire.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.860
We all thought we
were hilarious.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.720
I would not do that now, but
that's just part of the story.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.130
Hunter and I went out
to dinner once in

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.690
Washington, DC, and--

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.900
you're set with who Hunter
Thompson is, right?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.350
You're OK.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.290
Went out to dinner in
Washington, DC.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.990
And it was so long ago that the
Metro system in Washington

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.280
hadn't been built yet.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.620
So the streets were
all torn up.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.310
The streets were wooden
in Washington, DC.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.400
It was 1971 or so.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.130
The streets were wooden
and slick, and it was

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.330
pouring down rain.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.170
And Hunter has this rental car
that's fishtailing through the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.940
streets of Washington
on this wet wood.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.860
And he says, wow, I hope the
police don't stop us.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.640
I hope we don't get into an
accident, because the police

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.190
will go crazy when they find
out what's in the trunk.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.750
I'm like, really?

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.270
I'm a reporter for "Rolling
Stone Magazine." I don't want

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.810
to be with Hunter Thompson when
the police come and we

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.990
all get arrested and I have to
call my mom in Indianapolis

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.640
and say, guess what?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.010
And I'm sure he was kidding.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.030
I'm sure he was kidding.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.550
I never looked in the
trunk to make sure.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.830
So we go out to dinner to,
like, Don Juan's or

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.580
something like that.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.750
Mexican restaurant.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.050
And Hunter orders
five margaritas.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.910
And I'm like, you're not even
going to drink five

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.730
margaritas.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.730
Why would you do that?

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.330
And he says, I just
want to see if the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.480
waitress will bring them.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.570
I just want to see
if she will.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.480
So that's kind of what
he was like.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.520
He was also so generous.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.410
I mean, he came across as this
gonzo journalist who was tough

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.030
and wacky and crazy and nuts--

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.320
I mean, nuts.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.810
But he was really the kindest,
most gentle person you could

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.070
possibly imagine.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.010
And here's how long
ago it was.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.310
He asked me if I had ever
heard of Jimmy Buffett.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.940
And I said, no.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.970
So that's how long ago it was.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.530
And he said, well,
come with me.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.580
And he took me to
a record store.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.890
You OK on record store?

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.760
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: He took
me to a record store and

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.830
bought me all the Jimmy
Buffett albums,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.850
which I still have.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.740
So that's a generous heart.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.800
That is a wonderful guy.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.590
So when I look back on those
years, working in Washington,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.400
DC during Watergate, during
the Nixon presidency, when

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.020
Woodward and Bernstein's
articles were

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.800
coming out every day.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.480
Then I transitioned to covering
the Ford White House

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.790
for "Rolling Stone"
for a while.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.760
I did a column called "Capitol
Chatter," which was sort of

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.040
Washington gossip.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.410
Now we had a three-week
lead time.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.850
So if you can imagine doing a
gossip column when it has to

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.450
hold and be new for
three weeks?

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.010
That just like, gossip is gone
in a moment, so nothing's

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.060
going to hold for three weeks.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.010
So I did stuff like, I covered
Susan Ford's prom

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.590
at the White House.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.850
That was pretty surreal
and kind of great.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.518
So it was a fun time.

00:05:32.518 --> 00:05:36.170
But this, I'm here for "The
Other Woman," although when

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.270
I'm finish the yapping, I'll
be delighted to answer any

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.340
questions about any realm of
my career that you like--

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.460
writing or thinking or
imagination or reporting or

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.730
investigative reporting or
mysteries or television, or

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.130
anything like that.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.170
But when I see "The
Other Woman"--

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.780
this is my first hardcover--

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.540
I love it.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.320
It is in a second printing
already.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.750
It's been on the Boston Globe
bestseller list twice, went to

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.130
number two.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.160
That pesky "Gone Girl"
is number one.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.510
Can't imagine.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.750
But what I also didn't imagine,
when I wrote this

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.850
book, is that the cover
would look like this.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.520
It says, Hank Phillippi
Ryan, "The

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.500
Other Woman." [LAUGHTER]

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.450
No.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.700
I should have thought that
through a little bit more.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.180
And the second book in the
series, which comes out next

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.020
year, is called "The Wrong
Girl." Hank Phillippi Ryan,

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.220
"The Wrong Girl."

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.910
So I need to think, and maybe
you can help me at some point,

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.610
think of a better title
for the third book.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.690
Hank Phillippi Ryan, "Really
Good." Or Hank Phillippi Ryan,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.540
"Buy This Book." Or something
like that, that is a little

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.210
more encouraging.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.360
You know, this juxtaposition of
title reminds me of a story

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.450
that we did a couple
of years ago.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.830
As you know, I'm the
investigative

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.030
reporter at Channel 7.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.090
I've just worked there
now for 30 years.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.710
Yesterday is my anniversary.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.330
Crazy.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.380
But since 1988, I've been
the investigative

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.840
reporter at Channel 7.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.250
And we did a story a couple
of years ago on

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.800
headlights on cars.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.800
Not head lice, but headlights
on cars, and how they

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.080
diminish, their power diminishes
over time.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.110
And people think that they can't
see as well, but really

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.360
it's that their headlights
aren't working as well as they

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.140
did before.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.020
So I promise you this
has a point.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.770
We got 20 cars from a car dealer
and lined them up,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.950
everything from like a 1999 Ford
Gizmo or whatever they

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.170
had, to like the big, flashy
Jaguar something or other,

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.100
with xenon headlights, or
xeon, or whatever it is.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.050
And we lined them all up
and we turned on the

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.910
headlights at night.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.850
And we had a guy who was an
expert in lighting calibrate

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.950
the light that came, the
foot candles that

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.410
came from each headlight.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.690
And sure enough, it turned out
that the headlights got worse

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.830
as time went by.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.440
The bulbs themselves would get
dim, and the plastic in the

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.880
headlight cover would get thick
and opaque and make it

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.810
more difficult to see.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.930
So here's a good story.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:00.600
We thought, good.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.350
This is a good story.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.770
People need to know this.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:04.860
So we reported the story.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.700
I wrote the story.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.480
I went into the edit booth,
and I edited the story and

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.070
made a little movie out of it.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.050
And you know, the last thing
that you do before a story

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.040
goes on TV, an investigative
story, is you do the stand-up

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.570
in the newsroom, the stand-up
close to the story.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.215
Come on in.

00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:23.620
The stand-up close to the
story, which is when the

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.940
reporter stands in front of the
graphic that describes the

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.330
story and says, for more on
this, go to our website.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.700
Yap, yap, yap.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.559
So I put on my spiffy little
reporter suit and a whole

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.760
bunch of makeup and combed my
hair and I'm going down to the

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.740
newsroom to stand in front
of the graphic.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.450
And I turn around,
and the graphic--

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.440
like this--

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.250
the graphic says

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:50.052
"Dangerously Dim." [LAUGHTER]

00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:52.990
And I said to the dude--

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.450
So I go to the news director,
and I say, I cannot stand in

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.350
front of a graphic that says
"Dangerously Dim." And he

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.950
laughed, just like you did.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.620
And then he goes, Yeah,
we don't really

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.570
have time to fix that.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.880
So I had to stand in front
of this graphic that says

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.570
"Dangerously Dim." The only
thing that I've ever seen

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.250
that's sort of worse than that
is we had an anchorwoman, this

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.000
gorgeous anchorwoman, who had to
stand in front of a graphic

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.280
that said, "Botched

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.420
Plastic Surgery." [LAUGHTER]

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.250
So these are things that
you just don't

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.380
think about, as viewers.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.270
Things that the art department
ought to think about,

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.080
but they rarely do.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.580
But as I said, I've been a
reporter for 30 years.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.730
I've wired myself with
hidden cameras.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.020
I've confronted corrupt
politicians.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.520
I've chased down criminals.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.710
I've gone in disguise and
undercover and been

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.980
tear-gassed and gotten to close
to fires and been to

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.940
murder scenes.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.410
And gosh, interviewed everybody
from Jimmy Carter to

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.180
Muhammad Ali to Prince
Charles.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.750
And it's been fabulous.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.500
You know, I love my
job as a reporter.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.890
It's one of those--

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.190
it's one of those professions
where every day you go to

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.090
work, and you have no idea
what's going to happen.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.660
And that's good.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.680
That's good.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.890
I have a cartoon--

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.690
I think it's a "Zippy."
No, it isn't.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.400
I have a cartoon on my
refrigerator that has two guys

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.890
on a desert island, clearly
by themselves.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.900
And one of them says other, you
mean we're out here on our

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.330
own in the middle of nowhere?

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.820
We have no idea what's going to
happen, and no control over

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.910
our future?

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.280
And the second guy says, Yeah.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.360
And the first guy says, Cool.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.360
And that's sort of how I look at
the world, that there's so

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.070
many open doors and so many
possibilities and so many

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.020
things that could happen,
and everything

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.750
could turn into a story.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.070
Now when I started in
my real, grown-up--

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.270
my first job was at the Dairy
Queen, and I can still make

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.890
the dip cone with the
curlicue on top,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.030
which I may need someday.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.670
But my first real job in
grown-up world was as a

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.190
campaign worker, political
staffer in a political

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.075
campaign in my home
in Indiana.

00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:05.310
You know, and I took constituent
calls and

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:10.590
organized advance teams and went
to county fairs and flew

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.230
in the helicopter with the
candidate and ate corn dogs

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.350
and wrote press releases
and stuff like that.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:22.540
And I really got an inside view
of what it's like to work

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.560
in politics.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.310
What politicians want,
what candidates want.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.650
How they think, what they need,
the desire for power.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.680
How they manipulate,
how they try to

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.080
manipulate how we think.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.450
No matter what's really true,
that they want you to think

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.690
what they want to think.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:44.020
And at that time, I thought I
wanted to be in politics.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.950
But what happened was, sadly,
none of the candidates I ever

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.360
worked for actually won.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.290
And I began to think
that perhaps I had

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.620
chosen the wrong field.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.030
Not that I was in charge, no.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.640
I was 20.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.640
But nevertheless, this
was not going my way.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:06.620
And I have a pretty abiding
philosophy that when something

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.550
bad happens in your life, it
only means that something

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.840
fabulous is going to
happen soon after.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.540
I mean, you've had this happen,
that you think, oh my

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.460
goodness, I'm so disappointed,
I'm doomed.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.490
My life is over.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.110
I will never be OK.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.590
And then soon after, some
fabulous thing occurs that

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.800
makes you realize that if the
bad thing hadn't happened, the

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.850
good thing wouldn't have
happened next.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.480
You know what I mean?

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.800
You've had that.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.280
And so that is exactly why
I am where I am today, is

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:40.570
because no politician who I ever
worked for actually won.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.360
And here's why.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.470
When a guy who was running for
governor of Indiana lost the

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.470
election, I was out of a job.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.540
And instead of being a hotshot
campaign aide to the governor

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.720
of Indiana, I was unemployed.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.620
I was unemployed.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.820
And an English major, so
skill-less and unemployed.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.600
Completely unemployable.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.560
So I went to the biggest radio
station in Indianapolis, my

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.610
hometown, and applied for
the job as a reporter.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.380
They had a job opening
for a reporter.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.470
This was 1970?

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.440
'71.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.600
1971.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.770
I applied for the job
as a reporter.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.840
And the news director,
this guy who was

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.490
kind of like Lou Grant--

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:20.920
remember Lou Grant?

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.390
Sort of crusty but benign.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.610
He says, well, do you
have any experience?

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.010
Do you have any experience
as a reporter?

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.350
Have you ever written
a news story?

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.670
Have you ever interviewed
anyone?

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.020
Have you ever written
a news release?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.350
Have you ever covered
any kind of a story?

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.320
Did you go to journalism
school?

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.100
Work on the school paper?

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.620
Anything.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.740
I'm like, oh, drat.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.440
No.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.360
I have no experience.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.560
The dreaded experience
question.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.670
Nothing.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.080
But I was young, and I thought,
I can do this.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.830
He should just hire me.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.200
So I said, no, I don't really
have any experience, but I

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.350
grew up here in Indianapolis
and I know where all the

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.160
streets are.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.311
You kind of got to go
with what you have.

00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:09.240
And I said, and your license is
up for renewal at the FCC,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.040
and you don't have any
women working here.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.930
And then I just smiled.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.714
And the next day, I had my first
job in broadcasting.

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:19.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.905
And here's why I
tell you this.

00:14:20.905 --> 00:14:21.840
Here's why I tell you this.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.680
One, because it won't
work anymore.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.420
When I talk to journalism
classes, I say, don't go in

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.160
and say, you should hire
me because I'm a woman.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.690
They're going to be like, yeah,
you and everybody else

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.160
in the office.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.360
My boss is a woman, her
boss is a woman, and

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.500
her boss is a woman.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.290
So that's very different from
how it was back then.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.170
In the days when I started, when
Andrea Mitchell started,

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.740
with Leslie Stahl started, when
Nancy Dickerson started,

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.290
and Barbara Walters, and Jane
Pauley, all of us were

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.430
breaking the glass ceiling
for women in

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.370
broadcasting at the time.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.130
When you walked into a newsroom
when I started back

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.280
in the '70s, everybody
was smoking,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.860
everybody was yelling.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.850
There was smoke and
cigarettes and

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.330
typewriters and people yelling.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.350
And now they're quiet and full
of women and no smoking.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:09.770
I mean, it's completely--

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.075
the world has changed
so incredibly much.

00:15:12.075 --> 00:15:15.080
So who would have thought, back
in the day when you had

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.420
to get up to change
the channel--

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.010
do you remember that?--

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.150
you had to get up to change
the channel that now there

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.010
would be 900 channels and
Diane Sawyer would be

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.870
anchoring "The Evening News?" I
mean, 35 years ago, that was

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:30.500
unthinkable.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.000
So the world has definitely
changed since then.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.730
But I think I knew, from the
moment I read my first

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.210
"Sherlock Holmes" story and my
first "Nancy Drew" book, that

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.840
I wanted to be a
mystery author.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.840
You read "Nancy Drew."
Did you read "Nancy

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.170
Drew," the real ones?

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.040
There was "The Clue in the Old
Clock," and "The Clue in the

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.970
Diary," which I thought was
"Clue in the Dairy," for like

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:54.950
most of the book.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:58.860
So I'm going, shouldn't there
be some cows in this?

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.210
There weren't.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.250
I figured that out.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.190
And then I went on to the
wonderful British woman

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.440
mystery authors, Margery
Allingham, Josephine Tey,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.420
Ngaio Marsh, and of course,
Agatha Christie, my idol when

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.960
I was 13 years old.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.030
And in the interesting sort of
synchronistic world, the way

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:20.550
it is, my first novel won the
Agatha for Best First Mystery.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:24.370
So who'd have thought, you know,
this 13-year-old loving

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.970
Agatha Christie would 50 years
later win an award for Best

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.270
Traditional Mystery,
named after her?

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:33.840
So that's how the world is so
wonderful, and the world is so

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.250
mysterious.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.130
But then one day, I sneaked from
my parents bookshelves

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.720
the book "Failsafe." Do you
remember "Failsafe" at all?

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.625
Really, really scary book
about the Cold War.

00:16:47.625 --> 00:16:49.290
And I terrified myself.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.470
And then I read "On the Beach,"
and "Seven Days in

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.600
May," and "Advise and Consent,"
and all these

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.530
wonderful, dark political
thrillers.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.190
And I realized that there
was another kind of

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.530
literature out there.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.770
It was suspense.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.290
And that's what, all of that
goes into "The Other Woman."

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.390
But my life turned out a
different way, as you know.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.510
I wasn't a mystery
author back then.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.720
I turned out to be a television
reporter.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.060
Because that day in
Indianapolis, when I talked to

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.170
the guy about the FCC, I took
a chance, I had some

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.730
confidence, and I found
my calling.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.690
Just by chance.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.580
I became a TV reporter.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.160
And you might think that being
a reporter for television, an

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.880
investigative reporter,
and writing

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.110
fiction are very different.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.650
And of course, they are, because
in television you

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.160
can't make stuff up.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.840
This is the key difference.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:46.320
But basically, in television
and in mystery writing,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.960
they're very similar.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.650
Because the key of both of them
is to tell a good story.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.290
It's only and all about telling
a good story with a

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.510
wonderful plot and with
compelling characters, where

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.150
the good guys win and
the bad guys get

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.130
what's coming to them.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.670
When at the end, there's a
satisfying ending with some

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.930
justice, and you get to change
the world a little bit.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:16.120
And whether it's in television
or in fiction, that's my role,

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.240
to change the world
a little bit.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.800
You know, every one of those
28 Emmys that I have

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.740
represents a secret that we
discovered that someone didn't

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.040
want you to know.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.750
You know what I mean?

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.230
It's not just like
a good story.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.300
But it's a thing that someone
was trying to keep you from

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.040
knowing that we revealed.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.380
Quickly, in our stories, we did
stories about the mortgage

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.080
industry and home improvement
contractors in Massachusetts

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.790
that resulted in three new
laws being passed.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.110
We got people's homes
out of foreclosure.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.050
People's homes out
of foreclosure.

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.050
And millions of dollars in
refunds and restitution.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:58.480
We discovered why there was no
diversity at all in federal

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.740
jury pools in Massachusetts, no
people of color at all for

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.480
years in federal jury pools
of Massachusetts.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.580
No diversity, and we found
out why that was.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.170
And now that's getting
changed.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.360
We discovered that it's possible
that when you call

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.440
911 for emergency help, that the
police and firefighters,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.550
the emergency responders,
were being sent

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.150
to the wrong address.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.710
Over and over and over and over,
people were being sent

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:21.450
to the wrong address.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.250
The state had no idea.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.200
And we, as a result
of our story, that

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.200
system is being changed.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.720
We had to battle up to the
Secretary of State's office to

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.510
get them to give us the
information about why you

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.470
weren't receiving your emergency
response in the

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.370
proper way.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:43.170
So it's been very exciting.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.640
Fiction and investigative
reporting

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.365
are all about secrets.

00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:50.890
Who knows a secret?

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.030
Who has a secret?

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.270
Who's telling the secret.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.970
Who's going to find
out the secret?

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.930
And what's going to happen
as a result of that?

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:03.360
So every day, what I do every
day is to look for secrets.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.850
Also every day, I look
for a good idea.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.500
And it's really fascinating to
me to think about, you know,

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.510
every story I write and every
book that I write starts with

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.960
the nugget of a wonderful
idea.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.620
Harlan Coben--

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.560
do you know the author
Harlan Coben?--

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:25.220
talks about how he writhes on
the couch for a month to think

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.890
of his good story.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.570
And all authors worry about
where their next

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.040
idea will come from.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.070
And it's fascinating to
me to think about

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.660
how our minds work.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.490
A couple of years ago, five
years ago, I was still looking

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.340
for a plot for my first book.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.110
I got an email, a spam email,
and I was deleting all the

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.070
spam for my computer.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.380
You know how you do that, just
blink, blink, blink, blink,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.260
blink, because you recognize
it instantly.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.490
And I opened one by mistake.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.870
And in it--

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.760
the subject line said, a new
refinancing deal for you.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.440
But in the body of the email
was what looked like lines

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.570
from a play by Shakespeare.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.800
And I thought, why would
somebody put that there?

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.490
Why would someone put a
Shakespeare play in the body

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.380
of an email about mortgage
refinancing?

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.580
And it crossed my mind that it
might be a secret message.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.690
And then I thought, oh my gosh,
ding, ding, ding, secret

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:25.590
messages in computer spam.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.790
And I thought, that is an
idea for a mystery.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.780
And that turned out to be "Prime
Time," my first book.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.370
And I'll tell you that I went to
the FBI Citizen's Academy,

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.280
which is this eight-week course
that the FBI gives to

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.450
the public, to come in and
learn how they work.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.530
So on the cyber crimes day, I
took aside the agent who was

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:49.470
in charge of federal cyber
crimes and I said, can I tell

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.210
you my idea for a mystery?

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:51.820
And can you imagine?

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.110
This guy's like, oh my gosh.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.990
Here's some woman who
wants to tell me

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.170
her idea for a mystery.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.310
Sure, lady, tell me the idea.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.690
So I told him about the secret
messages in computer spam.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.250
And his eyes got bigger and
bigger and bigger, and he

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.980
said, you know, that
would work.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.630
And I said, I know.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.430
And I said, have you ever
had any cases like that?

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.290
And he said, no.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.290
And I said, well, maybe I
should've chosen a life of

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:17.840
crime rather than a life
as a mystery author.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.620
And he says, no, watch it,
we're on to you now,

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:21.776
so don't try it.

00:22:21.776 --> 00:22:23.310
You know why it would work.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.700
I mean, you all know why it
would work, because it was

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.600
plain text.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.040
I was seeing the plain text
instead of the HTML, and

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.190
somebody had just put that in.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.370
But I didn't know that.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.325
So it was just this incredible,
mysterious thing

00:22:33.325 --> 00:22:34.315
that happened.

00:22:34.315 --> 00:22:36.580
But like every other author--

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.030
every other author--

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.680
after I had a good idea, I
wondered if I would ever have

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.130
another good idea.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.260
I say to my husband, I'm never
going to write another book,

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.180
because I'll never have
another good idea.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.470
I'm never going to do another
investigative story, because

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.190
I'll never have another
good idea.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.140
And he says, you always
say that.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.500
And I say, I know, but this is
the time I'm never going to

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.840
have another good idea.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.460
And he says, you always
say that too.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.600
And I say, I know, but this
could be the time that I

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.710
really never have another
good idea.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.165
And somehow, the universe,
it seems to me--

00:23:09.165 --> 00:23:12.440
and I don't know if you've
had this happen to you.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.040
But when you need the idea, when
it's really time for the

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.710
idea, the universe provides
the idea for you.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.180
Have you had this?

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.420
It's unbelievable.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.860
And if you just sort of let go
and be open to the thought,

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.090
sometimes it just shows up.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.480
And I don't mean to
sound woo-woo.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.400
It's not magic.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.050
It's just the flow.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:37.990
Forgive me for that.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.740
But sometimes that happens,
and it happened to me in

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.630
writing this book.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.840
Now I'll tell you that my
husband and I don't celebrate

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.130
the anniversary of
the day we met.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.970
We do not.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.226
We celebrate the anniversary
of the day before we met.

00:23:53.226 --> 00:23:57.210
And we call that "You Never Know
Day." Because you never

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.570
know what wonderful thing is
around the next corner.

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:02.790
You know, one day, we didn't
know the other person existed.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.680
The next day we met, and we
haven't been apart since then,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.910
17 years ago.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.240
So You Never Know Day.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.400
You never know what's
around the corner.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.550
And that's where this
book came from.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:15.270
Remember, I said my philosophy
about good stuff

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:17.500
coming out of bad?

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.570
I needed a root canal.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.050
I needed a root canal.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.120
And you wonder, what good could
come out of getting a

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:23.730
root canal?

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.100
So I'm in the dentist's
office.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.610
My face is puffy, I'm cranky,
I'm missing work.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.400
I'm going, like, oh my gosh,
I can't be here, I can't be

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.890
here, I have to go.

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:35.840
And I was reading an old "People
Magazine." Not--

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.650
not an old people magazine.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.460
And old "People Magazine." And I
was reading an article about

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.445
Mark Sanford, the ex-governor
of South Carolina.

00:24:44.445 --> 00:24:48.040
You know who that is, of course,
the one who told his

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.690
wife and his family that he was
out hiking the Appalachian

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.440
Trail when really he was off
with his Argentinean mistress.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.550
And in the dentist's office,
in pain, puffy face, I'm

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.990
thinking who would be
the other woman?

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.980
Who would be this Argentinian
mistress?

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.290
Who would do that?

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:11.360
Who would actively decide
to ruin her life?

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.290
Who would actively decide to
ruin the life of this man she

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.480
ostensibly loves?

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.600
You know, we think about these
people that we've known--

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.700
I mean, first of all, you're
going to get caught.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.720
You're going to get caught.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.240
From Kay Summersby,
to Elizabeth

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.450
Ray, to Rielle Hunter--

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.580
I mean, Monica Lewinsky could
win the Nobel Prize, right?

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.400
And what would the
headlines say?

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.380
"Monica Lewinsky, paramour of
President Clinton, wins Nobel

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.040
Prize." Right?

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.820
It's never going to go away.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.120
So I was just obsessed with
who would be other woman?

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.060
You're going to ruin
your life.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.900
You're going to ruin-- the
guy you ostensibly

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.680
love, his life is ruined.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.040
His wife's life, his family's
life, his children's life, his

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.076
employees' life, his
staff's life.

00:25:52.076 --> 00:25:57.820
And here's a guy who is the
elected governor of a state.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:02.480
And you know, all of us are
jaded and cynical and

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.500
suspicious enough of people in
politics and public service,

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.780
when really being a public
servant and giving your life

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.680
to politics and lawmaking
is the highest

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.730
calling you can have.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:17.640
It's one of the most honorable
things you can do.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.150
So I started getting cranky and
angry about why someone

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.610
would take that and--

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.550
why would someone be such a
bad guy and make everybody

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.310
else look bad, too?

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:32.700
So I began to wonder whether
there was a big, juicy story

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.180
that I could write
about motivation.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:41.090
I began to wonder whether there
was a thriller about why

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.190
someone would be the
other woman.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.920
Was it lust?

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.600
Was it power?

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.440
Was it corruption?

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.100
Was it need?

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.840
Was it desire?

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.070
Was it selfishness?

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:51.030
Or maybe there was a motivation
that I hadn't

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:56.860
thought of yet that would really
talk about why someone

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.180
would do that.

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:02.900
And in the end of this article
in "People Magazine"--

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.980
I mean, through my pain I'm
thinking about this.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.550
In the end of this article,
someone says, you can choose

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.840
your sin, but you cannot choose
your consequences.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.440
And I just thought, oh, my
book, my book, my book.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.920
Because we all have, everything
we do has a

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.050
consequence.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.970
Even when we think we're making
the right decision, it

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.440
has a consequence.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.450
And that's what I wanted my book
to be able to be about.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:32.750
It takes place in Boston.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.630
It's very local.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.090
You'll recognize the Esplanade
and MassPike.

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:38.140
I mean, my husband and I will
be driving on the MassPike,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.670
and I"ll say, oh, exit 17, this
is where Jane gets chased

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.430
by the truck.

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.800
And I think, no,
I made that up.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.270
So it's so realistic and so
Bostonian that sometimes I

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.430
forget what's real and
what's not real.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:54.260
But it takes place right
now, actually.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.850
In the pivotal weeks before a
Senate election, a Boston

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.950
television reporter on the
trail of an ex-governor's

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:05.005
secret mistress, a Boston police
detective on the trail

00:28:05.005 --> 00:28:08.170
of a possible serial killer--
two women's bodies have been

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:12.060
found under bridges, the Zakim
Bridge and the BU Bridge,

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.190
specifically.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.840
Both killed the same
way, both with no

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.480
identification and no shoes.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.810
When the next victim is a key
player in the political

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.750
campaign the reporter
is covering--

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.920
Jane, the reporter,
is covering--

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.550
when the next victim is a key
player in the political

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.530
campaign, Jane, the reporter,
and Jake, the cop, believe

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.860
that they might be on the trail
of the same person.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.770
And this is someone who
will stop at nothing

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.500
to prevent a scandal.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.680
So in the book, it
says, seduction,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.380
betrayal, and murder.

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.050
It's going to take
a lot more than

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.410
votes to win this election.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.820
So Booklist Starred Review
called it a perfect thriller

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.000
for the election season.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.110
And you can't really do
better than perfect.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:02.210
Let me just wrap up by saying
that a couple of months ago,

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:06.410
my husband and I went to hear
Judy Collins at Stanford

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:07.110
Theatre at Harvard.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.970
Did you go?

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:10.200
She was so amazing.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.330
And Judy Collins, this brilliant
icon, gorgeous

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:19.010
singer, told the story of how
she had been brought up as a

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.170
kid to be a concert pianist.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.520
Her parents wanted her to be a
concert pianist, and she was

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.070
trained for that.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.340
But she knew, she said she
always knew that she wanted to

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.055
be a folk singer.

00:29:31.055 --> 00:29:35.550
And at age 16, she left home,
she left Denver, and ran off

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.860
to New York to become a folk
singer, to make her mark.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.960
And she said, I went to New
York and I took all

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.610
my songs with me.

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:45.630
And then she said, of
course, I hadn't

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.060
written any of them yet.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.270
And that touched me so much,
because it made me realize

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.190
that we all have songs.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.600
And some of them we haven't
quite written yet, because we

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.940
haven't quite decided that
it's the time to do so.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.380
She decided it was the
time to do so.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.300
I'm the poster child for
having a time to do so.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.420
I didn't start writing
my mysteries until I

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.780
was 55 years old.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.450
I was 62 yesterday.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.410
No, I was 63 yesterday.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:19.400
And you know, who'd have thought
that all that work in

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.560
politics and all those
years as a reporter--

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.000
and I'm still a reporter--

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.890
weren't the end in themselves?

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.760
It wasn't about being
a reporter.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.390
It wasn't about being a
political campaign staffer.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.170
It was 40 years of research.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.150
It was 40 years of research
for this part of my life,

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.620
which is so exciting.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.380
And I tell people, you
know, if there's

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.740
something you want to do--

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.130
like make a lot of noise.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.850
If there's something you want to
do, like write that book of

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:50.100
poetry or take that trip or
learning Italian or start a

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:53.730
business or try something
new, please do that.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.810
You don't want to wake up one
morning and think, I regret

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.100
that I didn't try that.

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.450
I regret that I didn't
do that.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.640
I have a motto on my bulletin
board, and it says leap, and

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.230
the net will appear.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.090
Leap, and the net will appear.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.200
And that's how I feel
about the world.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.000
If not now, when are we
going to do this?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.890
When I finished my first book,
"Prime Time," I called my

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:23.090
husband into the room, and I
said, sweetheart, watch this.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:24.730
And I've typed, The End.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.920
And then I burst into tears.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.400
I burst into tears.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.720
Because I knew no matter what
happened with that book, I had

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.130
done something that I
always wanted to do.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:36.710
I had followed my dreams.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:41.345
And of course, I shouldn't have
cried when I typed The

00:31:41.345 --> 00:31:42.930
End, because it wasn't
the end.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.410
It wasn't the end at all.

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.370
It was the beginning of
this wonderful new

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:47.640
second half of my life.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.330
And I'm so happy to be here
today to share it with you.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.268
Thank you very much
for inviting me.

00:31:54.268 --> 00:31:58.948
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:58.948 --> 00:32:01.710
I would be delighted to answer
any questions about reporting

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.440
or writing or mysteries, or the
mysteries of television,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:08.040
or juggling two different
careers, anything like that.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.815
Anybody have a question?

00:32:08.815 --> 00:32:09.552
Yes.

00:32:09.552 --> 00:32:11.480
AUDIENCE: So currently, you
don't write your own graphics,

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.372
but do you write your
own material as an

00:32:14.372 --> 00:32:15.830
investigative reporter?

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:16.930
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Do I write
my own material as an

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:17.790
investigative reporter?

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.670
Yes I do.

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.660
Every word.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:25.960
One of the joys of being able to
tell a story is that I have

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.430
a tremendous amount
of material.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:29.660
Well, I start out
with nothing.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.130
I start out with an idea.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.360
And then we write, we research
and do interviews, and look up

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.100
documents, and track down clues,
and follow leads, and

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.540
come up with volumes and volumes
and volumes of stuff.

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.340
And then we shoot
our interviews

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.250
and shoot our video.

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:46.410
We usually shoot about 18 times
more video than ever

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:47.650
goes on the air.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:51.960
So you can imagine what it's
like to take all this

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.580
voluminous information that's
complicated and mysterious and

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:01.540
make it into a compelling little
movie, to narrow it to

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.170
the essence--

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.801
AUDIENCE: So you're actually
a documentary filmmaker, in

00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:05.730
addition to all these
other things.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.400
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Well, yes,
kind of a documentary

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.350
filmmaker, because every news
story is a little movie.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.740
Every news story that we write
is a little movie.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.050
So we get told we have
three minutes for a

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.150
story, let's say.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.800
So you have to figure
out how to tell the

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.220
story in three minutes.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:24.860
And then sometimes if some big
breaking news thing happens,

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.140
the boss will come in and say,
well, you can only have a

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.240
minute and a half.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.190
And so then we have to fix the
little movie to make it be the

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.400
same good story in a
minute and a half.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.780
So your mind is always working
about how to take the very

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.150
best things that you have and
put them together so that no

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.310
one will turn the channel.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:46.380
And writing those stories,
taking all the puzzle pieces

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.550
and seeing what picture it
makes, you know what I mean?

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.100
Because at the beginning,
you don't know.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.940
Taking those puzzles pieces
and seeing what picture it

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.150
makes in the most compelling
ways is really one of the most

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.196
fun parts of my job.

00:34:00.196 --> 00:34:02.900
Who else has a question?

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.600
Yes, Kathleen?

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.660
AUDIENCE: I have to assume that
a certain amount of your

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.725
experience is going in
there, in being Jane.

00:34:09.725 --> 00:34:15.010
And I'm wondering how you can
take someone who is supposed

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:19.070
to have the naivete of maybe
being willing to sniff a

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.986
little lighter fluid, but also
has the good sense to know

00:34:22.986 --> 00:34:24.978
when the license is
being renewed for

00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:27.600
the local radio station--

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.580
with all of your experience, how
do you keep her from being

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.920
too smart to be believable?

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.159
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Oh,
that's so interesting.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.540
How do I keep my main character
from being too smart

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.020
to be believable?

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:38.550
That's funny.

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:39.646
I've never been asked that, and

00:34:39.646 --> 00:34:41.900
that's a terrific question.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.650
What I try to do with my
characters is make them be

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:47.830
real, someone who you
might really know.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.790
And one of the magical--

00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:50.550
it's not magic.

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:56.130
But one of the amazing things
about writing is how you're

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.630
making a real character
out of something that

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.950
didn't exist before.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.870
You know the Stephen Sondheim
musical, "Sunday in the Park

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.420
with George?" Have you
seen that at all?

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.220
It's about creativity
and it's about--

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.275
he's painting--

00:35:10.275 --> 00:35:12.650
he has a blank canvas, and
he sings this song called

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.860
"Finishing the Hat." And
he's painting this hat.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.930
And he says, look, I
made a hat where

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.790
there never was a hat.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.350
And that's how I feel about
creating my characters.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:26.520
I'm creating something
out of nothing.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.230
I'm making a person who never
was there before.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:34.070
I'm making hats, new hats,
everyday as a writer.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.250
So Jane, or all of
my characters--

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.580
I don't have an outline.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.310
I don't know where the
books are going.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.210
Everything that happens
is a surprise.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:45.440
So I see how she would
really behave.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.170
Sometimes my characters say
things that I hadn't planned

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.410
for them to say.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.780
Sometimes they won't say the
things that I had planned for

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.905
them to say.

00:35:53.905 --> 00:35:56.560
What I worry more about--

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:59.330
I worry more about not making
a character do something

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:00.590
that's silly.

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:03.140
I don't want people to say,
you would never do that.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.390
You see the movies or read the
books, or you think, don't go

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.975
in the basement.

00:36:05.975 --> 00:36:08.690
You know, the bad guy
is in the basement.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.600
At least in the movies,
they have the music.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.290
When that music starts,
you don't go in there.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.470
What I worry more about than
making her too smart--

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:21.900
because she's vulnerable, and
she's 33, and Jane is learning

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.620
her way in the news business.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.020
She's been unfairly fired.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.040
She's been humiliated.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.730
She's trying to get her
reputation back in this book.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:32.840
So I dig for my own personal
experiences in those emotions

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:38.980
of being 33, which now at 63,
I can look back on that in a

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.860
certain way and take the things
that work and not take

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.010
the things that don't work.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:47.820
So I never thought about not
making her too smart.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.820
I have thought about making
her too dumb.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.490
Isn't that so interesting?

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.040
Yes.

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.122
AUDIENCE: You said this was your
first hardcover, which I

00:36:58.122 --> 00:37:00.104
always assumed that books
started as hardcover and then

00:37:00.104 --> 00:37:00.740
went to paperback.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.720
So the earlier books started
as paperbacks?

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.540
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Yes.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.900
You're asking about my first
hardcover, and that you

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.160
thought that all books
started as hardcover.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.070
No.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.480
Some books start as what they
call paperback originals.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.290
And they can be the mass market
size, which is the

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:20.260
pocketbook size, and then
there's the trade paperbacks

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:24.150
which are bigger and more sort
of elegant-looking and more

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.520
expensive, and then the
hardcover books.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.720
And the publisher decides how
they're going to use your

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.330
manuscript, and how they're
going to make that look,

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:34.950
whether it's going
to be a hardcover

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.800
like this or a paperback.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.560
Paperback originals
are fabulous.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.830
You can tuck them in your
pocket, you can

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.370
tuck them your briefcase.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.130
You read them fast, and they're
not a treasure, but

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.420
they are convenient.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.100
I mean, look at this--
it's beautiful.

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.460
It's embossed, it's metallic.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.520
When my agent got the book, she
called me and she said,

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.680
wait 'til you see your book.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.335
It's so delicious.

00:37:57.335 --> 00:37:58.632
I could eat it.

00:37:58.632 --> 00:38:01.170
But she's enthusiastic.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:03.720
So the publisher decides
what's going to be a

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.290
hardcover, what's going
to be a paperback.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.470
They decide the print run,
they decide what the

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:09.160
distribution, they decide
what the cover's

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.210
going to look like.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.430
They decide everything.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:13.120
The author is just
happy that their

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.370
book is going to published.

00:38:16.832 --> 00:38:17.319
Yes.

00:38:17.319 --> 00:38:20.002
AUDIENCE: I'm interested in the
editing process. 'Cause I

00:38:20.002 --> 00:38:23.362
know you said you got to the
end of your first book and

00:38:23.362 --> 00:38:26.980
wrote The End, but I would guess
that's the beginning of

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:28.680
going through the whole
editing process.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.037
I was just wondering what that
was like, maybe your first

00:38:32.037 --> 00:38:34.154
time around, and then what was
different this time around,

00:38:34.154 --> 00:38:35.760
because you had done
it before.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.790
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: The editing
process is really one

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:38.950
of my favorite parts.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.780
It is so interesting to see
the book that you meant to

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:47.630
write emerge from all the
junk that you take out.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.770
You asked about my first book.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:51.390
When I wrote "Prime
Time," I took--

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.110
do we have time?

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.460
What's our timing?

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:53.910
We're OK.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.400
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: OK.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.250
When I wrote my first book, I
took the disk that the book

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.470
was on to the Kinko's--

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.320
this is how long ago it was.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.470
I went to the Kinko's and
I said, could you

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:05.490
print this for me?

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.890
It's my novel.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.390
And the guy says, yeah, OK.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.960
And so just like in-- did you
see the movie "Sideways?" And

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.030
so just like in "Sideways,"
I come back to get my book

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.770
later, and I said, I'm here
to pick up my printing.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:22.390
And the guy says, oh, you're
the one with the novel.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.460
And I thought, oh, he read it.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.070
He read it and he loves it.

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:27.230
So I said, yes.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.220
So he says, OK, here.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:31.070
And he bends down and he picks
up a ream box and puts it on

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:31.600
the counter.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.610
I said, OK, thank you.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:33.920
And he goes, no, wait.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.080
And he bends down and picks
up another ream box.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.100
It was 723 pages long.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:43.130
You know, a book can be
like 322 pages long.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.440
I was such a newbie that I
hadn't numbered the pages,

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.360
first of all.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.440
So in answer to your
question--

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.630
finally--

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.240
I had to cut 400 pages
from my book.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.870
I had to cut 400 pages.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:02.750
And that was the most
educational, fabulous,

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:07.330
wonderful experience that I've
ever had in writing, because

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.100
it made me question every single
word, every single

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.330
scene, every single idea
that I had in the book.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.400
So I went through and I asked
myself, why is this here?

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.430
Why do they say this?

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.110
What it this scene for?

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:21.520
What is this paragraph for?

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.100
Why did I choose this
particular word?

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.130
There are 10 words here.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.600
Can I make it into one word?

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.300
What's the concept of
this entire page?

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.420
Can I take this one page and
make it into one word?

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.730
Do I really need it?

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:36.280
Do I need it at all?

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.750
And that editing process, I
mean, I just got goosebumps

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.900
thinking about it.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.930
When you're writing and your
brain just sort of flows

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.660
sometimes, you're just going
to put stuff down that's

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.220
vamping and transition.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.370
When you go back and look at it,
when you go back and look

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:55.310
at the editing, you see what's
derivative, you see what's

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.670
stupid, you see the parts where
you thought, oh, I'm

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:59.950
such a good writer-- and that's
the part that's got to

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.310
go, because you know, that's
just showing off.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.620
You see what's repetitive.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:07.420
You see what's unintentional,
see what's tangential.

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:12.010
I cut everything that wasn't the
story, is what happened.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.280
I cut everything that
wasn't the story.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.290
And when I saw what was left,
that was fabulous.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.910
So the difficult part for me is
writing that first draft,

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.330
and I just power through
and write the story.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.950
And then I go back
and look at it.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:31.290
Using the skills that I learned
in my first book, I

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:33.350
try not to write that
stuff now anyway.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:36.480
So my stories don't turn out
to be 700 pages long.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.005
But they're always, you know,
10,000 words too long.

00:41:39.005 --> 00:41:42.740
And I generally have to
cut 10,000 words.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.720
And it's wonderful.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.680
It's like making a statue, and
you cut away the parts you

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.650
don't need, and then
that's what left.

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:55.260
I have a wonderful editor now,
who as I'm writing, I'm

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.120
writing for myself, and then
I'm writing as her.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.540
You know, I think, what would
Kristin say about this?

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.610
So I use what she's taught
me too, to make a

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:05.650
difference in the book.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:08.270
But I know that shorter
is always better.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.780
Cute never works.

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.594
And just tell the story.

00:42:11.594 --> 00:42:14.014
Is that what you mean?

00:42:14.014 --> 00:42:14.982
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:14.982 --> 00:42:18.790
I also wonder, sometimes, if
there was things like you find

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:22.400
the deleted scenes at the end
of movies sometimes, the

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.320
scenes that they pulled out
because they just didn't work.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.820
But sometimes those are the
director's favorite.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.300
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Yes.

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.380
AUDIENCE: And so I wonder, did
you go through that process,

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.190
where some of you favorite
parts of the

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.910
book, you had to cut?

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:34.380
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: I
love deleted scenes.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.680
I love deleted scenes.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.810
I watch them all the time,
because I do think, just as

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:42.000
you say, that they give a
fresh look at what the

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.130
director was trying to convey.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:46.350
But you know, when you're in a
movie and you're kind of going

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:49.440
like this and trying to
see what time it is?

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.010
That's what I do in
my books, too.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:53.940
I think, I love this, but
people are going to be

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.980
thinking, you know, maybe
I should make dinner.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.550
I don't want your attention
to stray.

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:04.890
But I'll tell you, unlike
fabulous directors whose

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.180
deleted scenes are so fabulous
that they leave them on the

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:11.530
DVDs, when I cut a scene, part
of the power of cutting is I

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:12.510
think, I have this.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.170
I've written this.

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:16.430
I can keep this, and I can
use this another time.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.495
So I'm not making
it disappear.

00:43:19.495 --> 00:43:22.130
I'm just moving it
to another place.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:23.700
And when I go back and
look at them later,

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.750
they're just awful.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:25.700
It's awful.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.635
They're terrible.

00:43:26.635 --> 00:43:27.600
It's nothing you
would ever use.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.280
I think, how could I ever
have written this?

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.340
How could I ever have thought
this was good?

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:34.920
So my deleted scenes
are better deleted.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.390
But I love to find them.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.645
There's the power in finding
what's wrong.

00:43:38.645 --> 00:43:39.280
You know what I mean?

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.990
There's the power of finding
your mistake and recognizing

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:45.610
that, and having the nerve
to take it out.

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:47.690
And then at the end,
you think, yay.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.860
It's better now,
and I did that.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:51.660
That's education.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:52.660
That's learning.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:53.360
Yes.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.857
AUDIENCE: You seem
very positive

00:43:54.857 --> 00:43:55.855
about your entire career.

00:43:55.855 --> 00:43:58.849
And I always thought that an
important part of being an

00:43:58.849 --> 00:44:00.845
investigative reporter would
involve making a lot of people

00:44:00.845 --> 00:44:02.342
very angry at you.

00:44:02.342 --> 00:44:02.841
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: Yes.

00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:05.093
AUDIENCE: Wanting to sue you,
or even just throw you off a

00:44:05.093 --> 00:44:05.350
bridge somewhere.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.408
AUDIENCE: Yes, indeed.

00:44:06.408 --> 00:44:08.144
People have--

00:44:08.144 --> 00:44:08.720
throw me off a bridge.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.080
That's a good idea for a book.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:11.460
Yes.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.050
I've had a lot of people be very
upset with me and very

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.100
angry with me.

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.610
I've gotten a lot of threats--

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.410
threats of violence, threats
of lawsuits.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.196
I've never been held at
gunpoint, like Jane is.

00:44:21.196 --> 00:44:23.000
But I have had people
come to my house.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.740
I have had people send
me nasty letters.

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.620
I've had many threats
of violence,

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.630
many threats of lawsuits.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:31.430
People say to me, people who
are in my stories say, how

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:32.580
could you do that to me?

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.290
How could you do that?

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.250
You wrecked my life.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.160
How could you do that?

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.345
And I say, I didn't
do anything.

00:44:38.345 --> 00:44:39.320
You did.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.810
I just told.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.020
And that's a different deal.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.080
And I am so careful--
knock on wood--

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:45.500
Formica.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.670
And I'm so careful
to be right, if

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:49.620
you know what I mean?

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.480
The stress of being an
investigative reporter not

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.760
only has to do with coming up
with a good story, but in my

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.540
job I can never be wrong.

00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.110
I can never be wrong.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:01.270
I can never make a mistake.

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:02.470
I could never be
a minute late.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:04.010
I can never choose
the wrong word.

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:05.180
You know what I mean?

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.680
So that's a lot of pressure.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.520
And so when my stories are on
the air, they're right.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.460
I feel like I need to
touch Formica again.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.690
They're right.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:18.180
And so I don't feel
bad about making

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.840
someone's life miserable.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.690
When was the last time you
heard a quote like that?

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:23.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.790
Because I didn't do it.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.960
They did it.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.350
And also, the thing about
being an investigative

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:31.520
reporter for television is
that when you're out on a

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.760
story, I have a photographer
with me, right?

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.690
So I say to him, if it looks
like somebody's going to haul

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.740
off and hit me, make sure
you're rolling.

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:41.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:42.290
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: You know?
'Cause who's going to hurt a

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.760
reporter when it's going
to be on tape?

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:49.880
So I'm laughing now, but I
take it very seriously.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:52.470
And when I'm in my
reporter role, I

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:53.750
take it very seriously.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:54.810
I do a lot of research.

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:56.080
I do a lot of homework.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.060
I'd do a lot of soul-searching,
actually.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.890
I use the Chip Landman rule.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:02.700
My brother's name
is Chip Landman.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.620
And I say to myself, if someone
were doing a story

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.210
about my brother, would
I think that what

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:09.340
I'm doing is fair?

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.570
Do you know what I mean?

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:16.230
I try to put myself in the shoes
of a person who's being

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.680
targeted in a story, and I see
whether I would think, if

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.290
somebody did it to my brother,
would it be fair?

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.075
And if yes, then I just do it.

00:46:24.075 --> 00:46:27.520
That's my job as a reporter, to
reveal when something bad

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.160
has happened.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.180
But I try--

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.530
in television, I know you've
heard this, but it's called

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.450
compassion fatigue.

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:40.640
And it's very prevalent among
reporters who've been

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.620
around a long time.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:43.275
You just start thinking,
oh, I don't care.

00:46:43.275 --> 00:46:43.660
I don't care.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.470
Just go away.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:47.100
So I work very hard
not to have that.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.740
I work very hard to respect each
person who comes to me,

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.900
to respect each story that comes
to me, to listen to each

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.660
person who comes to me, and
to make the best and most

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.910
honorable decision that I can,
knowing that I have this huge

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.850
responsibility.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:08.020
And a little bit of power to
change the world a little bit,

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:09.375
if things go right.

00:47:09.375 --> 00:47:12.730
Does that answer
your question?

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:13.884
Yes.

00:47:13.884 --> 00:47:16.219
AUDIENCE: It seems like you
live in two worlds.

00:47:16.219 --> 00:47:18.614
You live in the fiction
world and you live in

00:47:18.614 --> 00:47:19.358
this reality world.

00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:21.838
And you know, in the fiction
world, you can create

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:22.334
characters.

00:47:22.334 --> 00:47:24.070
Is there sometimes the
temptation, as you're putting

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:27.838
together a story, to, you know,
maybe present things a

00:47:27.838 --> 00:47:29.837
little differently to make
your story better?

00:47:29.837 --> 00:47:31.690
Or how do you balance that?

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:33.030
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: You're
asking whether there's a

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:35.630
temptation to tweak the
story a little bit to

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:36.930
make the story better.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.500
No.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.170
I mean, no.

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:42.830
I mean, one of the
things that's

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:46.400
wonderful about reality--

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.700
you can just write all
this stuff down.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.550
One of the things that's
wonderful about reality is

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:53.790
that it's always fascinating,
it's always interesting, and

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:57.550
the realness of it is
what's compelling.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:00.960
And the realness of what people
say is better than

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.080
anything I could ever make up.

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:10.760
So no, I have no problem keeping
my absolute reality in

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.460
journalism separate from my
whatever-I-want-to-do

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.260
imagination in writing
fiction.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.980
I wondered, actually, initially,
whether my brain

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.200
would do it, whether my brain
could make stuff up.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.590
You know what I mean?

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:30.120
Because for the last however
many years, I've never made

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.100
anything up.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.280
I never--

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.190
I create how something looks.

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:38.880
I write a story, and I'm in
the booth with the video

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:44.320
editor, making a little movie
with graphics and effects and

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:48.120
sound and music, and it's
a little movie.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.840
So I'm creative, but what's
true is true, and

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.060
what's real is real.

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.780
And I wondered if my brain would
let me make stuff up.

00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:00.145
I was happy to realize
that it did.

00:49:00.145 --> 00:49:02.061
Yes.

00:49:02.061 --> 00:49:04.935
AUDIENCE: You sound kind of
like a prosecutor to me.

00:49:04.935 --> 00:49:06.851
Your husband is a defense
attorney.

00:49:06.851 --> 00:49:08.770
How does that work?

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:09.840
HANK PHILLIPPI RYAN: She's
saying, I sound like a

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.740
prosecutor, and my husband
is a defense attorney.

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.920
How does that work?

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.800
I never thought of myself
as a prosecutor.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.770
I see why.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:22.190
I look at myself as defending
the little guy, rather than

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:24.680
prosecuting, rather than going
after the bad guy.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.980
I look at myself as the
person who stands up

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:27.605
for the little guy.

00:49:27.605 --> 00:49:29.110
I'm trying to make
the system work.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:30.770
I'm trying to make it be fair.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:33.560
When I was growing up, I
would say to my mom,

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.230
but that isn't fair.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:36.940
And she's say, the
world isn't fair.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.370
And I would say, why not?

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:39.160
Why not?

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.650
And that's one of the reasons
I decided to be a reporter,

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:46.150
too, is that I wanted to make
the world be a fairer place.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:49.430
So I look at myself as
a defense person too.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:51.020
I do go after the bad guys.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:52.580
Certainly I do.

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:57.850
But I do that for making the
world be a better place.

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:02.160
My husband is a really wonderful
civil rights and

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.190
criminal defense attorney.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:07.880
He represented Muhammad Ali in
the Supreme Court in his

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.160
conscientious objector case,
and has done a lot of

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.080
wonderful work.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.380
So it's wonderful to have
in-house counsel.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.610
That's what's good about having
a lawyer husband.

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.660
I can say, I need to keep this
guy in jail for another day.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.500
How would I do that?

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.600
How do I get a search warrant?

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.810
I need to keep someone
in custody.

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:28.010
What would a lawyer say?

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.130
What would a lawyer do?

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:31.090
Or what would the police say?

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:35.730
So having in-house counsel
is fabulous.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:37.930
My husband is also incredibly
supportive.

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:42.570
Incredibly hilarious.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:44.745
He read my first book,
page by page--

00:50:44.745 --> 00:50:45.910
I'll tell this fast.

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:47.680
Read my first book,
page by page.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.810
He read the first five pages.

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:49.520
I heard him laughing.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.240
I was so happy.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.540
I hid around the corner
to get the response.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.580
I'm so needy.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.980
So he reads the first five
pages, laughing.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.460
The next day, he reads the next
five pages, laughing.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.950
At about page 50, I'm hiding
around the corner, waiting for

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:04.110
my daily dose of approval.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:05.990
And I hear nothing.

00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:07.220
I hear nothing.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.740
So I came out, and I
said, oh it's bad.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.750
It's bad, isn't it?

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:11.550
I can't write.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:12.620
I should never have done this.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.070
This is a bad idea.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.390
It's terrible, isn't it?

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:18.740
And he says, sweetheart,
is something

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.680
going to happen soon?

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.160
So that was my first--

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.540
that was my first bit
of knowledge--

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:27.670
in a book, something
has to happen.

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:30.650
So that's what I learned after
all those years, that writing

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:33.200
a page-turning novel is
what I want to do.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.020
I'm so thrilled that
the second part of

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.120
my career is fiction.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.480
Thank you all very much
for being here today.

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.765
[APPLAUSE]
