00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:13.950
NIAMH GAFFNEY: I'm
a bit freaked out

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.750
because there's so
many people here.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.460
And I have a bit of a
confession to make--

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.450
I kind of got you all here
under false pretenses,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.110
because as much as
I would love to,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.540
I can't teach you how
to control change.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.106
No one can.

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:33.355
No, you can go if you want to.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:34.320
That's OK.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.036
But no one can.

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:36.660
And before Caroline
starts freaking out

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.300
about her P45 or
anything, I promise,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.640
there are things that we can do.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.160
But change impacts us
from the very second

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.530
that we're conceived.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.370
And most of the time,
we wouldn't notice it

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.200
then, but most of the time,
we don't even notice it.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.770
We are a child, until
one day we're an adult.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.510
We're young, until one day we're
not fit for Coppers anymore.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.080
And you, being in a place
like this, until one day

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.600
we're the person
showing people around.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.750
We're a high-flying executive
flying all around the world,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.050
until one day we're
claiming the pension.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.370
We're sick until one
day we're healthy,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.930
as anyone who's had the flu
recently knows all about.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.870
And equally, we're
perfectly healthy, living

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.690
our normal lives,
until one day we get

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.859
a diagnosis that change it all.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.400
And like I said,
most the time, we're

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.580
happy enough because we've
created this idea that

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.440
normality is no change.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.230
We don't notice the single
gray hair appearing.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.710
We don't notice those
small little bits and bobs.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.910
And then something powerful,
something unexpected,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.190
something unwanted happens,
and it changes all that.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.100
And we realize that normality
isn't all of these changes.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.490
Normality is change.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.020
Normality is all of that.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.251
I just want to show you--

00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:05.500
I talk too much, but actually,
it might be easier just

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.700
to show you guys.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.410
If you close your eyes for a
second and find your pulse--

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.410
for anybody who doesn't
know where the pulse is,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.870
it's in your neck or in
your wrist or in your heart.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.470
But find it.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.560
And I can assure you,
it's definitely there.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.090
As you feel it, close your
eyes and see in your mind's eye

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.109
the graph that it's making, the
ups and downs, ups and downs.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.900
And if you're on this
side of the audience,

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.054
guaranteed it's going an awful
a lot faster than normal.

00:02:33.054 --> 00:02:35.220
But then just take your
hand away for a split second

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.920
and continue to see that graph
and just see it fading out.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.866
See it, those ups and
downs, smoothing out.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:44.550
It's all normal.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.990
It's all calm.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.120
It's all controlled.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.800
But there's not much
life going on there.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.380
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is what I can help you with.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.640
Because normality isn't
a place that we all

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.720
run to when we try to get back
to normal after a big change

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.130
happens.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.420
Normality includes
all of that change.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.620
Normality is where we have
to take those changes.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.270
We have to do
something with them.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.700
We cannot avoid them.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.650
There is no such thing
as going back to normal.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.210
You take it all with you.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.230
And I've just realized, because
I'm thinking about my own heart

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.530
rate, that I've forgotten
the lovely images that

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.330
go with that.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.680
But what I want to show you
is that-- and does anybody

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.650
recognize this quote?

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.580
And anyone who does
is kind of going,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.390
I'm not admitting
that I recognize that.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.924
It's-- yeah, I know.

00:03:41.924 --> 00:03:43.340
I'm giving up all
my secrets here.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.670
But it's from Harry Potter, that
well-known point of reference.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.080
But it's so true.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.500
No matter what happens,
there is always something

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.740
that you can do-- always,
no matter what it is.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.920
And it's all about taking
that bit of control,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.570
reaching out, and
turning on the light,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.050
no matter how awful your
experiences and your changes

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.820
may make you feel.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.790
So I know it's not normal
to open your laptops

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.110
and things like that here.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.149
But what I'd like us
to do, rather than just

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.649
you guys sit back
and listen to me,

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.780
I'd like us to use
this as an opportunity

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.150
to create solutions
for whatever changes

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.190
that are going on
in your own life.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.700
The first part of that is
naming it, naming that darkness.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.310
So if you'd like to open your
laptops or a piece of paper,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.900
if you have it, or your phone,
and write down something

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.850
that you're dealing
with right now.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.540
You can write down a code name.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.160
If you haven't any paper
with you, if you can just

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.860
think about that and
bear that in mind as we

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.065
go through the exercises.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.930
Because what happens when we
are faced with this change

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.690
is we lose sight of the
fact that life is change

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.200
and we lose sight of
the fact that this

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.240
is what it's all about.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.980
And when that happens, we get
that feeling of out of control

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.480
and we crave for that
sense of normality.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.880
And to give you an idea of why
I talk about things like that,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.180
I suppose I'd better
introduce myself a little bit.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.540
Five years ago, I was worried.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.940
I had just had a little baby.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.150
I was on maternity
leave and I was worried

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.615
about going back to work.

00:05:43.615 --> 00:05:44.990
How would I be
perceived at work?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.610
What had happened with
the team while I was away?

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.670
Maybe I'd be overlooked
now for promotion prospects

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:58.504
because I couldn't commit in the
same way as I had done earlier.

00:05:58.504 --> 00:06:00.920
I was worried about the commute
up and down and the crush,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.450
and leaving at 5 o'clock,
thinking, god, maybe people

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.190
think I'm on a half day
when I leave at 5 o'clock.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:15.440
And then I got a diagnosis
of aggressive breast cancer,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.250
and I wasn't so worried
about the commutes

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.140
then at that stage.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.869
So what you can do
in those situations,

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:27.910
you freak out, as you do.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.720
You cry, as you do.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.901
But then there's no
way out but through it.

00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:33.150
You get on with the treatment.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.020
You do what you're told.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.270
You kind of give up those
choices and that control,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.550
and that's part of it.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.054
And you have to do that, because
there is only one way out,

00:06:42.054 --> 00:06:42.970
and that's through it.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.520
Well, I'm here today not in
spite of all those changes

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.800
and things that happened to
me, but I'm here because of it.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.490
I couldn't have stood in front
of you guys five years ago.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.750
I just couldn't have done it.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.750
I probably wouldn't have
anything to talk about.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.070
But that's beside the point.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.380
I suppose I just want
to impress upon you guys

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.060
that we run away a lot.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.930
We avoid a lot when we're
faced with scary changes,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.890
with traumatic changes.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.632
Because those changes can
range from being mild anxiety,

00:07:22.632 --> 00:07:24.840
if you're worrying about
asking someone out on a date

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.780
or asking for a raise, to
intense trauma, when you're

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.450
dealing with bereavement or
a life-changing diagnosis

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.270
or anything scary.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.381
However you experience
it is totally normal.

00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:40.380
That's the way you're
supposed to experience it.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.120
But trying to run away from it,
trying to find this normality,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.410
that doesn't work.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.660
And especially, I don't know--

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.909
I'm sure you guys have come
across it, where something

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:52.710
has happened and it's all over.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.330
And then people say, ah, great,
you can go back to normal now.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.440
The thing is, I couldn't go back
to my pre-cancer me, anymore

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.354
than I could go back to
my pre-motherhood me.

00:08:03.354 --> 00:08:04.020
I just couldn't.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.400
It's not possible.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:12.180
So when you see things like
human evolvement even--

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.844
is that the right word?

00:08:13.844 --> 00:08:15.510
Charles Darwin had
it right when he said

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.860
the survival of the fittest.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.790
We're not all walking
around on all fours anymore.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.980
We let go what we
needed to let go of.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.380
We took with us what we
needed to take with us.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.530
And we changed to make
it so that we can now

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.410
walk on two feet.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.620
Our whole skeleton has changed.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.280
And that's the point
of today's talk,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.140
because we can always
do three things.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.054
The first, we choose.

00:08:43.054 --> 00:08:46.160
We choose what's
important to us.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.880
The second, we change.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.060
We change our perspective.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.420
We change our position.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.530
And the third is we control
the actions we take.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:00.620
If you use all of those
three steps, no matter what

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.850
whirlwind picks you
up and pushes you

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.600
in a completely different
place, no matter

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.380
how change impacts you,
you can get on with it.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.180
And not only can
you get on with it,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.920
you can become who you need
to be and you can evolve.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.930
So the first step is
getting clear, then,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:25.110
on where we want to go
after these whirlwinds.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.760
And it's ironic
that I'm here today,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.330
because anyone who knows me
knows that, quite literally,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.250
the best thing that
ever happened in my life

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.870
was Google Maps.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.240
I know.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.230
It's ridiculous, but it has
literally gotten me here today.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.160
Because not only--
no, it's unreal.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.999
No matter how often, no matter--

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:51.040
I've forgotten what I was
going to say there now,

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.290
because I'm kind of thinking,
where did I park my car?

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.350
Really, I am bad at that.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:56.840
But, oh, yes, of course.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.730
The best thing
about it, the thing

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.396
I love about it is that not only
does it tell you where you need

00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:02.350
to go and how you
want to get there,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:05.910
it tells you where you are and
the direction you're facing in.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.490
It's incredible.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:13.330
And when I went through my
own thing that we all have,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.380
when I went through my own
whirlwind, I was totally lost.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.395
I wasn't the person I
had been before that.

00:10:20.395 --> 00:10:21.770
It frightened the
life out of me.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.660
And then I realized that
every single one of us

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.150
has our own internal GPS system.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.350
And we can call that
fulfillment or meaning or values

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.790
or whatever you want to call it.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.580
But what it boils
down to is this--

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.850
it's what is important to you.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.210
That's it.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.970
If you know what's
important to you,

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.450
and you know that,
and really know it,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.830
then every decision you
take, every step you take

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.000
is done with that in mind, and
it makes life so much easier.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.820
Because wherever that
whirlwind drops you,

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.720
you can find out where you
want to go, where you are,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.787
and the direction you're facing.

00:11:04.787 --> 00:11:07.120
It still doesn't help you
with where you parked the car.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.090
But that's by the by.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.790
So what I'd like you to do is
close your eyes for a second.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.120
We'll do a little exercise,
if everyone's OK with that.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.500
And at the end of it, hopefully
you'll get a real sense of--

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.110
a little sense of--
what's important to you.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.450
So close your eyes, please.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.760
And if I can ask you to take
a deep breath in and out.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:36.100
Deep breath in, and
breathe out fully.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.980
Deep breath in, and
breathe all the way out.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.350
Now, you will notice
the sounds in the room.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.590
But as you hear my voice, you
become more and more relaxed.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.800
You can feel the weight of the
chair supporting you, if you're

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.530
lucky enough to have a chair.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.030
And for those of you who
are standing, hold on.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.010
But you become more
and more relaxed.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:11.830
You are calm, safe, and relaxed.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.910
In and out.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.140
Now, I want you to imagine that
you have just been given one

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:27.150
week to live, just seven days.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.570
You feel the shock of hearing
that, the horror of having

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.600
to tell everybody you love.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.740
This is your last Friday.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.280
But you also begin to notice
that you have the freedom

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.450
to do exactly what you want.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.170
These are your seven days.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.700
These are your last seven days.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.740
You can choose what
you want to do.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.630
What is important that you do?

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.660
What is important that you say?

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.700
What message do
you want to leave?

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.232
What do you want to
do with the people

00:13:09.232 --> 00:13:11.190
you are going to choose
to spend the time with?

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:19.520
What is important that those
people remember about you?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.350
What would you be brave enough
to do that you're not already

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.800
doing?

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.910
Or perhaps, what would you stop
doing that you're currently

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.080
spending too much time at?

00:13:35.647 --> 00:13:37.480
Now I want you to think
about that challenge

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.800
that you wrote down.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.900
If you had seven days to live,
what would you do about it?

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.170
What's important about that?

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.370
In a moment, I'm going to
ask you to open your eyes

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.700
and just record down
one thing that you

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.880
can do about your
challenge now that you

00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.510
know what's important to you.

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.870
Take a deep breath in and out.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.070
And when you're
ready, open your eyes.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.560
If you can make a
note of those things,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.722
any thoughts that you have
about what's important to you.

00:14:15.722 --> 00:14:17.430
Maybe something you
didn't realize you're

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.540
spending too much time at.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.550
So what we've done there
is change your perspective

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.870
a little bit.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.660
And actually, that's
the second part.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.550
Because we don't see
things as they are.

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.070
We see things as we are.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.370
And we are all safe and secure
in our lovely little comfort

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.600
zone.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.980
And for as long as we
stay in that comfort zone,

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.390
we can only see things the
way we've always seen them.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.910
So when you try to
challenge those boundaries

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.630
and push out the edges of that
comfort zone a little bit,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:01.220
you start to
understand that there

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.410
are other solutions, other
ways of thinking about things.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.099
And that can help you get
solutions to the problems

00:15:07.099 --> 00:15:08.890
that you're facing, no
matter what that is.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.780
So it's very definitely
easier to blame whatever it is

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.990
and be a victim
of the situation.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.860
But actually, our
responsibility is to ourselves.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.980
To keep that line going up
and down on our heart rate,

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.760
we have to step up.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.254
You have to move out of the
place of being a victim.

00:15:32.254 --> 00:15:33.670
And one of the
ways we can do that

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.170
is to change our
perspective and get

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:39.024
a different insight, a different
way of thinking about things.

00:15:39.024 --> 00:15:40.690
So what I'd like you
to do is, everyone,

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.430
if you could just
bring to mind your most

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:45.190
positive relationship,
somebody that you look up to,

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.240
somebody whose advice you
take on and you actually hear,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.865
rather than just listen to.

00:15:51.865 --> 00:15:55.090
And have a think
about it and imagine

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.790
what they would do if they
were faced with your challenge.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.230
What would they do
if they were faced

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.940
with what you're
looking at, what you're

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.480
worrying about right now?

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.060
What would they suggest you do?

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.490
If something comes to mind,
make a quick note of that.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.670
Now, I'd like everyone
to stand up, please.

00:16:30.705 --> 00:16:34.810
And I'd like you to pick
somebody else in the room

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.320
and swap places with them.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.057
Have a look at them as you're--

00:16:39.057 --> 00:16:39.890
have a look at them.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.272
It's what they--

00:16:41.272 --> 00:16:43.256
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:08.590
Now, as you take their
place and as you sit down--

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.230
as you sit down in
their place, I'd

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.650
like you to look at that person
and imagine that you're now

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.730
wiggling your toes
in their shoes,

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.390
if you can stand
to imagine that.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.647
They might be a different
gender, a different culture.

00:17:22.647 --> 00:17:24.230
They might see things
a different way.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.396
They might be a different
managerial level than you.

00:17:26.396 --> 00:17:28.890
But guaranteed, one
thing's for certain,

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.800
is that they can see things
differently than you.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.982
How would they deal
with your challenge?

00:17:34.982 --> 00:17:37.440
What would they do if they were
faced with the thing you're

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.090
worried about?

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.100
Have a think about
that for a second

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.110
and see if you can come
up with one solution

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.730
that you wouldn't have
thought about when you're

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:46.854
standing in your own shoes.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.360
Do you get a fresh insight
from that perspective?

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.660
You can always go and stand
on the top of Everest.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.430
You can always--
well, maybe you can't.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.020
But all the astronauts
who've left this world

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.150
have come back with
a fresh perspective

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.340
and have changed their
whole lives as a result,

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.730
because they've seen things
from a different place.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.140
That's what you
guys are doing here.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.920
So look at the person whose
space you've just taken

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.950
and find out and challenge
yourself to think of one thing

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.650
that they would suggest that
they would do in your position.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.660
OK, go back to your seats.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.550
Go back to your places.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.840
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.740
And as you sit down this time--

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.480
as you sit down
this time, I'd like

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.500
you to age yourself 25 years.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.270
What would your older self
say about your challenge?

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.630
If you are 25 years
older, you've already

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.070
lived through your challenge.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.746
You've already asked that
person out on a date.

00:18:58.746 --> 00:19:00.120
You've already
asked for a raise.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.320
You've already dealt with
the cancer or the headaches.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.320
Or you've already done
your driving test.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.220
You've already managed to
live through that change,

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.670
and you've evolved and
changed as a result.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.650
What advice would your older
self give about the thing,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.487
about the challenge
that you're facing,

00:19:18.487 --> 00:19:20.070
the change that
worries you right now?

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.130
If there's anything that
you can gain from that,

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.760
please write it down.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.824
Or take a moment later
to go through it when you

00:19:29.824 --> 00:19:30.990
have time to think about it.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.270
So like I said, this
exercise creates

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.580
lots of just positive
relationships with yourself

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.340
and it shows you that there is
life outside your comfort zone.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.570
And it's a gentle way of
doing it, rather than having

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.060
to actually sit in
the consultant's chair

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.950
and listen to that news.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.990
Being pushed out of your
comfort zone like that

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.850
allows you to take
responsibility

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.940
for the situation and allows
you actually to gain control

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.380
over the situation.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:07.160
Because you then are able to
not only know what's important,

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.837
but you're seeing
different ways.

00:20:08.837 --> 00:20:10.670
And you're coming up
with your own solutions

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.560
to things, solutions
that aren't possible

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.630
when you're dealing with
the fight or flight response

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.280
that change can often cause us.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:27.450
My third step for
dealing with change

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.430
is the whole notion of control.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:37.370
Because there is always, always
something that you can do.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:41.560
The problem is, we're not in
the habit of thinking like that.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.550
Our brains are incredible.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.110
They are an incredible
tool of efficiency.

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.810
But if you've always
thought the way you think,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.452
you'll always get what
you've always gotten.

00:20:53.452 --> 00:20:55.910
And changing your perspective
and choosing what's important

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.620
are ways of challenging that.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.590
But no matter how much
you do that, unless you're

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:05.190
willing to step up, put
on your big girl pants

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:09.714
and get on with it and take
action, nothing will change.

00:21:09.714 --> 00:21:11.880
And you will continue to
be a victim of that change,

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.110
rather than the driver of it.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.250
So what I would like you to do
is to think of three things--

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.876
write them down, if you can--

00:21:21.876 --> 00:21:29.460
that you can do right now that
will further your challenge,

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.310
that will help you move
through that challenge.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.420
And those things can be as
simple as having a cup of tea

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.560
so that you can get the mental
space to think about it.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.880
We don't actually think about
things in a positive light

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.540
very often.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.500
We worry about things.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.541
We ruminate about things.

00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:49.190
But we don't actually think
it through in the same way

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.630
that you would
deal with a project

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.280
or spec out a new design.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.294
You only get one chance at this.

00:21:59.294 --> 00:22:00.710
It doesn't matter
whether you have

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:05.399
seven days to live or 70 years.

00:22:05.399 --> 00:22:07.190
But if you're not behind
the driving wheel,

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.600
it doesn't matter.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.600
You might as well be having
one of those flat lines.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.850
So there's two principles
to bear in mind

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.820
with the whole area of control.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.320
The first, like I said, is that
you can always do something.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.060
And I'll teach you
the three small things

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.970
that you can always, always do.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:31.090
They're kind of an emotional
first aid box, if you will.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.940
And the second thing
is that action actually

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.790
creates confidence.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.950
When we're faced with
an unexpected change

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.140
or an unwanted change, the
first thing that happens

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:41.920
is we're impacted.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.600
We feel we can do nothing.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.240
You feel that you're
out of control,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.580
that everything is
happening to you.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.310
And you have no confidence in
your ability to do anything.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.416
And a lot of the time,
you don't have any ability

00:22:54.416 --> 00:22:55.040
to do anything.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.380
I certainly couldn't come
up or dish out the chemo

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.270
that I had to get.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.170
So in that respect, yes, you
do give up a lot of control,

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.497
a lot of choices in
those situations.

00:23:07.497 --> 00:23:09.580
But the thing is you haven't
given up all control.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.140
You haven't given
up all choices.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:15.670
And the more action
you can take--

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.540
in the same way as a journey
starts with one step, the more

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.220
action you can take, the more
momentum you can build up,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.790
the easier the next step
becomes, the next step,

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.350
the next step.

00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.650
So if you're worrying about
asking someone on a date

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.760
or asking about a raise,
schedule a meeting

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.740
or send a text.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.290
Do one small, tiny thing
that gets the momentum going.

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.180
So if you can think--

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.800
I'm going to just
give you a moment

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.470
right now to think and
write down three things

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.930
that you can do as
soon as you leave here

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.140
that will further your change.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.450
Things that not only you can
do, but things that you're

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:57.950
committing to doing.

00:24:00.412 --> 00:24:02.620
If you can take a moment to
write those down, please.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:16.330
This exercise is
very, very good for--

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.510
and the physical act
of writing, actually.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:22.750
Writing even more so than typing
or jotting notes in your phone.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.250
The physical act
of writing has been

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:29.110
proven to be an action in itself
and can allow you the space

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.430
to get to the end of a thought.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.400
And if you can get to
the end of a thought,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.880
you're eliminating the space
that the worry can creep in.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.140
So the more and more
you write, the better

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:46.900
it is for your ability to
come up with those solutions.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.730
So I promised you
a few other things

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:58.170
to add to your "I can"
list, and the first

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.270
requires a little
bit of visualization,

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.590
if you don't mind once more.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:06.032
Don't worry, you're not going to
get a death sentence this time.

00:25:06.032 --> 00:25:08.490
But if you can sit with your
bum to the back of your chairs

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:12.306
or sit as comfortably as
you can be on the floor,

00:25:12.306 --> 00:25:14.430
I'd like you to put your
feet solidly on the ground

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.020
and wiggle your toes
so that you can feel

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.145
them connect to the ground.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.382
And feel your hands
heavy in your lap.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.230
And close your
eyes for a moment.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:41.600
I want you to breathe in deeply
to the count of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:49.306
And out slowly, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:25:49.306 --> 00:25:50.180
And breathe in again.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.190
And breathe out fully.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:07.170
Now, I'd like you to think about
your very worst day at work,

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.000
the worst day that ever
happened to you at work.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.030
Remind yourself what
you were wearing,

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.350
who was there with you.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.160
Remind yourself what
you could smell.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.230
What was going on?

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.080
What could you hear?

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.380
What words were being said?

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.610
Stay with that memory
just for a moment,

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.120
and put yourself
back in that position

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.240
of your worst day at work.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:48.350
And as you remember
that, I'd like you just

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.160
to notice the thoughts
that are coming up.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.161
Maybe they're the thoughts
that happened on that day.

00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.160
Perhaps you were feeling
you're not good enough.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.490
Perhaps you've been told
you're not good enough.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:03.920
Perhaps you're feeling you're
going to get caught out or that

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.580
your work isn't as
good as other people's.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.750
Perhaps you're noticing feelings
of anger, of disappointment,

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:20.840
shame perhaps, or maybe
guilt or regret or fear.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.870
Are people blaming you?

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.220
As you notice those
thoughts and memories,

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.430
I want you just to
notice the reaction,

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:37.480
your physical
reaction right now.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.330
Is your heart rate getting
a little bit faster

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.640
as you remember those feelings?

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.260
Perhaps you're
reminding yourself

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:50.320
of the knot in your stomach
or the crick in your neck.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.591
Perhaps your breathing is
a little bit shallower.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.390
This is your physiological
response to the fear,

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:02.070
to the anxiety.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.570
This is your flight
or flight response.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.410
But with your eyes
still closed, I'd

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.010
like you to take your
thumb and your index finger

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:16.450
and rub them together
ever so slowly, ever so

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:21.510
lightly, so that you
can feel the ridges

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.845
of your fingerprints.

00:28:24.845 --> 00:28:26.220
Perhaps you've
never even noticed

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.810
that you can feel them before.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:31.560
But you can feel every
ridge and every furrow

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.888
on your fingerprints.

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:40.120
Now, using your thumb and your
middle finger, do the same.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.920
How are they different?

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.126
Is there a difference?

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.430
What you notice right
now is that as you

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:57.780
do that, it's impossible
to think the thoughts

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.730
you were thinking earlier.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.190
As you concentrate on
finding those lines,

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.780
you realize you're not able
to do the two things at once.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.080
SPEAKER: We'll be through
with this problem any minute.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.530
NIAMH GAFFNEY: This could
easily be my worst day at work.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:20.150
But we'll get past that.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.340
OK, everyone's got
their eyes open again.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.420
But what I just want you
to notice, hopefully,

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:31.880
before you got interrupted
by whatever that was,

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.760
is that doing something
like that, that fingertip

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.470
mindfulness, if you like--

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.970
mindfulness is an
incredible thing.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.030
It's great.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:42.790
I hate it.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.040
I'll be completely honest.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.290
It's like, oh.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.730
I love the notion of it.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:51.012
I love the idea that I can be so
calm and in control of my life.

00:29:51.012 --> 00:29:53.220
And the reality is, it's
like, yeah, I'll do it once,

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.390
and then it'll be another week.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.890
And ah, sure, I'll
do a bit of that?

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.230
It doesn't work for me.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.080
And also, no matter how
good, no matter how great you

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.309
are at practicing mindfulness,
when you're freaking out

00:30:04.309 --> 00:30:05.850
because your boss
has just called you

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.400
in to talk about a report,
when you're worrying

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.270
about something, when you're
sitting in a consultant's chair

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:14.580
and you're worried
about the information,

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.810
you can't pop off and
do a bit of mindfulness.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.300
You just can't.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.670
So this is incredible.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.150
You can do it quietly,
you can do it quickly,

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:28.170
and it gives you the tiniest,
tiniest little bit of space.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:32.130
That's all you need to put
in place one of your I-cans.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.670
Because if you can do
that, then your brain--

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.920
what happens is
that your brain is

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.990
starting to open up
those pathways that

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.740
have been closed off to you.

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.450
When the fight or flight
response is triggered,

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.680
what happens is you literally,
literally cannot think.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.230
You can't think because all
of your mind's resources

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.340
are focused on the danger.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.670
And those parts
of your brain that

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:58.170
deal with the memories and the
creative solutions and things

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:00.720
like that, they're
literally blocked

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.660
by all the cortisol and the
adrenalin in your system.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.600
Doing this kind of
bypasses the fight

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.190
or flight response
for a split second,

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:09.510
and that's all you need.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:13.180
It gives you the space to think.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.960
So that is something that
you definitely can always do.

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.356
The next exercise-- and I'm
going to ask you to stand up.

00:31:23.356 --> 00:31:26.950
And I'm going to ask you
to go with me on this one.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.987
And believe you me, it's
better if everybody's eyes are

00:31:29.987 --> 00:31:31.820
closed on this one,
because nobody comes out

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.980
of this looking glam.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.020
What I'd like you to do
is just drop down anything

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.460
that you have your hands.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.070
And for the count
of 10, I want you

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:44.082
to squeeze every single muscle
you can as hard as you can,

00:31:44.082 --> 00:31:46.290
including your eyes, your
bums, your tums, your legs,

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.840
your toes, everything
for 10 seconds.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.710
Go, 1, 2--

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.330
I'm not seeing any eyes close.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:54.060
Everyone do it.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:32:01.400
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.090
And relax, shake it out.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:04.570
That was ridiculous.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.550
Do it again, as hard as you can.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.500
3, 2, 1, go.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.580
2, 3, 4, 5.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.980
You can definitely
do better than that.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.010
9, 10, and let it go.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.420
And we do it again.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:31.540
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9 10, and relax.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.870
You can definitely do better.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:33.440
Do it again.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:44.150
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.480
OK, one last time, go.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:55.370
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.260
OK.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.260
Do you feel the difference
in your muscles?

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.862
If you've been giving it
all in that, you will feel--

00:33:04.862 --> 00:33:06.140
[SIGH]

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.780
And that allows you to turn
off your fight or flight--

00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:13.020
blah, blah, blah-- the fight
or flight response, no matter

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.245
how ridiculous it seems.

00:33:14.245 --> 00:33:15.790
You can all sit
down for a second.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.309
This is an incredible
tool for insomnia.

00:33:24.309 --> 00:33:25.850
If you're dealing
with insomnia which

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.350
is driven as a
result of anxiety,

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.450
and you get that fizziness
that goes on in your muscles,

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.976
this is brilliant for that.

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:34.730
If you do it about
12 times, guaranteed

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:37.580
you're too knackered to
do anything but sleep.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.500
But you have to go all out.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.750
But equally, if you're--

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.790
OK, I'll admit to
being somebody who

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.360
can get myself quite wound up.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.000
And once you're in that thought,
you can't think of your way

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.310
out.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:53.020
That fizziness
can be dealt with.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.700
Anybody who loves your
boxing or physical exercise,

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.690
go and do that.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:58.565
That's what it's for.

00:33:58.565 --> 00:34:01.250
It allows you to
get more relaxed

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.540
and take advantage of that.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.660
But it's not always
possible to go and do

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.120
a spot of boxing or
dancing or running.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.199
But you can always take yourself
somewhere private perhaps,

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.230
and do that.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:17.270
And that allows you to get
rid of the adrenaline that

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.280
builds up in your muscles.

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.699
And by doing that, it gives
your body and the amygdala

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:28.010
the signal that the danger has
passed, rather than getting

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:32.840
stuck in a vicious cycle
of stress upon more stress

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.190
upon more stress,
which is what happens.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:42.320
The final thing that we can
do, and we can always do,

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.320
is-- like I said, action
creates confidence.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.759
So how about we get a
little confidence hack,

00:34:47.759 --> 00:34:49.550
something that will
give you the confidence

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.469
and fake it until
you can make it.

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:54.880
Now, I'm sure some of you
have heard this before,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.590
but I'd like you
to stand up for me

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:01.870
and give me your
inner superhero.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:07.440
If put your feet hip distance
apart and arms on your hips--

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.310
you can close your
eyes, if you want to.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.730
But I'd like you just to
think how incredible you

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:17.820
look in Lycra, how
brilliant it is to have

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.740
your own special superpower.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:25.140
What would your superpower
be, if you had one?

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.810
If you had that
superpower, how would you

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:30.632
deal with your challenge?

00:35:30.632 --> 00:35:33.980
If you can keep your head
up and your tummy tucked in

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.620
and really, really
feel that superpower,

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.890
feel how powerful
you actually are.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.100
Probably better to do without
putting your underpants

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.380
on the outside of your
tights, but go with whatever

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.080
you need to on that.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.160
So this has been
proven to increase

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.810
your testosterone levels.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:05.560
But it's also been proven to
decrease your cortisol levels,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:08.430
which is the very
hormone that's blocking

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.850
those pathways to the
memory banks and experience

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:16.240
banks of your brain during
the fight or flight response.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.630
So when you do feel
anxious about something,

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.160
it's very easy for us to say,
oh god, I couldn't do that,

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.390
or I won't do that,
or try and avoid it.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:29.070
If you can do something as
simple as this for two minutes,

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.140
you're allowing
yourself to boost

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.150
your feelings of confidence.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.700
But you're also
allowing yourself

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.760
to take that one action, to
take that one step to create

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.110
that momentum.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:43.560
You can all sit.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:45.350
And thank you for
going for it for me.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.450
These things are only
small tools, guys.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:55.360
Like I said at the start, I
can't help you control change.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.880
My god, I wish I could,
because I wouldn't wish some

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:00.490
of the experiences on anybody.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.460
Nobody wants to go
through the horrible stuff

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.920
that we go through in life.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.090
But we don't have a choice.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.850
Those horrible things are
as equal a part of our lives

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.580
as the gorgeous things
and the lovely things.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.470
You don't get to have
one without the other.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.340
So when we look at a
problem or a challenge,

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.120
we can often look
at what we can't do.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.720
And that's kind of where--

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.350
we have a habit of that.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.120
And what I'd like us to do,
even just in a small way,

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.960
is to stop moving in the
direction of reacting

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:35.110
to change, but actually
step forward into being

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.200
the driver of change.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:41.170
I'm here today, like I said,
not in spite of change,

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:42.930
but because of it.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:47.000
I've created a new normal.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.200
I've created a life
where I help people

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.880
deal with emotional and
mental difficulties.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.020
I'm here today not as a cancer
survivor, but as a mommy,

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.890
as a person, as somebody
who's just living.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.650
I think this is a great
quote because, to be honest,

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.190
that's the only way that
we can control change.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.180
It's not about
striving to avoid it.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.000
It's not about trying to stay--

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.620
going back to normal.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.100
It's about embracing
it, building the new,

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:23.840
choosing what you want,
adapting however you need to,

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.930
and going for it.

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.600
So every single day,
we're impacted by change.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.710
None of us are going
to change that.

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:33.540
But like I said, we
can change the victim,

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.740
or we can change the driver.

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.770
We can drown, or we
can surf the waves.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.960
But it's our choice.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.430
Sin é, thank you very much.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.180
And good luck with
the rest of your day.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.484
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:52.968 --> 00:38:55.070
SPEAKER: I just have a
few questions for you,

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.170
and then we've a
few minutes then

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:59.600
to move to audience
Q and A. Just

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.170
remember to wait until we
get a microphone to you

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:05.390
for the audience Q and A--
we've one on either side--

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.400
so that they can hear
you on the recording.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.760
So my first question is, these
different skills and techniques

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:14.510
that we can practice
that we've heard today,

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.760
we can practice them when
we're facing a challenge.

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:22.280
How often do we have to relearn
how we deal with change?

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:26.510
Does it become that, every
time we face a change, we are--

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.310
we're back at the
beginning again

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.110
in terms of our
reactionary responses?

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:33.500
Or with time, do these
techniques eventually

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.300
become almost the
automatic way that we

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:42.350
turn to when facing challenge?

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:46.470
NIAMH GAFFNEY: So the
answer is yes and no.

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.130
So the reality is,
is that we're great--

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:52.730
a brain, like I said,
it's a master illusionist.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:56.000
And it allows us to
believe that those ups

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.870
and downs of everyday life
aren't even happening.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.730
So we kind of form
into the habit

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:05.240
of doing things like
that and kind of thinking

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.270
of things in the same way.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.560
Tools like these are incredible.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.600
But it's actually--
the importance of them

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.510
is only when the
unexpected happens.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.880
And the unexpected,
by its very nature,

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.440
doesn't happen often enough for
us to create habits about it.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.730
We can improve, and we
can definitely get better.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:27.050
And you can get in the habit
of this notion of being

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.480
able to always do something.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.160
But actually, when
it comes down to it,

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.790
when something unexpected
or unwanted happens,

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:36.580
your reactions are
going to be the same.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.290
You can have your
anxiety and your trauma,

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:41.110
depending on what you're facing.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:42.960
And that is part of life.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.830
You can't not have that.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.260
So yes, they can help.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.750
But they can only help in the
aftermath of it happening.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.314
They can't help it not happen,
if that makes any sense.

00:40:54.314 --> 00:40:54.855
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:40:54.855 --> 00:40:55.550
Yes.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.210
Great.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.959
Another question I
wanted to ask you about

00:40:57.959 --> 00:41:00.450
is, in lots of
work environments,

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.900
and definitely in ours,
we face a lot of change.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:07.080
Do you notice that people
are more open or accepting

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:10.040
or respond more
positively to change

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.620
in one area over the
other, like their work

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.900
life over their personal life?

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:18.830
Or in general, do we deal
with them mostly the same?

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.620
NIAMH GAFFNEY: I think we deal
with them mostly the same.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.870
It depends on the
importance of them.

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:28.615
So if you are being told
you're being made redundant,

00:41:28.615 --> 00:41:29.990
for example, there
are people who

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:33.450
that doesn't matter to because
they've always been considering

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:34.730
of how to move out of that.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.930
It's not an issue.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.360
But there are people for
whom, let's say, the role

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.370
is a complete lifeblood.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.494
And so much other things,
what's important to them,

00:41:41.494 --> 00:41:42.700
depends on that.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.940
Then obviously they would have
a much greater reaction to that.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.910
My only caveat to
that, if you like,

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.720
is that sometimes
in an organization,

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:59.760
we feel we can't react
other than how people react.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.270
And that's why
there's a lot of--

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:04.727
and it's probably
not here as much

00:42:04.727 --> 00:42:06.060
as it is in other organizations.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:11.570
But there's a sense that you
can't be anything other than OK

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.500
with change at work.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.737
The reality is-- and that kind
of puts pressure on ourselves

00:42:16.737 --> 00:42:18.320
to deal with things
in a specific way.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.510
The reality is,
it doesn't happen.

00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:22.430
You're going to feel how
you're going to feel.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.596
And that depends on the
importance of the situation.

00:42:24.596 --> 00:42:33.470
But we kind of buy into the fact
that you have to be OK at work.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.970
Even no matter how
many times people

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.080
say it's OK to not be
OK, the reality is,

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.860
is that there's an expectation.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.490
So I suppose for people
here, be conscious

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.530
whether you're
reacting normally,

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.880
whether you're acting--

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.917
let me rephrase that.

00:42:47.917 --> 00:42:49.250
Be honest with yourselves, guys.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.480
That's it.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.660
Be honest.

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.150
You don't have to tell anyone.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:54.540
You don't have to share it.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.586
But at least you be
honest with yourself,

00:42:56.586 --> 00:42:59.210
because that's the only way that
you can take your next action.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.330
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:00.735
It'll catch up with
you eventually.

00:43:00.735 --> 00:43:00.980
NIAMH GAFFNEY: Exactly.

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.810
Sorry, a big, long-winded
response to your--

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:03.970
SPEAKER: No, a great response.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:05.760
And that brings me on
to my next question.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.900
And after this question, then
I'll go to audience questions,

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:12.770
so you can have
something in mind.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:18.000
Is there such a thing as
reacting dangerously to change,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.110
like having a dangerous
reaction to a change?

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:24.170
And what are maybe some
of the warning signs

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.980
that the person's
response isn't going

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.900
to be good in the long run?

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.180
NIAMH GAFFNEY: Well,
I can't answer that,

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.651
to be honest,
because everybody has

00:43:33.651 --> 00:43:34.900
their own reactions to things.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.390
And none of us know how
we're going to react

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.420
to something until it happens.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.450
Equally, I suppose
what we have to be

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:46.330
conscious of is our
conscious steps.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.900
So when I spoke
about taking control,

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.580
taking responsibility
of the situation,

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:57.830
if we have consciously
decided to react in a big way,

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:02.080
and that decision is made with
what's important to us in mind,

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.682
then it doesn't matter to anyone
else what that reaction is.

00:44:04.682 --> 00:44:06.640
But if it's a reaction
where we're running away

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.200
from something, where
we're trying to avoid it,

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.080
where we're not
facing up to it, then,

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.824
yes, that is a
dangerous situation.

00:44:11.824 --> 00:44:12.740
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:13.620
Great answer.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:17.200
Do we have any odd questions?

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.466
NIAMH GAFFNEY: I do a lot
of work with small teams.

00:44:19.466 --> 00:44:20.840
So as I kind of
mentioned myself,

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.730
that one of the big
worries, for example,

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.980
when people go off maternity
leave or long-term leave,

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.470
even as well as with sick,
is that so much happens

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:29.319
while you're off.

00:44:29.319 --> 00:44:30.610
So much happens for the person.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.026
They've changed
while they're off.

00:44:32.026 --> 00:44:33.700
But the team has changed.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.790
So there's often a lot of
alignment to be done there.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.420
And we can do that through
both training and then

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.360
individual support, as needs be.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.660
SPEAKER: So are there
any daily actions

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:50.670
that we can take that
would support us or help us

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.630
when we do face some
kind of big change?

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:55.570
Or is there anything to be
said for doing little things,

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.470
like taking a new route to
work or not always having

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:02.290
the exact same
breakfast every day?

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:03.980
Or will that help you at all?

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.070
NIAMH GAFFNEY: Well, for sure
it does, because that is exactly

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.111
like I was talking about.

00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:09.400
That is the change perspective.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.750
If you go on your bike
ride and you go out

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.080
into the forest
without a GPS, or if I

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:17.980
dare to drive without my
own GPS, you get lost.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.460
And you get through that.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:21.640
And it makes you
think how you would

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.240
react in those dangerous
or difficult situations.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.740
So yes, it is all about change.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.662
That allow you to
change perspective.

00:45:28.662 --> 00:45:30.120
The only thing we
can do is-- look,

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.860
everybody knows what
works best for them.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.120
I know mindfulness and
yoga doesn't work for me.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.640
I don't enjoy them.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.910
But there's so much to be said
for the gratitude journals,

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:44.430
for the mindfulness, for
whatever works for you.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:45.060
Do that.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:48.790
But I suppose a bottom
line to all of it

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:51.430
is to figure out
what's important to you

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:54.250
and take action towards that.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.740
Because once you know
that you can do that,

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.800
no matter what
life throws at you,

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.500
you can always adapt to that.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.580
SPEAKER: OK, great.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.640
And you said during your
talk that we don't see things

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.820
as they are, we
see them as we are.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.880
Which is-- it's a great line,
and it was eye-opening for me.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.770
But while I was
sitting there thinking,

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:19.570
it made me realize that this
would encourage us to look back

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.350
on our previous
reactions to change maybe

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:26.357
with a kinder point of view.

00:46:26.357 --> 00:46:27.940
Because we can be
quite-- like, do you

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.470
find that people can be
very hard on themselves

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:30.810
on how they dealt with change?

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:31.810
NIAMH GAFFNEY: For sure.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:35.560
We have an innate reaction
to, or an innate ability

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:39.880
to look on the dark
side, like never

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.810
look on the positive side.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:43.700
It's all, like, personal
bias and things,

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.520
but we never look at what we
did in the best possible light.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.820
And when you can treat
yourself with the kindness

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.040
that you would,
without thinking, show

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.510
somebody else in your life, it
changes the whole perspective

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.434
of things.

00:46:59.434 --> 00:47:01.600
I don't know, has anybody
ever been in an experience

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.294
where you felt that something
had happened one way,

00:47:04.294 --> 00:47:06.460
and then when you spoke
with somebody else about it,

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.620
they saw it in completely
different light?

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.730
That's the same situation.

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:13.300
You would never,
ever, ever treat

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.640
another person or
a person you loved

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:17.330
the way you treat
yourself in your head.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.329
You would never do that.

00:47:18.329 --> 00:47:19.720
You wouldn't dream of it.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.440
And yet we do it all the time.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.500
So when I talk about
being conscious of making

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:27.550
those decisions, you
can't stop those thoughts.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.310
There's no point even trying.

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.717
But you can challenge them.

00:47:30.717 --> 00:47:32.050
And that's one thing you can do.

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:35.380
You can always say, hold on now
a second, that's not even true.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:39.010
It's not true that I never
get to the right place

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:39.809
at the right time.

00:47:39.809 --> 00:47:40.600
It's just not true.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.516
I do, the odd time--
usually with Google maps,

00:47:42.516 --> 00:47:44.470
but that's beside the point.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.870
So you have to just be
kind in that respect.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.770
SPEAKER: We've got a
question at the front.

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:52.270
NIAMH GAFFNEY: The thing is,
all you can ever do-- no matter

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.370
what's going on,
all you can ever do

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:59.200
is let that person know that
you're there, no matter what.

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.110
But you're there being kind,
and you're there being brave.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.330
And you're there
to hold their hand,

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.820
metaphorically or literally.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.794
And that's all any of us can do.

00:48:09.794 --> 00:48:12.210
There's so many things that
you'd take away and you'd fix.

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.155
But actually, fixing it
doesn't resolve anything

00:48:15.155 --> 00:48:15.780
for the person.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.071
They're still dealing with
their version of the change.

00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:21.930
They're still dealing with the
things that they feel inside.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.610
And no matter what you say or
do, you cannot change that.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.790
And that's what I meant
when I said at the start,

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.370
I can't teach you how
to control change.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:30.040
I can't.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.260
No one can.

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:31.860
So, sorry.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:32.530
It's a great answer.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.530
I'm telling you nothing.

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:35.378
So--

00:48:35.378 --> 00:48:37.500
SPEAKER: And so this a
quick follow-up on that,

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.190
because we're getting
to close again.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.610
What are your thoughts
on the phrase--

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:43.735
and even I chatted about
this a little bit further,

00:48:43.735 --> 00:48:46.170
and I think you guys would
appreciate hearing it--

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.821
the phrase, "Stay positive?"

00:48:49.821 --> 00:48:52.704
"Keep your chin up."

00:48:52.704 --> 00:48:54.870
NIAMH GAFFNEY: I've heard
that phrase once or twice.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.270
Believe you me, the bald look
does nothing for me, right?

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.460
So when somebody says to
you, oh, you look gorgeous.

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.150
Be positive.

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:02.320
It's like, are you kidding me?

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.610
No, I cannot bear that phrase.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:08.954
But we say it all the time.

00:49:08.954 --> 00:49:10.370
There's two ways
of looking at it.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:13.200
The first is that it's
completely, completely futile

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.154
to be positive when
you're feeling rubbish.

00:49:16.154 --> 00:49:17.820
If you're feeling
rubbish, feel rubbish.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.070
If you're being sad or
you're angry, be angry.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:22.527
God knows it will
come out somehow.

00:49:22.527 --> 00:49:24.360
But the other side of
it is that, I suppose,

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:28.410
in terms of being kind and
changing your perspective,

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:29.790
people say things.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:33.630
They say things because they
don't have anything to say.

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:35.760
And it's a kind of a
way of trying to be

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.670
there to support somebody else.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.307
It's like, look, this might
make them feel better.

00:49:40.307 --> 00:49:40.890
I'll say this.

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:41.820
I've heard this said.

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.600
And it's a kind of a reaction.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.950
Some people feel so awkward
in those situations.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.110
God knows, I was at a
funeral there recently.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.270
And a lot of the people--

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:53.550
when you're sympathizing,
you don't know, let's say,

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:54.300
half the family.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.425
It's like, what do you say?

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:55.980
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:56.220
I'm sorry.

00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:56.690
I'm sorry.

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:58.731
And then you have that
connection with the person

00:49:58.731 --> 00:50:00.840
that you do know.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.844
You have to say something
in those situations.

00:50:02.844 --> 00:50:05.010
And that's where the "be
positive" often comes from.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:07.080
And it's from a good place.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.530
But, my god, if you find it
at the tip of your tongue,

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:11.160
just hold back.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:15.270
Think of another
way of phrasing it.

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.190
Encourage people, I
suppose, sometimes.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:20.230
I'd encourage people
to be how they feel.

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:22.290
If that's positive, great.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:25.625
If it's not, please don't
ask them to be positive.

00:50:25.625 --> 00:50:26.250
SPEAKER: Great.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:29.229
I think we have
one final question.

00:50:29.229 --> 00:50:31.020
NIAMH GAFFNEY: It's
funny that mindfulness,

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.960
for me-- and that's what I
meant by fingertip thing.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.830
It's just to give you
the breathing space.

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.420
That's the way I see it.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.150
So for me, I read.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:41.160
Sometimes when you're
going to bed at night

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.007
and you can't shut off, I--

00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:46.590
people who do gratitude journals
and mindfulness and all that,

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:50.150
it's brilliant, and
it works really well.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:51.210
I don't like it.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.610
It makes me anxious,
which defeats the purpose.

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:54.570
But I read.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.820
And then in the reading,
I can kind of switch off.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:01.560
It's like you can be
out of your own head.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.090
And it's just to stop
that craziness of thought,

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.910
that tornado that can go on.

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:07.460
That's one thing that I do.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.210
The other thing is
that sometimes you just

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.610
have to get on with it
and just say, OK, I'll

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.700
just do one thing, one
thing that you can do.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.190
And even if that one thing
is moving out and going

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.410
and getting a cup of tea,
or going outside the house

00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.310
for a walk, just whatever
that one thing is,

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.430
it could be the
tiniest little thing.

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:29.520
But once you feel that
energy, that movement,

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.750
certainly for me, that
helps me feel better.

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.080
It helps me feel that
I'm doing something.

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:37.299
I don't feel as much of a
victim of the situation.

00:51:37.299 --> 00:51:39.090
I'm using "victim" a
lot, but it's probably

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.980
the best word to
describe sometimes

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.990
how you feel in that situation.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.344
So yes, it helps you
just to do something.

00:51:45.344 --> 00:51:47.260
SPEAKER: That's a lovely
question to close it.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:48.100
Thank you for asking.

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:48.550
Thank you for everything.

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:49.290
NIAMH GAFFNEY: You're
more than welcome.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:51.081
SPEAKER: And thank you
for coming in to us.

00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:53.110
