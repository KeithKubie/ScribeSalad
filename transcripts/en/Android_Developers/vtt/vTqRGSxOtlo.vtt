[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.570
RETO MEIER: Hi there.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:06.910
My name is Reto Meier.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.220
RETO MEIER: And we're going
to be taking a look at the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.170
technology behind the Device
Profile Switcher Apps Tasker,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.120
NFC Task Launcher, and
Profile Widget.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.110
IAN NI-LEWIS: So stick around to
find out what features and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.600
technical tips and tricks it
takes to make a device profile

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.040
app today on--

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.700
RETO MEIER: "The App Clinic." So
we're going to take a look

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.320
at these three apps today.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.990
And they're all fairly similar
in what they're trying to do,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.290
which is excellent because it
makes it much easier for us to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.530
talk about the technology that
really makes them great.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's also great
because we really relate to

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.020
these apps.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.680
I think that these apps,
although they have an appeal

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.880
to everyone, I think everyone
would like the functionality

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.000
that these apps provide.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.420
But it turns out that the people
that actually use them

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.930
are mostly hackers and
software engineers.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.460
RETO MEIER: It's true.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.560
And that's actually something
which we're going to see as we

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.060
go through each of these apps.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.830
You can almost see who the
target audience ends up being.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.420
So I think much like the
evolution of most

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.110
technologies, and mobile phones
most recently, you

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.290
start off with something that
appeals to a geek crowd.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.420
And then if you create something
which just anyone

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.519
can use to make their life
easier, it's going to become

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.430
massively popular.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.630
So we're going to look at how
these apps are approaching

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.500
those problems and how we think
they can do a good job

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.560
of taking that one
step further.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.630
So we're going to start
off by looking at

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.480
the standard features.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.120
So these are the things that
all of these apps can do.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.200
And so this is basically the key
core functionality that we

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.020
would consider that you need
in order to make a device

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.460
profile switching app.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.410
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, let's talk
about what a device profile

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.430
switching app is.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.136
RETO MEIER: It's a mouthful.

00:04:45.136 --> 00:04:46.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: It is
definitely that.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.020
Well, it's just because
I call them task apps.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.290
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.370
Well let's call them
task apps.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what?

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.820
I don't call them anything.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.470
RETO MEIER: Maybe that's
the problem.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.040
You call them task apps and--

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: Maybe
they're auto apps.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.590
The thing about device profile
is, I think the terminology

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.480
comes from the idea of having
a device in a completely

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.050
different state for
certain things.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.610
And we certainly introduced that
concept when we started

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.920
looking into Docs.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.700
And the idea is you have one
profile when you're undocked

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.890
versus another profile
while you're docked.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.810
But these apps that we're
looking at today

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.470
go far beyond that.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.470
And I think it's almost hard
to talk about a specific

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.160
profile because there are
multiple overlapping things

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.530
that each app can do.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.130
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: But the core of
it is we're going to change

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.740
something in the system, or
possibly just do something in

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.870
this system when you execute an
action, when the conditions

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.030
of the system change.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.460
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.320
And so the idea here is that
rather than having a single

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.570
toggle, you're able to say I'm
at home, I'm at work, I am

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.060
entering a meeting, whatever
your profile case is.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.470
And execute a whole bunch of
different settings changes or

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.760
launch a bunch of apps, and as
Ian says, basically perform a

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.220
series of actions in relation to
that change in environment.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.290
So they can all change the
volume in ring tones, they can

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.230
all change brightness, they
can all modify your

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.290
connectivity settings as well.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.610
Some of the apps, I think Tasker
in particular, goes

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.400
significantly further
than that.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.460
But these are the core things
that I think anyone

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.310
downloading one of these
apps is going to want

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.610
to be able to do.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.400
Mute the volume, change your
ring tone, alter the screen

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.210
brightness based on time
of day or location.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: And in addition
to that, although it doesn't

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.170
really fit into the profile
idea, I think I would add

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.870
sending alerts and
notifications,

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.470
SMSes, things like that.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.240
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.500
OK.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.130
So these three apps.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.030
Like we said, they have these
things in common.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.300
I like to think of them as three
variations on a theme.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.070
And we're going to see this
as we go through.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.070
Tasker is kind of like
a self driving car.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.925
You spend a lot of time
setting it up.

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:51.360
And once it's going, you just
sit there and it does

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.560
everything for you.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: I wonder if that's
a really good analogy

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.280
or if it's going to resonate.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.190
Because while everyone can
understand the experience of

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.520
getting in a self-driving
car--

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.020
I mean, everyone's been
driven by someone--

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.340
only people like you and I know
what it takes to set up a

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.510
self-driving car.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.270
RETO MEIER: This is very true.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hours
in the morning.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.580
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.580
I know, right?

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:11.380
You've got to plug things in.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.300
We shouldn't go into.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.580
RETO MEIER: NSC Task
Launcher is kind of

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.930
like driving an auto.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.210
It does most of the hard work
for you, but you still need to

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.080
initiate the action.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.280
You still need to
do something.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.600
And you still have some
element of control.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.900
Profile Widget goes
the other way.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.650
You basically have to initiate
it yourself entirely, choose

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.260
which widget to click, which
profile you want to switch to.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.620
So you have to be conscious of
that rather than just being

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.570
able to use a particular
location.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.450
So let's talk a little
bit about what we

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.110
want from the apps.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.820
So we've talked about what they
can do, what they all

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.440
should do, and how they vary
at a very high level.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.820
So what are the things that you
want to see in an app like

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.120
this for it to be your go-to?

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I think the
most important thing that

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.750
I want is for it to be able
to control everything.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.090
I don't want any part of
my system to remain

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.800
untouched by this app.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.130
Now, of course, as we talked
about yesterday-- we had a

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.850
long conversation about
permissions and how wanting to

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.090
control everything imposes
some really interesting

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.630
restrictions and
responsibilities on the

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.810
developer of the app.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.990
But I want it to
do everything.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.320
I don't want there to be
anything that I can do to the

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.810
phone that this app can't,
because I want it to be an

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.420
agent or a proxy for me.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.920
I also want to make sure that it
can combine multiple events

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.530
and multiple actions with
multiple conditions, because

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.990
the sort of profile that I can
use to tell you that I'm at

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.250
work, for instance, unless
it's got machine learning

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.289
along the lines of
Google Now--

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.900
only next year's version
of Google Now--

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.730
it probably doesn't know
that I'm at work.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.410
It probably doesn't know
that I'm in a meeting.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.910
I need to be able to tell it
that, yeah, when I'm attached

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.560
to this Wi-Fi network during
these hours of the day, and

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.170
possibly some other conditions,
that's when I need

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.730
to be not disturbed.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.710
Or that's when I can accept
text messages.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.470
So I need to be able
to push all of

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.920
those into one container.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.080
And several of the apps that
we looked at have this

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.750
functionality, but only
in the pro version.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.233
So that's something
to look for.

00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:16.980
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now the other
thing that you need, I think

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.400
you mentioned, is these
things are really

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.330
difficult to set up.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.260
RETO MEIER: Yes, they are.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.520
And I think the core thing here
is that it's something

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.090
which if you describe the
functionality to people, it's

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.640
kind of obvious.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.920
And there's been things like
this built into mobile phone

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.230
operating systems for a
long time on and off.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.440
This notion of being able to
click a button, change a

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.710
setting, and you're at home, at
work, receiving calls, not

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:42.470
receiving calls.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.030
I think the challenge has always
been presenting this in

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.860
a way that just regular
people can use.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.850
At the moment--

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.690
and we'll see it varies for
each of these apps.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.140
But at the moment, you've got
that tendency to feel like

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.920
you're having to program
the phone, right?

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.150
And that's what you want
to get away from.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.850
So when we say easy to use,
what we mean is easy to

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.110
configure, especially.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.200
The actual use case, I think,
for all three is pretty

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.930
straightforward.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.940
But the configuration
is the trick.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.350
And so we really want to make
it as easy as possible.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.500
And that kind of relates
to the last point.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah there's
really two ways that you can

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.600
make this easy to use.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:21.110
You can either make it very easy
to program, which if you

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.330
figure out how to do
that, let me know.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.580
RETO MEIER: Yeah, that
could be [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: I used to program
games, and one of the

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.890
things that we would always say
is, boy, I don't want to

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:35.790
program all this game play.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.970
It seems like the designers
should be able to do that.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.380
And so multiple projects,
this happened to me.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.900
I wasn't always the one
calling the shots.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.780
But you make a scripting
language and give it to the

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.450
designers, and they're
like, oh thanks.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.830
And then they come to you
and say, hey, can

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.720
you write this script?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.530
And you realize, wow, I just
spent a huge amount of time

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.090
making this scriptable, and I'm
going to have to write all

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.800
the code to script it.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.330
And that's the feeling that
I get with these apps.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.590
For a software engineer or
someone who's used to thinking

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.570
in terms of code, these
are very easy to use.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.460
Some of them are more cumbersome
than others,

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.390
navigation-wise.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.850
Some of them are prettier
than others.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.780
But the concepts are easy.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.560
At the same time, for most
people, I think it's going to

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.150
be like programming a VCR, which
is, you want to do it.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.770
You know what you want.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.520
But you're never
going to do it.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.300
You're never going to figure
that out, right?

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.067
RETO MEIER: It'll one person
in the house who figures it

00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:28.810
out, and that's it.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:29.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.110
RETO MEIER: They're the go-to.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.350
Can you set up the--

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, one person
in the extended family, and

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.760
you don't want to be that guy.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.815
RETO MEIER: You do not
want to be that guy.

00:11:34.815 --> 00:11:37.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: So let's take
a tip from the VCR world.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.730
You remember that this was very,
very difficult until

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.360
things like TiVo came along.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.250
And what they were doing was
leveraging the information

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.730
that was on the internet or
in the community to help--

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.540
instead of saying, I want to
program this amount of time,

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:54.710
you could say, yeah, I want
to watch this show.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.440
RETO MEIER: Yeah, which
is always what

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.150
you want to do, right?

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.190
No one just randomly wants
to record half an hour of

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.980
television sometime
on Friday night.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.720
There is a thing.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.920
There is something on that
they want to record.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Usually, yeah.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.580
RETO MEIER: Generally.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: So it turns out
the best way to solve this is

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.300
to have a community repository
so I can go to the internet

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.760
and say, oh yeah, someone else
had a problem where they don't

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.180
want to receive alarm
notifications between 10:00 PM

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.890
and 6:00 AM.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.340
And yet they still want their
clock to be able to

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.700
send them an alarm.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.910
And I pull down that code and
install it into the task

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.460
application that I'm using.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.060
And boom, I got what I wanted.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.050
And I didn't have to learn
how to program the thing.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:41.080
So the ease of use is important,
but you can get

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.610
away with less ease of use if
you have a better repository

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.815
of community scripts that people
can very easily browse

00:12:47.815 --> 00:12:48.860
and install.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.340
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.750
And this gets to one of the
points which we tend to make

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.890
again and agains-- it's one of
these recurring themes--

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.510
is you want to make it really
easy for people to see the

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.990
value of your app within
the first 30 seconds of

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.220
installing your app.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.730
So if they can press a couple of
buttons as soon as the app

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.040
is open and say, ah.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.120
Oh, OK, cool.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.985
So this is now going to mute my
volume after 9 o'clock at

00:13:09.985 --> 00:13:13.444
night, before 6:00 in the
morning and maximize my alarm.

00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:14.290
That's perfect.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.330
That's going to be
useful for me.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.780
I can use this right away.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.740
And it gets their minds thinking
as to how else

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.460
they're going to use it.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.540
If all you're presenting them
with is a blank canvas, hit

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.190
plus to create a new action
and then you've got this

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.310
massive array of controls for
virtually everything, if the

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.000
app is doing the right
thing, it's daunting.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.010
It's like, I don't know how I
would even want to use this.

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.730
And they'll move on.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.620
So make that initial action
of learning the app and

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.805
understanding how to use it as
simple and easy as possible,

00:13:41.805 --> 00:13:42.980
and you'll get a lot of
mileage out of that.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: So let's take a
trip to the top of the power

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.110
curve and possibly the
bottom of the ease of

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.702
use curve with Tasker.

00:13:52.702 --> 00:13:53.040
OK.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.340
As you know, a feature graphic
is a great way to grab

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.210
people's attention and let them
know in a nutshell what

00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.270
your app is about.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.505
And Tasker doesn't have
a feature graphic--

00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:02.340
RETO MEIER: No it doesn't.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:02.920
That's unfortunate.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which
is very sad.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.260
So I've gone ahead and tried
to take the liberty of

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.590
creating a quick mock up.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.710
I'm not an artist, and so this
doesn't have the flair of,

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.240
let's say, a Roman
Nurik design.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.850
But I think it captures almost
perfectly what the average

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.794
user can expect when
they start Tasker.

00:14:22.794 --> 00:14:23.232
Yeah.

00:14:23.232 --> 00:14:23.670
You like that?

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.460
RETO MEIER: That's
pretty good.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.330
It's got glow, it's got big
text, which you like.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.020
Yeah, I think it's
representative.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.130
And a beautiful photo.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:32.690
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: Only 14 iStock
photo credits.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.000
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: The point that
I'm trying to make--

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.550
I'm being a little
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.870
It's just like an airliner.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.210
It might be the best way to get
you where you want to go,

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.990
but there's a good chance that
you're not actually qualified

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.720
to take the wheel and
fly it yourself.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.900
And I think that's the way most
people are going to feel

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.730
about Tasker.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.030
RETO MEIER: That's the
thing about Tasker.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.790
It is an app which
does everything--

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.020
literally everything-- but it is
a little like sitting down

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.630
in the console of a 747 the
first time you open it up.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Bingo.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.670
RETO MEIER: So you spent a
little more time looking at

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:03.560
this app, didn't you?

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.700
It's a great app.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.750
And oh, yeah--

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.390
RETO MEIER: Let's
switch sides.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Look at that.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.742
Yeah.

00:15:12.742 --> 00:15:13.730
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.940
All right.

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.310
So Tasker is tackling a
really difficult job.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.760
The mission of the Tasker app is
to let you define what your

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.600
phone does in any specific
set of circumstances.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.750
And it wants to let you define
those circumstances as

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.270
precisely as possible and give
you as many things to do in

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.190
those circumstances
as possible.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.650
So for instance, you might want
to turn off Wi-Fi when

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.340
you leave your house, or turn
off Bluetooth when your

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.990
battery gets low, or
even-- and this is

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.860
something Tasker can do--

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.780
automatically respond to
text messages when

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.460
you're in the car.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.540
It sends a little text saying,
sorry, I'm driving.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.800
I can't respond to you.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.870
Which I think is awesome.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:56.540
RETO MEIER: That's very nice.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.790
Yeah.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: I actually
used Tasker for

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.910
several months myself.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.620
I don't think I'm as big of a
fan of these apps as you are.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.700
I have no idea why.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.760
I think it's just because I have
very irregular habits.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.810
RETO MEIER: I think that's the
key to these apps, is they

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.480
presume that you are going to
want to respond to the same

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.520
situations in the same way.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:19.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.940
RETO MEIER: At the same
general time.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:30.030
Whereas I am irregular, lazy,
and sort of odd in my habits.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.000
RETO MEIER: You're
a free spirit.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right, exactly.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.840
And you're practically
British.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.360
So depending on where you're
coming from, you'll have a

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.870
different experience
with this.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.410
But there was a time in my life
when our dear employer

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.520
decided to turn on alarms for
all calendar invites that came

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.710
from our corporate email center,
which meant that we

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.440
got alarms set on all of
our holiday reminders.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.900
You'd get woken up at midnight,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.050
going, oh, it's midnight.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.950
It's Christmas Eve.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.900
Don't forget to sleep
in tomorrow.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.770
That was a good time.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:07.490
So I specifically used Tasker
to just turn off calendar

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:12.369
notifications between 11:00 PM
and 1:00 AM, and that worked

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.079
out pretty well.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.410
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: But when you
think about it, Tasker's

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.240
really offering an environment
for programming your phone.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.579
So it's not surprising that most
of the people that love

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:28.310
this app are software engineers,
and using it feels

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.970
like software engineering.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.960
In fact, you can actually write
Android apps in Tasker.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.150
We're not going to cover
that functionality.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.930
That's for a different time when
we talk about on-device

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.230
IDE's someday.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.310
RETO MEIER: That would
be a fun one.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: So it's a very
powerful program, and this is

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.900
really the problem.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.100
With great power comes great
usability issues.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.920
My complaint with Tasker,
though, is

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.960
not that it's difficult.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:53.980
I expected that.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.150
It's that it's more difficult
than it has to be.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.860
So let's switch to
the giant phone.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.790
Oh, and we can swap places.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.480
RETO MEIER: We're going
to swap back.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.120
RETO MEIER: This is getting
a little crazy.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.660
RETO MEIER: You're going to trip
yourself over my cord.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: I said wireless
mics, and everybody said no,

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.760
that's crazy.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.290
And I said, I'm buying them
anyway, and then they sucked,

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.000
and everyone went, OK.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.870
RETO MEIER: So now after last
week's issue, some people said

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.730
that we shouldn't use
the giant phone.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.680
They said that it's too much
phone for us to handle, that a

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.970
smaller, more discreet phone
might suit us better.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.180
To them I say, witness the power
of our fully operational

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:32.990
giant phone.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which I can
handle just fine.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:37.330
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.070
Well, that's disturbing.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.032
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:18:40.032 --> 00:18:44.180
So leaving aside the issues that
we have with navigation,

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.530
legacy buttons, and just
general Android design

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:53.420
guideline issues, let's just
focus on the meat of Tasker.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.700
Let's actually define a task.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:01.890
So when I start up, the first
thing I see is three tabs, is

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.160
Profiles, Tasks, and Scenes.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.170
Now as a user, I'm thinking
to myself, OK, I know

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.360
I want to do tasks.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.820
At least that's what
I thought.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.250
Right?

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:12.510
RETO MEIER: Sure.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.780
It's Tasker, right?

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now I think that
other people might say, oh, I

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.720
want to define a
profile, right?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.090
It depends on how
you look at it.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.530
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:20.350
I think it depends on how
familiar you are with the

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.736
programs and the terminology
that goes around it, because

00:19:23.736 --> 00:19:25.600
it's not always obvious
to me what's a task

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.030
and what's a profile.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:27.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:34.770
Now it turns out in Tasker, a
profile is a set of contexts

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:36.540
that contain tasks.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:36.950
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:37.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now you'll
notice there

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.900
is no Context button.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.090
Instead, there is a Scenes
button, which actually sounded

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.990
like a content.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.850
Like oh, maybe if I'm in this
scene-- perhaps I have become

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.110
an actor in the scene.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.990
When I exit stage left.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.780
RETO MEIER: Are we all not
actors on the stage of life?

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: I will be
pursued by a bear.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.390
So, acting.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.770
So I immediately went to Scenes

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.440
because that made sense.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.310
Now it gives me a helpful pop
up, which essentially says,

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.210
please do not press
this button again.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.430
RETO MEIER: Wait, why did
you press the button?

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.070
Stop pressing it.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.690
But it turns out that Scenes are
actually the GUI designer

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.860
for writing your own
applications in the Tasker

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:21.790
design language.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:22.880
RETO MEIER: That's
kind of cool.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: It is cool.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.660
RETO MEIER: While you've got
that up as well, what I wanted

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.495
to point out, A, modal
dialog-- please

00:20:27.495 --> 00:20:28.455
don't do modal dialogs.

00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:28.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.900
RETO MEIER: Particularly when
it's a modal dialogue popping

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.460
up over an empty screen.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.390
So I mean, there is
nothing here.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.750
So if you want to display some
information, that's the

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.500
place to put it.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.270
Not on a pop-up box.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, and that's
really the issue that we're

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.140
going to see over and over again
is that this is a very

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.340
modal dialog based
application.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.620
And I think part of it,
especially when you look at

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.730
the buttons, I think you can see
that this was definitely

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:55.185
designed in the Eclair era.

00:20:55.185 --> 00:20:58.110
And that used to be, I think,
a better way of doing things

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.580
than it is now.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.440
I think we have much
better design

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.610
language now than we did.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.000
RETO MEIER: I think the problem
was at that time, it

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.830
was quite ambiguous.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.180
And it was really up to you.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.630
And if you wanted your app to
look good, you really needed

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:09.510
to do it all yourself.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.680
And I can see that they've put
some effort in here to try and

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.070
make it look better
than the stock

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.240
Gingerbread, Eclair stuff.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.110
Unfortunately, now it starts
to look a little dated.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.150
And look, I understand.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:22.290
We all definitely understand why
people have been reluctant

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.840
to update their app with every
single version of Android.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.870
But since Holo, since Android
3, things have been pretty

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.480
consistent.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.890
We've added new things.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.300
But if you create an app which
is consistent with those

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.790
design guidelines, I think
you'll find something which is

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:36.870
going to look good for
a while to come.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: So I'm really
excited to see what Roman has

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.550
to say about this.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:43.940
But I will point out that there
are some great apps on

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.170
Google Play right now that
sign a little bit

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:47.930
more in this area.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.130
Now I haven't found anything
with the power of Tasker.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:59.680
But for instance, there's an app
called Automate It, which

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.660
uses almost an identical
paradigm, but it allows me to

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.620
swipe between the
different pages.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:16.170
And as I do different actions,
where Tasker uses modal

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:23.010
dialogs, Automate It uses drop
downs, and it uses--

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.700
what do we call those things
where they open up?

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.660
RETO MEIER: Like an expanding
list view?

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:27.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:28.540
Exactly.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.560
So they use expansions.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.530
One really obvious place, for
instance, is when you choose a

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:38.100
location on Automate It, then it
expands a map view directly

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.520
underneath the piece of script
that you're working on.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.560
Whereas here, it actually takes
you to a completely

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.120
different screen.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:44.450
RETO MEIER: All right.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.920
So it's just providing you
the context without

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.150
breaking your workflow.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:47.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.790
RETO MEIER: I like that.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Again, not
a huge big deal.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.660
Just some things that could
be polished there.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.670
The important thing is helping
people to understand how these

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.990
things actually work.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.700
Now these little modal dialogs
that pop up are certainly

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.200
better than nothing, but
could be better.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.305
Now it is pretty obvious,
though, what I need to do to

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:10.500
add a profile.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.900
I don't really want to click
the Plus button down here.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.600
I probably would've rather
had it in the list,

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.780
but that's a quibble.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.110
I do like that the new profile
name is optional.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.620
Great.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.530
I can click right past it
without having to think of

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:29.510
something to type in and have
all of my profiles named QWE.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.600
So the first context it's
going to give me--

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.300
I'm sorry, it's naming
it first context.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.100
But it's giving me some options
for context, and this

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.650
is essentially the conditions
under which you

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.640
are going to run.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.890
So for instance, I'm going to
want to be, let's say, during

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.170
a particular time.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:50.320
Time entry is painful, more
our fault than theirs.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.120
RETO MEIER: It's just our
fault, but we fixed it.

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.690
So please hide our shame.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:57.420
So OK.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.560
I'll say it's in this.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.800
And then I'm going to do a task
at that particular time.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.520
Again, optional name,
thank you.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:09.380
And a task contains actions,
and then actions go into a

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.230
huge amount of work.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.845
RETO MEIER: This is good,
because this is everything, I

00:24:13.845 --> 00:24:15.600
mean, it's everything you
could want to do here.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.350
RETO MEIER: It's great.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: And it's
categorized.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.600
So that's good.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.730
I mean, there's probably over
100 options here, and I don't

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.210
have to look at all
of them at once.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:31.015
So maybe I want to do
a particular task.

00:24:31.015 --> 00:24:32.400
RETO MEIER: That's nice that
you have ifs and elses.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: There are.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.470
There are ifs and
elses all over.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.150
RETO MEIER: This really is kind
of a programming language

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.980
for programming your phone
rather than programming apps.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: There are, in
fact, even variables that you

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.460
can set, et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.490
RETO MEIER: So I see
the challenge here.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.020
So the Tasker guys--or guy.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.430
I'm not sure how many
people are involved.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:54.770
But they're basically trying
to implement a GUI-based

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.210
programming language for
altering your phone's behavior

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:58.950
on the fly.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:24:59.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.200
RETO MEIER: And that's
apparently hard.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.370
That's not really surprising.

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.085
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's a relatively
difficult activity.

00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:06.610
RETO MEIER: So we really are
asking them to say, look, we

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.250
love the functionality of your
jumbo jet, but we'd like to

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.690
have just sort of a steering
wheel and maybe a brake pedal

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.480
and an accelerator.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, this is
where I think Tasker could

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:21.070
make the most difference is in
having a usable repository

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.700
that can be the first
thing that I see.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.190
So instead of seeing the ability
to program things

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.650
coming up initially, I'd rather
see a bunch of stuff

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.040
that other people
have programmed.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.440
RETO MEIER: But this is the way
a lot of people learn how

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.170
to write code in
a new language.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.200
It certainly is for me.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.680
I'm not so much the "read all of
the API docs first before I

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.350
get started." I'm all like, let
me download a sample app

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.140
that does something in the vague
vicinity of what I want,

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.900
and I'm just going
to mess with it.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh I think it's
telling that, for instance,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.670
the JavaScript guys we work
with, they say, yeah, they'll

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.360
never obfuscate source code,
because otherwise, how would

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.340
anyone learn JavaScript?

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:02.240
And I answer, no one
learns JavaScript.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.470
So I don't want to get too
far into it, but--

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.320
RETO MEIER: Yeah, we probably
shouldn't rabbit hole too far.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: The other thing
that I wanted to bring up

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:10.870
though was--

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.040
well, actually, let me finish by
adding some random accent.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:16.440
OK.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:20.930
They do have conditions on
everything, but it makes the

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.810
defining a task a little bit
difficult, because you need to

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:28.070
define, essentially, an event.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:33.090
Now, they call them contexts,
and they can be stateful in

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.500
the sense that you can
enter and exit them.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.300
But you basically have to say,
in response to this event, do

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.950
this task, but only if
this other thing.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.500
And that's how most of the
things are structured.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.990
And some of the other things we
looked at were a little bit

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.550
more explicit as far as
the conditionals.

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.770
Because right now, you'd
actually have to burrow in to

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.710
each conditional to see which
one actually applied.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:58.010
RETO MEIER: Gotcha.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:02.380
So we could talk about Tasker
for hours and hours.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.450
It's a wonderful program.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.510
You should definitely
check it out.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:09.000
But let's go ahead and move on
to something that's maybe a

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.770
little bit easier
to configure.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:11.580
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.550
It's a little easier for you.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.460
Before we do, I just wanted to
do a really quick call out.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.850
Thank you for blocking
the photo of me.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.030
One of the things about
an app like--

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.950
perfect.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.810
It's like I'm--

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.210
whoa, what's the photo?

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.130
What's being overlaid?

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.341
One of the beautiful things
about Tasker and a lot of

00:27:28.341 --> 00:27:31.390
these apps is that they function
based on location, so

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.260
whether you're at home or at
work or whatever else.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.990
And so it's really, really
important in that context to

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.190
be as efficient as possible in
your location updates, because

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.490
this is just something which
is going to help

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:43.410
give you a short cut.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.790
No one wants to sacrifice hours
of battery life to be

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.080
able to save themselves
two or three

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.950
seconds of clicking things.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.320
So I have a deep dive into
location on the Android

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.750
Developers blog, which you can
check out, which can give you

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:56.870
some of the details there.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:01.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: There's also a
section on the Tasker wiki.

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.300
So it's not that they don't
have a community.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.410
It's that they have a community
with a wiki, where

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.075
you can download XML
and presumably load

00:28:09.075 --> 00:28:10.380
it into Tasker somehow.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.150
So it's not that it's not
friendly, it's just that it's

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.010
not friendly for
normal people.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.226
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:28:16.226 --> 00:28:16.300
Yeah.

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:16.910
OK.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: So they have a
section called "Location

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.250
Without Tears," which also goes
over some of this and has

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.560
some very interesting Tasker
specific info.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.340
RETO MEIER: Perfect.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:25.820
All right.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.870
So let's have a look at the
next app which is NFC Task

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.340
Launcher from Tagstand.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.890
Now they have, as you can see,
a lovely feature graphic.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.560
Gives you an idea of how
it's going to work.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.950
It's kind of artistic.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.100
I kind of like it.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.730
Don't know if you'd necessarily
need to have the

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.390
phone on there, but in this
instance, it kind of makes

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.760
sense, because it's showing
how the app gets used.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.160
There's an NFC tag there, you
hold your phone over it,

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.050
that's how the magic happens.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:52.030
Now I actually have used
this app quite a bit.

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.010
I had a big set of suggestions
from my initial experience

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.880
working with the app, getting
everything configured.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.010
And since I had everything
configured the way I wanted

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.510
to, I haven't really had to go
through that process again.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:06.060
So I opened up the app just to
confirm my thinking, and it

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.284
turns out that they've fixed
pretty much everything I was

00:29:09.284 --> 00:29:09.675
going to tell them to.

00:29:09.675 --> 00:29:11.875
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's good being
Reto Meier, isn't it?

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:14.660
RETO MEIER: I don't even
think I told them.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think you
blogged about it, and they

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.350
just read your blog.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.420
RETO MEIER: That's possible.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:18.990
That's possible.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.640
But it's wonderful
for me to see.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.860
Like the big questions I had was
particularly around things

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.170
like navigation, getting
started, a lot of things that

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.460
we've already talked about.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.370
And they've actually fixed a lot
of what I was asking for.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:33.080
So as a little bit of context,
the way I used this app, I

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.590
actually talked a little bit
about it when I did a blog

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.950
post about how I modded
my Prius to be able to

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:39.980
use my Nexus 7.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love that
you drive a Prius.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.175
That's so San Francisco.

00:29:42.175 --> 00:29:42.970
RETO MEIER: It's so perfect.

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.130
If you're going to move, move.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: I, on the other
hand, drive a Mack truck with

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:52.280
windshield washers that squirt
West Texas light crude.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:52.530
RETO MEIER: Nice.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:53.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.570
RETO MEIER: That way,
you get that rose

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.460
colored tint to the world.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: You're not going
to kill many birds in your

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.300
Prius, that's all I'm saying.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.290
RETO MEIER: Well no, you
have to really aim.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.430
So this is how I use
the app every day.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.140
So in my car, as you can see,
there I've got a tablet.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.820
There's an NFC sticker
stuck on that mount.

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.270
So when I put the tablet in
there it turns on navigation,

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.110
it turns on Wi-Fi and connects
to the hot spot which is

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.590
enabled when I put my phone
into the center console.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.780
So again, I've got a sticker
stuck underneath the other

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.540
little tray for my mobile phone,
and that turns on the

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.000
hot spot for my Nexus 7.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.500
It also turns on the Nexus 7
music, so as soon as I sit

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.340
down, put it there,
I start getting my

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.290
music, which is lovely.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.640
When I get to work, I have an
NFC tag stuck under the bottom

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.430
of my desk.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.830
I've got a little X
marked on my desk.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.160
I've got my phone there.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.610
It turns off my volume, connects
to the office Wi-Fi,

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:47.790
and does a bunch
of other stuff.

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:49.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: So you're able to
get it through your desk?

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:50.320
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.650
It's like an inch of, I guess,
really, really light wood.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.330
But it gets through,
which is nice.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.630
At home, where I put my wallet
and keys, again,

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.730
I have an NFC tag.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.740
So I just pop my phone
against that.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.850
Connects to the home Wi-Fi, does
all of the other things I

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:06.380
need at home.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.510
And then the last thing is I
have a little coaster, which I

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.580
stuck an NFC tag to.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.930
It sits next to my bed.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:11.030
Boom.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.660
Pop is there when
I go to sleep.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.560
Mutes everything, turns on the
alarm, et cetera, et cetera.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.300
So it's really automating
a lot of the stuff

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.780
that I do every day.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.710
And once you've set it up once,
you never really need to

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:21.030
think about it.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:21.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's genius.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.480
And actually, I tried to do
this very same thing.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.660
I ran into a few problems.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:27.695
I realized that actually, this
app works a lot better if

00:31:27.695 --> 00:31:29.070
you're consistently sober.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.190
So that was an issue.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:31.240
RETO MEIER: There
is an aim issue.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:31.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.320
RETO MEIER: There is that.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: But also, the one
thing I noticed-- and this

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.330
really isn't an issue with
this app, per se.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.620
It's more of the operating
system in general.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.170
I would love to see us
add this, is the

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:43.560
app needs to be installed.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.420
So for instance,
I thought, oh.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.200
I'll put a Wi-Fi sticker
for my guest

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200
network next to the door.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.510
That was one of the things
the app suggested.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.530
Then I went to the sticker, and
it turns out first thing

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.590
it needs to do is download the
app, because there's no

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.630
general set up a Wi-Fi
NFC intent.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.550
RETO MEIER: Which is a shame.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.660
Which in a way is a shame
because that would be really

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.410
useful, but it would also make
this app less useful.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:04.987
So, yeah.

00:32:04.987 --> 00:32:05.860
It's chicken and egg.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.130
You always want to stick a bar
code onto the NFC tag so you

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.578
can scan the bar code, which
will install the app, which

00:32:11.578 --> 00:32:13.380
will then let you use the tag.

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:13.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, no.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.770
It does actually install
the app.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:19.920
But the problem for me was,
well, if I'm bringing somebody

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:22.580
over to use my guest network,
and the first thing they need

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.640
to do is install an app, how are
they going to get to the

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.690
network to install the app?

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:27.440
RETO MEIER: That's going
to be a challenge.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.085
I mean, you might say via mobile
network, but come on.

00:32:31.085 --> 00:32:33.070
This is the Bay Area.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.830
What if they're on AT&amp;T?

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.870
RETO MEIER: And then
they're out of--

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:36.890
[INAUDIBLE],

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: In my house,
yes they are.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.610
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.880
I guess this is particularly
useful if you happen to have a

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.210
Nexus Q. So you need to get onto
the right network so you

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.700
can have the tag here and you
don't have to worry so much

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.520
about Wi-Fi in general, but
for specific Wi-Fi.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.190
Anyway.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:52.760
We're rabbit-holing again.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.550
So I want to move
on real quick.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.270
So happily, this--

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.390
now we're going to
have to switch.

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:58.490
We did this really well.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:00.390
RETO MEIER: You should
go in front.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:01.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.300
RETO MEIER: Excellent.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.370
Yay.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.760
So like I said, I had
a whole bunch of

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.700
suggestions for these guys.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.230
But as it turns out, I can go
through this pretty quickly,

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.260
because most of what I wanted
them to do, they now do.

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.530
So the welcome is really nice.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.240
This, I think, works
really well.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.020
This is what happens when
you load the app

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.690
for the first time.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.380
You have a little
welcome dialog.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.340
It explains how to use the
app, what it's there for.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.370
But it's not modal.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.480
It's not going to stop you
from doing anything else.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.450
And you can dismiss it after
you've read it the first time.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.360
So I actually really like this
as an introduction to an app.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.530
I think it works really,
really well.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.820
Once you do dismiss this, you
have preexisting suggestions.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.050
You have all of these profiles
which have descriptive names.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.790
So you go, this is for work.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.090
This is for home.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:46.060
This is for daytime, nighttime,
These things which

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.340
you can immediately say, OK,
well yeah, that sounds like

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.370
exactly what I want to do.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.670
I downloaded this app so that
I can shut down everything

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:53.920
when I went to sleep.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.430
And so I'm going to choose this
and see what happens.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.220
And then once you select any
of those, you can then

00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.890
continue to modify them.

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:00.980
But it gives you a start.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.650
It gives you, as a user, an idea
for how am I going to use

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.690
this and what do I need to do
in order to get the obvious

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.500
things working?

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.989
So we'll jump back to
the giant phone.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:16.188
And I'll bring up NFC
Task Launcher.

00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:16.679
Perfect.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:21.699
So it's all got a really nice,
modern Holo-type UI.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:22.349
Still customized.

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:27.334
It's got this orange theme,
which is similar in color to

00:34:27.334 --> 00:34:30.110
the Gingerbread orange
but nicer.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.090
It actually looks good.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:31.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.070
RETO MEIER: It's a
different shade.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.699
IAN NI-LEWIS: More creamsicle,
less pumpkin.

00:34:35.699 --> 00:34:36.120
RETO MEIER: Indeed.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:36.710
Indeed.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.060
And you can see here, you've
got all these locations.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.659
So these are popular tags, which
people have created and

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:42.610
configured.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:43.699
You've got your nice icons.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:44.989
And that was one of the things
I wanted to say.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:48.050
Once you've created your own
tags, they're listed here

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.690
under My Tags.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.130
But you lose the cool icons.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:52.730
Like, I would like to be able
to have that as a shortcut.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.290
It's a small thing, but it just
makes it a little bit

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.830
easier, particularly if you
have a lot of these, to be

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.610
able to easily recognize them
if you want to edit them.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:02.250
Now of course, you're not
actually going to be using the

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.950
UI that much, because it's one
of those you set up once you

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:08.460
leave it forever
type scenarios.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.690
So if we go through, we'll
create a tag based on

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:11.270
something else.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.310
So create a Wi-Fi network.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.140
That's probably a bad example
because we need to actually

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.000
have a Wi-Fi network.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.100
We'll go home.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.475
So it's going to change
my ring type to

00:35:20.475 --> 00:35:21.560
normal and turn on Wi-Fi.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.740
That makes sense.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.780
And when you get to this point,
it can almost get a

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.530
little bit confusing.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:28.680
So we're going to say
Save and Write.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.890
So I like that they've got the
confirmation at the top here.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:32.560
That's great.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.800
And at this point, it gets
a little bit confusing.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.430
So this is the point where you
would put your phone against

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.770
the tag to record this.

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.690
Once you do, it will vibrate,
tell you it's

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:44.830
done, which is great.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.730
But then to finish, you have
these two options.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.135
So on the one hand at the top
left, it says Finish.

00:35:50.135 --> 00:35:51.895
And on the top right,
it says Done.

00:35:51.895 --> 00:35:55.580
And if you hit Finish, it goes
back, which is correct,

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.440
because it's actually the up
affordance that I'm clicking.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:35:59.490
So you do have to write Done.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.670
But I just found that a
little bit confusing.

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.920
You almost don't want
to use that word.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: So in
other words, this

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.600
page is called Finish.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.780
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: And it has
an up affordance.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:08.940
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:11.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: But it has
also a Done button.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.350
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:14.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Do they both
do the same thing?

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:14.970
RETO MEIER: No.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.490
So if you hit the up affordance,
it goes back.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.590
And that's kind of
important here.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:22.900
So up, in terms of Android,
means, don't go to a sibling,

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.180
go to a parent.

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.050
Now basically, what you're
going through here is a

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.910
wizard, and a wizard is a
horizontal sibling flow.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.110
You're moving from equal
stages along the path.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:34.930
So Back should take you back.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.080
Up should take you out
of this workflow.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.430
And in this case, it's
basically the

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.860
equivalent of cancel.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:41.900
So you probably don't actually
want to do an

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:42.450
up affordance here.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.120
You want to have basically
a Save and Write.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.815
Or I can't remember the name
that Roman has been using for

00:36:48.815 --> 00:36:52.470
it, but the alternative way, you
basically have a Save and

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.040
a Cancel right at
the top here.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.600
So those are the two things
that you can do.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: A commit
type of thing.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.590
RETO MEIER: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:59.110
Like a Commit or Cancel
at any point.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:36:59.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:03.910
And in general, if you're going
to do a wizard, the very

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:06.190
best way to do it that
users like is to

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.880
just use a view pager.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:14.100
Because it is weird to have
a verb in your action bar.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.380
RETO MEIER: In your title bar.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
in your title bar.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.120
But having that as a particular
tab on a wizard,

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.010
especially a wizard that you
can swipe through, which is

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.790
becoming a far more interesting
and understood

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:29.290
action than a Back
button, honestly.

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.830
I mean, you'd think a Back
button is the easiest

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:31.400
thing in the world.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:31.680
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: But I've seen
people with a Back button

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.290
right there trying to swipe.

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.360
Because as soon as you start
thinking in a horizontal flow,

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.760
you want to be able to swipe
view pager style.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.140
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.740
And that is still one of the
bigger challenges, and

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.600
particularly if you're using a
view pager to swipe between

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.680
things which aren't necessarily

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.900
contextually identical.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.660
So if I swipe along this main
page, it tells you where you

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.780
can buy tags, which is a great
feature, because the first

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:56.190
thing you goes is,
oh that's great.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.140
But where do I get
the tags from?

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:57.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.150
RETO MEIER: So this is nice.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.520
And you've got Popular Tags,
My Tags, and Statistics to

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.485
tell you how many actions you've
performed and how much

00:38:02.485 --> 00:38:03.260
time you've [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: So popular tags,
is that sort of a community

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.520
repository?

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.380
Can you upload your own?

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.070
RETO MEIER: Well, this
is what I'm not sure.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.940
I don't know that you
can upload your own.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.920
So I'm not sure whether they
mean popular as in used by a

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.040
lot of people or popular as in
asked for by a lot of people.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.590
So they don't have a community
repository.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:17.730
It would be wonderful
to see that.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.430
But the trick here is that when
I'm in By Tags, or if I'm

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.380
over in Statistics, mentally
my context has switched.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.580
I'm no longer looking at tags,
I'm looking at stats.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.960
And so my temptation is more
frequently than I'd like to

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.950
admit to hit Back to go back
to my tags, and then I exit

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.750
the app and I'm angry
and frustrated.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:35.590
I don't necessarily have a great
solution, but it's a

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:40.560
risk of having contextually
independent items all in the

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.710
same view pager.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:45.760
So again, we're short on time,
so I don't want to go into too

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.950
much depth here.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.970
One thing I did want to point
out, so the difference between

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.850
this and Tasker is Tasker
is fully automated.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.830
You set up your context, and
then you leave it in your

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.100
pocket and it does
it all for you.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:54.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.430
RETO MEIER: This, you do
need to hit the NFC

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.810
tag, which is nice.

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.210
The disadvantage here, of
course, is that you have to be

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:01.800
conscious of it.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.030
You have to have a tag
in the right place.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.910
You have to manually do the
tapping rather than just

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.210
having it automatically.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.200
The advantage is that you
don't need to have any

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:11.760
services running.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.380
It's really efficient.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.790
Nothing needs to be running
in the background.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:16.620
The app can be completely
gone.

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.720
And once you hit an NFC tag,
it's still going to wake up

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.400
and do what it needs to
do, which is nice.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.080
So how would you go about
building something like this?

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.270
Well, you need to learn
a lot about NFC.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.400
Really, the key here is you need
to learn to listen for

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.710
tags and try and be as specific
as possible as to the

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.826
type of data that you're trying
to listen for so that

00:39:36.826 --> 00:39:39.590
you're not colliding with other
apps which are also

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:42.160
listening for NFC data.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:44.340
There's a couple of really good
Google IO talks, which

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.670
you can check out.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.760
One from 2011 with Nick Pelly
and Jeff Hamilton, which

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.420
really give a great introduction
to how NFC works,

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:52.810
how you would build an
app that works in a

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.120
similar way to this.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.340
And then last year there was
another follow-up session to

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.410
that, "Up Close and Personal,
which talked a little bit more

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.340
about Android Beam, but again
gave more of an update into

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.010
how NFC can be used for
apps like this.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.080
So I'm going to buzz really
quickly through

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.580
Profile Widget as well.

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:18.300
So this is the fully manual
version, I suppose.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.590
You have to know exactly what
you're switching to.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:20.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.920
So it's got the task part but
not the detection part.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.660
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.700
Exactly.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.040
It's probably one of the most
simplistic of the three apps

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.025
that we've looked at.

00:40:29.025 --> 00:40:32.940
But in some ways, it's almost
a positive, because there

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.400
should be a much smaller
learning curve to get going.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:35.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:40.040
Well, especially as we talked
about, deciding what profile

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.510
I'm in is actually a really
interesting machine learning

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:45.920
task, which a lot of users
wouldn't be able to program

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.920
even if they knew how.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.780
So this is actually
really attractive.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.140
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.380
So you can see, they've got
the nice profile graphic,

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.470
which is great.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:54.300
Always like to see that.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.830
And that is a prerequisite in
order to be considered for our

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:59.970
Pure Android collection, which
we will have more on soon.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:03.020
We've got a few likely
candidates, which may be

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.660
getting un-veeled.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.130
Soon.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.476
Un-veeled?

00:41:04.476 --> 00:41:06.260
That's not a word.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:06.470
Unveiled.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: Assumed
it was British.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.610
RETO MEIER: Maybe it is, but
either way, I don't know it.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:11.870
Should we switch back?

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:12.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.340
RETO MEIER: This is awesome.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:15.920
All right.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: We had half an
hour to review these slides.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.980
How did we not catch this?

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:21.080
RETO MEIER: Longer than that.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.260
So this is Profile Widget.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.710
So they've got a dashboard
pattern, which is a bit of a

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.080
shame, particularly because one
of the key things for me

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.450
on all of these apps is
that they need to

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.770
work well on tablets.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.880
Because there are tablets with
NFC, and I use those just as

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.060
much as my phone.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.800
So it doesn't work
quite as well.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.170
It also means that the learning
curve is much higher

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:38.840
than it should be.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.410
I started this app off, and this
is the page that I get.

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:45.140
And it's not obvious to
me, what do I do here?

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:47.970
Profile, Widget, I don't really

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:49.750
understand how to get going.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.680
And as you navigate through the
app, it doesn't really get

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.070
any clearer.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:55.430
It's kind of hard
to understand.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.060
And I'll show you that
when we bring up the

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.150
giant phone in a moment.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.110
One thing that I really did want
to point out is they have

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.870
a really nice toast.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.480
So because it's all sort of
automated, [? plus ?] a

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.610
widget, you don't have an
activity to show information,

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.260
you need to use something
like a toast.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:13.060
And they've customized their
toasts really well.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.640
They've added color,
a background.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.260
So it's not just sort of that
general, standard generic

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.600
toast which pops up.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: And this is one
of the few places where a

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:21.580
toast is truly appropriate.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.150
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.660
And it's nice to see that they
have used it appropriately and

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.020
prettied it up as well,
which is great.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.230
So let's jump to the giant
phone really quickly.

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:33.760
So if we have a look at Profile
Widget here, you can

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.600
see straight away if we go
back to the main page.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.720
So the way it works is, you go
into your profiles, and then

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:43.245
there's Activate Profiles
and Create and Edit.

00:42:43.245 --> 00:42:45.590
And what you actually want to
do for most cases is either

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.400
Create or Edit a profile.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.490
Reordering and activating
are secondary functions.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:53.310
If we go into Editing,
Day, then we end

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:53.970
up with this screen.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.730
So we're already having to
navigate deeply into the

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:57.380
innards of the app.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.140
And at this point we can do
things like change the icons,

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.740
modify the sound, connection
and screen.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.480
So one of the others, I guess,
not necessarily issues but

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.020
observations about this app is
it doesn't have quite the same

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.820
level of control that
the others do.

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.690
So you can't do things.

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.310
You can turn on and off Wi-Fi,
but you can't specify a Wi-Fi

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.630
network to connect
to, for example.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.490
So it's a little bit
more limited in its

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:22.240
functionality there.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.730
As well, once you actually have
it set up, it creates

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:28.970
this really nice widget on the
home screen, which is great.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:31.060
Again, they've put a lot of time
into the design effort of

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.540
making sure that the
things you actually

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.100
use a lot look nice.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.630
And so if I click on the widget,
it lets me choose a

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.290
profile to activate.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.930
Displays it in the nice little
toast, and then changes the

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.240
actual widget so it can see
what profile you're in.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.450
So the expectation here is
really much more sort of that

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:51.415
older approach of defining a
profile for your phone, where

00:43:51.415 --> 00:43:54.170
you basically want to say
night mode, day mode.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:56.560
at-home mode, Wi-Fi on
mode, whatever it is.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think people
certainly get used to that.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.240
I mean, we've got airplane mode
for instance, night and

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.670
day mode, work mode,
home mode.

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:05.300
Those all makes sense,
and I like that.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.500
It's probably worth mentioning
that Tasker, for instance, and

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.960
most of the other profile apps,
also offer widgets.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:12.250
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: If that's
what you're into.

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.830
It's just that they focus most
of their efforts on the more

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.550
interesting conditional stuff.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.060
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.880
And so I think there is a niche
for an app like this,

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.930
which provides a much smaller,
simpler subset for the most

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.650
common, the 80% of things
which people want to do.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.860
Turn up screen brightness, mute

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.080
volume, change ring tones.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, if I was
trying to do this for my mom,

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:39.300
this is exactly what I would
use, because I don't want to

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.310
have to do tech support for
the set of profiles and

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.225
conditions that I wrote
to figure out if

00:44:44.225 --> 00:44:45.050
she's at work or not.

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.590
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: If she has a
problem with that, I'd rather

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.260
that she just presses
a button.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.690
Because the code that I can
write in their script is not

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:56.580
going to be nearly accurate
enough to cover all the cases.

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.950
And if it ever fails,
she's not going to

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.980
be able to fix it.

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.550
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:02.090
So this is kind of nice.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:06.240
So the downside here for this
app is that it's simpler once

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.560
you understand how to use it,
but that learning curve to

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.280
understand how you're setting
up your profiles, where that

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.700
happens, how you
place a widget.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.390
The actual process of putting
your widget on the home screen

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:18.680
and choosing how it's going to
choose between the different

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.920
profiles you've set up is a
little bit harder and less

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.940
intuitive than it should be.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:25.250
So that's, I think, the key for
these guys is to really

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:29.090
try to make that process as
simple and easy to do.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:30.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, I think we
knew this show was going to

00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:33.440
run long, because these
are such complex apps.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.660
But let's go ahead and talk a
little bit now, wrap it up,

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.400
and see what all these
apps should be doing.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:40.950
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:44.500
So we introduced this stuff
at the beginning.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.800
We want it to do as
much as possible.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.030
We want it to be easy to use.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:48.740
We want it to work on tablets.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.990
And tablets, I guess, is one
which I do want to bring up,

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.650
because I think they've all
been designed for phones.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.780
Which makes sense, but we
really want to try and

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.430
emphasize how much people should
be thinking about doing

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:00.070
those things.

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.310
And so step one is really
creating a great responsive

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.810
design so that the app is going
to look good and work

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.590
great on any device that
you happen to be using.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.140
It doesn't matter what
orientation you're in.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.570
It doesn't matter whether
it's a tablet,

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:11.450
whether it's a phone.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:15.010
Whatever it is, it should just
adapt and work well.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.850
And similarly, you want
to create that great

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.350
tablet-specific experience.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.020
And even if you're not planning
to do anything tablet

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.590
specific, it should
still work.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:26.050
You shouldn't have to worry
that, well, actually, on my

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:27.270
Nexus 7, it doesn't work.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.740
And I have to mount it
differently in my car or place

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:31.410
the NFC tag in a different
place.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.980
And so really, you want to
optimize in all ways.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.950
And in fact, there can be
opportunities to take it a

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:38.620
step further.

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:41.510
Now we can see that the NFC
Task Launcher is providing

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:42.820
some statistics.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.950
That sort of stuff works really
well on a tablet where

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:48.045
you may want to sit down, or
indeed for a Tasker, where

00:46:48.045 --> 00:46:51.020
you're having to create GUIs
and those sorts of things.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.460
That on my phone, not so much.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.280
That on a tablet, well, I think
we'd all like to be able

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:56.280
to write code on a tablet.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.640
Maybe this is the first step.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, giving
yourself a little more space

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:00.460
is always a good thing.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.010
Although one thing you should
also remember when you're

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.710
going between tablets and phones
is that most people

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:05.760
have both devices.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.860
If they have a tablet, they
almost certainly have a phone.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.190
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:10.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: And so being able
to create something on

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.560
one device and use it on another
device, or on all of

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.190
your devices, is also
a feature I would

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.850
really like to see.

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:17.190
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.390
I guess it's the other side of
that community repository.

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:20.830
I want my own repository.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:21.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Bingo.

00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:22.820
RETO MEIER: It's like I've
created it, I want to apply

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.750
this to all of my devices.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:25.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.220
Alright.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.810
So before we sign off, let's
take a look at our

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:31.020
prescriptions for reach app to
help them move towards a pure

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.440
Android experience.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.180
Do we put that in
scare quotes?

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.850
RETO MEIER: I think until we
actually launch it, yes.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.685
IAN NI-LEWIS: No problem.

00:47:36.685 --> 00:47:38.060
RETO MEIER: Once it's launched
then we lose the scare quotes.

00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:38.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: Awesome.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.820
All right.

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:45.020
So the prescription
we have for Tasker

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.560
is first a UI makeover.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.400
I think it needs one.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.240
It deserves one.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.925
It's a wonderful program,
and it'd be nice

00:47:49.925 --> 00:47:50.900
if it looked nicer.

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.610
RETO MEIER: Yeah, don't
sell yourself short.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:54.615
It's a great app with huge
amounts of functionality.

00:47:54.615 --> 00:47:57.460
It just looks like it's old.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.290
And give it the Holo makeover.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:00.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:01.670
And lose the dialogs.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.350
More than anything else,
this is what makes the

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:04.870
program hard to use.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.700
It puts you in a very modal
position, so it's difficult to

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.550
quickly edit things because
you have to jump

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:11.560
in and out of modes.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.950
I'd love to see a tablet version
where I could see

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:16.940
multiple conditions, multiple
contacts, and multiple tasks

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.230
all laid out where I could
tweak each one of them.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.250
RETO MEIER: Oh, that would
be beautiful, yeah.

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:22.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: They definitely
need a repository.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.760
The wiki is awesome, but only
if you're willing to really

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.500
work at something.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:30.310
Some of the competitors out
there actually have something

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.700
where the first thing you do
is press a button, or you

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:35.580
don't even need to
press a button.

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.360
You just see popular tasks, or
popular contexts, or popular

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.230
profiles that other people
have defined.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:46.000
And it turns out, when I went
looking, that everything that

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.080
I wanted to do had already been
defined, and all that I

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.860
needed to do is change the
location or change the time.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.440
RETO MEIER: A couple
of variables, yeah.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: So let's
get that in.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.780
I think that if that was in the
app, it would be a winner.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.315
It would be, hands down, my
favorite profile app.

00:49:02.315 --> 00:49:05.110
But finally, I think that you
could have a little bit more

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:06.730
appropriate feature discovery.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.050
Things like variables that are
very important-- like if I

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.400
want to see what speed I'm
going, for instance--

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.445
are very difficult
to discover.

00:49:12.445 --> 00:49:15.850
You have to drill all the
way in to a condition.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.290
And then sometimes you have to
type in the variable name, but

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.410
sometimes you can select
it from a list.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.820
And that's very, very odd,
especially since there are

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:26.490
about 100 different built-in
variables that let you check

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:27.500
different things
on your phone.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.290
It's really, really nice.

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:31.870
But then again, you've got the
Scenes feature, which is an

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:32.460
app builder.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:36.930
It's an IDE, which most of the
users of this particular

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:39.410
application will probably
not use.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:40.960
It's a niche feature.

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.240
And yet it's given a very
prominent position on the very

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.010
first page.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.830
So it's not about making
things more or less

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:48.590
discoverable.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:52.030
It's making them more
appropriately discoverable.

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:54.020
RETO MEIER: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.390
For NFC Task Launcher, like I
said, they've actually done a

00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:58.920
lot of things that
I was hoping for.

00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:00.900
I think there is still a little
bit of work to be done

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:01.630
in navigation.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.050
And that's maybe something that
you guys can find out

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:07.180
exactly, if I am a one-off case
or if a lot of people are

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.980
having the same problems,
using analytics.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.075
Find out how many times people
are accidentally exiting out

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:13.490
of your app.

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:16.120
Don't put up an "are you sure
you want to exit" dialog.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.520
That is not a solution.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.690
That is just an indication that
your navigation is more

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:21.600
confusing than it needs to be.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.240
I'd love to see icons for My
Tags because they look really

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.175
nice on that front page.

00:50:26.175 --> 00:50:27.320
The icons exist.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.970
I copied a profile which had
an icon associated with it.

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:32.140
So having those there available
for my own apps

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.550
would be really nice.

00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:37.670
What I've said here is avoid
duplicative actions, because

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:39.890
when I wrote this, I thought
that Finish and Done did the

00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:40.790
same thing.

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:42.180
As it turns out, they don't.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:45.150
So do check out the way the up
affordances are supposed to

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:47.140
work, and make sure that that's
consistent with the way

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.560
the platform has
been designed.

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.510
IAN NI-LEWIS: And in general,
try to avoid using verbs as

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:55.590
app titles, because they will
show up as if they were

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.570
buttons to a lot of people.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:58.730
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:01.630
Even experienced Android users
like myself get confused.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:02.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.250
RETO MEIER: And also take at
leaf out of Profile Widget.

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:09.330
They've done a really nice job
customizing their toasts.

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:10.570
I've seen other apps which
have really rich

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:11.430
notifications.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:15.650
We do use both of those things
in this app to notify you that

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:16.600
the profile has changed.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.280
So maybe you spend a little bit
of the awesome design work

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:20.790
that you've done throughout the
rest of the app just to

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:22.730
make those final couple
of pieces a

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:23.740
little bit more polished.

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: But remember,
for those of you at home

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.740
watching this do not make toasts
for any other reason.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:36.080
Toasts that say, please don't
press that button again, no.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.210
RETO MEIER: This is a perfect
example of where toasts are

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:39.700
useful and are appropriate.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.560
Because it's a short
lived notification.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.920
It's a notification.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.340
You need to be notified if
you're paying attention.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.300
You do not need to be
notified later.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:51.370
You do not need the notification
to persist.

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:53.500
And you don't need to pop
up its own activity.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:53.890
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:56.650
And the good job that they've
done here as well is that both

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.080
toasts and notifications
are optional.

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:01.140
So if you don't want to have
anything pop up or appear in

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:03.840
your notification
tray, it won't.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.020
And the last app, Profile
Widget, it's a little bit

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.090
simpler, so we don't have
as much feedback.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.300
Really, make that getting
started as simple as possible.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.430
If you take a leaf out of some
of the other apps here,

00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:15.560
particularly NFC Task Launcher,
to say, well, here

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.590
are the most common things.

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:19.530
Press this button once, and make
that part of the flow.

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:22.520
So when I drop the widget onto
the home screen, basically

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.330
just give me a list of either
existing or new profiles that

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:28.870
I want to associate with it so
that it's click, click, done.

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.420
And then I can worry about
customizing it and everything

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:31.870
afterwards.

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.260
But I need to understand how it
works as quickly as I can.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.510
And maybe revisit the
dashboard pattern,

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:38.570
particularly because even on
a phone, if I rotate into

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:41.030
landscape mode, it doesn't fit
and I end up doing mini

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:43.790
scrolling, which is a little
uncomfortable.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:46.890
So that is all for us today.

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:48.980
Don't forget to tune into Roman,
Nick, and Adam for

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:51.620
"Android Design in Action" next
Tuesday, when hopefully

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.600
they'll be setting their design
skills loose on some of

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:54.660
the apps we looked at today.

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:54.965
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:52:54.965 --> 00:52:57.840
And we'll be back again next
week to look at sleep

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.150
monitoring apps.

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:01.700
RETO MEIER: Which will make a
nice change from having Ian

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.680
monitoring my sleep every
evening, which is getting a

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.220
little creepy.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:06.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it's also
a really difficult job, and

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.460
I'm very tired in the morning.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.100
Now, if you've got a device
profile app you'd like us to

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.230
take a look at--

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:13.860
RETO MEIER: Be sure to
hit our Trello page.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.340
I think we meant sleep
app, though.

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.080
I meant sleep app.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:18.910
RETO MEIER: I don't know
what you said,

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:19.540
because I wasn't listening.

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:20.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: I said
the thing that you

00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:22.560
wrote, and it was wrong.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.620
RETO MEIER: The thing which
we didn't update.

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:23.920
Right.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.440
Well, yes, so if you have a
sleep monitoring app or any of

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.840
the other categories-- we've got
ebook readers coming up in

00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.520
a couple of weeks.

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.400
There's a whole bunch
of options there.

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.360
So go to bit.ly/AppClinicTrello
and get

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.210
your votes and your
self-nominations in.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:40.300
We love to review apps from
people who have written them

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.780
and asked for us to take
a look at them.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.250
It's the easiest way for us to
be able to really have an

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:45.465
impact on what you
guys are doing.

00:53:45.465 --> 00:53:45.990
So please do it.

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:53:46.250 --> 00:53:49.860
And we hate people calling in
to complain later that we

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.580
reviewed their apps without
their permission.

00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:55.950
So please don't post an app
unless there's a way for us to

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.700
get in touch with the author.

00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:58.630
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.980
So until then, thank
you for watching.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.310
My name is a Reto Meier.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:03.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.380
RETO MEIER: And this has
been "The App Clinic."

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:06.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: Thanks
for watching.
