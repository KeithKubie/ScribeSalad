00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.650
Okay, the scenarios that represent 4 chromosomes are the top left

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.340
and the bottom left. Now if you think about why that is, we can see these

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:17.530
are 4 duplicated chromosomes, 1, 2, 3 and 4. And down here we have

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:25.220
4 non duplicated chromosomes. In the top right, we actually have 1, 2, 3,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.240
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 non-duplicated chromosomes. And we have

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.620
only 2 duplicated chromosomes. So if we were to just count the ends,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.470
the tips, right, overall. We can't get the answer we want. You actually

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.710
have to look at the structure, and see is it an X or is it a linear chromosome.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.240
And remember that the word chromosome is used the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.630
same whether it's a duplicated or non duplicated chromosome.
