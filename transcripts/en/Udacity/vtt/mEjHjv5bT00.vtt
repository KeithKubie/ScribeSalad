00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.000
Did you ever figure out what type of blood this woman needs?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt; We did. I mean her genotype is for type

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.890
A, but we don't have type A blood at the hospital.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.140
&gt;&gt; Well, you're going to need to figure

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.280
something out because if you introduce any new

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.080
antigens that her body hasn't seen before, they

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.560
may attack it, and they can kill her.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.030
&gt;&gt; Well, all we have are type AB, type B, and type

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.070
O. Which would you give so that she has a successful blood transfusion?
