00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Norvig] There's an old saying that there's a joker in every deck.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this exercise we're going to allow for jokers.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In fact, we're going to have 2 kinds of jokers.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There's going to be a black joker and a red joker.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The idea is that if you have a joker as one of the cards in your hand

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you can replace it with any other card of the same color.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So if you get the black joker, you can replace it with any spade or club of any rank,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the red joker, you can replace it with any heart or diamond of any rank.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And what you're asked to do is write a function, best<u>wild</u>hand(hand),

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that tries all possibilities for jokers and comes up with the best 5-card selection.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Like before, hand might be more than 5 cards--it could be 7 cards--

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and you still have to come up with the best 5-card answer that substitutes in

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
one of the appropriate cards for any jokers that exist in the hand.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Here are some tests.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This test says here's a hand where we're doing pretty good.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
We already have a straight--6, 7, 8, 9, T--but we also have a wild card,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and we can use that wild card, that joker, and replace it with a jack rather than a 10,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and now we get a slightly higher straight.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We have a straight with a jack high rather than a 10 high.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Here's an example where we have two 10s but we have 2 wild cards,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so we can add in 10s for both of them, and we end up with four 10s, four of a kind.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And here's an example where we show that even if there aren't any jokers

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we still come up with the right answer.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I should say that the hint still holds--that itertools is still your friend.
