00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.920
This is Jocko podcast number seven with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.660
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.510
Ambush of dominating patrol at knee don't Keeney

4
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.530
need Ankeny is a small village in the midst of the jungles and it's extensive

5
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:26.440
cleared patches we're developing as farms.

6
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.000
The village had a couple of rice mills closed for a long time,
a school,

7
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.940
a dispensary,
and a small market next to the school.

8
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.630
The market was itself a road junction with houses in huts around northeast of

9
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:40.450
the market.

10
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.450
A couple of kilometers away was the post of the Ip KF held and strength north of

11
00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:49.810
the market was a pond.

12
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.170
It's rising and bay in Bankman facing the post.

13
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.790
It had become necessary to dominate,
need Ankeny,

14
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.850
need Ankeny by day as well as night at the height of operations in 88 and early

15
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:05.770
89 thereafter,

16
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.930
dominating the market became a routine and the Gospel for the next battalion.

17
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.270
Since the relieved battalion in it's handing over notes had mentioned the same,

18
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.050
so the new battalion got into the Rut and carried on without once asking why

19
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.090
this action was necessary.

20
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.810
So much so that the new units dominating patrols even occupied the same trenches

21
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.320
in the same fashion for the same period and checked the population in the same

22
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:39.644
manner.

23
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.360
One change it made was to stop occupying the double,

24
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:49.361
the only double storey building in the bizarre and instead occupy only the

25
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:54.470
ground level trenches in the midst of the market.

26
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.010
The second change was to stop searching the nearby school and other buildings

27
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.080
where trenches and bunkers were made thoroughly before occupying them.

28
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.220
The third change over over a period was to stop being inquisitive about the

29
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:18.080
increase or decrease of public attendance in the market school and other

30
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:18.914
buildings.

31
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.260
The battalion for months had not been involved in any kind of encounter,

32
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.920
not even caught or seen a mouse.

33
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.100
So this is setting the stage and I'm reading from a book called assignment

34
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.480
Jaffna,
which is about
the war,

35
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.370
the long civil war,
you know,

36
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.400
small country called Sri Lanka and it's written by a Lieutenant General Sardi.

37
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.030
Sheesh Pandey.

38
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 0>Who was a commander there on the ground.</v>

40
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.020
And what's interesting about this book,
it is a very rare book.
In fact,
I,

41
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.280
after I picked it up and started reading through it and I figured other people

42
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:10.180
might want to get it,

43
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.790
I looked on Amazon and it's a rare book that you have to buy from individual

44
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.624
buyers.

45
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.360
And the reason that I have it is because I bought it on the ground in Sri Lanka

46
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.990
in the 90s when I was attached to a seal unit that went to Sri Lanka to help

47
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:35.251
train the Sri Lankan soldiers to fight against the Tamil Tigers,

48
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.970
which was an insurgent terrorist group called the LTTE,

49
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.190
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Islam.

50
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.480
It is an ethnic group that lived in Sri Lanka and had been mistreated and had

51
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.530
now wanted their own state.

52
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.010
So this opening of this book for the opening of the chapter that I just read

53
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.060
about this ambush is catches a couple things that I think are very important.

54
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.321
Number one,

55
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:12.670
you heard me say that the new battalion got into this Rut and carried on with

56
00:04:12.671 --> 00:04:16.810
this mission without once asking why it was necessary.

57
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.370
And I think this is very important for everybody to remember that when you get

58
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.920
tasked with something,
do you need to ask why you're doing it?

59
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.410
You need to understand why you're doing something.

60
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.100
Don't just carry on because it's the way it's always been done.

61
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.810
Asked that question why?

62
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.450
And one of the things that I learned a very hard lesson on,

63
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.140
on my first deployment to Iraq,
we would get,
you know,

64
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.210
we'd get a target that would come down the chain and they'd tell us,
hey,

65
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:48.190
there's a,
a bad guy in this building.

66
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.180
And we would literally get a map of some area of Iraq or Baghdad or some city in

67
00:04:55.601 --> 00:05:00.430
Iraq like Baghdad.
And on the map there would literally like,
uh,
like,
uh,

68
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.280
like a cheesy movie.

69
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.370
There would be a red x on the target building and that would be the building.

70
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.300
And we'd go out and hit it.

71
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.330
And I remember one time we did an operation and we went and took down this

72
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:17.291
target,

73
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:21.490
the building that had the big red x on it and got the guy that we thought was a

74
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:25.210
bad guy.
And anyways,
to make a long story short,
short,

75
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.240
when we got the person back and we interrogated him and went through the

76
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:32.350
intelligence that we had taken from the house,

77
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.000
it turned out the guy was not a bad guy.
He was just a guy that had been,

78
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.700
you know,
somehow mixed up with the,

79
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.730
with with something that ended up giving us this quote unquote intelligence.

80
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.600
And so from then on it,
and as I dug,
as I pulled the thread on the red x,

81
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.650
I figured out that,
you know,

82
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.910
just someone had had three houses to choose from and for whatever reason,

83
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:58.250
but the acts on that house,
they had no real intelligence behind it.

84
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.270
And so I always would tell the story to the young seals and say,
you know,

85
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:07.271
find out who put the x on the target building and make sure that there's a damn

86
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:09.830
good reason why they put that red x there.

87
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.880
So it's also going back to the,

88
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.990
to the paragraph that I started with is you could see that these guys were

89
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:22.670
occupying the same trenches,
the same fashion,
the same period in the same manner.

90
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.030
So they are definitely locked into a pattern that is going to cost them dearly.

91
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.360
And it goes on to talk about the only changes.

92
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:35.030
They did make some changes,
but all of the changes were negative.

93
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.550
All the changes were wrong.
For instance,

94
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.910
they didn't occupy the one double storey building.

95
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.350
Now anyone that knows anything about tactics knows that you want to take the

96
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:48.470
high ground.
You always want to have the high ground.

97
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.850
And here they were in this bizarre and they didn't take the one double storey

98
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:53.211
building.

99
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:56.330
So when you're in a two story building and everything else is a one story

100
00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:59.420
building,
it gives you,
you can see much further.
It's a dominating position.

101
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:03.920
You can shoot,
don't shoot people much easier.
And so you,

102
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.890
you have to take the high ground and,

103
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.980
and there's a seal that I know that kind of took that fought and he had a great

104
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:17.480
quote,
which was take the high ground or the high ground.
We'll take you.

105
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.280
And you know,

106
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.280
when I talk to people about moral or ethical issues,

107
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.990
I use that very quote,
take the high ground or the high ground.

108
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.470
We'll take you.
So you know,
stay on the straight and narrow path.

109
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.310
So going back to this

110
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.200
on a routine round of the days,
morning activity,

111
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:46.370
a patrol of about 20 God out of the post at daybreak,

112
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.500
ambled along the road to the rice mill entered the market dispersed into

113
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:56.501
different trenches and bunkers got into them and started a days dominating work.

114
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.570
And this term dominating basically means they're going to go out and in control

115
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:04.580
the area.
That's what,
that's what this term is,

116
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.530
is referring to when they use this term dominating majority of the trenches.

117
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.800
We're in the or joining the school premises.

118
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.960
The school was closed as it was a holiday.

119
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.800
Doors and windows were locked from the outside.

120
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.650
Attendance in the market was thin,

121
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.080
some shops had not opened normally they should have.

122
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.890
So if you remember earlier it says the third change over a period was to stop

123
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:37.280
being inquisitive about the increase or decrease of public attendance in the

124
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:38.114
market.

125
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:44.290
So it's like the Scooby Doo old Scooby doo cartoon where you know,

126
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:48.080
they say,
oh,
it's quiet,
a little too quiet.
And that's exactly what this is.

127
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:50.480
And this is something that we would see in Ramadi.

128
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.950
You'd see the streets clear out because the local populace would know somehow

129
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.830
that there was an attack that was imminent.
Yeah,
yeah.

130
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.613
<v 2>Okay.</v>

131
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.130
<v 0>Around breakfast,
all hell broke loose</v>

132
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.740
the doors and windows of the school suddenly opened fire and started

133
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.840
and started incoming into the trenches and bunkers in front,

134
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.900
almost at point blank range.
Thereafter,

135
00:09:20.901 --> 00:09:22.880
grenades were thrown into the trenches.

136
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.760
As those few outside the school tried to react,

137
00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:29.990
the militants occupying the double storey building brought murderous fire on

138
00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:34.880
them below.
Every movement was picked up.
The two inch mortar detachment,

139
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:38.000
which had stayed off and was still behind across the school,

140
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.930
was only with the old only element,
not hit or engaged.

141
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.290
A quickly got behind some cover and fired a few bombs.

142
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.550
Then they too were picked up barely a few managed to get behind some building on

143
00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:53.000
the other side and kept it to psaltery volley of shots.

144
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.080
It was all over in the market but not on its outskirts.

145
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.790
So now you have these guys that had been in these positions and clearly the

146
00:10:01.791 --> 00:10:06.791
insurgence had set up on them completely and just unleashed and in moments had

147
00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:12.440
them gun down
the post.

148
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.860
So the post is where these guys had patrolled to this market from.

149
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.980
The Post reacted quickly and sent a relief patrol directly to the school through

150
00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:22.520
open patty fields.

151
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.400
The militants had correctly anticipated it.
As you can imagine,

152
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.590
the militants knew exactly where the post was.

153
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.250
They knew when they hit these guys that the,
they would send reinforcements.

154
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.590
Here come the reinforcements,
they're ready.

155
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.850
They gave a searing welcome to the Relief Party and pinned it to the ground.

156
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:46.270
The postmortem had been deployed and fired on the bond of the kilohm,

157
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.870
which dominating heights of the militants had a mo mobilize the relief column.

158
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.190
The militants seem to be enjoying it as they pumped automatic fire into the post

159
00:10:55.191 --> 00:10:57.530
itself from the nearby jungle edge.

160
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.550
Although this fire was more in the nature of gesture of defiance,

161
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.760
so they not only were hitting the market,

162
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.250
but they had coordinated so that when the market,

163
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:11.290
when they started to attack the,
the,
the Sri Lanka or sorry,

164
00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:14.590
the Indian soldiers in the market,
as soon as they started that,

165
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.290
then when that reaction force came from the post,

166
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.320
they hit the post as well as quickly as they had half an hour later,

167
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.920
the militant stopped firing as quickly as they had started it and melted away

168
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:32.190
with the booty of weapons for more than a dozen killed and wounded soldiers of

169
00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:34.630
the dominating patrol.

170
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.630
So obviously a horrific situation.

171
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.190
And this is where the general asks some questions,

172
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.690
some pointed questions.

173
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.650
What kind of training had this battalion done?

174
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.530
What manner of mental,

175
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.640
no professional preparation headed achieved before being inducted into the

176
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:59.020
battlefield and Sri Lanka.

177
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.000
What attention did its previous brigade and divisional commanders give to

178
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:07.780
training and a tuning it before dispatching it to Sri Lanka?

179
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.310
Surely it was forced to keep doing it's station duties,

180
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.060
providing working parties for golf courses,
clubs,

181
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.920
sports events,
and other peacetime activities.
Senseless.

182
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.423
So

183
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.630
what he's saying there is that while this force was back in India,

184
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.540
instead of training,
what they were doing was,
you know,

185
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.220
helping with golf events and taking care of the local,
uh,

186
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.330
sporting events that they would do in helping with the club's cleaning up.

187
00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:44.880
They weren't training for war,
which is what they should've been doing.

188
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.860
And that's the domination squad.
That's the domination score.
Yeah.
Yeah.

189
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.450
This is the guys they were not ready

190
00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.240
where the CEO stood up,
resisted peace,
peace,
time,

191
00:13:00.241 --> 00:13:05.241
demands made by selfish piece orientated peace oriented brigade and divisional

192
00:13:06.211 --> 00:13:10.650
commanders and trained their men.
They in their units did well.

193
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.850
They saved,
they saved on casualties and sought the enemy.

194
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.900
So he's saying that this,

195
00:13:15.901 --> 00:13:19.140
the commanding officer's back in India that stood up and said,
look,

196
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:21.510
we're not gonna,
we're not gonna manage the golf game.

197
00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:25.470
We're not going to go clean up the club over there.
We're going to train for war.

198
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.000
Those guys did well.

199
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.790
We're newly inducted units failed and senselessly suffered.

200
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.090
The blame must squarely and entirely fall on the unprofessional indifferent

201
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.790
brigade and divisional commanders from WHO's formation.

202
00:13:41.791 --> 00:13:44.490
Such units came as reliefs in Sri Lanka.

203
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.840
It was a breach of faith all along.
So paint,

204
00:13:48.841 --> 00:13:51.840
so very painfully callous and unprofessional,

205
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.510
even as late as the beginning of 1989 so you had this,

206
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.801
the IPK off,

207
00:13:58.801 --> 00:14:03.450
which the Indian peace keeping force who has really fought in all kinds of

208
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:04.710
different wars all over the world.

209
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.900
But they had been sent into Sri Lanka to try and quell the violence between the

210
00:14:09.901 --> 00:14:13.470
Sri Lankan government and the Ltt.
And they,

211
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.130
first of all,
they thought they were going to be getting,

212
00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:20.660
they thought they can be in a peace keeping mission and they ended up not being,

213
00:14:20.661 --> 00:14:22.490
I mean they ended up being on a peace keeping mission,

214
00:14:22.491 --> 00:14:25.880
but they ended up in serious war combat with,

215
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.590
with the Tamil Tigers.

216
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.860
So it's these questions that he asks,

217
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.800
you know,
what kind of training did they have,

218
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.490
what attention was paid?

219
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.330
These are things that if you're in a leadership position,

220
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:44.920
you should be asking yourself,
well,

221
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.130
what position are you putting your people into and how well have you trained

222
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:50.550
them for it?
And if you have not trained them for it,

223
00:14:50.551 --> 00:14:51.980
then you need to train them for it.

224
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.510
And also assessing where you are going to end up.

225
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.080
And this is something that when I was running training in the seal teams,

226
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.320
I would always training guys for the worst case scenario.
In fact,
we would do,

227
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.480
we would set up operations where we tell them,
okay,

228
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:11.120
you're just going to go and meet with the local tribal leader and we'd,
you know,

229
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:13.820
we'd have actors that we're going to play the local tribal leader and we just

230
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:16.880
want you to go in there and you'll drink tea with them and try and gather some

231
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.040
information from them.
And so there you go.
Okay.

232
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.700
And if they didn't prepare properly,

233
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.510
they would get destroyed because of course we lower them in and say,
Oh yes,

234
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:30.170
the tribal leaders ready to meet with you.
Oh Great.
Lauren into the room.

235
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:31.760
And then all of a sudden you take that guy hostage,

236
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:34.490
you kill him and then you start.
So we'd cause total mayhem.

237
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.490
But the point was you always had to prepare for the worst case scenario.

238
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.660
And that's obviously not something that happened here.

239
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.703
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

240
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.020
<v 0>I'm going into another ambush.</v>

241
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.490
It was a good unit,

242
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:59.090
had trained and prepared well before coming into Sri Lanka in late 1988 it had

243
00:16:01.501 --> 00:16:03.060
well taped up drills.

244
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:08.390
The unit and sub unit commanders plan their operations as innovatively as

245
00:16:09.031 --> 00:16:12.750
circumstances permitted and took pains to avoid routine.

246
00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:14.280
So these guys were a little bit sharper.

247
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.720
One of the biggest things you need to watch out for in a combat situation is

248
00:16:18.721 --> 00:16:22.080
routine and doing the same thing over and over again and getting a pattern,

249
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.140
a pattern of life that people can recognize and take advantage of.

250
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.720
So these guys were trying to avoid that there.

251
00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:32.721
One slip up was that they did not take enough pains to detect the setting in of

252
00:16:33.751 --> 00:16:38.190
routine and inclination to Find Comfort in slackness.

253
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.070
So that means they did a good job when they were fresh.

254
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.310
But once they started feeling tired,

255
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.760
they would slip into routine and they'd slip into slackness like complacency,

256
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.113
complacency.

257
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.510
As a newly inducted unit,

258
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:03.570
the men were alert up and about and keen and for a long time nothing happened.

259
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.410
And this is something that people try to express about combat,

260
00:17:08.411 --> 00:17:13.240
but combat is often a lot of waiting and sometimes they picture this,

261
00:17:13.241 --> 00:17:15.130
sometimes they portrayed as well in the,

262
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.900
in the better in the better movies about combat.

263
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.800
They show,
you know,

264
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.330
these long periods of waiting and debts can be what combat is.

265
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.830
And,
and what's happening here is this unit is there.

266
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.630
<v 0>And for a long time nothing's happening.
So when nothing happens,</v>

268
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.790
you start to get more and more complacent.

269
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.140
In mid May,

270
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:48.140
1989 on a day when the road to elephant pass had to be opened by the unit,

271
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:54.050
one of the posts and route detailed it's platoon to ensure security of a stretch

272
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.570
of road for a distance of about two kilometers,

273
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:05.450
the platoon split into four parties of six to seven men each and set out to

274
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:09.720
search the road physically and secure an area,
stride to it,

275
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.960
a distance of 300 to 500 meters within its given beat.

276
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.720
Having cleared the roads,

277
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.250
these parties established squads 300 to 400 meters away from the road from where

278
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:25.470
they could observe this,
the road stretch.

279
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.480
And the area a stride it at varying intervals.

280
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:33.780
One squad was to move out and relieve the next one and so forth.

281
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.110
The chain would have relief,
would go sometimes clockwise,

282
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.070
sometimes anticlockwise.
This was to overcome boredom,

283
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:46.130
avoid routine and keep mobile at odd times and thus dominate the stretch.

284
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.890
So what they're doing is they've got their little squad set up and then

285
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.520
occasionally one squad would go move to another squad position in that squad

286
00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:56.190
would go to another squad positions.
So they would just do that to keep moving,

287
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:58.950
keep mobile,
not get complacent.

288
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.990
The road had been kept open for the whole day for up and down convoys.

289
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:07.280
So they had to keep this road open because they were running convoys,
um,

290
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.140
to another area adjacent to the road,

291
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.250
ran the railway line to over which that day two trains were to run.

292
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.050
It would be a long day as all such road rail opening days war.

293
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:23.010
So this is kind of a common mission for them to secure these roads and these

294
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:28.011
railroad tracks to get convoys through to bring logistical supplies to other

295
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:30.330
parts of the military.

296
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.700
The platoon secured the area and saw the convoy and the trains through by about

297
00:19:38.851 --> 00:19:42.780
10 30 so 10 30 in the morning they'd gone by.

298
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.980
They would now have to wait for the returning convoy and trains in the
afternoon.

299
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.390
The Sun was well up in the sky and the men were being baked.

300
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.730
Humidity added to the discomfort.

301
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.890
It was time for the squads to get up and move out to relieve the next one.

302
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.230
Number one and number two,

303
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.460
squads were north of the t junction about 400 to five meters,

304
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:06.780
500 meters away from it.

305
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:12.350
Number number four and three squads were opposite one and two respectively south

306
00:20:13.951 --> 00:20:16.740
of the road number one squad.
However,

307
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:21.890
over a period had quietly decided to reduce this distance and establish itself

308
00:20:23.161 --> 00:20:26.550
next to the t junction in a thick coconut grove,

309
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.540
which had good shade.
So there's that opportunity.

310
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:32.100
Instead of baking out in the sun,

311
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.940
we're just going to kind of get a little bit closer to the road,

312
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.560
get a little bit closer to the t junction.
We're going to sit in some shade.

313
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:44.570
The squad occupied the grove as it had been doing and relaxed against the trees.

314
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.830
It was comprised of six men.

315
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.250
They did not feel the necessity of posting centuries.

316
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.890
No guards were out.

317
00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:56.953
<v 4>Okay.</v>

318
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.170
<v 0>The militants had noticed this routine.</v>

319
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.160
So this whole time they're being observed and you know that's something you've

320
00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:05.950
always got to expect.
You've always got to expect that you're being watched.

321
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.440
About 15 millimeter militants with weapons solely drove a vehicle to the t

322
00:21:12.541 --> 00:21:17.541
junction and went on dropping a few members at four or five places around our,

323
00:21:19.141 --> 00:21:22.860
sorry,
across the branch road opposite the on alert squad,

324
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.990
barely 40 meters away.

325
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.993
<v 4>Then</v>

326
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:33.090
<v 0>occupied a few old trunk trenches dug by the Ip KF during the previous year.</v>

327
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.300
So here are these guys basically asleep and sitting in this coconut grove and 40

328
00:21:40.271 --> 00:21:42.850
meters away.
I mean you played football 40 that's less,

329
00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:44.530
less than half a football field away.

330
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.220
You've got the insurgence getting in position.

331
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.250
Is it indicating that they were doing that on purpose?
Like that.

332
00:21:54.251 --> 00:21:58.660
Was their tactic to lull them to sleep a little bit or is it just kind of just

333
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:02.080
sheer complacency on the that I think,
I don't think they,

334
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.480
I don't think he had a way to Lauren to sleep or I'm sure that they were

335
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:05.171
watching this area.

336
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:08.860
I'm sure that this was an area that they had done this mission before.

337
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:12.940
And so they probably sat there and watched them do this three or four or five or

338
00:22:12.941 --> 00:22:14.410
10 times in the past.

339
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.160
And when these guys late a world state alert than they wouldn't attack them.

340
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.890
Right.
They just watched and waited.
And finally one day they see them,

341
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:23.170
it's a hot day.
You go down and watch,

342
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.590
they see them getting complacent and they move into position.
Yeah.

343
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:29.500
So it's not like they were waiting as a tactic,

344
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:32.650
like let's not do anything and create this feeling of inactivity.

345
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.680
So they go to sleep and just happen.
They happen to get one.

346
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:37.870
I bet you didn't catch them over and over again.

347
00:22:37.871 --> 00:22:41.380
And every time that that squad was alert,
they just said,
okay,

348
00:22:41.381 --> 00:22:43.010
well we're not going to hit him.
You know,

349
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.210
we used to say that about when we were driving on my first deployment to Iraq

350
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:49.210
and we'd be driving around in our Humvees with no armor on them,

351
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:53.350
slick Humvees,
and we would say,
look,

352
00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:54.970
our protection is that we're going to look alert,

353
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.280
we're going to have our guns scanning,
we're going to be,

354
00:22:57.281 --> 00:23:00.370
everyone's going to have a gun pointed at the,
at the,
you know,

355
00:23:00.371 --> 00:23:02.830
at a target somewhere,
wherever you think would be a target.

356
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.140
So that if an surgeon is going to attack us,
they're,

357
00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:06.490
they're going to look at us and say,
you know what?

358
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:10.270
Let's wait till a little less aggressive convoy came through and it,

359
00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:13.210
and it would usually work.
I mean,
we only got to ambushed a few times and,

360
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.760
and so to generally,

361
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.880
I assume that that worked well for us considering how often ambushes were

362
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:19.714
happening

363
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.540
around 1100 around 1100 hours,

364
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.310
all of them poured bullets into the resting squad.
Not One remained alive.

365
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.050
Not One could fire back.

366
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.120
Thus just then the number four squad,
which had ups,

367
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.690
which had up stuck from its location south of the main road and was going to

368
00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:44.020
number one location,
relieve it entered into the inferno,

369
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:49.890
the volley of the militants who were watching caught and killed four of this

370
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:55.061
party too and wounded the other two just as they were entering the grove out of

371
00:23:55.741 --> 00:23:58.070
these two.
One succumb soon,

372
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:03.050
but the other who survived froze took no further apart,

373
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.030
perhaps feigning death and survived
hearing this firing

374
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:13.530
the number three squad,
which was about a kilometer away,

375
00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.480
rushed in very fast

376
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.630
and was at the site in less than 10 minutes even as the militants were still

377
00:24:20.631 --> 00:24:21.464
firing.

378
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.090
<v 4>Okay.</v>

379
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:28.090
<v 0>The number two squad also reached the site a little north simultaneously to</v>

380
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:30.440
engage the retreating militants.

381
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:35.000
This promptness was good but was not.

382
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.010
But what was not was that the two groups having connected or having contacted

383
00:24:42.011 --> 00:24:44.230
and exchange fire with the militants at that,

384
00:24:44.231 --> 00:24:49.231
so at the site did not pursue the militants and allow them a clean break and

385
00:24:50.351 --> 00:24:53.590
they allowed them a clean break.
So these other two squads,

386
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.850
when the firing started,

387
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.030
they rushed in from two different directions and actually we're in a good

388
00:24:58.031 --> 00:25:02.110
position to do some big damage to the militants,

389
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.903
but they didn't.

390
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.260
It is all the more regrettable because the two parties had contacted the

391
00:25:10.261 --> 00:25:14.760
militants from two directions and were thus in a position of considerable

392
00:25:14.761 --> 00:25:16.590
advantage.
Instead,

393
00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.430
all of them converged on the site and started getting hold of the dead and

394
00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:21.264
wounded.

395
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.860
So instead of attacking,

396
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.550
they all just converged on the guys that were dead and wounded and started

397
00:25:29.551 --> 00:25:30.384
taking care of them.

398
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:35.040
The losses amounted to 10 killed in one wounded the melts and suffered one dead.

399
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.210
So again,
a horrible situation.

400
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:45.270
The glaring example of crass complacency on the part of our brave soldiers who

401
00:25:45.271 --> 00:25:49.920
neither firmly adhere to this spirit and content of basic tactical teaching nor

402
00:25:49.921 --> 00:25:53.730
thinks it's necessary to use that little brain God has given

403
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.920
our teaching and officer's methods,

404
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:03.950
make sure that the soldier does not use his gray matter and develop guile.

405
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.500
I'm going to read that part again.
Our teaching and officer's methods.

406
00:26:11.501 --> 00:26:16.501
It makes sure that the soldier does not use his gray matter and develop guile.

407
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.580
So what he's saying is the way that they train these troops and how they treat

408
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:26.630
them,
they get them so that they don't use their brain.
They don't use their mind,

409
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.680
they don't use their brain.

410
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.570
And that's something that we've talked about on this podcast multiple times.

411
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.790
He's just going automatically,
boom,
boom.
No,

412
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:39.791
to try and make sure that the training that you do expands your brain and makes

413
00:26:40.161 --> 00:26:40.761
you think.

414
00:26:40.761 --> 00:26:45.761
And I told quite a few stories how my goal when I was running training was to

415
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:50.130
put these guys in situations where the only way out was to use their brain,

416
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:54.720
not to use their physical skills,
not to use the tactics that they already knew,

417
00:26:55.050 --> 00:27:00.050
not to fall back on on their training that had been embedded into their brain,

418
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.700
but to think of their own solution to a problem.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
Hm.

419
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:09.300
You know what?
When you,
when you enjoy the second Jujitsu,

420
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.900
when you see someone that is really masterful in Jujitsu,

421
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.720
that person that you consider that as the person that you see get into a

422
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:18.840
position and they do something completely unexpected.

423
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.410
That's the kind of training that I want to do for people to put them in

424
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:25.740
positions where they have to do something that's unexpected and new and that

425
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:30.570
they created.
Nobody from the patrol could be punished.

426
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.900
Those who made the mistake or already dead.

427
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.393
<v 2>Okay.</v>

428
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.970
<v 0>It's a damn shame.</v>

429
00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:50.320
So to talk a little bit about this book,
this book,
as I said,

430
00:27:50.321 --> 00:27:54.700
it's called assignment Jaffna by Satish Pandey,

431
00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.830
Lieutenant General Satish Pandey.

432
00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:58.243
<v 2>Okay.</v>

433
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.360
<v 0>And here's his opening to the book.</v>

434
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:04.200
And I think this is one of the most honest openings to a book I've ever heard.

435
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:09.650
This book is an attempt to present to the reader and account of Operation Power

436
00:28:09.651 --> 00:28:14.490
won are considerable endeavor on military,
Diplo,
diplomatic,

437
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.420
political front in Sri Lanka from 1987 to 1989 a period of over two and a half

438
00:28:20.551 --> 00:28:25.380
years.
And this is where I think this guy is just beautifully honest.

439
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:29.460
I lay no claim to scholarship and research on the subject,

440
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:35.210
nor have I had ready at hand documentary backup to substantiate my remarks and

441
00:28:35.371 --> 00:28:36.390
conclusions.

442
00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:41.340
I have not attempted to consult others who were closer to the decision makers or

443
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:45.510
even the decision making process itself.
I kept no notes,

444
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.280
no diaries,
not even,
not even compared notes with my peers,

445
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.640
colleagues or subordinates with my seniors.

446
00:28:53.641 --> 00:28:58.050
I had the normal all too human quota of professional animus.

447
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.670
I did my job as I understood,
perceived it or sorry,

448
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:07.260
perceived and fought it appropriate in my post retirement glow.

449
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.030
I simply reminisced,
memories,

450
00:29:11.031 --> 00:29:15.800
researched as I did so not always with Precyse,
contextual precision perhaps,

451
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:20.750
but with sufficient clarity to heat up illuminate and see through this effort.

452
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.980
And this is something that I went when I've run the,

453
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.470
the books that have always kind of hit me in the books that we've used in this

454
00:29:30.471 --> 00:29:34.070
podcast are these books that I find value in.

455
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.750
And that's the books with kind of on altered FOBTs and it's usually coming from

456
00:29:38.751 --> 00:29:42.010
the person itself.
And that's,
that's one thing that automatically

457
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.610
gives me a,
a,
a negative impression or not a negative impression.

458
00:29:47.611 --> 00:29:51.740
But I love hearing the voice of the person that did it.
Right.
You know,

459
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:55.110
I want to hear from that person.
As soon as you interpret it,

460
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.120
as soon as someone else interpret it,
you know,

461
00:29:57.121 --> 00:29:59.550
it's getting spun somewhere another intentionally or not.

462
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.500
There's a different viewpoint.
And you know,

463
00:30:01.501 --> 00:30:04.800
this is something that I used to when we,
when we were running training,

464
00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.210
when I was running training,

465
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:10.860
and you'd have a guy do something that you have a guy come into a room and you

466
00:30:10.861 --> 00:30:12.240
know,
this is just a training operation,

467
00:30:12.241 --> 00:30:15.360
but used to have a guy coming to a Roman and there'd be,
you know,

468
00:30:15.361 --> 00:30:20.130
a doorway or a prisoner or a hostage and they would do something like,

469
00:30:20.131 --> 00:30:24.180
like dumb or crazy or wrong.
But

470
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.990
you know,
some guys would say,
you know,
go and do it again.

471
00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.910
[inaudible] you'll go and do that again.

472
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.280
And although we would definitely make them do it again,

473
00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:37.370
I would always make them deal with what they did because they did whatever their

474
00:30:37.591 --> 00:30:40.890
instincts told them to do and what your instincts told them to guess what your

475
00:30:40.891 --> 00:30:43.270
instincts were wrong.
Now you still have to deal with it.
Mm.

476
00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:49.470
So I like these guys that,
that talk about what they did.

477
00:30:49.471 --> 00:30:53.140
And as you can see from those first two,
you know,
stories disguise,

478
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.470
talking about what they did wrong,
what would,

479
00:30:55.471 --> 00:30:58.850
what happened bad and his assessment of,

480
00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.920
of why coming to continue it is the account of the happenings as seen through

481
00:31:05.221 --> 00:31:09.870
the eyes of a divisional commander who in war in my opinion and experience is

482
00:31:09.871 --> 00:31:14.490
the main link between strategy and tactics and the main difference between

483
00:31:14.491 --> 00:31:18.480
perception and insight,
so he's in a good position.

484
00:31:18.481 --> 00:31:23.190
He's kind of seeing what was it,
what you know,

485
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.520
how that strategy of what the,
what the goal was,

486
00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.230
how that got interpreted into the ground.

487
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.440
There are others who cherish macro level viewing and tend to underrate ground

488
00:31:37.991 --> 00:31:41.740
realities.
This is another thing that I always look for.

489
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.730
Now of course I'm interested in what the general say.
Absolutely.

490
00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:49.240
I'm always interested in what the president say or what the the the prime

491
00:31:49.241 --> 00:31:52.630
minister says and how the generals took dad and what they did with it and those

492
00:31:52.631 --> 00:31:55.150
broad strategies.
I'm very interested in that.

493
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:58.120
I always want to read about that in what he's saying it.

494
00:31:58.121 --> 00:32:01.900
There's others that cherish the macro level viewing,

495
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:07.410
which is what that is the generals and tend to underrate the ground realities

496
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:09.130
and I agree with him.

497
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.300
I belong to the former category.

498
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.310
Mine was termed a worm's view and I preferred it that way.

499
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:23.670
Meaning he is the guy that was on the ground and this is what he saw as he as if

500
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:27.610
he was a worm on the ground.
That's how on the ground he was.

501
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.060
I knew exactly where I stood.

502
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.920
It is this that produced considerable disillusionment,

503
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:41.310
friction and differences with superior's superior headquarters and planners.

504
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:42.680
Once again,

505
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:47.630
this is something that I always find intriguing when you get these guys,

506
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:52.130
these soldiers,
people like Hackworth,
people that are dedicated,

507
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:53.020
you know,

508
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:58.020
lifelong military members and they get this twist of disillusionment and

509
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.270
suspicion against their higher headquarters.

510
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.900
I kept shouting myself,
hoarse,

511
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.200
but the juggernaut rolled on on heating.

512
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.040
So despite this guy's protests and talking and trying to explain,

513
00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.343
<v 1>okay,</v>

514
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.330
<v 0>the juggernaut rolled on on heating,</v>

515
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:28.500
there is a school of thought which says that mistakes were bound to be made in

516
00:33:28.501 --> 00:33:33.501
the complex and undertaking of projecting power outside or national geographical

517
00:33:33.871 --> 00:33:37.980
confines and that these have to be taken in stride.

518
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.220
So yeah,
hey look,
we're going to have mistakes.
They're going to happen.

519
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.530
We just have to deal with them and,
and move on.

520
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.580
But he goes on.

521
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:52.660
My contention is that if we consider ourselves professional soldiers and experts

522
00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:58.060
in concerned fields than there was no need to and no excuse for committee

523
00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.020
committing most of these mistakes after all,

524
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:07.190
it was human lives and limbs which were being lost.

525
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.490
We know we have an abundance of manpower,

526
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.100
even cheap human lives in this country,

527
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.570
but that does not give us the power of attorney to waste them.

528
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.650
And I think that's a sediment that anybody that's been on the front lines can

529
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.350
understand is that it's,

530
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:36.890
it's easy to write those checks from the government or from the rear echelon or

531
00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:43.840
from
the safe place.

532
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:49.770
But those checks that you're writing are our human lives and no one should write

533
00:34:52.691 --> 00:34:55.900
that check without a heavy burden on their mind.

534
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.630
There is a good deal of I in the narration,

535
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:08.390
it is not so much because of my ego to show up myself or to put others always in

536
00:35:11.031 --> 00:35:11.864
the doc,

537
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:17.290
but simply because it is a compilation of what I as a cog in the gigantic wheel

538
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.670
saw,
felt perceived and god influenced by.

539
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:28.520
I think it's interesting that this guy
is saying,
look,

540
00:35:28.521 --> 00:35:31.640
the book's about me and I apologize and I'm not trying to be egotistical.

541
00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:33.770
And actually in reading that right now,

542
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:39.000
I know that on multiple discussions I've had about the book that Leif and I

543
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:42.570
wrote,
we're doing the same thing.
We're like,
look,
hey,
it's not,
it's,
you know,

544
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:45.780
sorry,
it's a we're not,
it's not about us.

545
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:49.410
It's about what we learned and I think he's trying to make the scenes the same

546
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:50.244
statement there.

547
00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:57.670
Sri Lanka was a fascinating assignment.
The most challenging of my life,

548
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.250
the most tense,
the most rewarding.

549
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.230
And I think that anybody that's been in tens combat will tell you that's the

550
00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:09.650
most rewarding thing that they will do in their life.

551
00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.760
I am grateful to my colleagues,
subordinates,

552
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.820
peers and our magnificent men steady solid as they are.

553
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:27.450
I have a high regard for the LTTE for its discipline,

554
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.670
dedication,
determination,

555
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:34.590
motivation and text and technical expertise.
So there he is,

556
00:36:34.591 --> 00:36:38.640
he's talking about the enemy and you've heard me say it on here is you have to

557
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:41.400
respect your enemy and there he is.

558
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.300
He is high regard for the Ltt and it's discipline and dedication and

559
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:49.260
determination,
motivation and their technical expertise.
That's everything

560
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.560
but find little justification in it's senseless.

561
00:36:55.590 --> 00:37:00.590
Mulish destructive insistence on continuation of military means in the search of

562
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:04.080
an honorable solution to the two mule problem in Sri Lanka

563
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:08.580
and he goes on,

564
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.860
I think some of my erstwhile subordinates for helping me refresh my memory.

565
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.720
Most of them took me seriously in war and remain two steps ahead of me in their

566
00:37:18.721 --> 00:37:21.720
spheres.
God bless them.
So

567
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.590
like me looking at the guys that worked with me and for me,

568
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.130
I hold them in the highest regard for taking care of me.

569
00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.720
Then he's saying the same thing,
fashion apart.

570
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:41.290
I genuinely feel I must dedicate this personal account to the young officer,

571
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.930
the young soldiers and the Jaffna two meals who made me a good soldier and a

572
00:37:47.991 --> 00:37:50.570
better human being in my own eyes.

573
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.580
I think that's just an outstanding opening for a book.

574
00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:03.270
Now getting into the tactics

575
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:10.460
on their arrival,
he goes on to say our tactics were predetermined,

576
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.730
straight jacketed,
predictable and reactive.

577
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:19.130
These rows only a little above what is known as minor tactics and military

578
00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:19.881
terminology.

579
00:38:19.881 --> 00:38:23.990
That is tactical arraignments and drills at section and platoon level.

580
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.020
Counterinsurgency operations demanded far more innovative and integrative

581
00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:33.740
formulations at company battalion and formation levels.

582
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:35.943
This is

583
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.243
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

584
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.990
<v 0>obviously something that we had to deal with in Ramadi and that was this idea of</v>

585
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.410
counter insurgency.
You know,
it's,
it's so,

586
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.210
it's infinitely more complex than a situation where,
you know,

587
00:38:50.211 --> 00:38:54.050
two uniformed military groups are fighting against each other.

588
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.910
Everything is clear.
It's very easy to understand.

589
00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:01.070
You know they have a different shaped helmet,

590
00:39:01.071 --> 00:39:05.000
they have a different colored uniform and we're going to get on our different

591
00:39:05.001 --> 00:39:09.620
sides of the lines and we're going to go and destroy him and an insurgency is

592
00:39:09.621 --> 00:39:12.650
just infinitely more complex.
People mixed in with the populace,

593
00:39:12.651 --> 00:39:15.650
the populace swaying back and forth on who they support,

594
00:39:15.651 --> 00:39:18.050
wanting to protect the populous from the insurgence,

595
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.380
some of the populace supporting the insurgency and some of the populace

596
00:39:21.381 --> 00:39:24.710
supporting the the the host nation or the friendlies.
It's just a,

597
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:29.060
it's just an infinitely more complex situation.

598
00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.000
How he explains it.

599
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:36.440
Counterinsurgency remains essentially accompany in platoon commanders battle

600
00:39:36.441 --> 00:39:37.250
task,

601
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:41.870
so he's saying that it is those front line guys that are actually going to make

602
00:39:41.871 --> 00:39:46.340
it happen.
However he goes on there.
Concerted,
integrated,

603
00:39:46.341 --> 00:39:50.060
mutually responsive and interconnected employment demands,

604
00:39:50.061 --> 00:39:53.240
particularized tactics at battalion and brigade levels.

605
00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:59.140
And what that means is that the person who is overall in charge has got to do an

606
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:03.950
outstanding job of explaining what the mission is and explaining how it's

607
00:40:03.951 --> 00:40:08.000
connected and explaining how what is going to happen on the front line is going

608
00:40:08.001 --> 00:40:09.470
to affect the broad strategy.

609
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.700
That getting that commander's intent down to the front lines is critical.

610
00:40:13.701 --> 00:40:17.510
And this is something that when I was in Ramadi and I was working for Colonel

611
00:40:17.511 --> 00:40:19.490
Sean Mcfarlane,
whose now general macfarlane,

612
00:40:19.491 --> 00:40:22.700
who is just an unbelievably outstanding leader,

613
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.150
but he was able to get his intent,
you know,

614
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:30.710
from him to the battalions to the companies,
to the platoons,

615
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.380
to the squads,
and right down to the frontline leadership,
very,

616
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:42.260
very similar situation that Colonel Mcfarlane was able to execute in a

617
00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:45.860
just a,
just an outstanding way.

618
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.513
<v 4>So now</v>

619
00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.000
<v 0>we get to beyond that the strategy or beyond the tactics and it,</v>

620
00:40:56.001 --> 00:40:58.130
and as we talked about on the last podcast,

621
00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.160
what always interests me more is the principles of war and how different people

622
00:41:04.971 --> 00:41:09.971
in different situations see those principles and how will his principles of war

623
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.550
can be translated into principles of life

624
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:19.740
and principles of business and principles of fighting and principles of

625
00:41:19.741 --> 00:41:22.650
relationships and everything that you're doing.

626
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:28.250
And really also the principles of the war within and the war that we have within

627
00:41:31.591 --> 00:41:36.591
ourselves to beat back the insurgents set center in our mind.

628
00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:37.910
You know,

629
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.330
being back lit emotions that are in our mind that are trying to make us weak and

630
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:46.340
trying to bring us down and trying to keep us from being the best that we can
be.

631
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.390
So those principles awar apply to so many different things.

632
00:41:50.391 --> 00:41:53.090
And that's why I find them so fascinating.

633
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:56.720
And luckily enough,

634
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:02.290
the good general has a section that's called principles of war.

635
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:09.020
Principles of war distilled from conventional warfare are well known,

636
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.910
but their degree of relevance,
relevance in insurgency wars is not the same.

637
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:19.520
Again,
we're talking about insurgency,
much more complex.

638
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:24.970
Insurgency is total war in the sense that involved people too in an intimate and

639
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:30.650
positive manner.
Employees,
all [inaudible],
news of war,
political,

640
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.890
social,
economic,
psychological,

641
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.750
diplomatic and military.

642
00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:41.260
It exemplifies determination and readiness for great sacrifices in pursuance of

643
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:43.610
its goals.

644
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:50.190
It eggs,
I'm going to read that again,
Echo,
I'm not sure you got it.

645
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:55.250
It exemplifies determination and readiness for great sacrifices in pursuance of

646
00:42:55.801 --> 00:42:57.930
its goals.
So what you're trying to achieve in,

647
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:02.970
in an insurgency and counter insurgency situation is so hard to achieve.

648
00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.053
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

649
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.060
<v 0>it is so difficult to achieve.</v>

650
00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:12.370
Insurgency is an unrelenting low intensity,

651
00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:17.490
long drawn war with time and opportunity serving the interests of the insurgent

652
00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:24.250
and wherein the insurgent designs to overcome his weakness in one's fear with

653
00:43:24.251 --> 00:43:26.140
strength in the others.

654
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.770
So in an insurgency

655
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:36.580
they don't have tanks but they have time and they can wait you out and they can

656
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.800
just pick away at you the death of a thousand cuts.
That's what the fear is.

657
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:47.390
And that's how the insurgent is going to win is the death of a thousand cuts.

658
00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.910
And when I think about

659
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.370
me or you or us as individuals,

660
00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.720
it's those little things.
It's those little cuts.
It's those little times.

661
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:00.500
It's those little,

662
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.440
those little situations where you cut yourself a little bit of slack.

663
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:04.953
<v 5>Okay.</v>

664
00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.570
<v 0>And that's the insurgent winning that seems surgeon beating you.</v>

665
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.320
So the principals themselves,

666
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.190
relentless pursuance of the aim.

667
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:27.580
The LTTE was clear in its aim and unrelenting in its pursuit,

668
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.190
Islam and political settlement on its terms.

669
00:44:35.191 --> 00:44:39.090
Islam was the name that they wanted to give the the state for the the two meals.

670
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.990
And that was their clear aim with no,

671
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:48.540
no other possible modifications to that.
They wanted their own state period.

672
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.510
On the other hand,

673
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.660
we were not very clear about our aim destruction of the Ltt or weakening it if

674
00:44:58.021 --> 00:45:03.000
the ladder then to what degree we had not fought through the eventuality of the

675
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:07.350
Sri Lankan government refusing to fulfill.
It's part of the accord obligations.

676
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:12.920
We did not know what to do with a warring LTT hostile population or recalcitrant

677
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:17.700
Sherlock and government.
And as it finally turned out,

678
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:22.380
we were not even sure of what our national interests were.
And what military,

679
00:45:22.381 --> 00:45:27.381
infantry intervention and later military operations we're required to achieve.

680
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.930
This is when you hear all the time about people saying,
Oh,

681
00:45:32.931 --> 00:45:34.820
you've got to write down your goals,
so this is what they're talking about.

682
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.590
You got to know what your goals are.

683
00:45:36.591 --> 00:45:41.420
You got to have them clear and then you got to have a relentless pursuance of

684
00:45:41.421 --> 00:45:44.840
the aim.
That's how you get things done.

685
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:47.900
It's kind of like when people were like,
I got to get in better shape,

686
00:45:47.901 --> 00:45:51.350
but that's it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

687
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.870
It needs to be a clear goal.
What does that mean?

688
00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.820
Is that a certain amount of running?

689
00:45:55.821 --> 00:45:58.940
Is that a body weight that you're trying to reach and a strength goal?

690
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:02.330
What does that goal,
do you write it down?

691
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.910
Do you know exactly what it is and is it clear?

692
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.533
<v 4>Next</v>

693
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.030
<v 0>aggressive spirit.
It's an interesting how we keep hearing this word,</v>

694
00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:18.860
aggression and aggressiveness in all these different principles of war.

695
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.740
Aggressiveness is so important.

696
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:27.020
And we talked about on the last podcast and I talked about how it had to be

697
00:46:27.021 --> 00:46:31.490
balanced,
but it,
it has to be balanced,
but man,

698
00:46:31.491 --> 00:46:35.720
it has to be there.
That aggressiveness has got to be there in low intensity,

699
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.670
long drawn conflict.

700
00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:42.760
Unflagging aggressive spirit is a vital importance far more than in conventional

701
00:46:43.341 --> 00:46:44.174
offensive action.

702
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:49.810
The LTTE had realized it thoroughly and practiced it with great deliberation and

703
00:46:51.771 --> 00:46:55.670
to great effect.
We were somewhat lacking in it.

704
00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.780
And why I think this insurgency in this talking about an insurgency and when

705
00:47:01.781 --> 00:47:04.780
we're talking about life and becoming better

706
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:10.670
is because it is a long term struggle,
right?
You know,
um,

707
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.370
the,
the war,
the,
the conventional war is a fast war where you,
you,

708
00:47:15.371 --> 00:47:18.590
you know what's going to happen.
You know what you're,
you know who your enemy is,

709
00:47:18.591 --> 00:47:22.190
you go and you fight him in.
It's done.
It's very easy.
The conventional,

710
00:47:22.191 --> 00:47:23.270
I mean the,
the,

711
00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.970
the insurgent war is more like what we go through as humans trying to improve

712
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:30.370
because it's a long

713
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:33.670
<v 6>drawn out struggle and we're,</v>

714
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.140
we got Pete pieces of our brain that are changing sides just like the local

715
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:40.960
populace might in.
It's very,
very challenging.

716
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:45.730
And that's why this notion of aggressiveness and knowing what your aim is and

717
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:50.350
then this relentless pursuance of this aim and getting aggressive as you pursue

718
00:47:50.351 --> 00:47:54.880
that aim.
Can you see how,
how important those are obviously in an,

719
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.830
in a counter insurgency situation,

720
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:01.510
but also as you develop your plan to become a better person and a better leader?

721
00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:04.840
Absolutely critical.
Especially,
I mean,

722
00:48:04.841 --> 00:48:08.760
one of the many things similar to the surgeon,
um,

723
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:13.240
comparison is the temptations that come up every day.

724
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:17.470
No matter if you're trying to,
I don't know,
make more money,
you know,

725
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.340
with your own business or get in shape.
Getting into busy is a good one,
I think.

726
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.840
So easy to talk about.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

727
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:28.330
And a lot of parallels that in my opinion are really clear.
So these temptations,

728
00:48:28.331 --> 00:48:29.320
just like the insurgence,

729
00:48:29.321 --> 00:48:34.300
they'll pop up or they won't be around for a day,
two days,

730
00:48:34.301 --> 00:48:38.860
and then one day it's your best friend's birthday and you know,

731
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:41.840
he's going to,
I don't know,
Dunkin donuts or something for,
you know,

732
00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:46.170
is there it is birthday and there it is,
let's say.
Yeah.
And his surgeon attack.

733
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:50.140
Yeah.
And they come up every day unexpected.
Well,
sometimes they're expected,

734
00:48:50.141 --> 00:48:53.440
but sometimes not expected.
Yeah.
And it's just so dynamic in that way.
We're,

735
00:48:53.441 --> 00:48:56.920
all these things are there to kind of get you and what's good when those things

736
00:48:56.921 --> 00:48:57.461
come to get,

737
00:48:57.461 --> 00:49:01.750
you get in the aggressive mindset where you get aggressive with that situation,

738
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:04.230
you get aggressive with those donuts.
Yeah.
It'll be aggressively,

739
00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.020
aggressively putting them in the garden.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's so true.

740
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:12.430
And when these things do come up,
it's,
so,
it's so much,
I don't say,
yeah,
I would,

741
00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.000
I would say easier to be like,
no,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm on the program right now.

742
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.880
If you're aggressive approaches,
if you're like,
you know,

743
00:49:18.881 --> 00:49:23.740
I'm going to allow excuses to get in my head or kind of kind of pussy foot

744
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:25.030
around and be like,
well,
you know,

745
00:49:25.031 --> 00:49:28.000
moderation is all right kind of thing and have that attitude,

746
00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:31.180
it's going to get you mad.
Good.
Yeah.
You're aggressive.
You can take,
you know,

747
00:49:31.181 --> 00:49:35.380
take us to take in a way to take pride in the fact that,
nope,

748
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.450
I'm not eating those out to,
nope,
I'm not drinking.

749
00:49:37.451 --> 00:49:39.360
I'm not going out to the club drinking.
I got arrested,

750
00:49:39.361 --> 00:49:43.330
I got to work out in the morning,
or whatever.
Yeah.
That aggression does help,
man.

751
00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:47.200
That aggression does.
It's,
it's almost like if you don't,

752
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:52.120
if you do kind of just kind of Tiptoe your way through it,
it wins.

753
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:55.450
Yeah.
That's what,
that's exactly.
You mean get it does the same thing with this.

754
00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.060
With a counterinsurgency,
you have to be aggressive.

755
00:49:58.061 --> 00:50:00.800
You can't let those little things creep in.
Yeah,
man.

756
00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.990
You've got to keep that relent,

757
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:05.590
relentless pursuance of the AME and you've got to do it aggressively.
Yeah.

758
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.340
Next surprise.

759
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:14.200
This embraces surprise at tactical,
strategic and political levels.

760
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:20.860
The IPK efforts.
That's Union peacekeeping force could not do anything,

761
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.030
could not do anything in tactical field.

762
00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:27.980
It was unable to match the Ltt mainly because

763
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.660
<v 0>of the lack of innovation and serious application of all our professional acumen</v>

764
00:50:32.661 --> 00:50:35.330
to stymie our,
to sign me the LTTE.

765
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:39.620
Our methods largely remained conventional.

766
00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.130
So surprise

767
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:47.630
and how important surprises.
Now

768
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.790
how do we surprise ourselves?
I can tell you,

769
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:57.020
and you've got to surprise yourself if you,
if you can surprise yourself,

770
00:50:57.050 --> 00:50:59.060
it means you lack creativity.

771
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.890
If you're not coming up with new ideas and new ways to do things,

772
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:08.500
you're lacking creativity and you're lacking surprise.
So you know,

773
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:12.680
I was,
I've been traveling a bunch lately and guess what?

774
00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:17.240
Sometimes it had been a hotel room and I got to get creative on how I'm going to

775
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:20.390
aggressively pursue my aims.
And that means I got to do,
you know,

776
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.960
maybe my workout is 300 burpees.
That's it.
Boom.

777
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.120
No squat rack there,
no pull up bar,
no rings,
no row or nothing.

778
00:51:29.121 --> 00:51:32.900
No kettle bells,
no.
I guess what I'm,
my soul gets crushed.

779
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:38.510
But that's just being creative and aggressively adapting to the situations that

780
00:51:38.511 --> 00:51:41.110
you get put into [inaudible].
So you got it.

781
00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.450
You got to maintain that adaptability,
that creativity all the time.

782
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:46.880
And I think that's absolutely critical men.

783
00:51:46.881 --> 00:51:51.530
And it's yet another one of those times where it's so easy to be like,
Dang,

784
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:55.150
this hotel doesn't have a gym.
Oh yeah.
In art or it's dancers.
No,

785
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:59.120
like really healthy food around.
There's the Mcdonald's right there.
Yeah.

786
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:03.380
There's no healthy food in this town even.
Yeah.

787
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.780
So then that healthy food thing,
especially when you look,

788
00:52:05.781 --> 00:52:09.830
start looking at intermittent fasting,
you know,
oh,

789
00:52:09.831 --> 00:52:14.370
you're in the airport and they don't have,
you know,
all you can get is those,
um,

790
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:18.860
those little hot dogs wrapped in a pretzel.
Those things are so tasty,

791
00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:22.510
but you know,
like you should not be eating those.
Right.

792
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:28.370
And sometimes you,
you're like,
oh,
okay,
I'll eat them.
Why?

793
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:32.660
You should be on the intermittent fast when you're in a travel situation.
Yeah.

794
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:36.350
You don't need to be eating.
And I'm telling you this right now,

795
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:39.710
and it's fresh in my memory because I had two of those bad boys this morning

796
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:43.100
and they were good.
Yeah.

797
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.720
The weakness crept in and I got some of those Pretzel Laptop Dogs,

798
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.850
Ang,
nobody's perfect.
Nobody's perfect.

799
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.340
Next one.
Mobility and flexibility.

800
00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:02.600
The insurgent must developed,
must develop intelligent and guile.

801
00:53:02.601 --> 00:53:04.510
Full flexibility in planning,

802
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:09.320
conducting and overseeing actions so as to retain initiative,

803
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:14.560
suffer the least damage and yet keep the opponent guessing and in a prolonged

804
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:19.820
state of readiness and uncertainty.
So that's what the surgeon has to do.

805
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.530
They gotta be super flexible.

806
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:26.670
They got to keep you guessing and keep you in a prolonged state of readiness.

807
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:30.000
That's uh,
that sounds good,
right?
Prolonged state of readiness.
It sounds good,

808
00:53:30.001 --> 00:53:33.140
but it's actually not good when you're constantly on edge.
Right?

809
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:36.000
That's wears people down.
It breaks them down over time.

810
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:41.820
But where we failed was we did not exhibit enough flexibility in our strategic

811
00:53:41.821 --> 00:53:44.880
and tactical plans and their guy awful execution.

812
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.220
We add to seize the initiative and pose challenges to the Ltt,

813
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:54.930
which we largely failed to do.
So you,
you know,
mobility,
flexibility,

814
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.860
suddenly we talk about all the time on this podcast is having the ability to

815
00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:03.090
adapt and be flexible.
And you know,
whether it's working out in a hotel room,

816
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.140
whether it's,
you know,

817
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:08.430
finding something good to eat or not eating because there is nothing good to
eat,

818
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.630
whether it's being in a leadership situation and you're adapting to a

819
00:54:12.631 --> 00:54:17.040
personality that you,
that is awkward or different or you're not ready for,

820
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:21.510
or a situation that needs to be overcome.
That's flexibility and mobility.

821
00:54:21.511 --> 00:54:22.830
And you have to maintain that

822
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.770
motivation and discipline

823
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:34.470
in prolonged slow bleeding,

824
00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:37.530
low intensity people oriented struggle,

825
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:42.740
motivation and discipline as ingredients of morale are far more important.

826
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.800
The LTTE and the people had both these tool remarkable degree,

827
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:56.100
the IPK F's.
Discipline was as good as any armies,

828
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.990
even the LDTS,

829
00:54:58.620 --> 00:55:03.620
but it's motivation was limited to the spirit of professionalism only we were

830
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:08.160
soldiers we did as ordered.

831
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:14.090
So the LTTE had this passionate goal that they were going after and that

832
00:55:14.671 --> 00:55:15.990
encouraged their discipline.

833
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:20.970
They understood why they were doing what they were doing,

834
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.580
and that's something they had that clear goal.
They understood,

835
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:25.380
why are we doing this?
Because we want our own state.

836
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.980
Now did the IPK F know why they're doing what they're doing?
No,

837
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:33.090
they did not.
They just,
he just talked about that.

838
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.700
He just talked about how they could,
they didn't know what their goal was.

839
00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:37.110
They didn't know how it was going to affect.

840
00:55:37.111 --> 00:55:39.690
They didn't know they even know what their end state was supposed to be.

841
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:43.020
So when you take that away from them,
even though they're disciplined troops,

842
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:46.440
they missed that last level.
And that's why.

843
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.600
Why are you doing this?

844
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:54.020
And that is why it's so important for you as you try and reach your goals as you

845
00:55:54.031 --> 00:55:57.420
try and get something done.
You keep that in mind of why you're doing this.

846
00:55:57.421 --> 00:55:58.740
What's the end state going to be?

847
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:00.810
Cause it's so easy to lose track of the end state.

848
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:02.280
I mean if you're trying to make,

849
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.760
you know you're trying to get gained 25 pounds of muscle,

850
00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:09.690
I mean that's going to take you a couple of years possibly.
Hmm.

851
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:14.220
If you're trying to make $1 million bag may take you 10 years,

852
00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:18.030
might take you six years.
That's a long ways.
And there's a lot of distractions.

853
00:56:18.031 --> 00:56:22.470
I can come on home away.
Yeah.
And to your point,
consider why.

854
00:56:22.471 --> 00:56:23.830
Why do you want to gain 25 months?

855
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.300
<v 6>We'll say losing weight,
right?
So it's,
let's say you're,</v>

856
00:56:27.301 --> 00:56:29.620
you have a photo shoot,

857
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.700
where are you going on spring break or something like that.

858
00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:36.190
Let me just think of all the big photo shoots at a weight that's never happened.

859
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:38.530
Okay.
Let's talk about this.
Let's talk about,

860
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.050
you're trying to lose weight because you're trying to be healthy,
right?

861
00:56:41.051 --> 00:56:45.310
That's a longterm goal.
That's realistic.
Yes.
Yeah.
And whatever that means.
Right?

862
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:49.300
Healthy.
Um,
or,
or what have your healthy person already,
but you just want to,

863
00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:53.870
<v 0>I dunno,
look better or,
or</v>

864
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.660
<v 6>achieve something.
However you've got a Jujitsu tournament coming up.
Yeah.</v>

865
00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.170
Have some weight.
Right.
Cut some weight.
Right.
Right.
Exactly.

866
00:57:00.171 --> 00:57:03.980
So it makes it so much easier to,
to cut.
I mean,
for the most part,

867
00:57:03.981 --> 00:57:07.070
when you have a specific goals.
Yeah.
So you've got a fight coming up.

868
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.350
That guy's going to cut that.
Wait,
wait quick.

869
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:11.630
You hear these guys cutting all this weight like Oh yeah,

870
00:57:11.631 --> 00:57:16.631
he has a fight in a month and a half and he got a cut 40 pounds and then he'll

871
00:57:17.001 --> 00:57:20.540
do it.
Yup.
Cause yeah,
I mean obviously the train athletes as well,
but that,

872
00:57:20.541 --> 00:57:23.660
that goal and understanding it man helps so much.
Yeah.

873
00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:27.340
<v 0>Especially when I'm going to read this part again in and again,</v>

874
00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:30.430
we talk about when you're trying to get stuff done as a person,

875
00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:34.330
it's a prolonged slow bleeding,

876
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:39.400
low intensity people oriented struggle.
That's what it is.

877
00:57:39.401 --> 00:57:41.950
That's what you're up against.
Yeah.
No,
that's what you're up against.

878
00:57:41.951 --> 00:57:43.120
It's a Lo of the,

879
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:47.200
anything that's worth achieving as a person eight takes all those.
It's long,

880
00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:49.210
it's slow.
It's probably,
you know,
there's nothing that you go,
oh,

881
00:57:49.211 --> 00:57:51.520
this is going to be the ultimate achievement of my life and it's gonna take you

882
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:52.840
15 minutes to do.
No.
Yeah.

883
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:57.430
It's going to take you months and months and months and years of effort of
blood,

884
00:57:57.431 --> 00:57:58.720
sweat and tears to get there.

885
00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:03.943
<v 4>Now</v>

886
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.180
<v 0>continuing with discipline and morale.</v>

887
00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.410
This goes into a section of the book where he starts talking about their

888
00:58:11.411 --> 00:58:15.460
performance.
And we're going to take a little bit of a of a turn here,

889
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.500
but I think it's important to bring up

890
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:23.050
in the initial stages of the war.

891
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:29.070
In October to December of 1987 there were complaints and reports of rape,

892
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:34.900
looting and wanton destruction indulged in by the Ip Kf.

893
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:41.200
When a soldier is pushed and led into a blind alley,

894
00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:46.740
like the situation in Jaffna where it's suddenly changed from so well,

895
00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:48.240
Tom,
Tom,

896
00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:52.390
peace keeping operations into a full fledged battlefield,

897
00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:58.170
he feels terribly insecure and start seeing an enemy all over.

898
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:01.300
So we talked about this earlier.

899
00:59:01.301 --> 00:59:04.750
These guys thought they were going on nice peacekeeping mission and they'd put

900
00:59:04.751 --> 00:59:08.920
their blue helmets on and you know,
be a referee.

901
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:10.361
Well,

902
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:15.361
the referee good gets attacked and this is starting to talk about the

903
00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:19.600
psychological effect it has and they start seeing an enemy everywhere.

904
00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.810
You know,
and this me of when I was in high school and,

905
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:25.740
and I was lucky enough to have a bunch of,

906
00:59:25.741 --> 00:59:28.850
of Vietnam vets that were put me through high school.

907
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:33.440
And when I was in high school,
the movie platoon came out.
Then of course I was,

908
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:35.600
you know,
you know,
all into war and whatnot.

909
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:41.380
So I went and saw the movie platoon and one of my teachers that was in Vietnam

910
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:46.280
had seen the movie as well.
And I,
I asked him straight up,
you know,
hey,

911
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:51.500
what'd you think of the movie?
And he explained to me

912
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:58.030
in a very solemn way that the movie depicted these Americans going in and you

913
00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:02.600
know,
brutalizing these villages and in,
you know,

914
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:06.560
doing horrible things to these villagers.
But he,
the way he explained it to me,

915
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.150
he said,
listen,
you know,
we'd be in,

916
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:13.190
in and around a village for three or four weeks.

917
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.340
And in that three or four weeks,
they,

918
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:21.700
the Americans would lose seven or eight guys to booby traps.

919
01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:26.300
And meanwhile the villagers don't hit any booby traps.

920
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.900
So they're out walking the same trails in the same areas through the right same

921
01:00:29.901 --> 01:00:32.440
rice paddies and the,

922
01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.770
the villagers aren't hitting any booby traps.
They're not getting blown up,

923
01:00:36.771 --> 01:00:40.460
they're not getting killed.
So that means they kind of know where they are.

924
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:45.970
And he said that kind of frustration is exactly what this is talking about right

925
01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:48.110
here in an,

926
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:52.310
and going back to it in an insurgency sparked and sustained by an opponent who

927
01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:56.570
is dressed in civilian clothes but shoots and blows him up.
Unseen.

928
01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:02.140
Suspicion alone takes a vicious turn when he sees his comrades being killed by

929
01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:06.890
innocent looking civilians,
blending again into the civilian population,

930
01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:12.280
he gets into a rage and anger against the uncertainty and the unseen.

931
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.850
At that point,

932
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:22.090
his pent up tension welling feeling of helplessness and burning desire to

933
01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:28.511
explode into a release of counter violence are in frantic search of a tangible

934
01:01:29.241 --> 01:01:32.780
object he can master on object,

935
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:35.270
which is weak and helpless itself.

936
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.700
What better object than a frightened week cowering woman and on gardened,

937
01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:48.780
an unguarded wide open shop and on resisting defenseless house and it's feeble

938
01:01:49.911 --> 01:01:54.080
occupants who shelter the unseen,
deceitful opponent.

939
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:56.810
Had obtained by whatever means

940
01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.260
it is madness.

941
01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:04.220
The animal in him that rules momentarily.

942
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:09.380
He is wild,
but just for a brief spell,

943
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.610
if he can get ahold of himself or if someone controls him in that moment of

944
01:02:13.611 --> 01:02:17.900
crisis,
of Cathartic explosion,

945
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:23.320
he might in all get over his base or instincts where this does not happen than

946
01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:29.490
the explosion manifests,
manifests in counter assault,

947
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:34.290
rape,
loot and wanton destruction,
seeking release from tension,

948
01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:36.510
fear and rage,

949
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.600
education,
motivation,

950
01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:46.430
communication and company are good anecdotes,

951
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:51.830
antidotes,
sorry.
Most culprits realize

952
01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:59.660
within minutes of their act and repent,
weeping like children.

953
01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:05.150
I saw an officer with 27 years of service breaking down like this,

954
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.890
so that's what happens to people.

955
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.470
I think there's so much in that paragraph,
this,

956
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:24.300
this paragraph about this pent up tension and we've got to remember that it's

957
01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:29.301
extreme in a situation like this and that the tension is extreme.

958
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.400
The fear is extreme.
The rage is extreme,

959
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
but and obviously for those that are listening that are in combat right now that

960
01:03:38.851 --> 01:03:43.110
are deployed overseas,
these are things that you,
you have to watch out for.

961
01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:44.370
And especially as a leader,

962
01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:49.020
you've got to be the person that controls him in the moment of crisis,

963
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:53.760
of Cathartic explosion.
As a leader,
that's got to be what your job is

964
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.640
and also as you work in businesses,
as a leader,

965
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:03.030
you've got a sense now the things won't be as dramatic as this,

966
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:07.290
but you can get people that do make mistakes in business.

967
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.940
They make ethical mistakes,
they make more mistakes,

968
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.310
they feel that pressure and they want to lash out and they make mistakes and

969
01:04:14.311 --> 01:04:16.770
you've got to get them through those moments.
You got to pay attention to it.

970
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.460
It is under these circumstances,
back to the book,

971
01:04:22.461 --> 01:04:27.170
it is under these circumstances of total uncertainty,
initial disorientation,

972
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.430
sudden violence,

973
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.620
inability to communicate because there was language differences and lack of

974
01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:38.621
effective control and education that accesses were committed by a few by a few,

975
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:44.960
but the command and leadership chain rapidly gathered their brood once again

976
01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:50.500
within the warmth of their moral influence and disciplinary binding inquiries

977
01:04:51.351 --> 01:04:55.220
were instituted and disciplinary action taken against the defaulters.

978
01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.530
Warped minds had to be weeded out,
but there were not very many.

979
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:06.130
After February to March of 1988 the incident rates dropped to almost zero.

980
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:11.660
So they were able to get control of the situation to weed it out,

981
01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:16.760
get rid of the sadists and the folks that couldn't control themselves.

982
01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:20.123
But this is the

983
01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:26.690
the type of pressure that you see military people under.

984
01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.560
And especially in these counter insurgency operations like we've had for the

985
01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:36.561
last 10 or 15 years in Iraq and Afghanistan where you have a local populace,

986
01:05:37.741 --> 01:05:39.600
you have eds,

987
01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:45.110
you have indirect fire mortars and guys are getting killed and where do you

988
01:05:46.081 --> 01:05:48.300
place the rage,
where do you,
where does it come out?

989
01:05:48.301 --> 01:05:51.270
And that is a huge challenge for,

990
01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:56.930
for leadership to try and keep that in check to the best of your ability.

991
01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.760
And speaking of leadership

992
01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:04.693
from the book,

993
01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:10.420
what we lacked in many in instance was what I should specifically emphasize

994
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.740
inspiring leadership.
If the leader,

995
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:19.730
particularly the formation commander,
did not inspire his command,

996
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:24.590
then that body of troops would be at half its effectiveness.

997
01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.050
So Lafe and I talk about an extreme ownership.

998
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.810
Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.
And here it is.

999
01:06:29.811 --> 01:06:31.700
Another example of saying,
you know,

1000
01:06:31.701 --> 01:06:34.250
he's saying that if the leader is not inspiring,

1001
01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.190
they're going to be a half their effectiveness.
For instance,

1002
01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:42.220
if he visited a post and the men did not talk warmly inquisitively and fondly

1003
01:06:42.561 --> 01:06:44.720
about the visit for the next week or 10 days,

1004
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:47.990
and if they did not perceive a challenge left behind by the commander,

1005
01:06:47.991 --> 01:06:52.700
not feel a spontaneous desire to meet it in thinking it hard to solve and

1006
01:06:52.701 --> 01:06:57.410
thinking hard to solve it and bracing to present it innovative novelty to the

1007
01:06:57.411 --> 01:07:02.411
commander on his next visit than it is Bez better that this type of commander

1008
01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:07.730
did not visit it all.
So these saying,
you know,
if you're not an inspiring,

1009
01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.640
if you're not inspiring,
your people is better.
Not even to show up.

1010
01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.230
Many formation commanders failed to inspire,

1011
01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.560
not many of them roughed it out with the troops on patrols.

1012
01:07:18.561 --> 01:07:23.000
Ambush is staying in their posts at night on road opening and raid or Hella

1013
01:07:23.001 --> 01:07:24.110
landing missions.

1014
01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:31.200
And this is an example of kind of a negative example,

1015
01:07:31.201 --> 01:07:34.710
and this is very clear and you actually see this portrayed in movies about

1016
01:07:34.711 --> 01:07:38.460
Vietnam a lot,
and you'll,
you'll get that very quickly.

1017
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:42.360
The brigade commander would land by a helicopter and a post on a helipad,

1018
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:43.830
which had to be secured.

1019
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:48.300
Does that mean soldiers had to go out and like secure this Helo pad somewhere

1020
01:07:48.301 --> 01:07:52.320
and set security around it and move the brush and make sure there's no mine's on

1021
01:07:52.321 --> 01:07:53.420
it,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1022
01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:58.650
Then the general would breeze past a few bodies lying in the muck and mud beam,

1023
01:07:58.690 --> 01:08:02.100
flashy smile to effect,
unconcerned for danger,

1024
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:06.420
have a hurried chat with the local leader,
blurred out directions or orders,

1025
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:08.730
sip a cup of tea or coconut juice,

1026
01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.450
showing no concern for the soldiers who labored under those circumstances to

1027
01:08:12.451 --> 01:08:17.451
prepare it and offer before could blink an eye would be offered this chap in his

1028
01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:19.004
chopper.

1029
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.520
What inspiration could his men in the post draw from that?

1030
01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:30.950
It's a stereotypical thing and it really happens.
It really does happen.

1031
01:08:32.130 --> 01:08:36.170
And you know,
you see that with uh,
you know,
not just military leaders,

1032
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:41.171
but you see that with senior leaders in big companies where you know the,

1033
01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.390
the folks on the front lines,

1034
01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:49.370
on the construction side or on the main manufacturing plant,
the boss is coming.

1035
01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:51.470
So what do they have to do?
They have to do all this preparation.

1036
01:08:51.471 --> 01:08:53.350
You've got to clean everything,
getting everything dialed in and,

1037
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:56.540
and then the guy shows up for five minutes and it took,
you know,

1038
01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:00.660
four hours to get everything ready.
The guy shows up for five minutes classes,

1039
01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.630
a quick smile and then leaves.
Is anyone inspired by that?
No,

1040
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:07.100
absolutely not.

1041
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.810
We had three types of officers.

1042
01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.580
One category was that which thought acted,

1043
01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:22.610
moved about was bold and got down to business fastest even in totally alien,

1044
01:09:24.391 --> 01:09:29.040
confusing,
unknown environment,
getting down to business.

1045
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:31.260
That's the guy,
the second one,

1046
01:09:31.261 --> 01:09:35.190
consistent of those who had the brains and moved about as best they could,

1047
01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:37.980
but lacked boldness and ability to inspire.

1048
01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:45.750
The third category consisted of those who simply slogged when prodded and

1049
01:09:45.911 --> 01:09:50.410
complained about their troops not being trained,
orders not being clearly given.

1050
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:55.120
And so on.
They could do nothing else.
Their unit suffered.

1051
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:58.600
So that's the guy that doesn't take ownership of anything this year that

1052
01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:01.510
complained about their troops,
not being trained,

1053
01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.180
orders not being clearly given and so on.

1054
01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.290
That guy is not a good leader because all he's doing is complaining.
That is,

1055
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:10.720
the orders weren't clear.
He's complaining up and down the chain of command.

1056
01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.670
The guys below me aren't trained right?

1057
01:10:12.671 --> 01:10:15.520
The guys above me aren't given clear orders and this guy's a disaster.

1058
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:17.920
Don't be that guy.
Don't be that leader.

1059
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.453
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1060
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:25.650
<v 0>and here's a piece on leading from the front.</v>

1061
01:10:30.370 --> 01:10:31.060
They,

1062
01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:36.060
there was a big battle and there was a bunch of friendly casualties and now

1063
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.450
going into the books,
their belongings,
dress and equipment,

1064
01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.350
lay tattered and strewn all over a huge playground.

1065
01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.320
And I went up there on one of my visits.

1066
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:52.360
I fought this was disrespectful to the brave souls and asked the escort team,

1067
01:10:52.361 --> 01:10:57.361
accompanying me to help pick up all those items and remove them from public gaze

1068
01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.320
to my acute horror.
Not One of them move to pick them up.

1069
01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:07.750
The escort team consisted of all denominations but none dared.

1070
01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:13.120
So,
so here we are,
he's out on this battlefield,
there's all you know,
gear and,

1071
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.440
and personal effects of all these guys that were killed and it's just been

1072
01:11:16.441 --> 01:11:18.300
sitting there and no one's moved it.

1073
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.000
And so he tells the team that he's with like,
okay sir,

1074
01:11:21.001 --> 01:11:23.460
go start rounding up the gear and,
and they won't do it.

1075
01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.080
It became painful to see such reluctance.

1076
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.840
I spontaneously got down from my open jeep,

1077
01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.080
walked up to a pair of pouches and a belt and pick them up,

1078
01:11:38.010 --> 01:11:39.000
brought them to my jeep.

1079
01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:42.930
And then the brigadier general that was with him did it as well because the next

1080
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:43.764
to do so,

1081
01:11:43.890 --> 01:11:47.640
it was only after this that the rest of the escort team got down and gathered

1082
01:11:47.641 --> 01:11:51.120
the other items.
Little bit of leadership from the front.
Right.

1083
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:02.220
And I think we're going to close with this section right here.

1084
01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:11.310
Views and visits of senior generals and their interaction with field commanders

1085
01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:13.260
and troops did a little to inspire us.

1086
01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:16.460
Subordinates provided little worth world worth,

1087
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:21.490
wild guidance and clarified little as to what the whole blame game plan was

1088
01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:26.280
about.
So these guys had no idea of what the Y was.

1089
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:31.850
Everybody lived and fought from one day to the next no strategic view.

1090
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.430
Our weight for pearls of wisdom remained endless.

1091
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:44.010
What increasingly showed up instead was the political eye and Pluster of the

1092
01:12:44.011 --> 01:12:44.880
generals,

1093
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:50.060
the tentativeness and uncertainty of the army commander above them and the army

1094
01:12:51.661 --> 01:12:52.494
chief,

1095
01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:58.310
which did little to change systemic incongruities and tackle the hidden rot.

1096
01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:02.850
Consequently,

1097
01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:08.330
boldness and experimentation became prominent casualties.

1098
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:16.030
So this glaring eye

1099
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:22.530
from the senior leadership snuffed out

1100
01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:29.130
the creativity and the boldness of the troops.
They actually

1101
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:35.010
made,
you know,
this,
this intense

1102
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:41.370
scrutiny.
Like I said,
it made the troops not want to do anything.

1103
01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:47.820
And I think not only should you keep that in consideration as a leader,

1104
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:52.830
that you make sure that you're not snuffing out creativity from your troops,

1105
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.340
but also on a personal level,

1106
01:13:56.970 --> 01:14:01.500
you can't let
the fear of failure

1107
01:14:03.450 --> 01:14:06.620
limit your boldness and your experimentation man.

1108
01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.300
And that's something that happens all the time.

1109
01:14:09.301 --> 01:14:13.660
People are afraid to step out and try something new.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1110
01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:15.940
And like I mentioned this before,
where

1111
01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:20.880
<v 6>a lot of the time the reason for that is when people get punished for making</v>

1112
01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:22.470
honest mistakes.
Yeah.

1113
01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:28.590
<v 0>You definitely should not punish people for making honest mistakes.</v>

1114
01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:30.930
And when you are going to take risks yourself,

1115
01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:34.080
you need to cut yourself some slack and realize that things might no go,

1116
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:38.450
not go perfect.
And I'll tell you,
I mean,
uh,

1117
01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:42.570
an example that's sitting right in front of us right now is this podcast that

1118
01:14:42.571 --> 01:14:46.980
we're doing because,
you know,
people were asking,
you know,
hey,

1119
01:14:46.981 --> 01:14:50.640
you should do a podcast,
but there's,
you know,
okay,
well where's it going to go?

1120
01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:55.020
Do we really want to do it?
What's the one people actually going to think of it?

1121
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:55.471
You know,

1122
01:14:55.471 --> 01:15:00.360
it's one thing to have do a podcast with a guy like Tim Ferriss or Joe Rogan or

1123
01:15:00.361 --> 01:15:04.650
Sam Harris where you've got this,
you know,
famous individual.

1124
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.540
And of course people want to listen to them,

1125
01:15:06.541 --> 01:15:11.160
but who's gonna want to listen to a Jocko and echo?
So there's some,
you know,

1126
01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:14.640
let's,
but,
but okay,
what's the worst thing that happen?
We fail.

1127
01:15:14.641 --> 01:15:19.560
No one listens to it.
Okay,
cool.
It wasn't going to affect me that bad.
You know,

1128
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:21.810
we'd move on and figure something else to do.
Yeah.

1129
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:25.590
But that's the kind of thing that,
that experimentation,

1130
01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.600
that can lead to good stuff.
Right?

1131
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:32.640
And if you don't allow yourself to do that,
then you're going to have problems.

1132
01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:33.810
And the same way,

1133
01:15:33.811 --> 01:15:38.811
if you don't allow your troopers to make mistakes,

1134
01:15:38.821 --> 01:15:42.090
like you said,
and try new things and you don't encourage that,

1135
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.140
then they're going to be,

1136
01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:46.680
their morale is going to be crushed and they're not gonna make the progress that

1137
01:15:46.681 --> 01:15:48.630
they need to need to make.
Yeah.

1138
01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.540
I mean you can kind of look at it at that type of scenario

1139
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:57.710
<v 6>in or from like an expanded point of view,</v>

1140
01:15:57.711 --> 01:15:59.690
like the big picture where if someone's not raised,

1141
01:15:59.691 --> 01:16:01.280
that kind of mentioned this before as well,

1142
01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.400
where if someone is raised in a really rigid household where you know the the

1143
01:16:07.671 --> 01:16:09.140
kid who's taking piano lessons,

1144
01:16:09.141 --> 01:16:11.870
he makes one wrong key and he gets whacked with a ruler,
right?

1145
01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:15.440
Let's say it's someone was just raised like that in life,
every little mistake,

1146
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.200
they're going to be so reluctant to start something new,

1147
01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:23.620
they're going to be so scared and a lot of times you don't even feel like you

1148
01:16:24.051 --> 01:16:27.440
know why you're scared.
It's just just,
it's just scary.

1149
01:16:27.441 --> 01:16:32.441
A lot of anxiety comes when you think about or consider branching out,

1150
01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.710
doing something new,

1151
01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.900
fear of failure and all this is so embedded in you because of that punishment

1152
01:16:38.901 --> 01:16:40.490
that you received,
so you're trained,

1153
01:16:40.491 --> 01:16:45.491
you know you're trained to avoid mistakes or new stuff that you might make.

1154
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:49.360
<v 0>That's something we've dealt with in the military for the last several years.</v>

1155
01:16:49.361 --> 01:16:51.180
Last probably couple of decades was this,

1156
01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:55.720
we call it the zero defect mentality where it's like,
okay,
if this,
if this,

1157
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:59.890
if this guy made any mistakes over his career,
he was not going to be advanced.

1158
01:16:59.891 --> 01:17:00.850
He was not going to be promoted.

1159
01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:03.040
And they've really tried to move away from that because like you said,

1160
01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:07.540
that completely suffocates any type of risk taken,
any type of creativity,

1161
01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:10.740
any willingness to go outside the box and try something new,

1162
01:17:10.810 --> 01:17:12.160
it just suffocates it.
Yeah.

1163
01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:16.610
So I was definitely never a person that would hammer people for making mistakes

1164
01:17:16.611 --> 01:17:19.400
as long as they were,
we'll call them good mistakes,

1165
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.230
just not just making stupid mistakes,

1166
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.120
being careless in general when you know being girl his bet.
Yeah.

1167
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:31.870
So that kind of wraps up the book assignment Jaffna by Satish Pandey.

1168
01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:38.630
Great Book.
And I don't know if you can get a hold of it,

1169
01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.220
but those are some major lessons that I learned from it.
And again,

1170
01:17:43.221 --> 01:17:48.221
I bought this book while I was in Sri Lanka and read it and it definitely

1171
01:17:48.921 --> 01:17:53.030
influenced me.
And as I started fighting a counterinsurgency war myself,

1172
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:57.830
I would think about what they went through and how difficult it was for them and

1173
01:17:57.831 --> 01:18:01.760
I knew we would be facing some very difficult times as well.
Yeah,

1174
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:05.960
that's interesting how that is essentially in a big way,

1175
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:10.760
the opposite of your book where he's,
he's,

1176
01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:16.070
this is basically a cautionary tale from beginning to end,
just how not to do it.

1177
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:20.750
Yeah.
And although,
and you know from,
from,
from our book,

1178
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:25.130
our book has a lot of,
this was a mistake that we made,
here's what we did wrong.

1179
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:30.830
Now strategically,
overall it was a very successful,
you know,

1180
01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:33.860
what the army did and what the one would Aidy did and what the two to eight and

1181
01:18:33.861 --> 01:18:37.370
what all these soldiers and Marines did over a longer period of time with,

1182
01:18:37.371 --> 01:18:40.730
with us seals as well was successful overall.

1183
01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:44.930
But we definitely point out the errors of our way because they're successful.

1184
01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:47.840
They're successful operations outlined in this book as well.

1185
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:51.800
But you don't learn as much from,
I picked out a couple of the,

1186
01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.790
of the ones that went wrong because of course you learn more from your mistakes.

1187
01:18:56.180 --> 01:18:58.490
And you know,
in the book that Leif and I wrote,

1188
01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:02.480
it's definitely a lot of those stories about the mistakes we made because we

1189
01:19:02.481 --> 01:19:07.430
learned more from them as,
as brutal as that is.
That's the reality,
man.
It's so

1190
01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:09.003
<v 2>okay.</v>

1191
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.590
<v 0>Yeah.
And before we get into questions,
I,</v>

1192
01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:16.500
I do want to say if I did this per Nazi,
uh,

1193
01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:21.840
incorrectly pronounce anything from assignment Jaffna I sincerely apologize.

1194
01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:26.880
So
my boss,
I'm sorry.

1195
01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.190
Still with that,

1196
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:33.090
we'll go into some questions from the inner webs.

1197
01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:37.470
So first question from Deacon Dad.

1198
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:39.163
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1199
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:44.130
<v 0>Jocko Willink,
how do you deal with fatigue,</v>

1200
01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:46.410
both mental and physical?

1201
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:56.440
How do I deal with fatigue,
mental and physical arrest and,

1202
01:19:57.250 --> 01:19:58.840
uh,
you know,
when,
when,

1203
01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:03.190
if I'm feeling like just completely overtrained and week,

1204
01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.880
uh,
I usually tell,
well,
I tell my fighters,
I'd say,

1205
01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:09.990
you just got your butt kicked today.

1206
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.270
Go eat a big steak tonight,
take tomorrow off.
You know,
you just need rest.

1207
01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.960
And it's pretty obvious when that happens.
And so I do the same thing for myself.

1208
01:20:18.961 --> 01:20:21.420
If I,
if I'm feeling horrible and you know,

1209
01:20:21.421 --> 01:20:25.290
you can see occasionally my workouts consist of like,
you know,

1210
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:29.430
doing some mobility training,
Roland and out,
you know,

1211
01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:32.940
doing a big stretch.
That's cause I'm just tired and I know it.

1212
01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.810
And so I just give myself some downtime.
Um,

1213
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:41.870
I think it's very important to know the difference between being lazy and being

1214
01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:47.010
overtrained.
And it's very easy to make that excuse for yourself.

1215
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:51.660
And that's why I always err on the side of I'm working out,

1216
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.650
I'm training because it and usually then the next day.

1217
01:20:56.730 --> 01:21:01.110
So if I feel like exhausted today,
I won't take today off,

1218
01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:02.620
but I will take the next day.

1219
01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.360
But I work out today just to make sure that are not just being lazy.

1220
01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.160
So I'll do another workout,

1221
01:21:08.161 --> 01:21:10.710
get another training session in or whatever the case may be.

1222
01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:13.250
So I make sure that's not just that moment cause I'm not,

1223
01:21:13.251 --> 01:21:14.640
I was the next day you're like,
you know,
I'm not that bad.

1224
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:19.590
I'm going to get him back in the game.
Back on the program.
The uh,

1225
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.750
the other thing people ask me all the time,

1226
01:21:22.290 --> 01:21:27.210
I've probably written this a dozen times or more on Twitter,
is do I take naps?

1227
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.360
And the answer is yes.
In fact,
I slept on the,

1228
01:21:30.361 --> 01:21:34.560
I flew today and I slept probably two hours on the plane.

1229
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:38.520
Um,
and that's a little bit more than a nap and I'm not on a plane every day.

1230
01:21:38.521 --> 01:21:42.990
So what do I do for naps?
Yes,
I do take naps.
What I do for naps,

1231
01:21:42.991 --> 01:21:46.320
and this is something that I've learned from my high school teacher that I had,

1232
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.700
was I walked into his office one day and he had his feet up on the desk above

1233
01:21:50.701 --> 01:21:54.180
his heart.
And I said,
you know,
what are you doing?
And he said,
oh,

1234
01:21:54.181 --> 01:21:55.150
this is really good for you.

1235
01:21:55.151 --> 01:21:58.470
You put your feet above your heart and it allows the blood to circulate out of

1236
01:21:58.471 --> 01:22:00.390
your feet and gives,
you know,
lets your,

1237
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:05.580
your veins and your one way valves in your veins rest a little bit and gets a

1238
01:22:05.581 --> 01:22:09.330
little pools of blood out of random places.
And it's two and a good.

1239
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:13.290
And so I tried it and if the really good and so when I was going through seal

1240
01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:14.124
training I used to,

1241
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:18.870
when I'd come in we'd have a couple minutes in between evolutions and I just go

1242
01:22:18.871 --> 01:22:23.250
in and put my feet up,
set my alarm clock,
sleep for a few minutes.
You know?

1243
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:27.180
Nowadays if I can,
I'll try and sleep for like six to eight minutes,

1244
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.160
set my timer on my iPhone.

1245
01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.100
And you look like distressed when I said six to eight minutes.
Yeah.

1246
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:38.460
You don't consider anything under the three hours to be?
Yeah.

1247
01:22:38.461 --> 01:22:40.770
That's not a legitimate and illegitimate nap.

1248
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:44.130
If I sleep for like an hour then I'm up for too long at night.

1249
01:22:44.131 --> 01:22:47.250
I won't be able to go to sleep too much rest.
Gotcha.
Yeah.

1250
01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:52.020
Under what circumstances are you going to take a nap though?
Like how do,

1251
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:55.530
how do you just title I'm just tired.
I'll feel myself.
Like no,
all yes,

1252
01:22:55.531 --> 01:22:58.890
like sleepy,
tired and that's the thing is I can do,
if I'm,

1253
01:22:58.950 --> 01:23:00.340
if my mind is engaged in some of their,

1254
01:23:00.341 --> 01:23:02.880
especially my body's engaged in something.
That's what's cool about working out.

1255
01:23:02.881 --> 01:23:05.430
You can work out when you're exhausted because once you start moving that,

1256
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.040
it's not like you're gonna

1257
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.570
<v 6>fall asleep while you're doing squats.
Right.</v>

1258
01:23:07.571 --> 01:23:09.420
It's like you can fall asleep while you're doing pull ups.
Yeah.

1259
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.500
You're just going to do the pull ups.
You're just going to do the squats.

1260
01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:14.830
I'm going to get done.
You'll be tired.
You go to sleep.
Right.
What's hard to do,

1261
01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.020
and this is when,
like when we were writing the book,

1262
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:19.330
when I was writing my section of the books,
I'd be writing at night,

1263
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:23.170
11 o'clock at night,
12 o'clock at night,
be trying to hammer through it.

1264
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:26.920
And sometimes they just fall.
You know,
I'd be falling asleep,
man.
So,

1265
01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:31.040
but that feeling of,
Hey,
I'm just falling asleep.
That's not good.
You know?

1266
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:34.030
So when I'm feeling that tired,
I'll,
I'll power it out.

1267
01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:37.090
But it's like one of those things where I also liked to push through it.

1268
01:23:38.530 --> 01:23:41.620
So if someone's just try and power through it,
because honestly,
even a,

1269
01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:43.030
even a short nap for me,

1270
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.450
we'll kind of make me stay up too late at night and all of a sudden it'll be one

1271
01:23:46.451 --> 01:23:48.400
o'clock in the morning.
I can't sleep.
Six to eight minutes,

1272
01:23:48.401 --> 01:23:50.440
six to eight minutes to six,
eight minutes of power nap.
Uh,

1273
01:23:50.441 --> 01:23:54.490
68 minute power nap can make you feel amazing.
It can make you feel amazing.

1274
01:23:54.491 --> 01:23:58.900
Don't underestimate the power nap.
It is a legit fool right there.
Yeah.

1275
01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:03.460
I actually used to take like 15 minutes.
Yeah.

1276
01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:08.290
Well it's minutes.
Yeah,
I know.
That's a little much into laziness.
No,

1277
01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:12.190
seriously.
15 minutes is yeah,
you probably felt like,
yeah,
outstanding when you,

1278
01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:16.630
but it only helps with that sleepy time because let's say I'm used to a certain

1279
01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:20.050
amount of sleep,
let's say get two and a half hours less sleep than I'm used to.

1280
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:24.850
It goes way beyond me feeling just sleepy,
tired.
It's like physically tired.

1281
01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:29.220
Oh really?
Yeah.
So I don't have that issue.
Yeah.
Yes,

1282
01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.153
you're different.

1283
01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:34.630
So if I take a 10 minute power nap on,

1284
01:24:34.631 --> 01:24:38.590
I am lacking two and a half hours of my quote unquote no.
We'll make up for it.

1285
01:24:38.591 --> 01:24:41.380
Right?
No,
no new,
new,
new,
new.

1286
01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.980
It helps me when I get my normal sleep,
give or take.

1287
01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:49.360
But I've been doing a lot of stuff during the day,
you know,
and you're like,
Dang,

1288
01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:50.011
I did a lot in,

1289
01:24:50.011 --> 01:24:54.880
my brain was kind of used a lot and I have this whatever I gotta do now.

1290
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:58.850
Then you take the 10 15 minute nap tenant,
it brings you right back.
Yeah.

1291
01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:01.300
And it typically will not mess with my seat.

1292
01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:06.420
I wonder how much of this is just you just not just powering through stuff.

1293
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.170
Yeah,
probably all of it.
The nonetheless,

1294
01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.340
that's how it is from me.
For sure.

1295
01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:17.530
It'd be interesting to at some point for you to experiment with like lack of

1296
01:25:17.531 --> 01:25:20.740
sleep and sleep deprivation and see how well you can perform.

1297
01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:24.070
Like I've been noticing that where I find I get a lot of sleep,

1298
01:25:24.071 --> 01:25:27.790
I can still perform really well.
Yeah.
At some physical activities.

1299
01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:29.410
And then after a few days though,
I do,

1300
01:25:29.411 --> 01:25:34.330
I feel like garbage and there'll be some physical activities that'll feel weak

1301
01:25:34.331 --> 01:25:38.080
at.
But yeah,
and you're right.

1302
01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.240
Well they're the immune as long as it's like one time or even two times or so if

1303
01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:46.210
I feel them or something,
and let's say a film in the morning,

1304
01:25:46.211 --> 01:25:51.040
but then I'd been up,
you know,
working late the night before when I go into film,

1305
01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:55.270
I'm like charged up.
I'm sure there's all kinds of factors in there.

1306
01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:58.750
A lot of it's like adrenaline,
not like,
it's like this huge adrenaline rush,

1307
01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:01.540
but there's that little bit of adrenaline because of the task,
you know?

1308
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:05.120
So that helps.
Um,
a lot of times,
just like how you said,

1309
01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:06.920
if I made the decision like,
no,

1310
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:10.250
I'm not going to miss this workout at all under any circumstances,

1311
01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:14.870
then I happened to get two and a half hours less sleep and I go in,
in a,

1312
01:26:14.871 --> 01:26:18.270
how you say power through it,
you can then you can totally do it.
Yeah.

1313
01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.130
But I'm seeking comfort fully.
Yeah,
for sure.
But it still doesn't help though.

1314
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:27.050
<v 0>But to answer the question,
yes.
If you're tired,
sleep,
if you need rest,</v>

1315
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:31.040
rest.
Right.
And don't try and overtrain yourself.

1316
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:35.690
You probably are overtraining and,
and just need some rest.
Yeah.

1317
01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.813
Next.

1318
01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:43.420
<v 6>Um,
we don't have an author on this one,
but,
um,</v>

1319
01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.440
well what are your thoughts on freakishly strong guys in Bjj who go too hard?

1320
01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:52.570
Get hurt and pain it as if it's your fault.

1321
01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:57.680
<v 0>Cause this guy rolled with a maniac tonight,
the guy that rolled with a maniac.</v>

1322
01:26:57.681 --> 01:27:01.040
So we've all been there.
We,
we're rolling with a maniac.
Okay.

1323
01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:04.970
So this is a [inaudible] it seems like a pretty straightforward question at

1324
01:27:04.971 --> 01:27:09.470
first,
but then all of a sudden it gets really complicated.
It really does.

1325
01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:14.030
Who is it fall here?
Right?
So you're rolling with the Guy Guy,
super strong.

1326
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:18.980
You catch him in the submission and guess what?
He doesn't want to tap.

1327
01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:23.720
And so the next thing you know,
there's a little pop,
there's a little crack,

1328
01:27:23.721 --> 01:27:27.510
whatever.
And you've got an injury and the big guy that was going,
all crazies,

1329
01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:30.980
I can't believe you did this.
So the question is who's at fault?

1330
01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:35.270
And there's actually two sides to that story in a lot of ways because

1331
01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:41.870
from one in one way,
the higher belt,
right,

1332
01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:46.871
or a more experienced guy should never really hurt a lower belt.

1333
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:50.900
Right?
I mean,
if,
if I'm a black belt and I'm going against a purple belt,

1334
01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:55.130
I really shouldn't hurt that person because if I do,

1335
01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:59.120
I probably meant to do it.
I mean,
of course there's,
you know,

1336
01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:02.120
mistakes happen and I'm not talking to,
I'm talking about submission,
right?

1337
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:03.730
I'm not talking about,
hey,
I,
I,

1338
01:28:04.450 --> 01:28:07.580
I went over and made you roll your ankle or you caught your wrist as you were

1339
01:28:07.581 --> 01:28:11.480
falling out or something like that.
Those are just incidents incidental,
you know,

1340
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:15.820
things that happen in Jujitsu,
but
you know,
so,

1341
01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:19.790
so the higher belt generally shouldn't be like putting someone into submission

1342
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:22.670
and hurting them because the experienced guys in Jujitsu,

1343
01:28:22.671 --> 01:28:27.260
they know when the tension is there on the arm or the foot or the knee,

1344
01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:32.390
they know that that tension means the next amount of pressure is going to take

1345
01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:35.630
this beyond the limit of the joint.
And they're going to,

1346
01:28:35.631 --> 01:28:39.410
you're going to have an injury.
So either big guy,

1347
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:44.390
he's going psycho and he's got a big ego and that's why he's not tapping.

1348
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:48.170
So that must be his fault,
right?
Well,

1349
01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.750
at the same time,

1350
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:56.410
if someone doesn't tap and then you hurt them,

1351
01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:04.030
well that's kind of jacked up too because you shouldn't be getting someone's uh,

1352
01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:09.360
uh foot and cranking it or getting their arm and cranking it when,
you know,

1353
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.090
I mean maybe they couldn't tap,
maybe they were arm was stuck or whatever.

1354
01:29:12.091 --> 01:29:16.470
Now all of a sudden you heard them.
So I really do think it's both.

1355
01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:21.500
I think both people are at fault and I think that part of the dual safety

1356
01:29:21.691 --> 01:29:25.860
mechanisms is you just in Jujitsu is that there's two people that can control

1357
01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:28.980
the situation,
but one that is getting submitted should tap.

1358
01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:32.190
And the one that's doing the submission,
you should,
you know,

1359
01:29:32.191 --> 01:29:36.450
should know to stop before the injury occurs.

1360
01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.800
Again,
there is a,

1361
01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.350
there's about a million little things that can happen where you get injured in

1362
01:29:40.351 --> 01:29:43.950
Jujitsu,
there's arm locks that get thrown on and it's a little tweak.
And,

1363
01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:47.610
and that,
that stuff does happen,
you know,
but,
but when I look at Dean and I,

1364
01:29:47.611 --> 01:29:48.151
Dean lister,

1365
01:29:48.151 --> 01:29:51.650
who's in my main training partner have been training with for 20 years.
We,

1366
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:55.080
we've put,
you know,
thousands,

1367
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:59.640
literally thousands and thousands of submissions on each other and neither one

1368
01:29:59.641 --> 01:30:02.640
of us has ever hurt the other one.

1369
01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:06.780
And neither one of us had ever gotten hurt from a submission.

1370
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.190
And I'm talking thousands of submission.
Of course,
most of those,
you know,

1371
01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:13.200
many of those,
most of those are him submitting me.

1372
01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:15.870
But I mean I've submitted him many,

1373
01:30:15.871 --> 01:30:20.871
many times as well and never have one of us got a submission on the other one

1374
01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:24.960
and hurt the other person.

1375
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:29.990
And I can tell ya he's let go of hundreds of submissions on me and I've let go

1376
01:30:30.661 --> 01:30:34.950
on many submissions on him because I go,
you know what?

1377
01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:39.780
Oh I've got this.
He's,
you know,
he's not tapping for whatever reason.

1378
01:30:39.781 --> 01:30:43.920
We'd go to the next move or he gets me in some weird position.
He,
you know,

1379
01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:46.590
he's got it but he lets go and goes to the next move.

1380
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:50.220
And what's really cool about this is what you end up with is you end up with the

1381
01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:53.730
ego free training because the truth of the matter is,

1382
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:59.270
I don't care if dean caps me and I don't care if I tap dean like,

1383
01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.730
and he doesn't care if he taps me and he doesn't care if he gets the tap from
me.

1384
01:31:05.731 --> 01:31:08.970
So what we are able to do then is take all kinds of risks and do all kinds of

1385
01:31:08.971 --> 01:31:12.750
crazy flow drills and,
and where we're really trying to get each other,

1386
01:31:12.751 --> 01:31:16.800
but at the same time we really don't care man.
And,
and the biggest,
um,

1387
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:21.330
dichotomy of that is I'm sitting here saying I don't want to get tapped or I

1388
01:31:21.331 --> 01:31:22.680
don't care if I get tapped by dean,

1389
01:31:22.681 --> 01:31:26.520
but it tries me crazy when I get tapped by dean.
He tries me crazy.

1390
01:31:26.521 --> 01:31:28.850
You can hear it.
You're like,
some of them,
the gym,
I'll be like,
ah,
you know,

1391
01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.600
I get frustrated cause I got tapped put.

1392
01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.070
But it's frustrated at myself and it's frustration in the game and whatever.

1393
01:31:35.071 --> 01:31:39.960
But it's not,
it's not my ego being like I didn't want a tap.

1394
01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:42.210
It's just a frustration that I made a mistake or whatever.

1395
01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:45.450
So that allows you to,

1396
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:50.880
to really learn more.
Now all this being said,

1397
01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:55.910
if someone's just a big maniac that goes crazy the whole time and they're going

1398
01:31:55.911 --> 01:31:56.744
to hurt you,

1399
01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.650
well then you've got to make a decision that you're not going to roll with them,

1400
01:31:58.690 --> 01:32:02.830
right?
I mean,
clearly you want to not get hurt.

1401
01:32:02.831 --> 01:32:04.860
You want to continue training.
So someone that's a,

1402
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:08.110
that goes crazy and a super strong,

1403
01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:12.460
you don't want to roll with them.
That being said,

1404
01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.340
and this is one of this whole thing has been a non answer,
isn't it?

1405
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.280
That being said,
because when you do that,

1406
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:20.350
you've got to understand that you're avoiding a real issue.

1407
01:32:20.351 --> 01:32:23.390
You're avoiding a big strong guy and how you're gonna deal with that guy and he

1408
01:32:23.391 --> 01:32:27.190
and you will get better dealing with the big,
strong guy.
That's what makes you,

1409
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:30.940
that's one of the key things and gets you better at Jujitsu.
So

1410
01:32:32.650 --> 01:32:37.540
you know,
you,
you,
you want to train with a big strong guys.

1411
01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:40.540
But that being said,
once again is if you train with a big guy and you get hurt,

1412
01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:44.320
then you can't train anymore.
So you gotta be smart.
You got to use your judgment.

1413
01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.750
Um,
you gotta check your ego.

1414
01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:51.130
You got to roll with people that have their egos checked.
Um,

1415
01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:54.970
and I think that's,
that's the best way to answer that.
It's a long answer.

1416
01:32:54.971 --> 01:32:57.070
It's probably not the most complete answer,

1417
01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:02.340
but there is no clear cut answer because there's a lot of little nuances to

1418
01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:04.960
every little role in the Jujitsu.

1419
01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:09.500
<v 6>Yeah.
It seems like there's so many exceptions to all these situations.</v>

1420
01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:13.820
Even when you say a higher belt should never heard a lower belt.

1421
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:17.300
A lot of times I can just depend.

1422
01:33:17.301 --> 01:33:20.390
Like what if you're not that much higher and he's bigger than you and more

1423
01:33:20.391 --> 01:33:24.530
athletic and when you go for a submission really controlled or whatever,

1424
01:33:24.531 --> 01:33:27.410
he [inaudible] in the whole time.
So even in your transitions,

1425
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:30.250
he spazzed any spares.
And so really the,

1426
01:33:30.450 --> 01:33:35.450
the only way you can get that submission is if you go fast and hard slog,

1427
01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.900
getting slapped it right on.
Right.
And let's say you do it in,

1428
01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:44.390
in the midst of your arm bar you had in the myths of you slapping it on,

1429
01:33:44.391 --> 01:33:46.120
you can extend it too much for them.
You heard them.

1430
01:33:46.670 --> 01:33:48.650
So it's really just the nature of the role.

1431
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:52.190
And a lot of times it's nobody's fault.
That's just how two guys going crazy.

1432
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:56.760
Who Care about the submissions they're getting.
It happens and,

1433
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:58.051
<v 0>but,
but yeah,</v>

1434
01:33:58.051 --> 01:34:00.420
you shouldn't care about so much about this emissions you're getting,

1435
01:34:00.421 --> 01:34:01.254
that's the bottom line.

1436
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.410
<v 6>Well,
unless in Greg,
Greg brought this up where</v>

1437
01:34:06.970 --> 01:34:08.740
he said you should care,

1438
01:34:08.741 --> 01:34:11.770
you should care about the submissions you get and you should care about being

1439
01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:15.280
able to resist the missions as well because it's kind of your response.

1440
01:34:15.281 --> 01:34:17.920
And this was really,
this would understand the context we're talking,

1441
01:34:17.921 --> 01:34:22.890
we're talking about like me and him and the guys that,
that I was talking about,

1442
01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.860
I was rolling with,
he said,
it's your job to give them an accurate look.

1443
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:30.170
If you're a big guy who was,
you know,
you come in and you're,
you know,

1444
01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.050
however big in athletic,

1445
01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:36.050
you have to give them that look and you have a certain skill level and you just

1446
01:34:36.051 --> 01:34:37.390
say,
you got to give them that look.

1447
01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:41.740
So you provide an accurate experience of rolling with the guy who's,
you know,

1448
01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:46.690
200,
15 pounds,
brown belt.
You have to give him that,
that,
no,
that's true,
sir.

1449
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:50.280
Who are you saying you can't go easy?
You can't go easy.
You can't.
Um,

1450
01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:52.840
he's not saying you can't,
he's saying,

1451
01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:55.630
but if you put on a submission and that guy's not tapping,

1452
01:34:55.631 --> 01:34:59.270
he's just giving you an accurate look that your submission isn't submitting him,

1453
01:34:59.330 --> 01:35:00.920
you're not submitting them,
you're not helping him out.

1454
01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:04.220
And if he's tough and likes the pain or,
or is not scared of the pain will,

1455
01:35:04.221 --> 01:35:08.420
that's the look he's given you.
So you have to complete the move a,

1456
01:35:08.421 --> 01:35:11.000
if you're not going to break his arm,
if you have that,
that mindset,

1457
01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:11.750
that's good too.

1458
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:15.890
But then you have to work on other situations that you would do in that

1459
01:35:15.891 --> 01:35:18.520
situation.
So if you want to just control the,

1460
01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.800
the fight more or something like that,
then that's what you gotta do.

1461
01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:23.390
But it is his job to give you that look.

1462
01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.930
<v 0>That is something that Dean and I will do that I think is awesome is let's say,</v>

1463
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:30.900
Dean,
what's a heel hook on me?

1464
01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:35.870
And instead of cranking it in,
making me tap,

1465
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.170
he'll hold it.
Yeah.
And when he holds it,

1466
01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.660
it gives me an opportunity to work some kind of escape.

1467
01:35:41.661 --> 01:35:45.290
Now sometimes they'll hold it and he,
while he's holding it,

1468
01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.530
he's adjusting his legs and he's actually getting me deeper and deeper into

1469
01:35:48.531 --> 01:35:50.780
where I can't,
can't get out anymore.

1470
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:53.450
And eventually I realized I can't move and tap,

1471
01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:55.980
not because of the pressure and optics,
the pain,
because I realize it's,

1472
01:35:56.010 --> 01:36:00.530
it's checkmate in the game over.
Yeah.
The same token is as he's holding it,

1473
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:03.710
if I can figure out,
I have time to think and consider and go,
oh,

1474
01:36:03.711 --> 01:36:05.690
what if I put my foot here?
What if I grabbed this arm here?

1475
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:10.550
What if I spin this way or that way?
And all of a sudden a real escape opens up.

1476
01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.890
But I had time to think about it.
Well maybe next time I do it,

1477
01:36:12.891 --> 01:36:13.641
I don't have to think.

1478
01:36:13.641 --> 01:36:17.240
And now we actually have figured out and escape from the position.
Yeah.

1479
01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:22.420
And and or either I figured out an escape or maybe he figured out the way to

1480
01:36:22.941 --> 01:36:25.460
finish it with 100% reliability.

1481
01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:27.970
So we actually have advanced the,

1482
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:31.490
that's probably the original advancement in the leg lock game for,

1483
01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:35.160
for Dean and me was and really for,

1484
01:36:35.161 --> 01:36:39.620
for Dean more than me was him holding a submission and not and,

1485
01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:43.880
and allowing me to try different things to escape and shutting them down.

1486
01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.590
And then eventually where I was like,
okay,

1487
01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:47.540
now I've got you in a position where there is no escape.

1488
01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.510
And that's how things like we ended up with like the four,

1489
01:36:50.511 --> 01:36:51.950
four 11 and ultimate game over.

1490
01:36:51.951 --> 01:36:55.910
All that stuff came from holding those positions because if he just locked him

1491
01:36:55.911 --> 01:36:58.340
on in and cranked it,
well then I tap and then we started again.

1492
01:36:58.341 --> 01:36:59.960
But he didn't have to adjust anything.

1493
01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:05.120
And now you start building technique on top of technique on top of technique.

1494
01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:06.110
Next question,

1495
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:11.260
<v 6>and I'm quoting this here,
please,</v>

1496
01:37:11.261 --> 01:37:16.261
can I have some advice with dealing or please can I have some advice for dealing

1497
01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:20.920
with poor leaders at work they have little respect for,

1498
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:24.970
and the question as a subordinate,

1499
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:28.630
how do you handle a leader who leads from a place of ego

1500
01:37:30.210 --> 01:37:32.130
and isn't transparent with information?

1501
01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:33.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1502
01:37:34.210 --> 01:37:34.361
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1503
01:37:34.361 --> 01:37:39.220
So these were a couple of questions actually that I got and I just kind of

1504
01:37:39.221 --> 01:37:43.210
bunched them together because my answer's going to be very similar for each of

1505
01:37:43.211 --> 01:37:43.361
them.

1506
01:37:43.361 --> 01:37:47.980
And it's actually very similar to a situation that I'm dealing with right now.

1507
01:37:47.981 --> 01:37:52.570
The guy that I'm helping out.
And I wrote,
um,

1508
01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.840
something to him recently and what happened was he's in a situation where a

1509
01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:04.080
leader had come in that didn't have the knowledge inside the industry they were

1510
01:38:04.081 --> 01:38:06.510
working in.
So he came from another industry,

1511
01:38:06.670 --> 01:38:10.110
got put into a leadership position and that guy,

1512
01:38:10.111 --> 01:38:14.850
that new leader was resisting change and not giving support to the new

1513
01:38:14.851 --> 01:38:17.790
procedures that the guy who was coaching was trying to implement.

1514
01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:21.690
So he was kind of,
you know,

1515
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:23.960
at a loss for what to do.
You know,

1516
01:38:23.961 --> 01:38:28.961
you've got this new manager that's coming in that's inexperienced and eve and

1517
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:33.090
the Guy I'm coaching obviously doesn't respect him because he doesn't have a lot

1518
01:38:33.091 --> 01:38:37.410
of knowledge in this industry.
And so here's the advice I gave him.

1519
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:38.783
I said,

1520
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:43.290
you need to set this up to make the new manager look good.

1521
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:47.250
Make some adjustments to the words you are choosing,

1522
01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:52.370
the tack you are taking and the focus you are using to ensure that your changes

1523
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:55.470
make him look good.
Not Bad.

1524
01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:58.500
Now this is so counterintuitive for people.

1525
01:38:58.770 --> 01:39:01.590
It's so counterintuitive cause they get to that person that's above them and the

1526
01:39:01.591 --> 01:39:04.320
chain of command that doesn't know as much as them,
that's not as smart as them.

1527
01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.270
And what do they want to do?
They want to bring them down.

1528
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:10.110
They want to prove to everybody that they are better.
I'm better than that guy.

1529
01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.410
[inaudible] that guy.
I deserve that guy's job.

1530
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:17.160
That's what everybody's instinct is to do and it's wrong.

1531
01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:18.893
It's wrong.

1532
01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:24.980
Somehow let the ideas come from him or make him the approver or the driver of

1533
01:39:26.941 --> 01:39:29.610
some of the s aspects that he can handle.

1534
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:33.960
So I'm actually saying go out of your way to make this easier for this guy.

1535
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.010
Make him look good.
Give him credit.

1536
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:42.900
It's your ego that wants to pull him down.
Put your ego in check,

1537
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:48.660
help him without being condescending or acting like you know more than him.

1538
01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:52.620
He shouldn't even know you are helping him.
Have you ever been,

1539
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:56.130
this is so fun to do is when,
you know,

1540
01:39:56.160 --> 01:39:58.980
Echo doesn't know this section of the equipment.

1541
01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:04.310
So I don't say,
Hey,
since you don't know this,
um,

1542
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:09.330
all teach it to you,
right?
This condescending tone of,
you know,

1543
01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.570
but instead of like,
hey,
have you ever seen the way this one works?
I know your,

1544
01:40:12.710 --> 01:40:15.780
have you ever seen this specific equipment before?
Because the way it works,

1545
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:16.740
it's a little bit different than,

1546
01:40:16.770 --> 01:40:19.290
than some of the other ones is you got to do this,
this,
and this,

1547
01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:23.490
and you can sit back and you can accept that knowledge without feeling like you

1548
01:40:23.491 --> 01:40:25.410
don't know it.
So I'm teaching you,

1549
01:40:25.411 --> 01:40:29.280
but I'm doing it in a clandestine manner and that's what we're trying to do

1550
01:40:29.281 --> 01:40:30.720
because we're trying to build or we try to do,

1551
01:40:30.721 --> 01:40:33.240
we're trying to build a relationship here.
That's what we're trying to do.

1552
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:35.370
We're trying to build a relationship.
And if I go,

1553
01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.210
since you don't know how to use this,
I'll show you now.
What does that do?

1554
01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.690
Puts you on the defensive,
makes you,
um,
uh,

1555
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:47.430
considered me to be a threat.
Now I'm threatening and that's not good.

1556
01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:54.020
He should even know you are helping him respect what he does and show him that

1557
01:40:54.161 --> 01:40:57.460
you respect it.
So a,
you know,
I know this is,

1558
01:40:57.461 --> 01:40:59.890
you probably haven't been down in the weeds on this type of gear in a while,

1559
01:40:59.891 --> 01:41:02.560
but hey,
this is the way,
you know what I'm saying?
Like you actually,

1560
01:41:02.561 --> 01:41:07.030
I actually respect the fact that you're up top in charge and I'm just a front

1561
01:41:07.031 --> 01:41:10.720
line guy.
But here's how you do this.
If you ever had to,
you know what I mean?

1562
01:41:10.721 --> 01:41:15.721
Just downplay what he doesn't know and subtly help him to learn it.

1563
01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:20.170
Right.
You know,
you probably wouldn't ever have to do this,
this,

1564
01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:23.860
this new equipment over here.
I mean,
I know as a little bit below your level,

1565
01:41:23.861 --> 01:41:26.320
here's how it works.
If you ever needed it,
boom.
You know what I mean?

1566
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.250
Not like you don't know how to do this.
I do.
You know,

1567
01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:36.900
you don't want an adversarial relationship with this new leader.

1568
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:41.530
You want him to support and help you.
He will do that.

1569
01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.270
If you are making him look good.
This is so easy,
man.

1570
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:51.280
This is so easy and so hard because everybody's ego will get in the way.

1571
01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:53.530
Everybody's Eagle will get in the way.

1572
01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.160
Extreme ownership often requires covert and clandestino indirect actions.

1573
01:42:01.570 --> 01:42:05.650
So all these things that I'm talking about helping the guy without him knowing,

1574
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:07.420
um,
uh,

1575
01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:11.080
letting him take credit for ideas without him knowing

1576
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:16.870
all these little aspects,
they're indirect actions.

1577
01:42:16.871 --> 01:42:20.230
They're not going head to head.
It's like Jujitsu.
It's Jujitsu all the time.

1578
01:42:20.650 --> 01:42:24.810
Everything's Jujitsu.
You don't want to,
if you know I'm going to do an Armbar,

1579
01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.800
I am not going to get the arm bar right.
You're going to defend that.

1580
01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:35.110
So I have to go take indirect actions and set things up and take my time and be

1581
01:42:35.111 --> 01:42:39.070
clandestine and covert.
This is chess,
not checkers.

1582
01:42:39.370 --> 01:42:43.240
This is where you need to master your ability to influence,

1583
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:47.290
which as we talked about in a couple of podcasts ago,
is actually manipulation.

1584
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:51.520
I'm manipulating this guy to think that he's got something over me.

1585
01:42:51.550 --> 01:42:54.580
I'm inflating his ego while I'm putting my ego in check.

1586
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:58.510
I'm making him feel like he's even better and that makes him feel good.

1587
01:42:58.511 --> 01:43:03.220
It makes him want to support me because I make him look good.
This is,

1588
01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:08.110
this is just basic.
If you do this wrong,

1589
01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:11.920
the new manager will resist you at every turn.

1590
01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:17.200
If you do this right,
he will be your biggest supporter.

1591
01:43:18.250 --> 01:43:22.450
Now,
this is the same thing with leaders that you quote unquote don't respect.

1592
01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.280
First of all,
there should be something that you respect about everybody.

1593
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:28.450
Everybody that you meet,

1594
01:43:28.451 --> 01:43:32.020
you should have some kind of respect for them and by the way,

1595
01:43:32.050 --> 01:43:35.350
if you don't respect someone,
what is making you not respect them?

1596
01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:40.540
It's your ego.
It's your ego that makes you not respect people.
Because you think,

1597
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:42.940
oh,
I'm better than them.
I should have their job.

1598
01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:47.590
They don't know what they're talking about.
And I do.
That's all ego,
right?

1599
01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:50.800
So put your ego in check and just be like,
okay,
this person above me,

1600
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:52.580
they really an experienced.
But what can I learn from them?

1601
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:57.440
How did they get there?
If they're so dumb and bad at this job,

1602
01:43:57.470 --> 01:44:01.250
how come they outrank me?
Let me learn something from them.

1603
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:06.830
Let me learn something from them.
Put your ego in check.

1604
01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:09.350
And this is the key point.

1605
01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:14.210
And anytime I talk about quote unquote leading up the chain of command,

1606
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:19.280
I will talk about this,
that no matter what boss I work for,

1607
01:44:19.281 --> 01:44:22.520
and I work for every different kind of boss,
ego,
maniac psychopaths,

1608
01:44:22.521 --> 01:44:25.250
wonderful guys,
intelligent guys,
brilliant guys,

1609
01:44:25.251 --> 01:44:30.251
tacticians I worked for every different kind of boss and I always had the same

1610
01:44:30.621 --> 01:44:33.650
relationship with all of them.
That was my job,

1611
01:44:33.651 --> 01:44:36.650
was to build that relationship and that was a relationship of high trust.

1612
01:44:37.190 --> 01:44:40.460
So they trusted me.
They were to stay out of my way to let me do what I wanted,

1613
01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:44.390
and that's how you win,
which by the way,
when you win,

1614
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:48.770
they should never know you when they shouldn't even know that there was a

1615
01:44:48.771 --> 01:44:52.820
competition happening and that way you can do what you want.

1616
01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:56.870
And so that is how you deal with people above you in the chain of command that

1617
01:44:56.871 --> 01:44:59.930
you have little respect for or that lead from a place of ego.

1618
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:04.580
You build a relationship with them.
You don't go head to head with them.

1619
01:45:04.581 --> 01:45:08.540
You're not going to win and going head to head with your boss.
They're your boss.

1620
01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:12.380
They have rank on you.
If they're an EGOMANIAC,
they're going to use that rank.

1621
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:16.400
If there's someone that you don't respect,

1622
01:45:16.401 --> 01:45:17.870
you've got to build a relationship with them.

1623
01:45:17.871 --> 01:45:19.940
If there's someone that's an Egomaniac,
you got to build really,

1624
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:24.500
regardless of the situation,
the solution is the same.

1625
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:28.730
Build the relationship of trust.
Help them,
build them up,

1626
01:45:29.150 --> 01:45:33.560
take a back seat,
let them get credit.
It's all those things.
And once you do that,

1627
01:45:33.561 --> 01:45:34.394
you're going to have,

1628
01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:37.940
you're going to have much better results than if you try and bang heads with

1629
01:45:37.941 --> 01:45:42.770
them,
overcome them,
defeat them,
have an antagonistic relationship with them.

1630
01:45:42.771 --> 01:45:44.180
It's never gonna work.

1631
01:45:45.260 --> 01:45:48.080
So play the game.

1632
01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.250
You've been lifting heavy weights for many years.
Indeed,
sir.

1633
01:45:58.350 --> 01:46:00.060
Now that you're in your mid forties,

1634
01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.030
are you still seeing gains in strength and muscle?

1635
01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:09.400
Well,
yes I am.
And as a matter of fact,
I think one of the key,
uh,

1636
01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:14.420
kinda measurements of this is only a couple of years ago,
I set my,

1637
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:19.330
my personal all time record for pullups look a couple of years ago,

1638
01:46:19.450 --> 01:46:23.950
Dang,
maybe a year or two ago.
How many did you do?
63.

1639
01:46:24.970 --> 01:46:29.890
Yeah.
So,
uh,
but that being said,
obviously,

1640
01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:33.670
you know you're going to go up and down,
so,
so,
and you don't,

1641
01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:37.210
you can't continually set records on a daily basis.
So,

1642
01:46:37.211 --> 01:46:39.490
so what do I do and what's driving me?

1643
01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:44.700
So what I do is I'm constantly kind of going from goal to goal to go and I get

1644
01:46:47.201 --> 01:46:50.550
on a path where I'm trying to do something and I'll get into something.

1645
01:46:50.551 --> 01:46:55.080
I'll read an article or all see something and I'll go,
that looks cool.

1646
01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:59.220
That looks hard,
that looks like a challenge or I don't think I could do that,

1647
01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:03.570
but I'm going to dry,
you know.
So I'll say,
okay,
you know what man,

1648
01:47:03.571 --> 01:47:05.970
I haven't dead lift heavy in a while.
I'm going to get,
I'm going to get my,

1649
01:47:06.230 --> 01:47:08.280
get my 500 pound dead lift on.

1650
01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:11.620
And so I'll just start focusing on the dead lift.
And that to me,

1651
01:47:11.630 --> 01:47:15.420
I'm dead lifting every day.
But um,
I'm dead to start to go heavy.
Um,

1652
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:19.480
really working it.
I'm starting to all my,
you know,
uh,

1653
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:21.420
maybe I'll be dead lifting a little more often.

1654
01:47:21.421 --> 01:47:24.300
I'll throw it in another day and I'll,

1655
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:29.390
maybe I'll stop a little bit of that sprinting or little bit of that high rep

1656
01:47:30.121 --> 01:47:33.900
stuff and I just start,
you know,
spending more time dead lifting.

1657
01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.000
And after awhile,
you know,

1658
01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:41.120
maybe a month goes by month and a half and I get where I want to be now.

1659
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:46.440
So I get to I,
let's say I get to 500 500 deadlift feeling good.

1660
01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:51.210
Now I could say,
you know what?
I'll want to get five 25 right?

1661
01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.193
I could say that,

1662
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:56.760
but if you think about what I'm going to have to do and anybody that lifts

1663
01:47:56.761 --> 01:48:00.510
weights at all knows that the difference,
like the higher you go,

1664
01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:05.370
the harder it is to increase a little bit more.

1665
01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:09.540
And really what?
What are you getting out of that?
Like in the real world,

1666
01:48:09.541 --> 01:48:12.870
big picture,
what are you getting out of an extra?
You've got 500 pounds,

1667
01:48:12.871 --> 01:48:15.400
you can deadlift.
What are you getting out at an extra 25 pounds?

1668
01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:18.360
The answer is the answer is not a lot.
You know,

1669
01:48:18.361 --> 01:48:23.361
the answer is no one will ever know the difference between you at 500 pound dead

1670
01:48:25.431 --> 01:48:27.510
lift and you at five 20 or five 25.

1671
01:48:27.511 --> 01:48:29.670
No one's going to know that difference when they roll with you.

1672
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:30.721
When they look at you,

1673
01:48:30.721 --> 01:48:35.721
they're not gonna know and you will have to sacrifice other parts of your

1674
01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.520
physicality in order to get there.
You're going to be slower at row sprinting,

1675
01:48:41.670 --> 01:48:42.930
you're probably going to be heavier.

1676
01:48:42.931 --> 01:48:46.230
So you going to be able to do less calisthenic workouts or less,

1677
01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.760
less repetitions and calisthenics.

1678
01:48:47.970 --> 01:48:52.970
So I'll get there and then once I get to like that good goal that I'm looking

1679
01:48:54.031 --> 01:48:56.910
for and then I'll just shift to another goal and I'll start looking at something

1680
01:48:56.911 --> 01:48:59.760
else and you know,

1681
01:48:59.761 --> 01:49:03.840
whatever it's going to be a uh,
a certain number of,
you know,

1682
01:49:03.841 --> 01:49:06.510
a 20 rep squat routine at a certain weight,

1683
01:49:06.511 --> 01:49:09.750
I'll start heading towards that or a certain number of muscle ups and a certain

1684
01:49:09.751 --> 01:49:12.180
number of time or whatever the case may be.
I'll do that.

1685
01:49:12.210 --> 01:49:15.450
And that's what I've been doing for many,

1686
01:49:15.451 --> 01:49:20.451
many years and I never go so far down one path and become so specific that it

1687
01:49:21.961 --> 01:49:26.610
takes away a bunch from the other areas because at the end of the day,

1688
01:49:26.670 --> 01:49:30.990
you know,
I want to be a well rounded.
Yeah,
I think that's,

1689
01:49:33.250 --> 01:49:33.690
<v 2>yeah,</v>

1690
01:49:33.690 --> 01:49:35.820
<v 0>that's a mature,
I would say that's a mature</v>

1691
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:39.290
<v 2>cool</v>

1692
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:42.830
<v 0>pursuit right there.
Cause when you're young you want to,</v>

1693
01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:48.040
I mean not you like everyone,
but I'm just saying pretty general,
pretty

1694
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.110
<v 6>typical that when you're young you want to get,</v>

1695
01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:54.670
you set these not on a bench the most I can possibly bench and you'll go,

1696
01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:58.030
or the dead lift for example,
if you get 500 when you're younger,

1697
01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.930
you want to get that 25 25 you want to get that five 35 you want to get that

1698
01:50:01.931 --> 01:50:06.280
five 55 and you don't really see the big picture.

1699
01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:08.320
You don't see that,
that not only,
yeah,

1700
01:50:08.321 --> 01:50:11.860
you're going to have to spend so much effort just to get that little gains,

1701
01:50:11.861 --> 01:50:13.930
which no one's going to be able to tell unless you're in a competition or

1702
01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:17.920
something like that.
It's different.
But not only are you spending that much time,

1703
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:20.920
you're avoiding time.

1704
01:50:20.921 --> 01:50:24.730
You could be spending developing other aspects of your fitness if you're talking

1705
01:50:24.731 --> 01:50:27.900
to all working out.
So I fell into this night.
Yeah,

1706
01:50:27.901 --> 01:50:31.780
I fell into the same thing about a year ago when I was never really into like

1707
01:50:31.781 --> 01:50:33.670
conditioning in the gym,
you know,

1708
01:50:33.671 --> 01:50:37.810
like muscular conditioning and metabolic conditioning never into that.
Um,

1709
01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:40.360
but once you do that,
you find that Dang,

1710
01:50:40.361 --> 01:50:45.310
there's so many gains I can achieve doing this type of stuff.
When you know,
you,

1711
01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:48.850
I achieved the gains when I was young lifting weights and getting this big bench

1712
01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:52.180
or,
or big muscles or whatever.
But in,

1713
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:56.340
when you're talking about like your physical body and fitness and stuff,
um,

1714
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:58.900
gains in strength and muscle,

1715
01:50:59.150 --> 01:51:04.150
there's almost endless ways you can develop strength and muscle or physical

1716
01:51:05.381 --> 01:51:07.810
conditioning.
You mean physical testing as a whole?
Yeah.

1717
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:11.050
So Straight and strength is,
I mean,
I know strength is defined,

1718
01:51:11.051 --> 01:51:13.030
but really when you kind of talk about strength,
that's like a,

1719
01:51:13.031 --> 01:51:14.410
that's a general term.

1720
01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:18.400
Like you can even say his distance running is strong.

1721
01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:21.640
Like he has a strong aspect of his game or whatever.
That's not true.

1722
01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:28.060
This is usually usually not smelling.
Yeah.
But we'll just say his game is strong.

1723
01:51:28.710 --> 01:51:31.990
Yeah.
Is good or whatever it is,
I guess what you'd call it.

1724
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.140
But either way games and just in general,
you know,
um,

1725
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:40.200
and the more elements of physicality you have developed,

1726
01:51:40.840 --> 01:51:44.620
the better off you're going to be.
Absolutely.
So,
yeah.
If you,
if you,

1727
01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:48.460
so a lot of times when when they talk about gains in strength and muscle,

1728
01:51:48.461 --> 01:51:52.720
that means the numbers.
Yeah.
500 and now I'm getting fired.
I'm,
you know,

1729
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:57.280
mid forties now am I still getting gains in strength and muscle,

1730
01:51:57.281 --> 01:52:02.281
but there's so many other gains to get in all kinds of different physical

1731
01:52:02.561 --> 01:52:03.940
activities here.
And like I said,

1732
01:52:03.941 --> 01:52:07.870
that's the mature way to pursue it is to pursue all those things and set a cool

1733
01:52:07.871 --> 01:52:11.350
goal.
And when the diminishing returns start to come about,

1734
01:52:11.351 --> 01:52:14.680
then you shift your goal again and then at the end of the day you're going to

1735
01:52:14.681 --> 01:52:15.520
end of the day.

1736
01:52:15.521 --> 01:52:20.521
But the big picture of what you're going to end up with is this fully developed

1737
01:52:20.591 --> 01:52:24.850
physicality that applies to way more things in life than they would if you're

1738
01:52:24.851 --> 01:52:29.710
just trying to get that bench up or that dead lift up.
So yeah,

1739
01:52:29.711 --> 01:52:33.340
your mic,
your,
your pursuit.
That's,
that's,
that's a very eyeopening thing.

1740
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:37.120
I think I fell into it,
but the way you put it,
I think that's very important,

1741
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:38.890
especially when you start to get older,

1742
01:52:39.250 --> 01:52:44.250
you know when functioning overall [inaudible] this is not something that I

1743
01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:45.980
started doing.
I got

1744
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:49.190
<v 0>older when we were young in the seal teams,
we would do this.
We'd be like,</v>

1745
01:52:49.191 --> 01:52:49.970
all right,

1746
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:52.910
we're going to get to bench 300 and once we were mentioned 300 we'd say,

1747
01:52:53.070 --> 01:52:56.210
all right,
we're going to go.
And we'd be doing things like,
hey,

1748
01:52:56.211 --> 01:52:59.000
we're going to do the six mile run in x amount of time that we get that we'd
say,

1749
01:52:59.001 --> 01:53:00.950
oh,
we're gonna do 50 pull ups and then we get to that.

1750
01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.880
So we've been doing this for awhile.

1751
01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:04.300
<v 6>Yeah.
And I think that,
yeah,</v>

1752
01:53:04.301 --> 01:53:07.690
I'm sure there's a lot of people that actually conduct themselves like that.

1753
01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:11.120
Like I know Tim Ferriss kind of does that and just even more so than just an

1754
01:53:11.121 --> 01:53:14.470
exercise just in a lot of in life,
you know,
he'll do that,
he'll set a goal,

1755
01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:18.580
he'll experience it or,
um,
and then he'll shift it and do something else.

1756
01:53:18.581 --> 01:53:22.510
And there's guys who,
they kind of devote their life as almost like a hobby,

1757
01:53:22.511 --> 01:53:24.910
but just a part of their life will,
they'll do,

1758
01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:27.190
every year they'll take on something new.
They'll be like,

1759
01:53:27.191 --> 01:53:28.840
I'm going to learn the guitar just this whole year.

1760
01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:32.420
And then next year is something else or whatever.
Yeah.
And more so than an,

1761
01:53:33.130 --> 01:53:35.950
I'm not necessarily saying that.
I think it comes with age.

1762
01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.750
I'm just saying that's a mature way,

1763
01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:40.100
<v 0>two,
two</v>

1764
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:44.260
<v 6>to get gains.
It's a smart way to run your life.
Yes.
Yes.
Very smart.</v>

1765
01:53:48.210 --> 01:53:48.960
<v 2>So</v>

1766
01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.410
<v 6>next question.
Okay.</v>

1767
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:54.840
You talk about people becoming aware as a leader,

1768
01:53:56.980 --> 01:53:59.170
<v 0>when did you become aware as a leader?</v>

1769
01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:04.180
I think I've actually told this story before,
but it was,

1770
01:54:04.450 --> 01:54:07.180
it is pretty clear memory to me.
I was doing,

1771
01:54:07.181 --> 01:54:12.181
I was a young seal probably in my first or second was actually my second platoon

1772
01:54:12.730 --> 01:54:17.730
and we were taking down an oil rig and oil rigs are very complicated.

1773
01:54:18.401 --> 01:54:19.240
There's a lot of,

1774
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:24.510
there's different levels to the oil rigs and there you can see through all the

1775
01:54:25.751 --> 01:54:28.510
levels because the floors are,
is made of great basically.

1776
01:54:28.540 --> 01:54:32.290
So you can see multiple different directions,
360 degrees,

1777
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:37.500
and there's all kinds of gear and equipment all over the different levels.

1778
01:54:37.661 --> 01:54:41.470
So it's,
it can be pretty complicated.
Anyways,
we came up onto this level,

1779
01:54:41.471 --> 01:54:44.970
so I'm going to put a seal platoon and we got 15 or 20 guys and we come up onto

1780
01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:45.940
this level and everyone,

1781
01:54:45.970 --> 01:54:50.740
everyone spreads out in a line and we're looking at the level and there's all

1782
01:54:50.741 --> 01:54:53.380
kinds of complex stuff in front of us.
And we're trying to clear it,
you know,

1783
01:54:53.381 --> 01:54:55.720
you're looking for bad guys or whatever.
Again,

1784
01:54:55.721 --> 01:55:00.040
this is just training and as we're looking at everyone kind of freezes because

1785
01:55:00.041 --> 01:55:02.980
there's so much complexity out there that everyone just kind of freezes,

1786
01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:05.290
just goes with physical layout,

1787
01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:08.350
just the physical layer is just confusing and it looked,
you know,

1788
01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:13.120
confusing and complex.
And so as I stood there,

1789
01:55:13.150 --> 01:55:17.140
everyone froze.
And as everyone froze,

1790
01:55:17.710 --> 01:55:18.543
I,

1791
01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:23.880
I basically came offline and put my gun to high port and I said,

1792
01:55:25.930 --> 01:55:29.800
hold left,
move.
Right?
So,
so I was able to step back,
look around,

1793
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:34.180
assess a good solution for the situation.
And once I assessed the situation,

1794
01:55:34.181 --> 01:55:36.790
I just called out what to do.
I said,
hold left,
move.
Right?

1795
01:55:36.791 --> 01:55:39.340
Which basically mean the guys on the left stay where you're at,

1796
01:55:39.341 --> 01:55:41.650
the guys in the right,
we're going to move on and do the clearance.

1797
01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:46.290
And the guys did.
And I realized right then,
you know,
like,
wow,
I can,

1798
01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:51.880
I can kind of,
I think I got it.
I think I got this.
And it wasn't,

1799
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:54.300
then I didn't all of a sudden start trying to take charge of everything.

1800
01:55:54.301 --> 01:55:57.360
Cause in the seal teams you can't just as a new guy step up and start taking

1801
01:55:57.361 --> 01:55:58.980
charge of stuff and you know you'll get put in your place.

1802
01:55:59.670 --> 01:56:04.350
But I had that vision and the vision that I actually had was that patient of

1803
01:56:04.351 --> 01:56:05.130
detachment,

1804
01:56:05.130 --> 01:56:08.910
the vision of coming offline and stepping out of the tactical situation and

1805
01:56:08.911 --> 01:56:12.900
realizing that when you step back you can see everything.

1806
01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:15.240
And that was like a miracle to me.

1807
01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:19.260
And once I realized that it was always easy for me to do that from then on.

1808
01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:20.460
And not only that,

1809
01:56:20.461 --> 01:56:25.461
but it became easy for me to do that in regular life and in other things that

1810
01:56:25.471 --> 01:56:30.240
I'm doing and having conversations and dealing with relationships and making

1811
01:56:30.241 --> 01:56:35.241
sure I'm not getting dragged down into these crazy relationships situations or

1812
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:40.230
you know,
business situations where there's a lot of emotion going on and saying,

1813
01:56:40.231 --> 01:56:40.651
you know what,

1814
01:56:40.651 --> 01:56:45.600
I just gotta just gotta step back and observe this from a better vantage point.

1815
01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:46.830
That's more,

1816
01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:49.240
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1817
01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:52.690
<v 0>Unbiased.
Next question.</v>

1818
01:56:53.740 --> 01:56:55.990
What if you don't have a good mentor?

1819
01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:03.860
So w we talk about mentorship and how mentorship is important and it's good to

1820
01:57:03.861 --> 01:57:07.190
have mentors and I would agree it's good to have mentors if you can find them

1821
01:57:07.191 --> 01:57:08.960
and you can't always find them.

1822
01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.540
And so I think this individual that asks this question,

1823
01:57:11.541 --> 01:57:13.970
what if you don't have a good mentor?
What do you do?

1824
01:57:15.320 --> 01:57:16.153
<v 1>And</v>

1825
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:21.750
<v 0>for me,
it actually brings back my memories of when I first got to the seal teams</v>

1826
01:57:21.751 --> 01:57:23.460
because when I first got to the seal teams,

1827
01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:29.180
it was actually pretty hard to find a good mentor that I looked at and said,

1828
01:57:31.341 --> 01:57:32.174
you know,

1829
01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:36.410
I want to be like that person and they were going to invest in you.

1830
01:57:36.860 --> 01:57:38.210
So it was one thing to say,
hey,

1831
01:57:38.211 --> 01:57:41.660
that guy looks like a bad ass and I want to be like them.
That was easy.

1832
01:57:42.050 --> 01:57:45.470
But to have someone that says,
hey listen,
new guy,

1833
01:57:45.710 --> 01:57:48.140
I'm going to invest in you and,
and you know,

1834
01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:52.730
make you into a great seal that that really wasn't happening.
Um,

1835
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:55.080
you know,
we had,
first of all the reasons,

1836
01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:58.420
some of the reasons it wasn't happening was because there was guys that were you

1837
01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.990
on constant going on deployments.

1838
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:04.550
And so it wasn't like someone would grab you and pull you aside and when you got

1839
01:58:04.551 --> 01:58:07.430
in a seal platoon it became a little bit easier and you'd usually find somebody

1840
01:58:07.431 --> 01:58:10.580
that's going to at least take some interest in you.
But the,

1841
01:58:10.610 --> 01:58:15.260
like the Vietnam guys,
they were around but they were,
you know,

1842
01:58:15.261 --> 01:58:18.770
instructors and or working in the training department.
So they didn't,

1843
01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:21.890
you weren't going to see them on a daily basis.
They weren't going to mentor you.

1844
01:58:21.891 --> 01:58:26.060
They weren't going to be there for you.
And I'll tell you,
not only that,

1845
01:58:26.061 --> 01:58:29.680
but the guys that I went through training with and,

1846
01:58:29.681 --> 01:58:32.900
and the guys that I ended up going to my first team with,

1847
01:58:36.590 --> 01:58:41.590
we actually wanted to be more hardcore than what saw,

1848
01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:44.890
you know,
we actually wanted to take it to another level.

1849
01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:49.450
And so,
to be honest with you,

1850
01:58:49.451 --> 01:58:54.451
we kind of mentored ourselves and we set the standard of what we thought a seal

1851
01:58:56.471 --> 01:59:01.300
was supposed to be like in our minds.
And we started to act upon it.
I mean,

1852
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:05.460
I remember we were doing the,

1853
01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:10.560
the runs and the swims at the seal team with our full gear.

1854
01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:13.330
So like a,
the guys that the team would be wearing,
you know,

1855
01:59:13.331 --> 01:59:18.331
sneakers and a pair of shorts and we'd be wearing boots and a ruck sack in the,

1856
01:59:19.070 --> 01:59:21.490
they would be looking at us like we were kind of crazy,
you know.

1857
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:25.360
But that was us kind of mentoring ourselves.

1858
01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:27.220
And we did that with everything.
You know,

1859
01:59:27.221 --> 01:59:29.400
we were spending time at the team on the weekend.

1860
01:59:29.401 --> 01:59:33.280
We would inspect each other's gear over and over again and modify it and make

1861
01:59:33.281 --> 01:59:34.360
sure it's squared away.

1862
01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:39.280
And we were constantly trying to learn and teach each other different things.

1863
01:59:39.281 --> 01:59:42.250
I remember trying to teach each other about the different radios that they had

1864
01:59:42.251 --> 01:59:44.270
and different kinds of knots that we had learned.
And so we,

1865
01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:49.300
we were always just kind of mentoring ourselves.
And so I think,

1866
01:59:49.690 --> 01:59:50.920
you know,
that's,

1867
01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:56.500
that's the point is that if you can't find a good mentor,

1868
01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:00.010
then you've got to become your own.
And I think with,

1869
02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:02.410
with the way the world is now,

1870
02:00:02.411 --> 02:00:06.850
it's actually relatively easy to do that.
I mean,
first of all,
you can,

1871
02:00:06.940 --> 02:00:08.440
you can research what you want to be like.

1872
02:00:08.441 --> 02:00:10.090
You can figure out who you want to be like,

1873
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:12.400
or maybe it's not who you want to be like,

1874
02:00:12.401 --> 02:00:17.401
but what aspects of other humans you can take and bring on board.

1875
02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:21.250
Now that is something I did with all kinds of seals.

1876
02:00:21.251 --> 02:00:24.310
There was all kinds of Badass seals that I said that guy's really good at this

1877
02:00:24.311 --> 02:00:25.990
and I'm going to try and get good at that too.

1878
02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:29.710
Or the way that guy acts in this situation is awesome and I'm going to try and

1879
02:00:29.711 --> 02:00:32.770
act that way too.
So it wasn't like I was trying to be like them,

1880
02:00:32.771 --> 02:00:36.820
but I was at least trying to emulate the best aspects of these different

1881
02:00:36.821 --> 02:00:37.690
individuals.

1882
02:00:38.020 --> 02:00:42.160
And I think there's a lot of examples out there today where you can do that.

1883
02:00:42.161 --> 02:00:44.500
You can look for people to emulate.
You can,
I mean,

1884
02:00:44.530 --> 02:00:48.550
on youtube you can basically find out how to do anything.
Um,
in fact,

1885
02:00:48.551 --> 02:00:49.780
you need to be careful that you're,

1886
02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:54.820
that you sanity check some of the people that you look into,
uh,
on,
on that.

1887
02:00:55.150 --> 02:00:59.050
But I think the key really to mentoring yourself,

1888
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:05.070
it goes back to what we just talked about with detachment because you need to,

1889
02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:07.960
if you want a mentor yourself,

1890
02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:10.000
you gotta be able to look at yourself and you've got gotta be able to look

1891
02:01:10.010 --> 02:01:11.890
yourself in an honest way.

1892
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:17.070
And that means you need to be able to detach yourself and observe yourself from

1893
02:01:18.911 --> 02:01:23.050
that distant place.
By distance,
I mean three feet,
I mean,

1894
02:01:23.051 --> 02:01:27.430
just from just outside of inside your own brain.
And if you detach,

1895
02:01:27.431 --> 02:01:32.431
you can see where you're making mistakes and you can see what the long range you

1896
02:01:34.841 --> 02:01:38.410
that you're striving for.
You can see what it's going to take to get there.

1897
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.860
And I think that's this,
that's what,

1898
02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:47.920
that's what I've done when I haven't had a mentor is I've figured out a way to

1899
02:01:48.351 --> 02:01:49.220
mentor myself.

1900
02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.640
And I think the goals that you set and the path that you draw out and you detach

1901
02:01:54.891 --> 02:01:58.340
yourself so that you can give yourself an honest observation of who you are and

1902
02:01:58.341 --> 02:02:02.780
how you're doing and I think that is a,
a good way to handle it.

1903
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:14.280
<v 2>All right.
Um,
we'll do one more right.</v>

1904
02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:15.190
Last question.

1905
02:02:17.770 --> 02:02:22.350
<v 0>Uh,
any thoughts on how to crank up the discipline and um,</v>

1906
02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:25.530
where does discipline even come from?

1907
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:33.050
Where does discipline come from?

1908
02:02:36.140 --> 02:02:40.430
Just a classic question and whoever asked that question,

1909
02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.490
I would say thank you for asking that question.

1910
02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.550
Where does discipline come from?

1911
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:52.330
And and the answer is actually pretty simple and pretty obvious discipline comes

1912
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:56.750
from within.

1913
02:02:58.430 --> 02:03:02.570
It's an internal force now.
Sure,

1914
02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:07.600
of course you can have discipline imposed on you by some person like,

1915
02:03:09.051 --> 02:03:14.051
like a drill instructor or like that self help guru on TV.

1916
02:03:16.370 --> 02:03:21.370
But the reality is that type of discipline isn't the real type of discipline

1917
02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:24.920
that we're talking about.
That discipline isn't as strong,

1918
02:03:24.921 --> 02:03:29.921
it won't survive that imposed discipline that someone else is putting on you.

1919
02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:38.940
What you're looking for and what you're talking about and what you need is self

1920
02:03:40.231 --> 02:03:44.050
discipline.
Now,
self discipline,

1921
02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:49.000
as the very term implies,
comes from the self.
It comes from you.

1922
02:03:51.580 --> 02:03:54.850
It comes from when you make a decision

1923
02:03:56.890 --> 02:03:57.880
to be disciplined,

1924
02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:01.960
when you make a decision to be better,

1925
02:04:02.530 --> 02:04:07.270
when you make a decision to do more and to be more

1926
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:12.220
self-discipline.
Combs,

1927
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:17.430
when you decide that you're going to make a mark on the world.

1928
02:04:20.410 --> 02:04:20.600
Yeah.

1929
02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:25.600
And if you think that you're not disciplined or you can't be disciplined,

1930
02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:32.330
it's because you haven't yet decided to be disciplined.

1931
02:04:33.230 --> 02:04:38.190
It's because you haven't created that discipline yet.

1932
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:44.100
It's because you haven't become that discipline

1933
02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:46.953
yet.

1934
02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:56.000
So where does discipline come from?
It comes from you.

1935
02:04:59.350 --> 02:05:03.550
So make the decision,
make the commitment,

1936
02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:06.460
become the discipline,

1937
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:10.100
the discipline,

1938
02:05:10.250 --> 02:05:15.250
the root quality that will improve every aspect of your life and it'll make you

1939
02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:23.440
better and stronger and smarter and faster and healthier.

1940
02:05:25.670 --> 02:05:26.990
And most importantly,

1941
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:32.040
it'll make you free.

1942
02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:42.080
And that's pretty much all I've got for tonight.

1943
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:49.470
