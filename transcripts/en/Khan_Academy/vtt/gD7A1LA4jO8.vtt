00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.540
Ian can rake a lawn and
bag the leaves in 5 hours.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.820
Kyandre can rake the same lawn
and bag the leaves in 3 hours.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.030
Working together,
how long would it

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.019
take them to rake the
lawn and bag the leaves?

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.560
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.540
It says Ian can rake a lawn and
bag of the leaves in 5 hours.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.810
So for Ian, I for Ian.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:32.544
For 1 lawn, he can
do 1 lawn in 5 hours.

00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:34.710
We could have also written
this as 5 hours per lawn.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.150
But we'll see that
writing it this way

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.025
is more useful, because
it's actually a rate.

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:45.840
Because this is the same
thing as 1/5 lawns per hour.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.130
Or 1/5 of a lawn per hour.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
That's the rate at
which Ian can rake

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.640
a lawn, at 1/5 of
a lawn per hour.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.162
Now let's do the same
thing for Kyandre.

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:59.120
And this actually probably
shouldn't be plural.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.830
1/5 lawns, 1/5 of a lawn.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.750
So let me just
erase that S right

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.070
there-- 1/5 of a lawn per hour.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.660
Now let's do the same
thing for Kyandre.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.800
Kyandre can rake the same lawn
and bag the leaves in 3 hours.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.930
So for Kyandre, Kyandre can,
for 1 lawn-- I'll assume it's

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.090
a boy's name-- he
can do it in 3 hours.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.420
Or if we were to
write it as a rate,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.200
this is 1/3 of a lawn per hour.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.520
Now let's think about
what the combined rate is.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.620
So let's say if we
have Ian plus Kyandre.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.910
What's going to be
their combined rate?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.670
Well, they tell us that working
together, how long would

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.660
it take them to rake
and bag the leaves?

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.130
So let's let let's let t be
how long it will take them

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.630
together.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.370
So that's how long they
would take together.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.400
And if we say t is how
long they take together,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.050
then we could say
that combined, they

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.950
will do 1 lawn in
every t hours, if we're

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.240
assuming t is in hours.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.620
For every t hours.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.700
Or as a rate,
their combined rate

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.110
is going to be 1/t
of a lawn per hour.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.330
So that's their combined rate.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.720
So here, we have the rate of
Ian and the rate of Kyandre,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.990
and the combined rate.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.365
So the combined
rate's just going

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:46.110
to be the sum of
each of their rates.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.790
If he can do 1/5
of a lawn per hour

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.720
and he can do 1/3
of a lawn per hour,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.400
their combined rate is going
to be 1/5 of a lawn per hour

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.460
plus 1/3 of an hour.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.584
Because in an hour he'll
do 1/5, and he'll do 1/3.

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:57.500
So you'll add those two
together to figure out

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.750
how much they can do in an hour.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.086
So their combined rate is
going to be 1/5 lawn per hour.

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.460
And I won't write
the units here,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.751
just because it gets redundant.

00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.790
1/5 lawn per hour I
could write over here.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.800
Plus 1/3 lawn per
hour for Kyandre.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.640
That's going to be
their total rate, which

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.780
is 1/t lawns per hour.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.300
And now we just
have to solve for t.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.830
And we'll know the total number
of hours it will take them.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.860
So let's do that.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.910
So to do that, we just
have to add 1/5 plus 1/3.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.460
Well, we have a common
denominator of 15.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:44.310
So this is the same
thing as 3/15 plus 5/15

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.676
is going to be equal to 1/t.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.720
And then we have a
common denominator now.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.420
So 3 plus 5 is 8.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.760
So this is going to be 8/15.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.830
I'll go over here now.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.540
So now we have 3 plus 5 is 8.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.212
Over 15 is equal to 1 over t.

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:05.670
If we want to solve
for t, we could

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.780
take the reciprocal
of both sides.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.720
So if we flip the left
side, we get 15/8.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.769
And if we flip the right
side, we get t/1, or just t.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.952
So it'll take them 15/8 hours.

00:04:19.952 --> 00:04:21.410
Or if we want that
in kind of a way

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.720
that we can think about it a
little bit better, 15/8-- so t

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.010
is equal to 15 over 8 hours.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.990
And I should say 15
over 8 hours per lawn.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.500
This whole time here
we had lawns per hour.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.400
This was lawn per hour.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.240
And this was here as
well, lawns per hour.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.230
When we flip it, it
becomes hours per lawn.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.070
So that's exactly what we want.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.190
But 15/8 is the same
thing as 1 and 7/8 hours.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.080
And 7/8 of an hour-- we
can get our calculator out.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.010
If we have 60 minutes
in an hour, times 7/8,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.980
we get 52.5 minutes.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.630
So this is equal to our answer.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:20.020
Combined, it will take them 1
hour and 52.5 minutes per lawn.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.660
Or to do this lawn right over
here, the lawn in question.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.344
Hopefully, you
found that useful.
