00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.100
In reality, most studies of twins are

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.370
of twins raised together rather than in different

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.190
environments. But we can still estimate heritability

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.300
by comparing the concordance of a trait between

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.750
monozygotic and dizygotic twins even when they've

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.460
been raised in similar environments. So if a

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.510
pair of twins matches for a trait We

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.360
call it concordance. If they don't match then

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.200
we call it a discordance. The higher

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.119
the concordance for trait in monozygotic twins, compared

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.590
to dizygotic twins. Then the higher the heritability

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.570
of that trait. In other words, the higher

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.360
the match in monozygotic twins, when there's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.870
a non-match in dizygotic twins, suggests that the

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.200
difference is the genetics, that the fact that

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.630
the monozygotic twins are identical, whereas dizygotic twins

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.895
are only half identical, right, they only share

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:57.530
50%. That being identical, those genes, those genetic factors,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.250
are important in making the match. Alternatively, if

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.319
we found a lot of matching between monozygotic twins,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.980
as well as a lot of matching between

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.130
dizygotic twins, because we know that there's the huge

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.750
difference in the genetic identity between these pairs

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.640
of twins that whatever's going on with the matching.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.730
Likely has more to do with the environment

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.450
that the twins are raised in rather than

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.100
the fact that the monozygotic twins are identical.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.740
Rather than genetics. For example, suppose you're interested in

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.585
handedness, right or left handedness. Taylor here is

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:33.420
left-handed and so is Grant. So they're concordant for

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.760
handedness. Now does this mean that handedness has

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.810
a high heritability? Why or why not? I want

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.740
you to think about this for a second, don't just

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.740
jump the gun and put something down. Think about the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.140
question and then come up with what you think is

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.180
a good answer put it in the text box here.
