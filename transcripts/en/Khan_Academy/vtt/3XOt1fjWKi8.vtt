00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.725
We're asked to identify the
numerator and denominator in

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:08.400
the fraction 3 over 4, or 3/4.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.140
So let's rewrite this just
so it's nice and big.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.580
So let me just write
the fraction.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:20.470
So we have 3 over 4, 3/4.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.880
Now, they want us to identify
the numerator and the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.130
denominator.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.040
So the numerator is just the
number on top, so the

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.600
numerator is the
3 right there.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.080
And then they want us to
find the denominator.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.160
The denominator is just the
number on the bottom.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.050
It's the 4.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.180
So if they say what's
the numerator?

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.810
3.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.310
What's the denominator?

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.220
It's 4, just the number
on the bottom.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.910
They could've just called this
the number on the bottom.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.340
They could've just called
this the number on top.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.680
Now to think about what this
represents, what this fraction

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.600
represents, you can think
of it as three out of

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.270
four pieces of a pie.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.380
That's how I think about it.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.330
So you can imagine, the
denominator tells us, what are

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.680
we taking a fraction out of or
how many pieces are there?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.950
So let's imagine a
pie like this.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.240
So we could draw like
a square pie.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.230
So this is what the denominator
represents.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.100
This is what the number on
the bottom represents.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.510
And then 3 says, we are
representing three of those

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.950
four pieces.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.390
So this 3 tells us that out of
4 possible ones, I guess you

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.580
could think of it, we are using
three, or maybe we're

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.360
eating three.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.205
So you can imagine if someone
says I ate three-fourths of a

00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:35.880
pie-- this would be read as
three-fourths-- they're eating

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.740
the blue portion of the pie
if we cut it this way.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.380
If we imagine a round pie,
it would look like this.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.905
Let me draw a round pie.

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:47.190
So that is my round pie.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.400
Let me cut it into four
equal pieces or

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.320
roughly equal pieces.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.030
And if someone says I ate
three-fourths of this pie,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.070
where the 3 is the numerator,
and then the 4, and you'd read

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.650
that as three-fourths, the 4 is
the denominator, they would

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.190
eat this much of the pie.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.480
They would eat 3 of
the 4 pieces.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.520
So this is is one piece, this
is two pieces, and this is

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.720
three pieces.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.200
So you could imagine the 4, the
denominator represents the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.730
total number of pieces in the
pie, and then the 3 represents

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.200
how many of those we ate.
