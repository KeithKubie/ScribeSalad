that I'm not actually using the trailer
 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.880
that I'm not actually using the trailer
in this review and that's because the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
in this review and that's because the
 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.979
in this review and that's because the
trailer of this movie gives away not

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989
trailer of this movie gives away not
 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.809
trailer of this movie gives away not
only the ending of the film but it

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819
only the ending of the film but it
 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.520
only the ending of the film but it
actually makes you think that something

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530
actually makes you think that something
 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.259
actually makes you think that something
happens that doesn't so if you haven't

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269
happens that doesn't so if you haven't
 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.000
happens that doesn't so if you haven't
watched the trailer please avoid it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
watched the trailer please avoid it
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.170
watched the trailer please avoid it
because it kind of ruined the ending of

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
because it kind of ruined the ending of
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.490
because it kind of ruined the ending of
the movie for me not just because I knew

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
the movie for me not just because I knew
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.990
the movie for me not just because I knew
it was going to happen but because I was

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
it was going to happen but because I was
 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.220
it was going to happen but because I was
expecting something to happen that

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230
expecting something to happen that
 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.420
expecting something to happen that
didn't and it was a little bit

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
didn't and it was a little bit
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.069
didn't and it was a little bit
disappointing it's not really the film's

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079
disappointing it's not really the film's
 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.319
disappointing it's not really the film's
fault though at first I was mad at the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329
fault though at first I was mad at the
 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.550
fault though at first I was mad at the
movie but then I realized it's really

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
movie but then I realized it's really
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.080
movie but then I realized it's really
the trailers fault so I can't really

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090
the trailers fault so I can't really
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.490
the trailers fault so I can't really
fault the movie for that some of the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
fault the movie for that some of the
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.720
fault the movie for that some of the
problems I had with the gray were I

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730
problems I had with the gray were I
