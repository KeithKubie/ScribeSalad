00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.680
All right.
Let's get started.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.333
I guess this watch is a couple
minutes fast.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:27.431
First a quick announcement.
In case you have forgotten,

00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:34.267
your lab notebooks are due
tomorrow with the post-lab

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:41.425
exercises for the first lab.
OK, so I am going to continue

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:45.859
with amplifiers today.
And to just give you a sense of

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.288
where we headed,
we have this five lecture

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:53.722
sequence covering different
aspects of amplifiers with

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:59.076
dependent sources and showed how
we could build an amplifier with

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:04.063
it on Tuesday.
Today I am going to show you a

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:08.760
real device that implements a
dependent source.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.274
And then next Tuesday we will
talk about analysis of an

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.542
amplifier.
Wednesday is our quiz.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:23.566
Thursday and the Tuesday after
that we then talk about small

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:30.000
signal analysis and small signal
use of the amplifier.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Today we will talk about the
MOSFET amplifier.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.400
So let's start with a quick
review.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.900
And in the last lecture,
I showed you that I could build

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.000
a amplifier using a dependent
source.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.693
And a dependent source worked
as follows.

00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:16.617
Let's say I had a circuit and I
connected a dependent source

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:21.780
into the circuit.
Let's say in this example I

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.000
have a current source.
So this is some circuit.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.230
And the current i is a function
of some parameter in the

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.845
circuit.
That's why this is a dependent

00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:40.078
source.
This is a dependent current

00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:43.692
source.
So it could be that I have some

00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:46.451
element inside.
And I measure,

00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:51.872
I sample the voltage across the
element or between any two

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:56.532
points in the circuit.
And, in this little example

00:02:56.532 --> 00:03:03.000
here, this current could be
dependent on that voltage.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.372
So notice that although I
showed you the two terminals of

00:03:07.372 --> 00:03:10.729
the dependent source that
carried a current,

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:15.102
there is another implicit port,
another implicit terminal

00:03:15.102 --> 00:03:17.600
there.
And that terminal there is

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.207
called the "control port" of the
dependent source at which I

00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:26.891
apply a voltage or current that
will control the value of the

00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.000
current source.
As a quick aside.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.837
There is a small glitch with
the tools in your tool chest.

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:46.911
We talked about the
superposition technique where

00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:50.900
you were taught to turn on one
source at a time,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.077
for a linear circuit one source
at a time, and then sum up the

00:03:56.077 --> 00:04:01.000
responses to all the sources
acting one at a time.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.540
Well, what do you do about
dependent sources?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.045
A dependent source is a source.
And we have to modify the

00:04:09.045 --> 00:04:12.344
superposition statement just a
little bit.

00:04:12.344 --> 00:04:17.091
And for details you can look at
Section 3.5.1 of your course

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:21.597
notes on the details and some
examples on how to do this.

00:04:21.597 --> 00:04:24.816
So the approach is very simple,
actually.

00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:27.551
The approach is,
for the purpose of

00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:30.850
superposition,
to not treat your dependent

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.000
source as sources that you turn
on and turn off.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.918
So what you do is when you do
superposition with dependent

00:04:39.918 --> 00:04:43.562
sources simply leave all your
dependent sources in the

00:04:43.562 --> 00:04:46.037
circuit.
Just leave them in there and

00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:49.131
turn on and off only your
independent sources.

00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:52.981
So look at the response of the
circuit by turning on your

00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:56.487
independent sources one at a
time and summing up the

00:04:56.487 --> 00:05:00.423
responses.
And your dependent sources stay

00:05:00.423 --> 00:05:05.114
within the circuit and simply
analyze them as you do anything

00:05:05.114 --> 00:05:07.850
else.
So essentially what it says is

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.697
that just be a little cautious
when you have dependent sources,

00:05:12.697 --> 00:05:16.918
but the basic method applies
almost without any change.

00:05:16.918 --> 00:05:22.000
The readings for today's
lecture are Section 7.3 to 7.6.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.780
So since we are going to build
up on the dependent source

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:39.077
amplifier, let me start with a
quick review of that amplifier.

00:05:39.077 --> 00:05:43.000
We built our amplifier as
follows.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.222
We connected our dependent
source in the following manner.

00:05:58.222 --> 00:06:02.518
And the current through the
dependent source in the example

00:06:02.518 --> 00:06:06.000
we took was related to an input
voltage vI.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.292
So some voltage vI.
And so these two were the

00:06:16.292 --> 00:06:21.756
control port of the dependent
source and a vI was applied

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.780
there.
And I showed you a simple

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.536
amplifier built with a dependent
source that behaved in this

00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:34.289
manner.
And again I will keep reminding

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.352
you, just remember that the
dependent source is actually

00:06:38.352 --> 00:06:41.676
this box here,
the control port and the output

00:06:41.676 --> 00:06:43.596
port.
And commonly we don't

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:48.250
explicitly show the control port
for those dependent sources for

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.607
which the control port does not
have any other affect on the

00:06:52.607 --> 00:06:58.000
circuit, like it doesn't draw
any current or things like that.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.731
So in this particular example
we said that this behaved in the

00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:11.462
following manner for vI greater
than or equal to 1 volt and iD

00:07:11.462 --> 00:07:14.000
was zero otherwise.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.972
So we can analyze the circuit
to figure out what vO is going

00:07:26.972 --> 00:07:31.322
to look like.
And a simple application of KVL

00:07:31.322 --> 00:07:33.870
at this loop here,
again, you know,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.767
when I say this loop here,
I am pointing at something

00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:40.315
here.
That is the VS source that is

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:42.788
implicitly across these two
nodes.

00:07:42.788 --> 00:07:46.909
Again, this is a shorthand
notation where this little up

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:51.705
arrow here implies that I have a
voltage source connected between

00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:55.602
these two terminals here.
And so there is a loop here

00:07:55.602 --> 00:08:00.643
that involves VS.
So Vo is simply VS minus the

00:08:00.643 --> 00:08:05.457
drop across this resistor.
So it's VS minus the drop

00:08:05.457 --> 00:08:08.477
across this resistor gives me
vO.

00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:13.008
And the drop across the
resistor is simply iD RL.

00:08:13.008 --> 00:08:17.917
iD is the current here and
that's the drop across the

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:21.410
resistor.
And I could get the explicit

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:27.262
relationship of vO versus vI by
substituting for iD as vI minus

00:08:27.262 --> 00:08:32.500
one all squared.
So vO relates to vI in the

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.961
following manner.
Nothing new so far.

00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:41.057
I have pretty much reviewed
what we did the last time.

00:08:41.057 --> 00:08:46.442
Here is where we take our next
step forward with some new

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:50.000
material.
Up to now I have talked as a

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.384
theoretician would where I said
just imagine that you had

00:08:55.384 --> 00:09:00.000
spherical cow or something like
that.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.537
Here I just asked you to
imagine this ideal dependent

00:09:03.537 --> 00:09:07.414
source, control port and an
output port, and it behaved in

00:09:07.414 --> 00:09:10.272
this manner.
So as a next step what I would

00:09:10.272 --> 00:09:14.081
like to do is show you a
practical dependent source which

00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:17.755
turns out to be a little bit
more complicated than this

00:09:17.755 --> 00:09:22.040
idealized dependent source that
I showed you in many dimensions.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.918
Real life tends to impose a
bunch of practical constraints

00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:30.000
on you, and we will look at
those in a second.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
If I could find a dependent
source that looked like this --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We had a control port A prime
and output port B prime.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.178
And I looked at some examples
where the current through the

00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:10.000
dependent current source was
some function of the input

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.303
voltage.
This is a "voltage controlled

00:10:13.303 --> 00:10:17.321
current source".
What I am going to do is talk

00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:22.500
about a device that can give me
this behavior or some close

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.053
approximation to it.
It turns out that under certain

00:10:27.053 --> 00:10:32.410
conditions the MOSFET that you
have already looked at behaves

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:38.000
in this manner.
The MOSFET that you've seen

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.222
sort of behaves like this.
And let me show you under what

00:10:44.222 --> 00:10:49.111
conditions the MOSFET behaves in
that manner.

00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:52.888
Let me create some room for
myself.

00:10:52.888 --> 00:11:00.000
Notice that I need a control
port, needed an output port.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.486
And I am going to view my
MOSFET in a slightly different

00:11:04.486 --> 00:11:07.097
manner than you have seen
before.

00:11:07.097 --> 00:11:09.626
I draw these two terminals
here.

00:11:09.626 --> 00:11:12.563
And this was a three terminal
MOSFET.

00:11:12.563 --> 00:11:16.560
This was my drain,
my gate and my source terminal.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.292
It was a three terminal device,
but what I do is I view the

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:25.942
MOSFET slightly differently.
I will just use this terminal

00:11:25.942 --> 00:11:31.000
to be common across both the
gate and the drain.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.054
And so this voltage here is
vGS.

00:11:34.054 --> 00:11:39.671
I am just using the source
port, the source terminal along

00:11:39.671 --> 00:11:42.824
with the gate as a terminal
pair.

00:11:42.824 --> 00:11:48.441
I am using the same source
along with the drain as another

00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:52.875
terminal pair.
So I have a vDS out there and I

00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:58.000
have some current iDS that flows
out here.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.641
Notice that when I view the
MOSFET in this manner I have

00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:09.384
accomplished my first step,
which is I seem to have a box

00:12:09.384 --> 00:12:13.179
which has a port here and a port
here.

00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:18.615
And I also explained to you
that a MOSFET behaves in a

00:12:18.615 --> 00:12:22.923
particular manner.
For one, the output port

00:12:22.923 --> 00:12:30.000
behaved as an open circuit under
certain conditions when --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.498
This was vGS,
G, drain and source.

00:12:33.498 --> 00:12:39.434
When vGS was less than a
threshold voltage VT this MOSFET

00:12:39.434 --> 00:12:44.416
had an equivalent circuit that
looked like this.

00:12:44.416 --> 00:12:50.883
So when vGS was less than some
threshold voltage VT then there

00:12:50.883 --> 00:12:56.395
was an open circuit between the
drain and the source.

00:12:56.395 --> 00:13:02.526
And you saw this before.
So far nothing new here.

00:13:02.526 --> 00:13:08.000
However, when vGS is greater
than or equal to VT --

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.438
vGS was greater than VT.
The MOSFET behavior we looked

00:13:19.438 --> 00:13:23.960
at earlier showed that this
behaved either like a short

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.236
circuit in the simplest form or
in a slightly more detailed form

00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:34.217
it behaved like a resistor.
We call that the SR model of

00:13:34.217 --> 00:13:37.542
the MOSFET.
So when vGS was greater than VT

00:13:37.542 --> 00:13:42.214
we said that a simple way to
approximate MOSFET behavior was

00:13:42.214 --> 00:13:46.727
to view this as a resistor
connected between the drain and

00:13:46.727 --> 00:13:49.815
the source.
That was our SR model use of

00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:52.903
the MOSFET.
It turns out that we kind of

00:13:52.903 --> 00:13:55.674
lied.
We were sort of looking at the

00:13:55.674 --> 00:14:00.789
MOSFET in a really funny way.
And I shone the light on the

00:14:00.789 --> 00:14:03.153
MOSFET in a really,
really clever way.

00:14:03.153 --> 00:14:06.796
Well, I shouldn't say clever.
A really, really tricky way.

00:14:06.796 --> 00:14:10.502
And tricked you into believing
that it was just a resistor.

00:14:10.502 --> 00:14:13.122
And we constrained how you use
the MOSFET.

00:14:13.122 --> 00:14:16.189
So that behavior was indeed a
resistive behavior.

00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:20.024
But it turns out that in real
life the behavior of the MOSFET

00:14:20.024 --> 00:14:23.474
between the drain and the source
terminals is much more

00:14:23.474 --> 00:14:26.861
complicated than the limited
form in which you saw it.

00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:30.376
So today what I am going to do
is take the wraps off the

00:14:30.376 --> 00:14:34.274
complete MOSFET and show you its
full behavior in all its gory

00:14:34.274 --> 00:14:38.706
glory.
And I will spend a bit of time

00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:44.120
on that to clearly emphasize
under what conditions the MOSFET

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.082
behaves like a resistor,
as you saw when you did digital

00:14:49.082 --> 00:14:54.135
circuits, or behaves differently
in other domains of use.

00:14:54.135 --> 00:15:00.000
Let me pause for a second and
leave this space blank here.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And let's do some
investigations.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.144
Let me leave this here.
I won't draw in anything yet.

00:15:13.144 --> 00:15:17.449
You will figure out what it
looks like yourselves under

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:21.195
certain conditions.
What I will do next is apply

00:15:21.195 --> 00:15:25.898
some voltages on a MOSFET and
observe the current versus vDS

00:15:25.898 --> 00:15:31.000
behavior and plot that on a
scope and take a look at it.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
What I am going to do --

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
-- is figure out what iDS looks
like for --

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.222
Remember iG into the gate for
6.002 is always going to be

00:15:57.222 --> 00:16:00.022
zero.
In much more detailed analyses

00:16:00.022 --> 00:16:02.921
of the MOSFET,
in future courses you may see

00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:07.033
slightly more complex behavior.
But as far as we are concerned

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.932
it is an open circuit looking
into the gate.

00:16:09.932 --> 00:16:13.033
So I am going to apply a vGS
across the MOSFET,

00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:16.606
apply a vDS across the MOSFET
and plot iDS versus vDS.

00:16:16.606 --> 00:16:19.505
First let me show you what you
already know.

00:16:19.505 --> 00:16:22.000
What you already know --

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.702
This is vDS.
I will just keep doing as much

00:16:33.702 --> 00:16:36.610
as I can of what you already
know.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.841
And then when I do some new
stuff I will tell you

00:16:40.841 --> 00:16:43.927
explicitly.
You've seen this before.

00:16:43.927 --> 00:16:49.303
The MOSFET behaves like an open
circuit when vGS less than VT.

00:16:49.303 --> 00:16:53.799
That is when vG is less than a
threshold voltage VT,

00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:59.000
I have zero current flowing
through the MOSFET.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.447
And when vGS was greater than
VT then the S model of the

00:17:03.447 --> 00:17:07.086
MOSFET the switch model simply
said that look,

00:17:07.086 --> 00:17:10.239
we can model the D2S as a short
circuit.

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:14.768
You saw this in your labs and
you saw that it was a very,

00:17:14.768 --> 00:17:19.619
very small resistance between
the drain and the source and it

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.450
kind of looked like a short
circuit.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.846
But then we said well,
that's not quite it.

00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:32.009
There is some resistance.
And so we said a slightly more

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:38.227
accurate model would have this
line droop a little bit to imply

00:17:38.227 --> 00:17:44.246
that there was some resistance
R_on between the drain and the

00:17:44.246 --> 00:17:49.161
source, so vDS iDS.
So this was when vGS less than

00:17:49.161 --> 00:17:52.972
VT and vGS greater than or equal
to VT.

00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:58.188
I have some resistance.
And that showed me a straight

00:17:58.188 --> 00:18:05.807
line kind of like behavior.
And I showed you that behavior.

00:18:05.807 --> 00:18:13.052
So far absolutely nothing new.
Now what I have plotted there

00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:19.929
for you is that behavior.
Up here notice that this is the

00:18:19.929 --> 00:18:27.298
vDS axis, this is the iDS axis.
I am plotting iDS versus vDS.

00:18:27.298 --> 00:18:32.261
And when vGS --
The gate voltage is more than a

00:18:32.261 --> 00:18:36.491
threshold, notice that I see
what looks like something more

00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:40.576
or less like a straight line.
And this is a straight line

00:18:40.576 --> 00:18:43.785
with some slope,
more or less a straight line

00:18:43.785 --> 00:18:47.870
implying resistive behavior.
And we also had some fun and

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.548
games here.
We said hey,

00:18:49.548 --> 00:18:51.590
what if I turn vGS off?
Boom.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.967
That would be my iDS of zero
implying that the MOSFET behaved

00:18:55.967 --> 00:19:01.000
like an open circuit between the
drain and the source.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.656
I applied a positive vGS more
than VT and it began to look

00:19:05.656 --> 00:19:08.025
like a resistor.
Open circuit,

00:19:08.025 --> 00:19:10.966
resistor, open circuit,
resistor, OK?

00:19:10.966 --> 00:19:15.377
Up until now nothing new.
So you shouldn't have learned

00:19:15.377 --> 00:19:19.952
anything at all that is new
until now in today's lecture.

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:22.811
Now watch.
What I am going to do is,

00:19:22.811 --> 00:19:27.712
as I said, I kind of lied all
this time and I just showed you

00:19:27.712 --> 00:19:32.319
this behavior.
And what I have been doing all

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:36.572
along is very carefully using a
very small value of vDS.

00:19:36.572 --> 00:19:39.123
Notice it's a small values of
vDS.

00:19:39.123 --> 00:19:43.298
I haven't told you what it
looks like as vDS increases.

00:19:43.298 --> 00:19:46.932
Well, let's go try it out.
We have a scope here.

00:19:46.932 --> 00:19:50.798
We have the MOSFET here.
Now, I am not sure what is

00:19:50.798 --> 00:19:54.510
going to happen now.
You may see smoke or have an

00:19:54.510 --> 00:20:00.000
explosion, who knows what?
But look up there for a second.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.969
I am just going to increase vDS
and you can figure out what

00:20:08.969 --> 00:20:14.845
happens for yourselves.
I increase vDS.

00:20:14.845 --> 00:20:20.412
Whoa, what a liar.
Agarwal is a liar.

00:20:20.412 --> 00:20:25.360
I have been kind of tricking
you.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:33.109
I have been putting --
Covering up all this part here

00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:39.743
and showing you just this region
of the curve for small values of

00:20:39.743 --> 00:20:43.164
vDS.
But as I increase vDS this is

00:20:43.164 --> 00:20:49.280
nothing that looks even close to
that of resistive behavior.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.878
So what's happening here?
What's happening is that as I

00:20:54.878 --> 00:21:01.097
increase my vDS the iDS curve
tails off and saturates at some

00:21:01.097 --> 00:21:06.477
value of current.
Notice it saturates at some

00:21:06.477 --> 00:21:10.607
value of current.
And so I am going to look at

00:21:10.607 --> 00:21:15.655
this region of behavior.
Notice that what we have looked

00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:19.325
at so far was the behavior for
small vDS.

00:21:19.325 --> 00:21:24.281
It kind of looks resistive.
But when I pump up the vDS,

00:21:24.281 --> 00:21:29.787
really whack this node really
hard with a much larger vDS the

00:21:29.787 --> 00:21:33.000
guy says, oh,
I give up.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.344
And the current saturates out
and flattens out and holds the

00:21:38.344 --> 00:21:43.327
value steady at some value.
So what's that behavior look

00:21:43.327 --> 00:21:46.135
like?
What is my horizontal line

00:21:46.135 --> 00:21:49.850
above the X axis in terms of V I
elements?

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.655
What is that behavior like?
Current source,

00:21:53.655 --> 00:21:57.097
exactly.
So this is current source like

00:21:57.097 --> 00:22:02.647
behavior.
And so let me start by drawing

00:22:02.647 --> 00:22:08.847
you a little model and
explaining it in more detail.

00:22:08.847 --> 00:22:14.317
What happens is that under
certain conditions,

00:22:14.317 --> 00:22:19.909
and the conditions are the
following, when vDS,

00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:26.960
that is my drain to source
voltage is greater than or equal

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.222
to vGS minus VT.
When my drain voltage goes

00:22:32.222 --> 00:22:36.410
above vGS minus VT,
so if vGS is 3 volts and if VT

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.914
is 1 volt, then if vDS goes
above 2 volts,

00:22:39.914 --> 00:22:45.213
if I am hammering the drain of
the MOSFET with a higher voltage

00:22:45.213 --> 00:22:50.000
then this guy says I give up,
can't show you nice restive

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.529
behavior, and the current
saturates out and it doesn't

00:22:54.529 --> 00:23:00.000
allow you draw any more current
than a maximum value.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.496
And that's the current source
behavior.

00:23:02.496 --> 00:23:04.992
This one behaves like a current
source.

00:23:04.992 --> 00:23:09.000
And the current iDS is given by
the following expression.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.489
The current is given by iDS is
equal to a constant K divide by

00:23:29.489 --> 00:23:35.280
two times (vGS-VT) all squared.
Kind of reminiscent of the

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.877
carefully chosen dependent
source example,

00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:44.140
just that this one here is VT.
This model, which applies when

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.877
vGS is greater than VT,
the MOSFET has to be on and the

00:23:48.877 --> 00:23:54.228
drain to source voltage in the
MOSFET must be larger than some

00:23:54.228 --> 00:23:59.491
value, and that value is vGS
minus VT then this guy begins to

00:23:59.491 --> 00:24:06.130
behave like a current source.
This model of the MOSFET is

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:11.000
called the "switch current
source model".

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.009
So in the region of the MOSFET
characteristics where vGS is

00:24:21.009 --> 00:24:25.225
greater than VT and the drain to
source voltage is larger than

00:24:25.225 --> 00:24:27.852
vGS minus VT,
the MOSFET behaved like a

00:24:27.852 --> 00:24:32.000
current source between its drain
and source terminals.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.969
And in that part we model the
MOSFET as a current source.

00:24:35.969 --> 00:24:40.151
And so not surprisingly that
part of the model is called the

00:24:40.151 --> 00:24:43.908
SCS model in contrast with the
SR model where we had a

00:24:43.908 --> 00:24:45.681
resistor.
Again, remember,

00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:48.162
this is not meant to be
conflicting.

00:24:48.162 --> 00:24:51.635
It is not like gee,
how can the MOSFET look like a

00:24:51.635 --> 00:24:55.888
resistor, and then suddenly what
happens it becomes a current

00:24:55.888 --> 00:24:58.156
source.
Well, the two regions are

00:24:58.156 --> 00:25:03.246
different.
It is not that it is behaving

00:25:03.246 --> 00:25:08.507
as a current source for the same
parameters, no.

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:14.776
When vDS is less than this
right-hand side it does behave

00:25:14.776 --> 00:25:18.246
resistive.
The SR model applies.

00:25:18.246 --> 00:25:24.626
But increase vDS beyond a
point, the current saturates and

00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:30.000
the SCS applies like so.
So let's draw.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.680
The SCS behavior can be drawn
here vDS and iDS.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:43.360
As I mentioned to you,
for small values of vDS,

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:50.622
let's say I pick some value of
vGS, let's say vGS3,

00:25:50.622 --> 00:25:56.576
some value vGS,
it is going to look like a

00:25:56.576 --> 00:26:05.000
resistor until vDS becomes equal
to vGS3 minus VT.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.162
And after that it saturates out
and begins to look like a

00:26:12.162 --> 00:26:17.534
current source.
And this point is where vDS

00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:25.337
becomes equal to vGS minus VT.
And this way is when this equal

00:26:25.337 --> 00:26:32.755
sign becomes a greater than
sign, vDS becomes larger then I

00:26:32.755 --> 00:26:38.000
move into this part of the
curve.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.941
Similarly, for various other
values of vGS it will look like

00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:46.000
this --

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.993
-- and so on.
And it behaved like an open

00:26:54.993 --> 00:26:57.911
circuit as before when vGS less
than VT.

00:26:57.911 --> 00:27:01.952
When vGS less than VT it is
still behaving like an open

00:27:01.952 --> 00:27:05.670
circuit.
And so as I increase my vGS,

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.247
provided I keep my vDS greater
than vGS minus VT,

00:27:10.247 --> 00:27:13.490
I get current source like
behavior.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:17.114
And notice that this is
increasing vGS.

00:27:17.114 --> 00:27:22.836
I have purposely drawn these
curves at greater distances from

00:27:22.836 --> 00:27:28.749
each other to imply that it is a
nonlinear relationship in that

00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:33.994
if I increase vGS by some
amount, the increase in vDS is

00:27:33.994 --> 00:27:41.255
related to the square of vGS.
It is vGS minus VT all squared.

00:27:41.255 --> 00:27:46.506
So I get a family of curves of
that look like this.

00:27:46.506 --> 00:27:52.598
And this is in the region of
operation where vDS equals vGS

00:27:52.598 --> 00:27:56.799
minus VT.
And this applies in this regime

00:27:56.799 --> 00:28:01.000
where vDS less than vGS minus
VT.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.432
This region of operation is
called, as you might expect,

00:28:06.432 --> 00:28:09.000
the "saturation region".

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.629
We say the MOSFET has been
hammered, the MOSFET has been

00:28:19.629 --> 00:28:23.417
walloped, the MOSFET is in
saturation.

00:28:23.417 --> 00:28:27.937
So the MOSFET is in saturation.
This region,

00:28:27.937 --> 00:28:32.000
corresponding to this,
is called the triode region.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.900
This is really very simple.
All we are doing is saying that

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.859
when vDS is increased beyond a
certain limit,

00:28:43.859 --> 00:28:47.154
given my vGS minus VT,
the MOSFET begins to behave

00:28:47.154 --> 00:28:50.181
like a current source.
It cannot draw any more

00:28:50.181 --> 00:28:52.467
current.
It limits the current to a

00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:54.687
given value like a current
source.

00:28:54.687 --> 00:28:58.587
But on the left-hand side of
this it behaves in a resistive

00:28:58.587 --> 00:29:01.812
manner.
So what I would like to do is

00:29:01.812 --> 00:29:02.000
--

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.274
What I will do is,
we've plotted for you,

00:29:11.274 --> 00:29:14.957
for the MOSFET,
all its characteristics in its

00:29:14.957 --> 00:29:20.032
full glory for a whole bunch of
values of vGS and a whole bunch

00:29:20.032 --> 00:29:23.469
of values of vDS.
And let me stare at those

00:29:23.469 --> 00:29:27.807
curves with you for a few
seconds and walk you through

00:29:27.807 --> 00:29:31.000
them.
So what do I have here?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.627
One of these curves corresponds
to a given value of vGS.

00:29:35.627 --> 00:29:39.245
This may be vGS equals 2 volts.
This is vDS,

00:29:39.245 --> 00:29:43.620
the drain to source voltage,
and this is the current.

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:48.415
So focus on this curve for now.
In the beginning I hid the

00:29:48.415 --> 00:29:53.127
right-hand side behavior from
you and showed you just the

00:29:53.127 --> 00:29:58.007
resistive behavior out here.
When I increase vDS to be much

00:29:58.007 --> 00:30:02.802
larger the curve saturated and I
got the saturation region

00:30:02.802 --> 00:30:08.498
operation of the MOSFET.
And notice as I increase my

00:30:08.498 --> 00:30:13.957
value of vGS the saturation
current also increases according

00:30:13.957 --> 00:30:19.046
to a square law behavior.
So these are the entire curves

00:30:19.046 --> 00:30:22.932
of the MOSFET.
Finally the truth comes out.

00:30:22.932 --> 00:30:27.558
And notice that when vDS is
less than vGS minus VT,

00:30:27.558 --> 00:30:32.000
I have more or less resistive
behavior.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000
But when vDS is greater than
vGS minus VT I get current

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.666
source like behavior.
So one question you may ask is

00:30:43.666 --> 00:30:47.666
when do I use one model or the
other?

00:30:47.666 --> 00:30:54.111
When do I use the SR model and
when do I use the SCS model?

00:30:54.111 --> 00:31:00.111
If you want to do a real
detailed analysis then you can

00:31:00.111 --> 00:31:07.000
use the SR model when vDS is
less than vGS minus VT.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.464
And you would use this model
when vDS is greater than or

00:31:12.464 --> 00:31:16.836
equal to vGS minus VT.
That is simple enough.

00:31:16.836 --> 00:31:21.903
In 6.002, to eliminate
confusion we constrain how we

00:31:21.903 --> 00:31:26.275
look at things a little bit more
stringently.

00:31:26.275 --> 00:31:31.641
And what we do is that for our
entire digital analysis,

00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:38.000
for the entire digital world we
focus on the SR model.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.221
And I will tell you why in a
second.

00:31:41.221 --> 00:31:46.284
So for all digital circuits,
invertors, look at power of

00:31:46.284 --> 00:31:50.794
invertors, look at delay,
a bunch of other things,

00:31:50.794 --> 00:31:54.292
we will be using the SR model
in 6.002.

00:31:54.292 --> 00:31:57.514
And I will tell you why in a
second.

00:31:57.514 --> 00:32:02.225
And for analog --
That is for amplifier designs

00:32:02.225 --> 00:32:06.522
and situations like that,
we will be operating the MOSFET

00:32:06.522 --> 00:32:10.665
in a saturation region.
And I will talk about that in a

00:32:10.665 --> 00:32:13.428
second.
What I am saying here is that

00:32:13.428 --> 00:32:17.341
in 6.002, when we do analog
designs, we are going to

00:32:17.341 --> 00:32:21.945
discipline ourselves to using
the MOSFET only in this region.

00:32:21.945 --> 00:32:26.165
We are going to constrain
ourselves to play in only this

00:32:26.165 --> 00:32:31.000
region of the playground where
vDS is quite large.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.272
Why?
Because I am asking you to.

00:32:33.272 --> 00:32:37.743
I am saying let's play in that
part of the playground and keep

00:32:37.743 --> 00:32:40.895
your vDS high.
And so the MOSFET is going to

00:32:40.895 --> 00:32:45.219
be operating somewhere in here.
So we can apply just the SCS

00:32:45.219 --> 00:32:49.178
model, just the current source
behavior in that region.

00:32:49.178 --> 00:32:53.429
There is another important
reason, which I will get to in a

00:32:53.429 --> 00:32:56.214
second.
And for digital designs we will

00:32:56.214 --> 00:33:01.258
simply use the SR model.
And it turns out that this is

00:33:01.258 --> 00:33:06.087
realistic because in the digital
designs that you have you seen

00:33:06.087 --> 00:33:10.527
and will be seeing in this
course, the pull down MOSFET is

00:33:10.527 --> 00:33:13.798
on, or when these pull down
MOSFETs are on,

00:33:13.798 --> 00:33:17.615
the output voltage is pulled
down close to ground.

00:33:17.615 --> 00:33:19.640
So vDS is very,
very small.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.989
So it does make sense that this
model apply.

00:33:22.989 --> 00:33:27.040
And when we talk about
amplifiers, I am asking you to

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.528
follow this discipline.
I will tell you why in a

00:33:31.528 --> 00:33:33.629
second.
I am saying analog designs

00:33:33.629 --> 00:33:37.449
follow this discipline that I
call the saturation discipline.

00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:41.014
It says simply operate the
MOSFET operating in saturation

00:33:41.014 --> 00:33:44.262
as a current source.
We will look at an amplifier in

00:33:44.262 --> 00:33:47.000
a second, and I will tell you
why.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Now let's do a MOSFET
amplifier.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.704
Remember my amplifier had an
input port and an output port.

00:34:06.704 --> 00:34:12.016
And in general in our use we
are going to have a common

00:34:12.016 --> 00:34:15.557
ground.
And we have a VS and a ground

00:34:15.557 --> 00:34:19.688
here as well.
That is the power port of the

00:34:19.688 --> 00:34:23.524
amplifier.
The input port and the output

00:34:23.524 --> 00:34:25.000
port.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:39.531
And let me redraw the circuit
putting a MOSFET in place of the

00:34:39.531 --> 00:34:44.687
current source,
RL, VS, vO, drain,

00:34:44.687 --> 00:34:47.187
gate, source,
vI.

00:34:47.187 --> 00:34:54.843
So my input is vI.
Again, the MOSFET output is vO.

00:34:54.843 --> 00:35:02.270
And I have a resistor RL.
Hey, we've seen that before.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.108
It turns out this is not
surprising.

00:35:05.108 --> 00:35:09.567
You've seen this before.
This was our primitive inverter

00:35:09.567 --> 00:35:12.243
circuit.
So what's different here?

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:15.486
We showed you the circuit as an
inverter.

00:35:15.486 --> 00:35:20.351
What's different here is that
when we look at MOSFET behavior

00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:24.486
as a current source,
this behaves like an amplifier.

00:35:24.486 --> 00:35:28.054
In other words,
when vDS is greater than some

00:35:28.054 --> 00:35:33.000
value then this behaves like a
current source.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.426
When vDS is small,
in other words,

00:35:35.426 --> 00:35:38.735
in the digital design when vDS
was small here,

00:35:38.735 --> 00:35:43.073
because when the MOSFET was on
it pulled the voltage down to

00:35:43.073 --> 00:35:46.676
ground, we could view this
behavior as a resistor.

00:35:46.676 --> 00:35:50.058
And exactly the same thing,
it is an amplifier.

00:35:50.058 --> 00:35:54.029
And with digital designs,
I was driving it with 5 volts

00:35:54.029 --> 00:35:58.000
and 0 volts and that was it,
rail to rail.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.399
As an amplifier,
what I am doing now is looking

00:36:01.399 --> 00:36:05.241
at a small region of its
behavior when vDS is greater

00:36:05.241 --> 00:36:08.640
than vGS minus VT.
What I am saying is that for

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:12.482
amplification let's follow the
saturation discipline.

00:36:12.482 --> 00:36:16.472
And the reason is that when
this behaves like a current

00:36:16.472 --> 00:36:20.832
source, what I have shown you is
that if this behaves like a

00:36:20.832 --> 00:36:25.192
current source I have shown you
that this expression up here

00:36:25.192 --> 00:36:30.043
gives you amplification.
In last lecture we plotted a

00:36:30.043 --> 00:36:34.130
bunch of values for vO versus
vI, and we saw that we were

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.560
getting amplification.
For a small change in vI,

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.865
I was getting a larger change
in vO, and that was when I had

00:36:41.865 --> 00:36:44.930
the equation for a current
source in there.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:49.017
And so we know for a fact that
if I can operate this as a

00:36:49.017 --> 00:36:52.082
current source,
with a reasonable choice of

00:36:52.082 --> 00:36:56.096
values here, I am going to be
able to get amplification.

00:36:56.096 --> 00:37:00.402
What I haven't told you is if
this is operated in the linear

00:37:00.402 --> 00:37:05.000
region, in fact,
you do not get amplification.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.125
I won't cover that,
but you can check that out in

00:37:09.125 --> 00:37:13.765
your course notes as a
discussion or you can try it out

00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:17.460
for yourself.
Replace this with the SR model

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.531
for small vDS and you can show
yourselves that you don't get

00:37:22.531 --> 00:37:25.710
any amplification.
In order to get the

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:30.609
amplification we are telling
ourselves let's focus on this

00:37:30.609 --> 00:37:36.023
part of the playground where vDS
is greater than or equal to vGS

00:37:36.023 --> 00:37:40.405
minus VT.
And for vGS greater than or

00:37:40.405 --> 00:37:44.148
equal to VT.
So when vGS is greater than VT

00:37:44.148 --> 00:37:48.069
the MOSFET is on.
Further, when vDS is large,

00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:53.326
larger than vGS minus VT this
behaves like a current source.

00:37:53.326 --> 00:37:58.673
So we have now created a small
playground for ourselves where

00:37:58.673 --> 00:38:05.000
we can build lots of fun little
amplifiers and other circuits.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.204
And provided our circuits
follow the saturation discipline

00:38:09.204 --> 00:38:13.852
where for the MOSFET or MOSFETs
in the circuit these expressions

00:38:13.852 --> 00:38:17.909
are true then the MOSFETs are
going to be in saturation,

00:38:17.909 --> 00:38:21.819
the current source model
applies, and I will be indeed

00:38:21.819 --> 00:38:25.065
getting saturation.
In future courses you may

00:38:25.065 --> 00:38:29.713
actually see the MOSFET used in
other regimes of operation for a

00:38:29.713 --> 00:38:34.296
variety of reasons.
But in 6.002 when we talk about

00:38:34.296 --> 00:38:38.296
amplifiers and so on we will be
adopting the saturation

00:38:38.296 --> 00:38:41.333
discipline.
And your homework problems and

00:38:41.333 --> 00:38:45.185
so on will state that.
Assume that the MOSFETs are in

00:38:45.185 --> 00:38:48.296
saturation.
What that means is that you can

00:38:48.296 --> 00:38:52.962
begin to model them as a current
source and simply analyze their

00:38:52.962 --> 00:38:55.555
behavior accordingly.
One minor nit.

00:38:55.555 --> 00:39:00.000
Note that vDS for the MOSFET is
the same as vO.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.194
And vGS for the MOSFET is the
same as vI.

00:39:04.194 --> 00:39:10.382
So if you see me jumping back
and forth using vOs and vIs or

00:39:10.382 --> 00:39:15.940
vDSs and vGSs they are the same
thing in this circuit.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:21.602
If you are dealing with
circuits with many MOSFETs then

00:39:21.602 --> 00:39:28.000
you will have vDS1s and vGS1s
and so on and so forth.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.876
But for this simple circuit,
vO and vDS are the same,

00:39:34.876 --> 00:39:41.223
vI and vGS are the same.
So we could go ahead and

00:39:41.223 --> 00:39:47.173
analyze that circuit.
What I do to analyze the

00:39:47.173 --> 00:39:54.578
circuit, I am telling you this.
I am telling you that the

00:39:54.578 --> 00:40:00.000
MOSFET is behaving in
saturation.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.408
I am telling you this.
We have disciplined ourselves

00:40:03.408 --> 00:40:07.083
to say that in that circuit the
MOSFET is in saturation.

00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:11.026
As soon as we tell you that we
can then go ahead and analyze

00:40:11.026 --> 00:40:13.699
that circuit.
And to analyze that circuit

00:40:13.699 --> 00:40:17.241
what you will do is simply
replace the MOSFET with its

00:40:17.241 --> 00:40:20.047
equivalent model,
and that looks like this.

00:40:20.047 --> 00:40:23.322
Since you have been told that
it is in saturation,

00:40:23.322 --> 00:40:28.000
we can replace the MOSFET with
its current source model.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:45.076
And the current iDS for the
MOSFET is given by K/2(vI-VT)^2.

00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:54.461
And it is always good to write
the constraints under which you

00:40:54.461 --> 00:41:02.833
are implicitly working close by.
So the constraints are one,

00:41:02.833 --> 00:41:09.444
vGS is greater than or equal to
VT, vDS is greater than or equal

00:41:09.444 --> 00:41:14.166
to vGS minus VT.
These constraints immediately

00:41:14.166 --> 00:41:20.567
follow from a statement of the
type we are operating under the

00:41:20.567 --> 00:41:26.024
saturation discipline or the
MOSFET is in saturation.

00:41:26.024 --> 00:41:32.216
Let me just mark this equation
as A, and we will refer to it

00:41:32.216 --> 00:41:34.000
again.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.916
So with this new little circuit
with the MOSFET working as a

00:41:49.916 --> 00:41:53.666
current source,
let's go ahead and analyze our

00:41:53.666 --> 00:41:56.666
amplifier.
Notice that to analyze the

00:41:56.666 --> 00:42:01.916
circuit I have a current source.
It's a dependent current source

00:42:01.916 --> 00:42:07.000
where the current depends on the
square of the input.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.488
So I want to go and analyze it.
This is a nonlinear circuit.

00:42:12.488 --> 00:42:17.790
So I can apply any one of the
methods that we talked about

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.767
last week for nonlinear
circuits.

00:42:20.767 --> 00:42:26.255
To analyze it I will go ahead
and use the analytical method.

00:42:26.255 --> 00:42:31.000
And my goal will be to obtain
vO versus vI.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.392
Again, remember where are we
here?

00:42:33.392 --> 00:42:37.960
The MOSFET circuit operating in
saturation so I can replace this

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.715
with a current source.
It is nonlinear.

00:42:40.715 --> 00:42:44.775
And so I can apply one of the
two methods, the analytical

00:42:44.775 --> 00:42:49.052
method or the graphical method.
Let's do both and start with

00:42:49.052 --> 00:42:52.677
the analytical method.
The analytical method simply

00:42:52.677 --> 00:42:55.505
says go forth,
apply the node method and

00:42:55.505 --> 00:42:56.882
solve.
Simple stuff.

00:42:56.882 --> 00:43:00.943
Let's go ahead and do that.
Node method.

00:43:00.943 --> 00:43:04.481
I have a single node here that
is of interest.

00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:07.154
I know the voltage vI at this
node.

00:43:07.154 --> 00:43:09.828
I know the voltage VS at this
node.

00:43:09.828 --> 00:43:12.422
So the only unknown is here at
vO.

00:43:12.422 --> 00:43:17.218
So I will go ahead and do that.
Let me go ahead and equate the

00:43:17.218 --> 00:43:19.813
currents into the node to be
zero.

00:43:19.813 --> 00:43:23.272
So the currents out of the node
here are iDS.

00:43:23.272 --> 00:43:27.203
And that was equal the current
into that same node.

00:43:27.203 --> 00:43:32.000
So iDS must equal VS minus vO
divided by RL.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.218
iDS=VS-vO/RL.
For later reference,

00:43:39.218 --> 00:43:46.000
let me call that B.
Simplifying,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.843
what I can do is,
we know that iDS is given by

00:43:55.843 --> 00:44:03.627
K/2(vI-VT)^2.
So I replace iDS with this

00:44:03.627 --> 00:44:08.651
expression and I multiply that
by RL.

00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:15.627
So I get K/2(vI-VT)RL.
So iDS gets multiplied by RL

00:44:15.627 --> 00:44:22.465
and I get vO on this side and VS
remains out here.

00:44:22.465 --> 00:44:30.000
All I have done is multiplied
both sides by RL.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.918
So it is RL iDS,
taken RL iDS to this side,

00:44:33.918 --> 00:44:37.090
that is here,
I get the minus sign,

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.075
and VS stays here,
vO comes here.

00:44:40.075 --> 00:44:45.486
So that is my final expression.
Remember this is true under

00:44:45.486 --> 00:44:50.151
certain conditions.
I will keep hammering that home

00:44:50.151 --> 00:44:55.562
because some of the most common
errors made by people is in

00:44:55.562 --> 00:45:02.000
forgetting the constraints under
which this was obtained.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.438
And the constraint under which
this was obtained is the

00:45:08.438 --> 00:45:14.638
saturation discipline.
And that was true when vGS for

00:45:14.638 --> 00:45:21.792
a MOSFET was greater than or
equal to VT and vDS for a MOSFET

00:45:21.792 --> 00:45:26.680
was greater than or equal to vGS
minus VT.

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:33.000
I also know that for vGS less
than VT, vO=VS.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.341
So when vGS is less than VT
then this one turns off.

00:45:38.341 --> 00:45:44.520
That's why it is the SCS model,
switch current source model.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:50.175
When vGS is less than zero it
turns off and VS directly

00:45:50.175 --> 00:45:54.679
appears at vO.
I would like to stare at this

00:45:54.679 --> 00:46:00.125
constraint with you for a
second, vDS greater than or

00:46:00.125 --> 00:46:08.056
equal to vGS minus VT here.
And vDS is simply vO.

00:46:08.056 --> 00:46:17.522
I want to rewrite this
constraint in terms of iDS.

00:46:17.522 --> 00:46:26.215
It will come in handy.
So iDS is K/2(vI-VT)^2.

00:46:26.215 --> 00:46:34.715
This is vI-VT.
So vI-VT is simply square root

00:46:34.715 --> 00:46:39.875
of 2iDS/K.
In other words,

00:46:39.875 --> 00:46:45.500
I can write iDS less than or
equal to K/2vO^2.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:53.250
So this constraint expressed in
terms of iDS is simply iDS less

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:57.000
than or equal to K/2vO^2.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.623
So all I've done here is
analyzed this nonlinear circuit.

00:47:10.623 --> 00:47:15.443
I can also analyze it using the
graphical method.

00:47:15.443 --> 00:47:20.364
And in order to do that,
for my nonlinear circuit,

00:47:20.364 --> 00:47:24.882
in order to do that,
all I have to do is plot.

00:47:24.882 --> 00:47:29.000
Let's have iDS here and vDS
here.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.346
And as we did with a nonlinear
expo dweeb, what I do is I plot

00:47:36.346 --> 00:47:41.284
the device characteristics iDS
versus vDS.

00:47:41.284 --> 00:47:48.270
The device characteristics
under saturation look like this,

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:53.930
so vGS increasing.
iDS versus vDS has a bunch of

00:47:53.930 --> 00:48:02.000
curves that look like current
sources of increasing values.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.818
That simply reflects equation
A.

00:48:06.818 --> 00:48:15.523
And then I superimpose on top
of that the expression that

00:48:15.523 --> 00:48:22.673
comes up due to equation B which
is iDS equals,

00:48:22.673 --> 00:48:32.000
let me write that down here,
iDS equals VS/RL - vO/RL.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.990
That's B.
And let me plot that.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:43.307
That is a straight line
relationship between iDS and vO.

00:48:43.307 --> 00:48:47.963
And so when vO is zero iDS is
VS/RL.

00:48:47.963 --> 00:48:52.353
And when iDS is zero vO equals
VS.

00:48:52.353 --> 00:48:56.743
Remember, vO and vDS are the
same.

00:48:56.743 --> 00:49:03.542
So this is what I get.
This is the straight line

00:49:03.542 --> 00:49:07.000
corresponding to equation B
here.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.103
And, as before,
we just find the point where

00:49:17.103 --> 00:49:21.780
the two intersect.
Let's say I am given some value

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.215
of vGS.
And let's say I am given some

00:49:25.215 --> 00:49:29.892
known value of vDS.
So for that I can go ahead and

00:49:29.892 --> 00:49:36.000
find out the corresponding value
of iDS from this graph.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.235
Just as I told you when we did
the expo dweeb stuff,

00:49:40.235 --> 00:49:43.224
this line here is called a load
line.

00:49:43.224 --> 00:49:47.958
You will be seeing that again
and again and again where we

00:49:47.958 --> 00:49:52.359
have the equation corresponding
to the one shown here,

00:49:52.359 --> 00:49:57.259
the equation written for the
output loop superimposed on the

00:49:57.259 --> 00:50:02.157
device characteristics.
That's called a load line.

00:50:02.157 --> 00:50:06.555
So I can get this point
corresponding to the operating

00:50:06.555 --> 00:50:11.285
point of the MOSFET for this
iDS, vDS and vGS by using the

00:50:11.285 --> 00:50:14.853
graphical method.
In the next lecture we are

00:50:14.853 --> 00:50:18.587
going to look at,
given a device of this sort,

00:50:18.587 --> 00:50:23.234
how do we figure out the
boundaries of valid operation so

00:50:23.234 --> 00:50:25.567
that the MOSFET stays in
saturation?
