&gt;&gt; Dr. Carla Hayden: Good
afternoon, I'm Hayden,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.710
the Librarian of Congress.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.780

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.070
[ Applause ]

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.080
Now I have to take this
opportunity to welcome those

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.640
in the hometowns of our
National Student Poets

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.140
who are watching the
livestream of this event.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.650
Thank you to our
livestream partners,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.870
and I feel like I should wave.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.510

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.350
And the Las Vegas

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.070
[ Applause ]

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.600
Now I have to also tell you that
I was very pleased and honored

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.070
to hold a pinning ceremony
for these talented young poets

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.710
in my office area just
less than an hour ago.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.180
And it's the second time

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.860
that we've been able
to have that honor.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.180
And I have to say it is one
of the highlights of the year.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.420
We also have two poets from
the previous year with us today

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.550
and we're delighted
to see them as well.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.700
Now at the pinning, and the
pinning, really you have

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.470
to see the beautiful pins.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.570
At the pinning, I was
joined by Kit Matthew,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.470
Director of the Institute
of Museum

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.510
and Library Services, Kit.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.380
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.570
Virginia McEnerney, Executive
Director of the Alliance

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.510
for Young Artists and Writers.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.210
[ Applause ]

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.010
And you'll hear more from
both of them in a minute.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.980
But let me just say how much
I appreciate their stewardship

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.040
of the National Poet -- Poets
Program, and their commitment

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.300
to our next generation of poets.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.950
Now you'll also year
from two very,

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.760
very special guests
this afternoon.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.510
Noted columnist,
Mr. David Brooks.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.510
And singer songwriter,
Valerie June.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.240
[ Applause ]

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.960
In addition to being
powerful voices,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.020
both of our special guests have
found inspiration at the Library

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.450
of Congress, our
nation's library.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.410
Mr. Brooks has written
about the power

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.450
of the Thomas Jefferson
Building,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.000
right across the street.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.110
And it was there that
Valerie June immersed herself

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.080
in the American Folk Life
Center's Historic Recording.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.950
So we are very proud that you
have found our collections

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.590
to be so useful to you.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.340
Darius, Daniel, Alexandra,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.850
Heather Laurel Jensen,
and Ariana.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.580
I hope you are equally inspired

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.940
by beginning your National
Student Poet Term here

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.240
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.670
And we are very proud that
you, and I'm telling you

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.860
from previous poets, will always
have that connection to us.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.330
As I told you at the
pinning, and you presented me

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.940
with autographed copies, you
all should be very jealous.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.110
I have my own autographed
copies.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.480
Maybe after the ceremony
you will get your programs

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.860
autographed too.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.010
Don't forget us as
you become famous.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.310
[ Laughter ]

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.370
You are famous now.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.280
Now there is another remarkable
poet connected to the Library

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.290
who is excited to
be part of this day.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.700
And right now she's
flying back from Alaska

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.810
where she kicked off
her second term project,

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.330
American Conversations:

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.430
Celebrating Poetry
in Rural Communities.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.770
But before she left,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.000
she recorded a special
message for you.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.250
He's trying to get sound
and I want it noted

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.510
that I am not doing any of this.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.040
[ Laughter ]

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.340
It makes me feel so good

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.160
when someone else has
these technology issues,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.510
and they're younger than I am.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.040
[ Laughter ]

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.840
Dora how old are you?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.510
[ Laughter ]

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.510
[ Applause ]

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.750
[ Laughter ]

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.590
And I'm so tempted
to try to help.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.460
But that will not do.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.840
There was opening music.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.060
It's Tracy Smith,
the Poet Laureate,

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.280
and she is in her second
year, and she wanted

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:14.510
to emphasize using poetry in
specifically rural communities.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.480
[ Music ]

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.940
[ Laughter ]

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:29.060
So what we're going to do,
and I wish I had like one iota

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.250
of her talent, because I
could actually read some

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.540
of her poetry and tell you.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.010
And so you see her, and
she wanted to do this.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.310
[ Laughter ]

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.930
And we will make sure that
this is available shortly,

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.900
because I had the
opportunity to talk Tracy

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.710
and asked her to,
to record this.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.020
Because she believes in the
healing power of poetry.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.790
And when she was selected as
the Poet Laureate it was one

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.560
of my first opportunities to
be involved with the program.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.530
She said she wanted
to go to communities

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:15.490
that had needed other ways
to talk about difficult

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.490
and challenging issues.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.190
And so in rural areas,
Native American communities.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.490
&gt;&gt; Tracy Smith: And I feel

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.790
like we actually have
something meaningful to say --

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.090
[ Applause ]

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.390
.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.690
Soon to be a poet or a trade.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:28.990
I'm sorry I'm not
there with you tonight.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.040
I'm actually in Alaska talking
poetry with new friends.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.050
But I'm excited to
join you tomorrow

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.010
and celebrate your
accomplishments.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.030
[ Music ]

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.040
[ Laughter ]

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.130
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carla Hayden:
We wanted sound.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.520
And we've got it.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.070
So we'll make sure though
that you get to see all

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.780
of our message, because
basically that's what she's

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.200
hoping that you young poets
will realize, that your words,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.340
and your way with words, have
a way of reaching out to others

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.990
that might not have their
own way of expressing things.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.740
And that's what she
wanted to wish for you,

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.870
because she's found
that in her career.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.760
And she's taking
it in another year

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.460
to communities throughout
this country,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.450
that need the healing
power of words.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.120
So I hope you will enjoy
meeting her tomorrow.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.660
Her flight is on
schedule, she will be here.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.510
And now I'm going to bring up
Kit to continue the program.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:36.300
[ Applause ]

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.820
&gt;&gt; Dr. Katheryn Matthew: Well
that video will be a treat.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.230
Thank you Carla, we appreciate
your work as both a librarian

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.810
and former member of
the National Museum

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:46.260
and Library Services Board.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.470
We, at IMLS, our
acronym, welcome to D.C.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.640
if you don't know
the land of acronyms.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.670
Always enjoy working with
our colleagues at the Library

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.640
of Congress on the
National Book Festival

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.660
which is coming up this weekend.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.450
So I hope many of you
will partake of that.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.760
I'm really delighted to
be with you all today

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.140
to celebrate this 2018 Class

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.920
of the National Student
Poets Program.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.330
We are extremely proud to have
partnered with the Alliance

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.420
for Young Artists and Writers
to establish the program

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.170
which shares exemplary
work from teen poets

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.410
like those we honor today,
with a national audience.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.030
As you well know, IMLS
also supports libraries

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.020
and museums large and
small across the country

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.770
as they enhance many
forms of literacy

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.420
and artistic expression,
including this poetry program.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.980
Writing and libraries of
course, are always intertwined

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.950
as I was reminded of this
last week when up in Maine.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.880
I had been telling
my Maine friends

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.400
about upcoming activities
at IMLS.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.630
I can't turn off my brain
about libraries and museums.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.570
Including this Poetry
Celebration.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.230
The next day my friend
was driving me on one

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.490
of those endless
winding Maine roads.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.690
My friend suddenly turned
the Jeep of the road,

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.630
through a battered chain link
fence into a small cemetery.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.910
The grass was try, scruffy

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.920
and there were few
graveside decorations.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.350
It seemed utilitarian
and in fact ignored.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.690
At the very back edge

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:27.240
of the cemetery was a very
non-descript plot under a tree.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.820
Elwin Brooks White.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.130
Various votives,
rocks, paper sculptures,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.050
folded notes were perched
on the simple headstone.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.930
Many of White's books
and artworks were donated

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.490
to the nearby Friend Memorial
Library in Brooklyn, Maine.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.460
One book inscription reads

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.960
for the Friend Memorial
Public Library

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.760
from a long-time
admirer E.B. White.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.460
And in a letter addressed
to the children of Troy,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.180
Michigan congratulating them
upon their newly opened public

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.610
library, E.B. White
wrote, Books hold many

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.800
of the secrets of the world.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.230
Books are people.

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.830
People who have managed
to stay alive by hiding

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.290
between the covers of a book.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:17.260
And we can say the same of
poetry as White did of books.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.250
Poetry holds many of the
secrets of the world,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.800
and people stay alive
within and through poetry.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.510
Many libraries and museums

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.000
across our nation are
critical platforms

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.450
for community expression
and advancing literacy

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.260
and learning for all Americans.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.710
And the National Student Poets
Program leverages these shared

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.330
community spaces to
create new perspectives,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:46.830
connect us across
generations, and spark critical

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.280
and essential conversations.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.720
This year's five exceptional
student writers, Darius, Daniel,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.540
Alexandra, Heather and
Ariana were selected by some

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.050
of our nation's finest literary
voices and leaders in education.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:08.550
And they rose to the top of more
than 300 national medalists.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.200
That's a feat.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.320
In the scholastic art
and writing awards.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.700
They will receive academic
awards, opportunities

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.530
to showcase their work in
libraries, museums, schools

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.450
and at festivals and
events across America.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:27.390
And they'll serve as
regional literary ambassadors

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.530
for the coming year.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.860
Each student poet from this
year's class is charged

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.210
with designing a special
community service project

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:40.130
which may include readings,
workshops, webinars,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.110
classroom visit's,
interviews and conversations

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.210
with established poets.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.890
In previous years young
writers have chosen

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.130
to focus their efforts on
outreach and engagement

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.870
with military families,
Alzheimer's patients,

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.810
English as second language
students, homeless youth

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.040
and Native American students.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.360
And I really look forward
to hearing how each

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.320
of you will reach out to others.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.550
This is just the beginning.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.970
Whether reading E.B. White or
participating in a poetry slam,

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.530
I truly believe anyone
can own the power

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.880
of poetry and have a voice.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.630
Our five winning poets are
ambassadors for poetry's power

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.880
to inspire curiosity, learning
confidence and connections.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.040
I want to congratulate you
on your accomplishments,

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.070
and we look forward to your
continued service throughout the

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.370
next year.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.170

Good afternoon.

Welcome. I'm Virginia McEnerney.

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.840
I'm the Executive Director of
the Alliance for Young Artists

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.190
and Writers, the
national nonprofit

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.040
that presents the Scholastic
Art and Writing awards.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.150
We are so honored to
be partnered with IMLS

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.200
in presenting this wonderful
program and bringing young poets

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.180
to museums and libraries
across the country.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.640
And I really want to thank
the Library of Congress

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.420
for once again, so graciously
hosting us at this event.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.060
We have some special guests
here in the audience tonight.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.190
And I would be remiss if
I didn't start by thanking

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.680
and honoring Olivia Morgan,
who's the head of the --

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:19.980
who started the program.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.280
Where's Olivia?

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.580
Thank you Olivia.

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:23.880
So glad that you're here.

The inspiration behind
the program.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.810
I also want to welcome
Dr. Lucianne Walkowicz,

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.880
whose notable in the back

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.690
Lucianne is here because
she's a proud alumnus

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.260
of the Scholastic Art
and Writing award.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.290
She's also the Chair
of the Astro Biology --

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.130
she holds the Chair
in Astro Biology here

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.910
at the Library of Congress.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.650
She'll be our Alumni Honoree in
the Scholastic Awards this year,

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.290
and Dr. Walkowicz told
me that she included

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.190
on her post doc fellowship
application to Princeton,

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:54.940
the scholastic award for
painting that she won

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.910
in tenth grade, because it gave
her the idea that she could be

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.140
who she wanted to be and
express herself artfully

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.440
about Astro Biology.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.510
I also want to acknowledge
and thank my friends

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.450
from the Poetry Coalition under
the leadership of Jen Benka

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.600
at the Academy of American
Poets, and our pals

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.900
in the Poetry Foundation.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.200
It's so great of
you to come here

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.160
and launch these young poets
onto their year of service.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.530
As Kit mentioned, these
fine poets became eligible

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.480
to be appointed as
national student poets

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.810
because they first
received national awards

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.890
through the Scholastic
Art and Writing Awards.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.420
The awards were started in 1923,
which is just about the time

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.420
that the word teenager first
appeared in the dictionary.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.300
And our mission and
our purpose is

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.570
to encourage creative
young people.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.670
So we have the privilege

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.510
of launching these creative
young people onto their year

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.850
of service and I wish all
of you could get to see some

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.280
of them at work as I, I do.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.250
Last year on went on tour in
Idaho with Kinsell Houston

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.730
who worked in a number
of different settings.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.450
She did a poetry
workshop for Doosan's,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.920
at the Boise Art Museum.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.570
She worked on an air
force base high school,

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.300
and then she spent her
day at Boise High School

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.620
where she read some
of her own work

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.200
and advocates a creative
word cloud,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.220
and then write poems
about their homes.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.520
And when it came time to share,

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.840
one of the students
raised their hand.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.210
And she was 15 years old.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.660
And started reading, I
remember my first home.

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:20.960
And then you went -- she went

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.650
on to artfully describe seven
more homes adding details

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:29.040
about the light, the step
families that had come and gone.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.530
It was a stunning
moment, a pause.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.830
The class did this.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.130
[ Snapping fingers ]

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.430
We do a lot of this

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.730
in the Scholastic Art
and Writing Awards.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.630
And they moved on,
but I've reflected

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.810
on that student quite a bit.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.050
Because she so aptly described
how poetry shortcuts the

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.980
expression of complex
emotions and ideas.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.780
And how powerful it is, it
has the power to connect us,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.930
to explain, to provoke,
to express, to explore.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.060
It's very complicated being
a teenager these days.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.240
It always has been,
but especially now.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.210
What better past time could they
possibly grab on to than poetry

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.710
and helping guide them
through the teenage years.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.950
These teen poets are
particularly well suited

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.250
to advocate.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.330
They're young enough to be
relatable to little kids.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:17.170
And they're mature enough for
adults to take them seriously.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:21.040
The 2018 Class of National
Student Poets joins a legacy

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:26.250
of incredible young writers
who feel poetry in their bones.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.420
And their voices are
strong and unique,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.750
and they will enter their year
of service fully committed

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.460
to sharing their voices insights
and artistry to audiences large

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.910
and small, grand and not so
grand, like those at the Library

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.580
of Congress, and like
those at Boise High School.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.830
Poetry is an ancient
artform that continues

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:52.040
to reinvent itself, and
make itself newly relevant,

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.050
generation after generation.

finest young poets.

talking to the students,

the poets, earlier and
I mentioned when I was

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.880
in college I applied for a --
to -- for a short story class.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.630
The professor thought it was
short story and poetry and so

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.930
to get into the class we had

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.240
to write a short story
and then also a poem.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.740
And I had never written
a poem before in my life.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.460
So I wrote the story
and I wrote the poem,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.190
and I wrote in the bottom,
I make no claims on poetry.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.420
And my professor
wrote, on the bottom,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.510
and it makes no claims on you.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.590
[ Laughter ]

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.170
I, myself, do not have this gift

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.980
but I'm the beneficiary
of poetry.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.170
And I'm the beneficiary
of the written word.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.570
And what I thought I'd do
just for a few minutes to try

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.960
to illustrate what the
written word does for us.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.570
And so I have a home
ten blocks from here.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.360
And I have a collection
in that home.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.150
And some people collect stamps.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.410
I collect accounts of
different emotions.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.910
And so I collect
accounts of joy.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.730
And so for example, and when
you have all these accounts,

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.900
you realize it comes in layers.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.920
There's physical joy that gets,
when people are moving together,

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.850
my old history professor
was named Julio McNeal.

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:33.270
And he was in bootcamp, and
he was marching with his men

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.000
and he experienced
a moment of joy.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.980
He wrote, "Words are inadequate
to describe the emotion aroused

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.710
by the prolonged movement in
unison that drilling involved.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.790
A sense of pervasive
well-being is what I recall.

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:49.080
More specifically, a strange
sense of personal enlargement.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.380
A sort of swelling up.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.340
Becoming bigger than life,
thanks to participation

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.000
in a collective ritual."

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.100
And so that's one layer of joy.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.630
Another is what they call
collective effervescence.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:05.800
Every group of humanity dances
in rhythm when they're joyful.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.860
And so Zadie Smith was in
London in a nightclub in 1999,

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.600
and she heard Q-Tip
rapping over the music.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.930
And she describes this moment.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.140
"A real thin man with enormous
eyes reached across the sea

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.820
of bodies for my hand.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.870
He kept asking me the
same thing over and over.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.250
You feeling it?

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:30.050
I was. My -- my ridiculous
heels were killing me.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.030
I was terrified I might die.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.140
Yet I felt simultaneously
overwhelmed with delight

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:37.110
that can I kick it should
happen to be playing

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.460
at this precise moment in
the history of the world.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:42.580
And was now morphing
into smells Latin spirit.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.660
I took the man's hand, the top
of my head flew away, we danced

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.770
and danced, we gave
ourselves up to joy."

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.330
That's another layer.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.960
Then there might be what
you call emotional joy.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.510
One of my heroes in life is
a woman named Dorothy Day.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.410
And she was -- got pregnant
and she realized that most

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.950
of the accounts of childbirth
she'd ever read were written

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.450
by men.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.890
So 45 minutes after giving
birth she wrote an account,

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.190
a very beautiful account.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.530
And it ends with
a moment of joy.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.230
She writes, "If I had
written the greatest book,

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.530
composed the greatest symphony,

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.050
or carved the most exquisite
figure I could not have felt a

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.690
more exalted creator than I did

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.270
when they placed my
child in my arms.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.530
No human creature could receive
or contain so vast a flood

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:28.650
of love and joy as I felt
after the birth of my child.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.030
And with this came the need
to worship and to adore."

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.040
And when you see these moments,
you realize that joy happens

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.930
when the skin barrier
between one person

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.540
and another disappears.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.760
Joy often involves
a loss of self.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.490
David White who's a
-- a good poet writes,

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.490
"Joy is a meeting place
of deep intentionality

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.160
and self-forgetting.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.390
The bodily alchemy of
what lies inside us

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:55.690
in communion would have

00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:00.000
but formerly seemed
outside, but now is neither.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.800
Dance, laughter, affection,
skin touching skin,

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.960
singing in the car, music in the
kitchen, the quite irreplaceable

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.000
and companionable
presence of a daughter.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.100
The sheer intoxicating beauty
of the world that inhabited us

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.310
as an edge between what we
previously thought was us,

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.810
and what was not us."

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.370
Then there's a couple
higher levels.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.670
I'll just two more.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.980
And one is transcendent joy.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.050
When we think we're
reaching across some barrier

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.030
that we can't really explain.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.330
So I am not a poet.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.900
I have a friend whose
an actual poet.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.630
And his name is Christian
Wyman, a very beautiful poet.

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.490
And wherever -- when
you talk to Chris,

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.790
he's lived in a lot of cities.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.610
And he always lived there
because there was a woman there.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.190
So like, he lived in Buffalo.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.490
Why'd you live in Buffalo?

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:46.790
Oh I had a girlfriend there.

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.210
And then where, you know,
why'd you live in Rochester?

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.510
Oh a girlfriend there.

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:50.810
And so he lived in Progue.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.730
He had a girlfriend there.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.480
And so one night he was
working on this poetry,

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.750
or one morning, in the kitchen.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.490
And he was just at
the kitchen table.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.890
And a falcon landed on the
windowsill across the window.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.670
And it scanned out and
it didn't seem him.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.660
It just was scanning, like
two feet away from him.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.310
And his girlfriend
was taking a shower.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.210
So he went and got her and said
come out you got to see this.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.760
So she came out dripping, naked.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.100
And they're standing there just
with this falcon right there.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.570
And the falcon turns and
looks eyes with Wyman.

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:30.250
And his girlfriend said,
wish for something.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.260
Take this moment,
wish for something.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.950
And he later wrote
about a poem --

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.820
he wrote a poem about
the experience,

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.590
and it includes this stanza.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:42.560
"And for a long moment I'm
still in, I wished and wished

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.220
and wished and wished that
the moment would not end.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.050
And just like that it vanished."

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.930
So that's that content that
people have with nature.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.840
And then finally the --
the part I'll end with,

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.910
and I actually don't
have a passage with this.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.990
Is some people -- some moments
of joy are just transcendent,

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.810
but moments, and then they
go away, like Wyman's.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.250
But some people for
them, joy is not a --

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.400
an experience it's an outlook.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.070
It's something they bring
into the world every day.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:15.050
And it comes from the habitual
giving other people's delight.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.110
And it becomes their permanent
way of being in the world.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.620
I was at a luncheon
here a couple years ago,

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.300
and I was seated next
to the Dahlia Lama.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.310
And the guy laughs for
no apparent reason.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.610
He just starts laughing.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.720
And you're sitting there,
and you want to be polite,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.540
so you laugh, and then
he laughs, and you laugh.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.370
And I had nothing
to say to the guy,

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.400
because he was just so happy.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:40.610
And so I finally said -- he
had a canvas Dahlia Lama bag,

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:42.020
so I said, you got
any candy in your bag?

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.690
And so he starts pulling
out the stuff in the bag.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.690
It turns out to be everything
you get in the First-Class cabin

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.880
of an international flight,
like a little razor, ear plugs.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.560
But he just radiates joy.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.810
And Kathy and I have a friend,
a very famous guy, Yo-Yo Ma.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:58.390
That guy just radiates joy.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.480
And that to me is a
higher form of life

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.270
because they are just delight
in things, delight in gratitude

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.820
and they offer goodness.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:08.150
Now so why have I
run through all this?

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.450
It seems to me we're born

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.180
with relatively primitive
understandings

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.040
of our own emotions,
at least men are.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.060
[ Laughter ]

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.290
But what language, and
especially poetry does,

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.360
is it educates us
in our own emotions.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.100
When you've read a poem, you
haven't gotten new knowledge,

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.570
or new information, but
you've had a new experience.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.530
And oft it's -- it's an
emotional experience.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.790
And you widen your
repertoire of emotions.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.150
The greatest poet of our day,
Taylor Swift, was once asked,

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.210
I actually sort of mean that.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.950
Was once asked, you
write all about sadness.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:46.230
She says, there are actually
22 different kinds of sadness.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.510
There's your dog leaves sadness,
your boyfriend dumps you,

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.900
your mom -- and she played a
different tune for all kinds.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.690
She's an expert on sadness.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:57.390
And so it's like we're born
with one piano key for joy.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:59.370
But through poetry and
through language we learn,

00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.320
well there are actually
88 different piano keys.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.270
And who would want to live
with the simplistic notion

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.710
of our own emotions when you
can live with an enriched one.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.350
It's the sort of thing that
just makes life so much better.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.940
And then finally, if you
realize joy is the kind of thing

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:17.150
that the Dahlia Lama or Yo-Yo
Ma could experience and project,

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.400
why would you want to live
for just mere happiness

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.700
when you could have joy?

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.160
And when you make that kind

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.410
of realization your whole
life can turn around.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.710
And so that's what I think
you guys are offering, the --

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.550
the explication of
your own emotions

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.790
and giving everybody a sense of
what you've learned about them.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.050
And so I congratulate you,

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:39.090
I thank you for what
you're about to do.

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.560
And as I mentioned, one
serious note, this is a moment

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:46.450
where our nation needs
a story, and it needs

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.610
to be told through poetry.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:52.250
And so I ask that you spend some
time at this next year filling

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.050
in what is a gap and that if
there's anything that's going

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.630
to unite such a diverse
country it's going to be poetry

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.950
and story and narrative.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.900
And I'm -- I'm sure you're
going to play a role in that.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.340
So I have never experienced
the kind

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.670
of joy that Sadie Smith did.

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.120
I can't dance to Q-Tip.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.770
But I have had a couple
of experiences of joy

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:17.000
and this is a replication of
one of my earlier experiences.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.560
Twice in my life I've
had this experience.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.030

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.460
And this is my second.

&gt;&gt; Valerie June: Well
I have the pleasure

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.440
of spending some personal
time with the students.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:59.040
And I was asking each one
of them about their voices.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:05.020
And I'm a musician but also a
songwriter, and a poet as well.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.190
So the voice of the poet is
really an interesting thing

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.490
to me.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.530
And one thing they told me,
each one in their different way,

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.930
of how they hear the voice

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:20.100
of a poem is it usually
starts with one line.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.330
And I'll hear that line, and
I'll work with that line again

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.260
and again for a little bit.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.110
And then I'll start
writing the poem.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.590
And the poems comes really fast
once they hear that one line.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:35.040
And they sit with it, then the
poem writing is fast after that.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.450
So I hope that you
go to your regions

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.310

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.290

have this power.

power to do that.

for you on my little baby,

For my father, widower at 33.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:04.730
Mornings when I woke up
my face sagging, defeated,

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:08.400
dad would smile at me and
wave his arms above his head.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.840
His legs kicking beneath him.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.200
A desperate flail,
but a chance to show

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.210
that he could move his
body aw well as anyone.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.410
When the sunlight
seemed to break and spill

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:21.630
down his raised chin like
egg whites, and the chill bit

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.630
into us both, he'd sing.

The song isn't as
important to me now

as the beauty of the dance.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.450
And I'm sure the melody
was a repetitious rip off

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:32.840
of zip-a-dee-doo-dah,

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.660

our heads beneath the sky

warm air from our mouths

as we screamed, it's
a beautiful day.

clung to my back whispering,

over and over like a chorus.

learn the way a body

at the car swerving

reconsidered being vegetarian?

up to the school.

to talk about the news

watch another morning swell

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.280
An eternity of southern
acrimony, a forbidden home,

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.430
familiar, familial,
a fresh wound

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:50.110
that never seems to scab over.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:55.790
There lay heritage,
blood, spirit, bone.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:58.900
Generations gone with the
wind, surviving through me,

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.790
my heart strung to
theirs like DNA.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.580
Their flesh dissolving
like sugar cube,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.730
my body still on stolen land.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.350
Someday we will all
taste liberation

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.510
on the tips of our tongues.

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.750
Well I think we have two
poets from last year here.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.380
Can you raise your hands?

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.680
Yeah. Great.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.980
Congratulations.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.040
Thank you for coming.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:49.500
So I think we're going to have
reflections from Anne Castillo?

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.800
Right? Great.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.010
And Ben is here to add, you
know, counterpoint, I'm sure.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.330
&gt;&gt; Annie Castillo: Hi everyone
and thanks for having me back.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:08.000
Welcome to the appointment

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.240
of this year's National
Student Poets.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.680
I want to congratulate the
Class of 2018, Darius, Alex,

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.780
Heather, Daniel and Ariana.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:21.130
And to your parents, teachers,
friends and supporters.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.290
Thank you for guiding
these people who write

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.890
and envision change
in their community.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:29.650
I wanted to offer a quick
recap of our year as the Class

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:34.380
of 2017, along side Juliette,
Kensal, Ben and Camilla,

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.000
I've had the best
year of my life.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.260
For starters, I made
four lifelong friends.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.030
Better yet, we skipped
school to travel together.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.040
[ Laughter ]

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.550
To New York City in October,
the Aspen Ideas Festival

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.050
and Carnegie Hall in June.

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:54.150
We were certainly the recipients
of a lot of generosity.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.880
People like Juan Felipe
Herrera, Dr. Katheryn Matthew,

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.130
Dr. Carla Hayden, Sarah Jessica
Parker, Elizabeth Alexander,

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:06.180
and Edward Hirsh lent us their
time and wisdom unreservedly.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.740
Thanks to the hard work of
the staff at the Alliance

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:12.050
for Young Artists and Writers,
we've experienced affirmation

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:15.580
and received a platform to
share poetry with our peers.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.000
We were given the
space to write bravely

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.430
and delve deeply into poetry.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:23.730
But this year isn't about the
amazing gift each national

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.090
student poet here
has been given.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.390
Don't get me wrong.

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:30.100
We should say thank you
often and sincerely.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.130
After all, this program
is the culmination

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.470
of many wonderful people's
vision and hard work.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:40.040
To Virginia, Hannah, Deborah,
Olivia and all the others

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.120
who helped at the Alliance
and IMLS, we thank you

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.430
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.170
In eighth grade, my English
teacher asked our class

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.090
to write essays not about
the best gift we got

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:55.710
over winter break, but instead
about the best gift we gave.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:00.040
It shifted our perspectives to
generosity and thoughtfulness.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.650
And it was a lesson
that stayed with me.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:05.640
I share this with you because
at its heart this is the magic

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.870
of the National Student
Poet's Program.

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:11.430
They help us and we turn
around to help others.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:14.830
I know the Class of 2018 will
change their communities,

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:17.930
amplify the voices too
often left unheard.

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.650
Make more room at the table
for new and bright poets.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.050
I know this because each of
you is an astounding writer

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.290
and ambassador to your craft.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.290
I also know this because
I've seen the same generosity

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:35.210
in my friends, Ben, Kensal,
Juliette and Camilla this year.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.890
Camilla spent time helping
teach poetry therapy

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.770
to immigrant advocates and
attorneys and connected

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:43.960
with refugees from
Somalia and the Congo.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.460
Juliette collaborated
with doctors and patients,

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:50.680
using language to heal
emotional trauma in hospitals.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.760
Kensal spent time
with Native students

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.010
at the Sherman Indian Boarding
School discussing identity

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:57.560
and the notion of home

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.440
and published a collection
of their writings.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.680
Ben was poet and resident
for summer school,

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.080
giving academic enrichment

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.890
to local Minneapolis
middle schoolers.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.680
They've all accomplished
wonderful things

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.000
and I hope you'll take
inspiration and guidance

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.200
from them as you search
for your own path forward.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.050
Before we go, we of the
Class of 2017 wanted

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:19.890
to give a few pieces of advice.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:21.270
Juliette says you should learn

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.980
from everyone you
meet, and I agree.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.800
Ben urges you to be unafraid

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.200
to seize the opportunity
you worked so hard for.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.590
We also recommend you
wear powder foundation

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.010
in TV interviews.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.310
[ Laughter ]

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.070
And send thank you notes early.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.000
Above all though, take a
lesson from Juan Felipe Herrera

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.260
who spent the last 15 minute
of our master class together,

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.330
showing us how to
fold Starbucks bags

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.870
into makeshift poetry booklets.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.880
Looking back, I realize
he was showing us how

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.190
to make room for poetry.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.280
And above all, remember you're
here because you earned it,

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.920
and we need your voices
now more than ever.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.510
We're standing right beside
you, and we can't wait

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:01.810
to see what you'll do.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:03.610
Thank you.

on me to close

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.620
out these beautiful festivities.

But before I do, I want to
see if we can play this video.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:41.450
I'm told that we
may have some luck.

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:46.510
So poetry keeps up pliable,
so we'll -- we'll try again.

&gt;&gt; My Name is Tracy K.
Smith, and I'm delighted

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:20.820
to congratulate you on having
been selected this year's

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:23.180
National Student Poets.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:26.870
It speaks to the commitment
that you've already demonstrated

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:31.740
to poetry as an art form,
and as a way of life.

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:37.300
As I see it, poems teach us new
ways of looking at the world.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.270
They give us new terms for
describing the many active

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.790
and powerful feelings
that we live with.

00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:47.480
And they also allow
us to listen closely

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.060
to other people's
voices and their stories.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.300
I think all of that is
indispensable to a full life.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.640
And I'm thrilled that over the
next year you will be able to go

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:00.990
into your communities, doing
this with other people,

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:04.040
talking about why
poetry matters to you.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.830
That's what I've been doing over
the last year as Poet Laureate

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:10.770
and it's been one of the most
rewarding acts of my life

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:14.560
as an artist, and a person
to go into communities

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.240
with people I don't know,
people I may never see again,

00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:21.180
and feel like we actually have
something meaningful to say

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:24.310
to one another through
the vehicle of poetry.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:26.530
I'm sorry I'm not there with
you tonight, I'm actually

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:30.460
in Alaska talking
poetry with new friends.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.260
But I'm excited to
join you tomorrow

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.510
and celebrate your
accomplishments.

I'm glad you guys got to
hear her special words.

just want to thank our partners,

The Alliance for Young Artists
and Writers and the Institute

I'd also like to thank our
special guests, David Brooks,

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:59.670
for that rousing, that was
very sweet, emotional talk.

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:02.190

like to thank her as well.

So before I send you
off to celebrate,

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.240
I just want to remind you all

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.610
that the National Book
Festival is this weekend

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.720
and the student poets
will be performing

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:12.130
at the book festival
not once, but twice,

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:13.430
on the expo of floors.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.080

to check them out.

And also the full day is
lots of fabulous programming.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.960
So make sure you --
you check that out.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.090
Very last thing there are
surveys on your chairs.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.000
If you wouldn't be so
kind as to fill them out,

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.990
it does help us here
at the library.
