00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.990
Let's talk about
one of the most

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.560
important biological processes.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.220
Frankly, if this process didn't
occur, we probably

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.470
wouldn't have life on Earth, and
I wouldn't be making this

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.900
video for you, because there'd
be no place for me to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.360
actually get food.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.185
And the process is called
photosynthesis.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.410
And you're probably reasonably
familiar with the idea.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.090
The whole idea is plants, and
actually bacteria and algae

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.830
and other things,
but we normally

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.430
associate it with plants.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.600
Let me make it in very simple
terms. So we normally

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.190
associate it with plants.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.520
And it's a process that plants
use, and we might have learned

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.730
this when we were very young.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.580
It's the process that plants
use to take carbon dioxide

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:56.490
plus some water plus some
sunlight and turn it into some

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.010
sugars or some maybe
carbohydrates.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.150
Carbohydrates or sugars
plus oxygen.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.360
Obviously, this has two very
profound pieces to it for us

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.790
as a living species.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.200
One, we need carbohydrates or
we need sugars in order to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.240
fuel our bodies.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.680
You saw that in the cellular
respiration videos.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.540
We generate all of our ATP
by performing cellular

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.990
respiration on glucose, which is
essentially a byproduct, or

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.015
a broken down carbohydrate.

00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:30.530
It's the simplest one for us
to process in cellular

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.250
respiration.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.240
And the second hugely
important part

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.330
is getting the oxygen.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.490
Once again, we need to breathe
oxygen in order for us to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.500
break down glucose, in order
to respire, in order to

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.100
perform cellar respiration.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.740
So these two things are key for
life, especially for life

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.990
that breathes oxygen.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.220
So this process, other than
the fact that it's

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.200
interesting, that there are
organisms around us, mostly

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.130
plants, that are able to harness
actual sunlight.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.900
You have these fusion reactions
in the sun 93

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.110
million miles away, and it's
releasing these photons, and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.570
some small subset of
those photons reach

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.790
the surface of Earth.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.690
They make their way through
clouds and whatever else.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.560
And then these plants and
bacteria and algae are able to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.010
harness that somehow and turn
them into sugars that we can

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.120
then eat or maybe the cow eats
them and we eat the cow if

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.280
we're not vegetarians, and we
can then use that for energy.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.960
Not that the cow is all
carbohydrates, but this is

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.200
essentially what is used as the
fuel or the energy for all

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.365
of the other important compounds
that we eat.

00:02:41.365 --> 00:02:43.930
This is where we get
all of our fuel.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.450
So this is fuel for animals.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.620
Or you know, if you eat a
potato directly, you are

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.380
directly getting your
carbohydrates.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.160
But anyway, this is a very
simple notion of

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.760
photosynthesis, but it's
not incorrect.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.550
I mean, if you had to know one
thing about photosynthesis,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.290
this would be it.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.640
But let's delve a little bit
deeper and try to get into the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.930
guts of it and see if we can
understand a little bit better

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.970
how this actually happens.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.780
I find it amazing that somehow
photons of sunlight are used

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.540
to create these sugar
molecules or these

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.226
carbohydrates.

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:16.850
So let's delve a little
bit deeper.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.350
So we can write the general
equation for photosynthesis.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.530
Well, I've almost
written it here.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.720
But I'll write it a little bit
more scientifically specific.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.640
You start off with some
carbon dioxide.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.890
You add to that some water, and
you add to that-- instead

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.030
of sunlight, I'm going to say
photons because these are what

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.070
really do excite the electrons
in the chlorophyll that go

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.970
down, and you'll see this
process probably in this

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.530
video, and we'll go in more
detail in the next few videos.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.100
But that excited electron goes
to a high energy state, and as

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.290
it goes to a lower energy state,
we're able to harness

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.180
that energy to produce ATPs,
and you'll see NADPHs, and

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.180
those are used to produce
carbohydrates.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.080
But we'll see that
in a little bit.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.590
But the overview of
photosynthesis, you start off

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.300
with these constituents, And
then you end up with a

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.210
carbohydrate.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.610
And a carbohydrate
could be glucose,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.080
doesn't have to be glucose.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.110
So the general way we can write
a carbohydrates is CH2O.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.210
And we'll put an n over here,
that we could have n multiples

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.140
of these, and normally, n
will be at least three.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.990
In the case of glucose,
n is 6.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.420
You have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens
and 6 oxygens.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.610
So this is a general term for
carbohydrates, but you could

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.100
have many multiples of that.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.810
You could have these
long-chained carbohydrates, so

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.620
you end up with a carbohydrate
and then you end

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.920
up with some oxygen.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.730
So this right here isn't so
different than what I wrote up

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.100
here in my first overview of
how we always imagined

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.720
photosynthesis in our heads.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.190
In order to make this equation
balance-- let's see, I have n

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.780
carbons so I need
n carbons there.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.860
Let's see, I have two
n hydrogens here.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.470
Two hydrogens and I have n
there, so I need two n

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.020
hydrogens here.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.150
So I'll put an n out there.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.400
And lets see how many oxygens.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.635
I have two n oxygens,
plus another n, so I

00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:13.880
have three n oxygens.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.455
So let's see, I have one n,
and you put an n here, and

00:05:18.455 --> 00:05:21.890
then I have two n, and I think
this equation balances out.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.850
So this is a 30,000-foot view
of what's going on in

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.760
photosynthesis.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.730
But when you dig a little
deeper, you'll see that this

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.900
doesn't happen directly, that
this happens through a bunch

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.270
of steps that eventually gets
us to the carbohydrate.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.850
So in general, we can break
down photosynthesis.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.440
I'll rewrite the word.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.830
We can break down
photosynthesis-- and we'll

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.960
delve deeper into future videos,
but I want to get you

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.220
the overview first--
into two stages.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.080
We can call one the
light reactions.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.900
Or sometimes they are called the
light-dependent reactions,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.010
and that actually would
probably be a better

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.830
way to write it.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.840
Let me write it like that.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.880
Light dependent means that
they need light to occur.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.300
Light-dependent reactions.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.500
And then you have something
called the dark reactions, and

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.140
that's actually a bad name,
because it also

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.850
occurs in the light.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.300
Dark reactions, I wrote in
a slightly darker color.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.420
And the reason why I said it's a
bad name is because it still

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.800
occurs in the light.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.950
But the reason why they probably
called it the dark

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.100
reaction is that you don't need
light, or that part of

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.620
photosynthesis isn't dependent
on photons to occur.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.130
So a better term for
it would have been

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:55.700
light-independent reaction.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.190
So just to be clear,
the light reactions

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.910
actually need sunlight.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.420
They actually need photons
for them to proceed.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.510
The dark reactions do not need
photons for them to happen,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.240
although they do occur
when the sun is out.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.010
They don't need those photons,
but they need the byproducts

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.800
from the light reaction to
occur, so that's why it's

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.230
called the light-independent
reaction.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.300
They occur while the sun
is out, but they

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.580
don't need the sun.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.270
This needs the sun, so let
me make it very clear.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.970
So this requires sunlight.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.350
This requires photons.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.280
And let me just make a very
brief overview of this.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.880
This'll maybe let us start
building a scaffold from which

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.400
we can dig deeper.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.880
So the light reactions
need photons, and

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.010
then it needs water.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.600
So water goes into the light
reactions and out of the other

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.820
side of the light reactions.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.850
We end up with some
molecular oxygen.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.875
So that's what happens in the
light reactions, and I'm going

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:57.370
to go much deeper into
what actually occurs.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:03.030
And what the light the actions
produce is ATP, which we know

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.710
is the cellular or the
biological currency of energy.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.750
It produces ATP and
it produces NADPH.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.790
Now, when we studied cellular
respiration, we saw the

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.930
molecule NADH.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.310
NADPH is very similar.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.260
You just have this P there.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.710
You just have this phosphate
group there, but they really

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:31.590
perform similar mechanisms. That
this agent right here,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:37.659
this molecule right here, is
able to give away-- now let's

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:41.039
think about what this means--
it's able to give away this

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.960
hydrogen and the electron
associated with this hydrogen.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.870
So if you give away an electron
to someone else or

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.690
someone else gains an electron,
that something else

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.310
is being reduced.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.500
Let me write that down.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.350
This is a good reminder.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.820
OIL RIG.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.750
Oxidation is losing
an electron.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.750
Reduction is gaining
an electron.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.430
Your charge is reduced when
you gain an electron.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.950
It has a negative charge.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.770
So this is a reducing agent.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.810
It gets oxidized by losing
the hydrogen and the

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:15.620
electron with it.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.060
I have a whole discussion
on the biological versus

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.670
chemistry view of oxidation,
but it's the same idea.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:25.530
When I lose a hydrogen, I also
lose the ability to hog that

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.130
hydrogen's electron.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.270
So this right here, when it
reacts with other things, it's

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.910
a reducing agent.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:37.030
It gives away this hydrogen and
the electron associated

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.550
with it, and so the other
thing gets reduced.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.660
So this thing is a
reducing agent.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.890
And what's useful about it is
when this hydrogen, and

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.230
especially the electron
associated with that hydrogen,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.950
goes from the NADPH to, say,
another molecule and goes to a

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.750
lower energy state, that energy
can also be used in the

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:02.570
dark reactions.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.800
And we saw in cellular
respiration the very similar

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.570
molecule, NADH, that through
the Kreb Cycle, or actually

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.950
more importantly, that through
the electron transport chain,

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:17.350
was able to help produce ATP as
it gave away its electrons

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:18.770
and they went to lower
energy states.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.410
But I don't want to confuse
you too much.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.280
So the light reactions, you take
in photons, you take in

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.930
water, it spits out oxygen, and
it spits out ATP and NADPH

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.030
that can then be used in
the dark reactions.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.520
And the dark reactions, for
most plants we talk about,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.770
it's called the Calvin Cycle.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.370
And I'll go into a lot more
detail of what actually occurs

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:48.810
in the Calvin Cycle, but it
takes in the ATP, the NADPH,

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:56.480
and it produces-- it doesn't
directly produce glucose.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.410
It produces-- oh, you
probably saw this.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.330
You could call it PGAL.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.990
You could call it G3P.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.410
These all stand for-- let me
write these down-- this is

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.660
phosphoglyceraldehyde.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.410
My handwriting broke down.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.910
Or you could call it
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.210
Same exact molecule.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.320
You can almost imagine it as--
this is a very gross

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.000
oversimplification-- as three
carbons with a phosphate group

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.250
attached to it.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.750
But this can then be used to
produce other carbohydrates,

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.620
including glucose.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.970
If you have two of these,
you can use those

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.160
two to produce glucose.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.820
So let's just take a quick
overview again because this is

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.610
super important.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.000
I'm going to make videos on the
light reactions and the

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.030
dark reactions.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.850
Those will be the next
two videos I make.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.450
So photosynthesis, you
start with photons.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.500
All of these occur when the sun
is out, but only the light

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.270
reactions actually
need the photons.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.090
The light reactions take
photons-- we're going to go

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.740
into more detail about what
actually occurs--

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.550
and it takes in water.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.130
Oxygen gets spit out.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.670
ATP and NADPH get spit out,
which are then used by the

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.020
dark reaction, or the
Calvin Cycle, or the

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.310
light-independent reaction,
because these still

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.470
occur in the light.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.820
They just don't need photons.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.980
So they're the light-independent
reaction.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.530
And it uses that in
conjunction-- and we'll talk

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.940
about other molecules that
are used in conjunction.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.950
Oh, and I forgot a very
important constituent of the

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.840
dark reaction.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.690
It needs carbon dioxide.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.070
That's where you get your
carbons to keep producing

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.220
these phosphoglyceraldehydes, or
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.600
So that's super important.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.830
It takes in the carbon dioxide,
the products from the

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:05.000
light reactions, and then uses
that in the Calvin Cycle to

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.070
produce this very simple
building block of other

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:09.980
carbohydrates.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.790
And if you remember from
glycolysis, you might remember

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:16.650
that this PGAL molecule, or this
G3P-- same thing-- this

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.210
was actually the first product
when we split glucose in two

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.720
when we performed
the glycolysis.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.270
So now we're going
the other way.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.540
We're building glucose
so that we can split

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.910
it later for energy.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.340
So this is an overview of
photosynthesis, and in the

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.090
next couple of videos, I'm
actually going to delve a

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.430
little bit deeper and tell you
about the light reactions and

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.630
the dark reactions and how
they actually occur.
