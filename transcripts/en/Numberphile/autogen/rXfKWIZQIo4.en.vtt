00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.220
 
so we're going to talk about a problem

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230
so we're going to talk about a problem
 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.500
so we're going to talk about a problem
in geometry and it's called the moving

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510
in geometry and it's called the moving
 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.749
in geometry and it's called the moving
sofa problem so the problem is inspired

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
sofa problem so the problem is inspired
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.030
sofa problem so the problem is inspired
by the real-life problem of moving

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
by the real-life problem of moving
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.320
by the real-life problem of moving
furniture around

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
furniture around
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.390
furniture around
it's called named after sofas but it can

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
it's called named after sofas but it can
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.039
it's called named after sofas but it can
be anything really you have a piece of

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049
be anything really you have a piece of
 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.209
be anything really you have a piece of
furniture you're carrying down a

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
furniture you're carrying down a
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.310
furniture you're carrying down a
corridor in your house or down some

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
corridor in your house or down some
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.130
corridor in your house or down some
whatever place and you need to navigate

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
whatever place and you need to navigate
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.320
whatever place and you need to navigate
some obstacles so one of the simple

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
some obstacles so one of the simple
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.470
some obstacles so one of the simple
situations and capturing that would be

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
situations and capturing that would be
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.960
situations and capturing that would be
when you have a turn right turn in a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
when you have a turn right turn in a
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.400
when you have a turn right turn in a
corridor you need to move the sofa

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
corridor you need to move the sofa
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.080
corridor you need to move the sofa
around we're modeling this in two

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
around we're modeling this in two
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.150
around we're modeling this in two
dimensions so let's say sophix so heavy

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160
dimensions so let's say sophix so heavy
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.620
dimensions so let's say sophix so heavy
you can't even lift it up you can only

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
you can't even lift it up you can only
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.510
you can't even lift it up you can only
push it around on the floor obviously

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
push it around on the floor obviously
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.979
push it around on the floor obviously
some sofas will fit around the corner

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
some sofas will fit around the corner
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.930
some sofas will fit around the corner
some will not and people started asking

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940
some will not and people started asking
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.819
some will not and people started asking
themselves at some point what is the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829
themselves at some point what is the
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.500
themselves at some point what is the
largest sofa you can move around the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
largest sofa you can move around the
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.150
largest sofa you can move around the
corner so that's the question what is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160
corner so that's the question what is
 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.060
corner so that's the question what is
the sofa of largest area large area not

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
the sofa of largest area large area not
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.430
the sofa of largest area large area not
longer store not long is not heavier

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
longer store not long is not heavier
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.130
longer store not long is not heavier
just largest area okay not most

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140
just largest area okay not most
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.319
just largest area okay not most
comfortable so here's an example of a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
comfortable so here's an example of a
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.209
comfortable so here's an example of a
one of the most simple sofas you can

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
one of the most simple sofas you can
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.250
one of the most simple sofas you can
imagine so it has a semicircular shape

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
imagine so it has a semicircular shape
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110
imagine so it has a semicircular shape
and we push it down the corridor so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
and we push it down the corridor so
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729
and we push it down the corridor so
let's see what happens we push it until

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
let's see what happens we push it until
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.579
let's see what happens we push it until
it meets the opposite wall and now we

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
it meets the opposite wall and now we
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469
it meets the opposite wall and now we
rotate it and of course because it's a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
rotate it and of course because it's a
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.050
rotate it and of course because it's a
semicircle it can rotate just perfectly

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
semicircle it can rotate just perfectly
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390
semicircle it can rotate just perfectly
and now it's in the other corridor so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
and now it's in the other corridor so
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.039
and now it's in the other corridor so
you can push it forward and what's the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
you can push it forward and what's the
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.690
you can push it forward and what's the
area about one lacks adequate area first

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
area about one lacks adequate area first
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.830
area about one lacks adequate area first
of all we have to say that we choose

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
of all we have to say that we choose
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.929
of all we have to say that we choose
units where the width of the corridor is

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
units where the width of the corridor is
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580
units where the width of the corridor is
one unit let's say one meter or

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
one unit let's say one meter or
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.160
one unit let's say one meter or
something like that then the semicircle

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
something like that then the semicircle
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.830
something like that then the semicircle
have radius one so I'm sure all your

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
have radius one so I'm sure all your
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.480
have radius one so I'm sure all your
viewers know that the area would be PI

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
viewers know that the area would be PI
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.370
viewers know that the area would be PI
over two because that's the area of a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
over two because that's the area of a
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620
over two because that's the area of a
semicircle in radius 1 now whether

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
semicircle in radius 1 now whether
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.480
semicircle in radius 1 now whether
that's good or not that's that's up to

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
that's good or not that's that's up to
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.249
that's good or not that's that's up to
you it's not the best that you can do

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
you it's not the best that you can do
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.830
you it's not the best that you can do
for sure but it is what it is so the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
for sure but it is what it is so the
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.020
for sure but it is what it is so the
next one that I have here looks like

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
next one that I have here looks like
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.760
next one that I have here looks like
this so it's still a fairly simple

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
this so it's still a fairly simple
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.520
this so it's still a fairly simple
geometric shape and it was proposed by

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
geometric shape and it was proposed by
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440
geometric shape and it was proposed by
British mathematician named john

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
British mathematician named john

hammersley in 1968 by the way I should

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
hammersley in 1968 by the way I should
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.030
hammersley in 1968 by the way I should
mention that the problem was first asked

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
mention that the problem was first asked
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.420
mention that the problem was first asked
in 1966 by a mathematician named Leo

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
in 1966 by a mathematician named Leo
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.190
in 1966 by a mathematician named Leo
Moser let's first of all check that it

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
Moser let's first of all check that it
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749
Moser let's first of all check that it
works and then I'll explain to you why

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
works and then I'll explain to you why
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.179
works and then I'll explain to you why
it work and so you see you can push it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
it work and so you see you can push it
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039
it work and so you see you can push it
and again it meets the wall and now we

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
and again it meets the wall and now we
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.600
and again it meets the wall and now we
start rotating it but while you're

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
start rotating it but while you're
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.999
start rotating it but while you're
rotating it you're also pushing it so

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
rotating it you're also pushing it so
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.630
rotating it you're also pushing it so
you're doing like this and it works

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
you're doing like this and it works
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.900
you're doing like this and it works
perfectly now the idea behind this

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910
perfectly now the idea behind this
 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.910
perfectly now the idea behind this
Hamersley sofa is you go back to the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
Hamersley sofa is you go back to the
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.260
Hamersley sofa is you go back to the
previous one which is the set the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270
previous one which is the set the
 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.510
previous one which is the set the
semi-circular one and you should imagine

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520
semi-circular one and you should imagine
 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.400
semi-circular one and you should imagine
cutting up this semicircle into two

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410
cutting up this semicircle into two
 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.500
cutting up this semicircle into two
pieces which are both quarter circles

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
pieces which are both quarter circles
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.750
pieces which are both quarter circles
and then pulling them apart and then

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
and then pulling them apart and then
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.430
and then pulling them apart and then
there's a gap between them and you fill

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
there's a gap between them and you fill
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.920
there's a gap between them and you fill
up this gap now in order to make it work

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930
up this gap now in order to make it work
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.030
up this gap now in order to make it work
so that you can move it around the

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040
so that you can move it around the
 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.449
so that you can move it around the
corner

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459
corner
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.850
corner
you have to carve out a hole because

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
you have to carve out a hole because
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.559
you have to carve out a hole because
that's what you need to do the rotation

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569
that's what you need to do the rotation
 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.600
that's what you need to do the rotation
part and hammers we notice and this is a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
part and hammers we notice and this is a
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.460
part and hammers we notice and this is a
very simple geometric observation is

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470
very simple geometric observation is
 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.380
very simple geometric observation is
that if the hole is semi circular in

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
that if the hole is semi circular in
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.809
that if the hole is semi circular in
shape then everything will work the way

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819
shape then everything will work the way
 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.309
shape then everything will work the way
it should and so she can move around the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
it should and so she can move around the
 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.380
it should and so she can move around the
corner and he also optimized the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
corner and he also optimized the
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.970
corner and he also optimized the
particular parameters associated with

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
particular parameters associated with
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.490
particular parameters associated with
how far apart you want to push the two

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500
how far apart you want to push the two
 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.199
how far apart you want to push the two
quarter circles and so on and then you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209
quarter circles and so on and then you
 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.900
quarter circles and so on and then you
work out the area of the overall area of

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
work out the area of the overall area of
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.210
work out the area of the overall area of
the sofa and it comes out to two pi over

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
the sofa and it comes out to two pi over
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.880
the sofa and it comes out to two pi over
two plus two over pi so slightly more

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
two plus two over pi so slightly more
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.890
two plus two over pi so slightly more
exotic number definitely an improvement

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
exotic number definitely an improvement
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.930
exotic number definitely an improvement
right well that wasn't the end of the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
right well that wasn't the end of the
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.820
right well that wasn't the end of the
story as it turns out Hammersley wasn't

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830

twenty something years later somebody

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
twenty something years later somebody
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.090
twenty something years later somebody
came up with something that is better

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100
came up with something that is better
 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.160

it's not really dramatically better

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
it's not really dramatically better
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.870
it's not really dramatically better
because the area is only slightly bigger

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
because the area is only slightly bigger
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.170
because the area is only slightly bigger
but eclis more clever I would say so

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180
but eclis more clever I would say so

so it's subtly different from it well

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180
so it's subtly different from it well
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.759
so it's subtly different from it well
here you see this curve is a semicircle

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769
here you see this curve is a semicircle
 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.520
here you see this curve is a semicircle
right here we're doing something a bit

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530
right here we're doing something a bit
 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.050
right here we're doing something a bit
more sophisticated so you see we've

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060
more sophisticated so you see we've
 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.750
more sophisticated so you see we've
polished off a little bit of the sharp

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760
polished off a little bit of the sharp
 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.610
polished off a little bit of the sharp
edge here and also this curve is no

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620
edge here and also this curve is no
 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.199

longer semicircle it's something

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209
longer semicircle it's something
 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.090
longer semicircle it's something
mathematically more complicated to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100
mathematically more complicated to
 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.580
mathematically more complicated to
describe and this this curve on the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590

made up by gluing together several
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.490
made up by gluing together several
different mathematical curves so this

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500
different mathematical curves so this
 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.349
different mathematical curves so this
shape is quite elaborate to describe the

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359
shape is quite elaborate to describe the
 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.059

in a very precise way oh and well let's

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889
in a very precise way oh and well let's
 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:11.569
in a very precise way oh and well let's
see it in action

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579
see it in action
 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.629

yeah okay so we put it here we push it

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639
yeah okay so we put it here we push it
 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.029
yeah okay so we put it here we push it
and you see I mean it looks roughly the

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039
and you see I mean it looks roughly the
 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.409
and you see I mean it looks roughly the
same as what happens with Hamersley so

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419
same as what happens with Hamersley so
 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.210
same as what happens with Hamersley so
far except the small difference here is

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220
far except the small difference here is
 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.159
far except the small difference here is
that you have a gap now because we've

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169
that you have a gap now because we've
 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.930
that you have a gap now because we've
carved off this piece so there's a

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940
carved off this piece so there's a
 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.830
carved off this piece so there's a
little bit of wiggle room here

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840
little bit of wiggle room here
 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.360
little bit of wiggle room here
you can push it in several different

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370
you can push it in several different
 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.550
you can push it in several different
ways there's no unique path to push it

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560
ways there's no unique path to push it
 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.860
ways there's no unique path to push it
but anyway if you push it you see that

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870
but anyway if you push it you see that
 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.899
but anyway if you push it you see that
it works just the same as before by the

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909
it works just the same as before by the
 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.969
it works just the same as before by the
way this was found by a guy named Gerber

very small improvement but like I said

it was sort of by thinking more

something that was carefully thought out
 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.080
something that was carefully thought out
and you know leads to some very

pretty good reasons to conjecture that
it's optimal because like I said the way

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629
it's optimal because like I said the way

it was derived is by thinking what would

it was derived is by thinking what would
it mean for sofa to be optimal in

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:38.589
it mean for sofa to be optimal in
 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:40.230
it mean for sofa to be optimal in
particular it would have to be locally

particular it would have to be locally
 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.990
particular it would have to be locally
optimal meaning you can't make a small

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000
optimal meaning you can't make a small
 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.389

find Mac the global maximum you often

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509
find Mac the global maximum you often
 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.059
find Mac the global maximum you often
start by looking for the local maximum

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069
start by looking for the local maximum
 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.889
start by looking for the local maximum
right so that's kind of the reasoning

00:05:58.889 --> 00:05:58.899
right so that's kind of the reasoning
 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:00.540
right so that's kind of the reasoning
that guided him you could say that the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550
that guided him you could say that the
 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.540
that guided him you could say that the
sofa satisfies a condition that is a

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550
sofa satisfies a condition that is a
 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.719
sofa satisfies a condition that is a
necessary condition to to be optimal so

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729
necessary condition to to be optimal so
 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.429
necessary condition to to be optimal so
and it's the only software that has been

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:08.439
and it's the only software that has been
 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.139
and it's the only software that has been
found that satisfies to this necessary

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:10.149
found that satisfies to this necessary
 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:11.519
found that satisfies to this necessary
condition so that's pretty good

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529
condition so that's pretty good
 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.589
condition so that's pretty good
indication that it might be optimal I

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599

kind of official research project I
 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.119
kind of official research project I
start tinkering with it and trying to

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:33.129
start tinkering with it and trying to
 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:34.920
start tinkering with it and trying to
wrap my head around some of the math

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930
wrap my head around some of the math
 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.139

I was reading his paper and it's kind of
 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.350

I was unable to do either of those

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310
I was unable to do either of those

what if it looks like this so you have a
 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.230
what if it looks like this so you have a

through here we rotate it we push it on
 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.170
through here we rotate it we push it on
through here and now we get stuck

of transporting it that can be a
 

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.210
of transporting it that can be a
nuisance right so then I asked myself

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:03.220
nuisance right so then I asked myself
 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.130
nuisance right so then I asked myself
the question that is the natural variant

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:08.140
the question that is the natural variant
 

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.400
the question that is the natural variant
or generalization of the original

problem and actually turned out of this

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.240
problem and actually turned out of this
 

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.580
problem and actually turned out of this
was the version of the problem that had

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:14.590
was the version of the problem that had
 

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.110
was the version of the problem that had
been thought about by other people as

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120
been thought about by other people as
 

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.610
been thought about by other people as
well and I refer to it as the

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:17.620
well and I refer to it as the
 

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.830
well and I refer to it as the
ambidextrous moving sofa problem so this

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840
ambidextrous moving sofa problem so this
 

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.710
ambidextrous moving sofa problem so this
is to consider all sofa shapes that can

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720
is to consider all sofa shapes that can
 

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.750
is to consider all sofa shapes that can
move around this corridor meaning so

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:24.760
move around this corridor meaning so
 

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.060
move around this corridor meaning so

can't turn that well then I ended up

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:43.510
can't turn that well then I ended up
 

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.720
can't turn that well then I ended up

looks very much like a realistic sofa

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:51.670
looks very much like a realistic sofa
 

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.640
looks very much like a realistic sofa
but mathematically of course it's a

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:53.650
but mathematically of course it's a
 

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:55.320
but mathematically of course it's a
well-defined shape it's perfectly good

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:55.330
well-defined shape it's perfectly good
 

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.880

okay so you push it you rotate it while

00:08:59.880 --> 00:08:59.890
okay so you push it you rotate it while
 

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.190
okay so you push it you rotate it while
pushing it and it works and of course

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200
pushing it and it works and of course
 

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.990
pushing it and it works and of course
it's going to work equally well in the

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000
it's going to work equally well in the
 

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.520
it's going to work equally well in the
other direction because it's symmetric

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.530
other direction because it's symmetric
 

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.670
other direction because it's symmetric
so it doesn't distinguish electrum right

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:08.680
so it doesn't distinguish electrum right
 

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:15.260

in fact it's subtle in many of the same

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:22.300
in fact it's subtle in many of the same
 

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.900
in fact it's subtle in many of the same
way the gerber sofa is subtle so if you

way the gerber sofa is subtle so if you
 

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.120

curves I mean there's three of them are

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:31.810
curves I mean there's three of them are
 

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.390
curves I mean there's three of them are
but that are just straight line segments

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:33.400
but that are just straight line segments
 

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.540
but that are just straight line segments
but the other 15 are just are curved and

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:36.550
but the other 15 are just are curved and
 

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.960
but the other 15 are just are curved and
in a few of them are circular arcs so

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:39.970
in a few of them are circular arcs so
 

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.430
in a few of them are circular arcs so
that's not very complicated but the

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440
that's not very complicated but the
 

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.650
that's not very complicated but the
other ones are really pretty pretty

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:43.660
other ones are really pretty pretty
 

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.960

complicated to describe curved you can

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:45.970
complicated to describe curved you can
 

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.310
complicated to describe curved you can
write down formulas for them and

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320
write down formulas for them and
 

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.380
write down formulas for them and

new sofa that I discovered and I did

00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800
new sofa that I discovered and I did
 

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.410
new sofa that I discovered and I did
that by applying the same idea that

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:01.420
that by applying the same idea that
 

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.390
that by applying the same idea that
Gerber had developed and that I sort of

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:03.400
Gerber had developed and that I sort of
 

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.120
Gerber had developed and that I sort of
developed slightly further was led to in

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.130
developed slightly further was led to in
 

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.710
developed slightly further was led to in
a certain system of equations that I had

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720
a certain system of equations that I had
 

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.050
a certain system of equations that I had
to solve and I solved it and that's

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.060
to solve and I solved it and that's
 

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.610
to solve and I solved it and that's
where the shape comes from and again it

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:11.620
where the shape comes from and again it
 

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.769
where the shape comes from and again it
turns out the shape is made of 18

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:13.779
turns out the shape is made of 18
 

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.050
turns out the shape is made of 18
