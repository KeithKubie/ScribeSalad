00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.332
In this exercise, you'll set up a diffused material. The sphere on this scene

00:00:04.332 --> 00:00:09.008
starts with a solid color, unaffected by the lighting. To give this object a

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:13.744
diffused material, the first step is to change the material from three.js's

00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:17.580
basic material to Lambert. The Lambert material has a few separate color

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.975
components. The equation that the Lambert material uses is, the color is equal

00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:28.630
to ambient plus the material color times the sum of the normal dotted with each

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.340
light source. We're going to ignore the emissive component, since in practice,

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.494
that component is rarely used. In the exercise, you'll see code like this. This

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:42.348
code sets up the solid color. By switching this material to Lambert material,

00:00:42.348 --> 00:00:47.495
the color set here is for the diffuse component. You could also explicitly set

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:51.312
this color after creation with the following code, as usual. If you want the

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:55.079
value of one channel of the color, you can access it like this, for example.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.915
This first term of the equation is the materials ambient color setting. The

00:00:58.915 --> 00:01:04.290
ambient color is called, wait for it, ambient. The ambient color is multiplied

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.498
by the ambience light color, which I've set to white. Your task is to set this

00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:13.851
ambient color to be the material color times 0.4. At the start of the exercise,

00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:18.579
you'll see this, a flat shaded sphere. When you're done, you should see

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:19.983
something like this.
