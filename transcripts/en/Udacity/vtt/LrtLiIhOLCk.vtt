Thanks, Matt, for explaining that. So, the key point here is that genes provide

00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:09.988
raw building material, but development is highly variable. It's often difficult

00:00:09.988 --> 00:00:15.001
to draw a direct link between genes and behavior. Behavior and psychological

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.225
traits are often influenced by not only one gene, but by multiple genes working

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:26.590
together to produce a trait. We call these traits, polygenic. And the traits

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.348
influenced by a single gene, we call monogenic. Virtually, every psychological

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:36.435
trait or phenomenon, like intelligence or personality, are influenced by many

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:41.023
genes. Other traits, such as sexuality or metabolism, are also influenced by

00:00:41.023 --> 00:00:46.036
multiple genes, so they're polygenic. Some monogenic traits, that are typically

00:00:46.036 --> 00:00:50.068
influenced by a single gene are lactose intolerance, blood type or even skin

00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:51.749
color.
