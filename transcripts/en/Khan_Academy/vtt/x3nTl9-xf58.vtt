00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.560
- [Instructor] Oneuli Beach
in Maui has black sand.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.390
The sand is made up of ground lava

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.960
instead of ground coral and shells.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.110
So let's think about this.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.130
So the way it read isn't
horrible and I actually like

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.160
breaking things up into
kind of smaller sentences.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.480
That tends to just be kinda my style.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.947
But it feels a little redundant.

00:00:21.947 --> 00:00:26.500
You say Oneuli or Oneuli,
I don't how the right way

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.020
to pronounce it, Beach
in Maui has black sand

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.120
and then you're saying the
sand is made up of ground lava.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.610
So it does feel like we're
just finished talking

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.680
about the sand and then
you say the sand again.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.220
So maybe a kind of a more
elegant way would just to be

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.210
kind of refer to this

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.840
and maybe not even have another sentence.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.130
So let's look at the other choices.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.040
Oneuli Beach in Maui has black sand,

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.370
with the sand being
made up of ground lava.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.870
Yeah that's, you know they're kinda going

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.570
in the direction that I'm
implying, but with the sand

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.280
being made up, it feels still redundant.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.660
You said sand and then
you're saying sand again.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.160
So the beach in Maui has
black sand, and this sand is.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.780
So once again you're using sand and sand.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.470
It's kinda the same problem
that you did up here.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.220
Sand and then you're immediately
saying the sand again.

00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:17.190
Oneuli Beach in Maui has black sand,

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.440
which is made up of ground lava

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.930
instead of ground coral and shells.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.040
Yeah this one feels nice.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.900
This one feels really good
because you're not being,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.970
you're not repeating the word sand

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.680
over and over again unnecessarily.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.470
We know you're talking about sand.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.700
Beach in Maui has black sand, which is,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.250
the second up here before we corrected it,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.180
the second sentence is referring,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.550
is referring, is talking
about this black sand.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.900
So why don't we just say, why
don't we just create a clause

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.660
where we say which is
made up of ground lava

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.270
instead of coral, instead
of ground coral and shells?

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.980
It actually makes a connection in my brain

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.140
a little bit clearer.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.570
That okay, what we're
talking about made up

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.890
of ground coral, ground lava instead

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.340
of ground coral and shells,
they're talking about,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.700
they're talking about this
black sand right over here.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.623
So I definitely like this
last choice the most.
