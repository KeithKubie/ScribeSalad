[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.637 --> 00:00:07.220
MAX CIOCIOLA: My
name is Max Ciociola.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.940
I'm the CEO and
founder of musiXmatch.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.000
My daily job is to
follow the product team

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.385
and build the best experience
we can around music and lyrics.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.730
The app is called
musiXmatch because we

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.470
match your music with lyrics.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.880
And we show you the lyrics
while you're playing the music.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.159
The experience with Google
Play so far has been amazing.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:38.050
Out of 27 million downloads,
more than 16 million downloads

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.350
are coming from
Android, Google Play.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.030
10 million monthly
active users, and that's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.920
growing faster than
any other platform.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.580
The floating lyrics experience
is a seamless integration

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.330
to the media [INAUDIBLE]
identification on Android.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.830
So this means you don't
even have to open the app.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.530
Any time you're playing a
track from any music services,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.900
you get notified instantly.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.370
And if you touch the
notification and open it,

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.350
you get, instantly, the lyrics
on overlay, synchronized

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.430
and on time with the music.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.300
And so this means
much more people

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.060
using the app for much more
time, much more sessions.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.600
It's only possible to
do that on Android.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.990
So far, we've seen
a dramatic increase

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.700
in terms of engagement.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.250
And there's been two times more
active user and even two times

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.804
more the average time
they spend inside the app.

00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:33.720
SEBASTIANO GOTTARDO:
Android sure it is really

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.960
an open system.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.970
It's a really fast,
high-rating platform.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.940
There are no limits
to the possibilities

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.190
of what you can build.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.150
For example, on musiXmatch,
we built the floating lyrics

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.970
experience.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.890
It wouldn't be possible in any
other mobile operating system.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.830
MAX CIOCIOLA: What's been very
important for us on Android

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.955
compared to any other
platform is the way

00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:56.590
we directly talk with
the users by replying

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.730
to each single review.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.600
This has being the
success on Android--

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.620
listening to the users and
having the way to provide them

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.470
back the experience they want.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.780
Chromecast, large
screen, reading lyrics,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.500
singing along with friends
in your living room,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.570
these have been driving
a lot of engagement.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.100
It's not only about
smartphone and tablets.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.600
You can get the lyrics
directly on your watch.

00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:26.680
SEBASTIANO GOTTARDO:
Building for Android TV

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.920
is great because there are
so many use cases and so

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.260
many different experience
that we can craft.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.630
And it's really exciting
for our application.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.660
MAX CIOCIOLA: The goal is
to reach 100 million people

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.480
through the technical
opportunity we

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.860
have by building the
app on Android, which

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.220
we don't have on
other platforms.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.370
