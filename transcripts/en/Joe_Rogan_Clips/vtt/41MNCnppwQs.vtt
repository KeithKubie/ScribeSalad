00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.310
The Joe Rogan experience and if I move,

2
00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:06.130
if I had more stories I could get away with it.
But it,

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.760
but once you hear the joke,
you know it's over.
Yeah.
Like it doesn't,

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.460
doesn't work again.
Yes.
Seinfeld,
he's still does old,

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:19.461
old stuff and he does really old stuff and he's done two specials of old stuff

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.260
that he's,
that like he's already put on specials.

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.150
I went and saw him at the palladium,
uh,

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.130
about a year or two ago and it was one of the worst shows I've ever seen.

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.990
Like I had like a splitting headache and I was like furious really.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
And one of my friends in other comic that I respect a lot gave him a standing

11
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.300
ovation and I was like,
are you fucking kidding me?
And he was like,

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.020
I understand why you feel the way you do,
but I just love seeing the act.

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.070
And I was like,
I couldn't believe it.

14
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.920
And then I saw Seinfeld again at cluster fest.

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.000
He was in the big outdoor stage with a bunch of like for kids completely

16
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.450
different hour and murdered like destroyed.
And it was like,

17
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:59.250
he has like corny stuff depending on what the audience,
you know,

18
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.470
is if everyone's sitting there wearing a Yamaka,

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
he's got one act and if it's a bunch of kids he's got,
he's got a cool hip act.

20
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.740
Really?
Yeah.
So you went to the Yamaka crowd?
Yeah.
Interesting.

21
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.870
What was bad about that?

22
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.560
It was a aggressively corny and just Courtney's a funny phrase like you'd be

23
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:24.230
like,
thank you for coming to the show.
I know,
you know,
we like,

24
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:26.620
or should we go to the show?
Should we go?
Should I,
should we go to the shows?

25
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.670
We get to be nuber.
How'd we get to the show?
Did we really want to go down?

26
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:33.270
I'm like,
I can't believe he's doing this right now.
But people were eating it up.

27
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:36.210
Like everyone around me was going nuts and loving it.
Uh,

28
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.810
but it was just like old man,
corny.
Oh Man.

29
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.700
Could you see Seinfeld on like a talk show and he's like mean kind of biting and

30
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.910
you're like,
oh,
this is great.
Like he's hilarious.
And I expected more of that.

31
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.870
But when I saw him in cluster fest,
I got that,
you know,
what does cluster fest?

32
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.670
It's that,
uh,
it's like,
uh,
it's the third year,
this year,

33
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.240
that festival in San Francisco.

34
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.920
It's a comedy central and Coachella put together a,
uh,
put together a thing.
