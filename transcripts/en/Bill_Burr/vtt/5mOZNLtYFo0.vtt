00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.600
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.600
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.700
July 9th,
2017 what's going on?

4
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:15.900
How are Ya?
How's it going?
Oh,

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.450
Billy's voice is coming back.
It's coming back.
You know,

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.410
I've been drinking my old throat coat tea there.
Right.
But Evans,

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.980
some fucking [inaudible] the halls menthyl lip this.

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

9
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.890
<v 1>You know,
just,
you know,
try not to yell at people in Traffic.</v>

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.150
Trying to meditate,
trying to learn about patients.

11
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.400
Oh,
that guy cut me off.
Oh,
if I get upset,
that's my fault.

12
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.560
According to to the fucking meditation guy on headspace.
It's,

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.070
he tries to chuckle through blaming me for other people's continuous.

14
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.350
That's a challenge.
That's a challenge to try to remain focused.
Yeah.

15
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.550
What kind of a fucking guy,

16
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.580
you know as you're sitting there trying to get into a zone is telling you that

17
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:04.030
things are your fault.
I know we chuckles along.

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.430
I know he's probably right.
Why?
Why?

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.520
Why should I have expectations when I'm on the highways of La that somebody

20
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:17.900
isn't going to pass me doing 90 on the right while somebody's in the left lane's

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.230
doing with 35 and I'm in the middle,
like,
you know,

22
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920
and I'm in the middle.
I'm the victim.
I'm the guy driving perfectly.

23
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:29.790
I never pass people on the right bull shit.
Every once in awhile I do.

24
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.610
I tried to be cognizant.

25
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.830
Um,
I don't even know what,
I have so much shit to talk about.
I mean,

26
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.070
I always talk,
but I mean,
I actually have shit to talk about and by the way,

27
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:49.600
shout out to that fucking lunatic who listened to my whole fucking give the oil

28
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.110
man the son.
And he took it seriously.
Like he's trying to debunk my theory,

29
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.110
<v 2>you know?
He's like,
oh goodness.
Uh,</v>

30
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.960
well did you ever take about 3.4 billion cars out there who will do both

31
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.680
<v 1>least?
That's the way I read it.</v>

32
00:02:08.681 --> 00:02:11.710
That's the way you sounded in my head and I just wrote him back,
was like,
dude,

33
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.280
how many f bombs did I drop during the priests?

34
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.910
The presentation of that theory.
Why you acting like you went to a Ted talk?

35
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.843
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.490
<v 1>Was I liked the one person you felt smarter than on the Internet.
It's like,
Oh,</v>

37
00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:30.790
here's my opportunity to be like,
oh fucking,

38
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.370
it's a classic Internet.
The way you dive into a debate.
Oh,

39
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.580
maybe try this next time.

40
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.280
<v 0>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.150
<v 1>Everybody coming at you like they have like these like just a bunch of awards up</v>

42
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:50.130
on the wall behind him,
you know,
as opposed to you,
you know what,

43
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:51.390
whatever you,
what do you got to do?
What,

44
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.960
what Hacky fucking posters do you have on your wall?

45
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.000
<v 0>Huh?
Okay.</v>

46
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.800
<v 1>What's a hacky poster for the,
for the millennials?
When was growing up,</v>

47
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:04.270
you had to have the Farrah Fawcett poster.
Um,

48
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.670
I don't know,
a Fonzie poster or some shit like that.
It was,
you know,

49
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.720
it was the 70s when I was still in the posters.
Um,

50
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.920
I don't want to talk about you.

51
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.470
What I'm doing is I'm talking to you guys on trying to get fucking comfortable

52
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.560
on this goddamn couch.
We bought one of these fucking pullout couches and Kate's,

53
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.140
we have guests.
What once every three years,

54
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.000
someone's going to stop by here for Thanksgiving.

55
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.920
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.450
<v 1>Because his fucking wife had enough with them.</v>

57
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:31.410
So instead I gotta be on this thing that's not a couch and not a bad,

58
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.600
oh,
it looks fluffy.
Oh,
we've looks comfortable,

59
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:41.340
but looks are deceiving.
So anyways,
I,

60
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.320
um,
I've been back in the writers' room.
I'm back in the Writers' room.

61
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.280
F F is for family.
We're knocking out a episode one.

62
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:54.960
We got our first table read on Thursday,
and then,
um,

63
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.660
I'm actually gonna have to do a couple of table reads over the phone because I

64
00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:01.560
got some acting work,
um,
in New York City.

65
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.410
And a spoiler alert,

66
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.270
they're rebooting sex in the city except this time they're doing it with guys.

67
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.100
And guess who gets to play?
Samantha?
I don't know.

68
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.700
What's the Cynthia Nixon,
whoever the redhead is.
All right,

69
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:20.250
I'm going to wear the short little wig.
All right?

70
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:23.430
And I'm going to be the smart girl of the fellas.
That's what's going to happen.

71
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.230
It's Kinda like that John Travolta movie,
hogs,
whatever the fuck it was called,

72
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.100
where they rode around on motorcycles.
You know,

73
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.830
I hate that those movies are hits.

74
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.420
It just reminds me of the sadness that most people live in,

75
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.580
that they can relate to that movie.
Like,
oh,

76
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:44.840
wouldn't it be awesome if we could still go out and do fun stuff?

77
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.840
I don't know why you can't.

78
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.980
I don't know why my voice still cracks at 49 years of age.

79
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.640
I don't know why you can't.
Why can't you continue to do fun shit?

80
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

81
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.950
<v 1>Two reasons.
One,
you're exaggerating your ear.</v>

82
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.220
Importance as a parent.

83
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

84
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.400
<v 1>You know what I mean?
And ability to,
that's the most important role you live.</v>

85
00:05:10.401 --> 00:05:12.140
I know,
I know it's important,

86
00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:16.730
but the fact that you think you've got to fucking be there 24 seven staring at

87
00:05:16.731 --> 00:05:19.760
your kid and you can't just sneak down the street,

88
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.970
you know,
for fucking 90 minutes during the day.
Like some,

89
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.750
what the fuck is going to happen to your kid knows not how fragile.

90
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.510
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.520
<v 1>A mindset is your family in that,</v>

92
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:37.020
God forbid you go down the street for 90 minutes,
you know,

93
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.970
figure 20 minute drive,
20 minute back,

94
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.130
you've got a shower after whatever the fuck you do,
right?

95
00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:45.210
You go to your rock climbing at one of those rock climbing gyms.
You know,

96
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.660
you take your talc out,
your little talc,
fanny pack,

97
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:50.850
whatever the fuck it is you do.
Yeah.

98
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.760
When in your head you're going up mount Everest cause that's all you got.

99
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.820
That's all you've got.

100
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.210
You can't go all the way over there and walk by dead people in sleeping bags

101
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.840
while you got a family of family baggage do.
You can't do that.
Right?

102
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.960
You can't fucking do that.
So you've got to go down the fucking rock wall.

103
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.260
Okay?

104
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.400
People either over exaggerate the importance of being a Goddamn parent or they

105
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:17.030
fucking,
they're afraid of their wife.

106
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.610
Just say,
look,
I need to go do this.

107
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.930
I'll be back in 90 minutes just and then just go do it.
What is she going to do?

108
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.760
Tackle you on the way to your car?

109
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.230
The words she can do is just be meanwhile,

110
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.540
while the where she can do is divorce you and take all your shit.
You know,

111
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:42.770
who's kidding,
who,
um,
whatever.
You know what I mean?

112
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.780
You've got to every once in a while why

113
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.210
we steal away like fucking every two,
three days.

114
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.500
You can't just go down the street and just fucking do something.
Um,

115
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.150
I'm saying this because I have a tremendous amount of guilt because,
uh,

116
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.860
I came home from work,
right?
And,
um,
you know,
I make sure I,

117
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:08.660
I don't work as much as I did last year before I became a parent before I became

118
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.550
the most important person in the world too,
for me.
Um,

119
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.440
so I,
I come home like a couple hours earlier than I did last year,

120
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.310
right?
So I can take my daughter for a walk around the block.

121
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.990
We're going to walk around.
Right?
That's what I do.
Okay.

122
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.180
See a day I'm driving to work,
no drive to work.

123
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.330
I dropped my car off to get serviced.
Right?

124
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.520
I got the old truck I'm driving now.

125
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:39.521
I can either go right to fucking work or it'd be like 10 15 minutes early or I

126
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:43.340
can swing by my house and hang with my daughter who just woke up.

127
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:46.970
So obviously no fucking brainer.
I do that.
I hang out with them for 10 minutes.

128
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:50.840
I have a great fucking time and then I leave and I drive to work feeling like a

129
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:55.730
great dad,
feeling great that I did that.
I got my priorities straight,

130
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.170
right?
I'm going to raise a,

131
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.480
a great citizen for this wonderful land that everybody else is jealous of.

132
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:06.470
That's why they don't like us around the world.

133
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.040
It has nothing to do with our foreign policy.

134
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:14.160
I'm so sick of that excuse.
Okay,
just admit it.

135
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.340
You like our blue jeans.

136
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.690
You liked that we feed cows to other cows,
right?
You like that you,
you know,

137
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.490
you like it.
You're over there in Europe,
urine,
Asia,
wherever you are,

138
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:30.020
you're all fucking jammed up.

139
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.940
Everybody had fucking driving cars on cow paths or there's like 90,000

140
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.970
skyscrapers like over in fucking Asia.
Jesus Christ.

141
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.730
Hong Kong is the most astounding fucking the,

142
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:43.280
I didn't realize there was that much concrete in the fucking world.

143
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.180
They had clusters of Manhattan skyline just parked all around that place.

144
00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:52.560
It was just never fuck it ended.
Um,

145
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.120
I would love to meet the Donald of Hong Kong talking about how he has the

146
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:00.620
greatest skyscraper ever.
Um,
but anyways,

147
00:09:00.621 --> 00:09:03.960
so I come home and I'm like,
all right,
this is great.

148
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:06.650
I still have 10 minutes this morning I'm coming on,
I'm going to get the hang,

149
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.220
go for this,
walk around the block and I walk into my house.

150
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.100
All right.
And I noticed it's hard to open the door.
I can't open it all the way.

151
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.160
And I look around the corner and what do I see?

152
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600
I see like five giant fucking boxes and then I see an even bigger box across the

153
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:31.800
room and they all say Gretsch drums on them.
My drum kit arrived.

154
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.390
I couldn't fuck it.
I was so convinced that I was like,
Murphy's law.

155
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:39.730
The second I go to New York for two fucking weeks,
uh,

156
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.460
that fucking drum kit's going to come.

157
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.030
There's going to be some nose picking jackass delivering it and he's just gonna

158
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:49.020
fucking leave it on the front porch and some asshole's going to take it.

159
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.930
Um,
but for once,
you know,
life worked out right.
I showed up.
It's there.

160
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.540
It is there.

161
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.700
I don't think I've ever been so fucking excited in my adult life ever.

162
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.990
So the drum kit came at it,
spent literally,

163
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.800
it was as far as when I saw it and I don't even think it's about 12 hours in my

164
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:18.130
house.
Boom,
right over to the roads.
So space and uh,

165
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.050
unpacked it in each block.
She on pact is a box within,
in it,
right?

166
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.940
You open that box up and then there's the drum and then this,
this little card,

167
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.410
this little card,
right?

168
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.940
Like a birthday card from Gretsch drums and it says that great Gretsch sound and

169
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:35.460
it's written in a,
that writing that millennials can't read,

170
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:36.480
whatever the fuck you call it.

171
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.920
We call it writing versus printing cursive is what they call it.

172
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.150
Maybe that's why millennials don't like it,
you know,
cause you know,
Kurt,

173
00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:50.550
I don't want to curse.
I don't want to offend anybody,
I'm going to print.
Um,

174
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.420
or maybe they were on computers all day bill and they just don't see it anymore.

175
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.820
All right,
fair enough.
Fair enough.
Whatever.

176
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.750
Maybe just an old guy bill and you just trashing younger people cause they're

177
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:02.970
younger than you and they're still in the prime of though.
Hey,
you know,

178
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.440
getting video of a point maybe.
Okay.
So,
um,

179
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.610
by load up my truck,

180
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.810
I drive over the place but 20 minutes down fucking straight.

181
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.800
And I started taking these things out of the box and um,

182
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:25.550
the absolutely fucking gorgeous is a couple of pieces of hardware that I need to

183
00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:30.080
get,
but I am going,
I'm going to tweet a fucking picture of that thing.
Um,

184
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.210
probably Monday,

185
00:11:32.211 --> 00:11:35.030
tomorrow I'm going to go over and pick up the last couple of pieces of hardware

186
00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:35.864
that I need.

187
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:41.260
They are fucking gorgeous and I don't give a shit what you are you like those

188
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.540
looks like you fucking,
I don't give a fuck what you think of the color.

189
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:47.930
I love him.
I love him.
So,
um,

190
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.010
I am,
I am just over the fucking world.

191
00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:54.740
I can't fucking believe Gabley best thing I ever did.

192
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.780
As I got rid of that old fucking Ludwig and went out and bought the kit that I

193
00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.060
wanted,
I can't fucking wait to go over there.

194
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:05.620
But now I have this crushing fucking guilt.
You know,

195
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.370
being a dangle.
You should be with your daughter right now.
It's like I can't,

196
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:11.440
and I'm fucking yelling at myself as I'm driving over there.

197
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.540
I can't fucking go to nau for fucking 90 minutes.

198
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.510
Not even 90.
I play for an hour.
20 bag 20.
Oh,

199
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.540
that's an hour and 40 fucking minutes.
Oh Shit.
That's more,

200
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.430
that's a hundred minutes of Jesus.
All right.
So I'm the worst fucking dead ever.

201
00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:30.660
What do you want for me?
Keeps me in a good mood.

202
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.880
Um,
anyways,
they came and,
um,
I'm going over there today.

203
00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.040
Uh,
my drum teacher,
he's gonna fucking tune them up.
Um,

204
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.070
I got him sound and halfway decent,
but,
uh,
I'm just a comedian.
This guy's a pro.

205
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.020
So these things are going to sound like,
fuck,

206
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.800
I don't know what they're going to sound like,
but uh,
I can't fucking wait.

207
00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:54.700
I'm so God damn excited.
And um,
I got,
oh Jesus,

208
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.870
my stomach's growling.
Yeah,
I got to fucking,
I got my symbols.

209
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.610
I got the whole fucking thing that,
you know how nicely this is,

210
00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:06.150
how nice the setup is.
I'm afraid to show it to my wife.

211
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.200
That's how nice it is.
You know that Shit,

212
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.750
you know when you do something like that and then your wife just looks at it and

213
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.660
she's just kinda quiet,
doesn't say anything and it's just,
this is all they do.

214
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:19.494
They just go,

215
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.163
<v 0>Huh.</v>

216
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.880
<v 1>And you're like,
oh fuck.
How much did that,
how much?
That noise right there.</v>

217
00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:30.860
How much is that going to cost me?
You know,
all I did was buy a set of drums.

218
00:13:30.861 --> 00:13:34.740
You know,
there's their fucking shit.
Well,
what's she going to go get?
Well,

219
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.350
I thought this would be fair.
Um,
maybe I'm just paranoid.
So anyways,

220
00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:43.500
I want to thank the Gretsch Drum Company for fucking making the greatest goddamn

221
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.030
drums.
I've have the most beautiful fucking drums I've ever seen in my life.

222
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.730
It packing them up.
So that wasn't an,
it wasn't a even even a,

223
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:55.220
a piece of dust on them.
Absolutely gorgeous.

224
00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.430
And I'm going to go over there today and I'm going to play cause I'm doing the

225
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.260
goddamn comedy jam,

226
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.700
the fucking two or three year anniversary.
I've lost track at this point.

227
00:14:04.701 --> 00:14:09.140
I think it's the two year anniversary.
What did it start in 14 or 15?

228
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.610
Maybe 14.
No.
Started in 15,

229
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.530
the two year anniversary.
And um,

230
00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.480
I'm going to be singing one song even though I can't sing and then I'm going to

231
00:14:20.481 --> 00:14:25.250
be sitting in on drums for the encore and uh,
no,
I am not bringing my kid over.

232
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.730
I'm not bringing it over cause uh,
I don't have any cases.

233
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.920
Plus I would be fucking losing my mind that something bad was gonna happen to

234
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.920
him.
So that's it.
Um,
all right.
So there you go.

235
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.600
That's what I have to look forward to.
Um,
anyways,

236
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.270
so where do,
I didn't know what to fucking start here.

237
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.010
See if I can keep my happiness and my drum kit as I talk about this next thing.

238
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:53.490
I saw two of the most fucked up things
as far as,

239
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.260
uh,
just that have you no shame,
you know,
and I'm a piece of shit.

240
00:14:58.261 --> 00:14:59.760
So for me to think that,
you know,

241
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:01.560
<v 4>yeah,</v>

242
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.830
<v 1>I was watching,
uh,
some fucking clip.</v>

243
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:07.180
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

244
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.290
<v 1>Trashing Dr Phil and I never saw this,
I didn't realize this,</v>

245
00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:13.840
I guess like a year ago or two years ago,

246
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:19.210
you know that actress Shelley Duvall,
who crushed it in the shining?
Well,

247
00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:21.520
she's in her sixties now and I guess she's having,

248
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:24.310
I don't know what she's having,
she's having some sort of mental issue.

249
00:15:24.311 --> 00:15:26.290
I don't know what it is.
Okay.

250
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.390
But she's old and she needs medical help.
That scumbag.

251
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.800
Dr Phil,
who I called it the second I saw that guy,

252
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:40.930
I called it,
I,
I,
I was at,
that guy looks like a fucking crooked cop.

253
00:15:40.931 --> 00:15:42.100
The second I saw him,
I was like,

254
00:15:42.101 --> 00:15:45.370
that guy looks like he planned a fucking gun on you.
You know,

255
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.780
he fucking shoot you over some routine fucking traffic stop.

256
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.240
And he pulled out and he'd do that to a white person.

257
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.110
That's how fucking nuts this guy is,
right?
He's not your standard,

258
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:59.860
you know,
bad cop going after minorities.
This guy would do it.

259
00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:04.180
This guy's like a c as a serial killer.
Look,
doesn't he?
Um,

260
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.273
anyways,

261
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that piece of Shit fucking interviewed Shelley Duvall and talk to her is if he

262
00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:17.881
was trying to help her and she was saying all of this stuff about how Robin

263
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.470
Williams was still alive and fucking,
you know,

264
00:16:20.471 --> 00:16:23.950
the earth is flat and just all kinds of stuff like that where it's clearly like,

265
00:16:23.951 --> 00:16:26.320
oh my God,
all right,
shut off the camera,
shut off the cameras,
come on,

266
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.490
let's not do this to her.
And he's sitting there talking to her lie.
So he like,

267
00:16:30.491 --> 00:16:31.420
he's going to try to help her.

268
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.930
Scilog you think that a Robin Williams is still alive?

269
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.650
Okay.
Um,
I think you need,
like he's,

270
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.640
he was acting the entire fucking time.

271
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.240
Like he was trying to help her rather than completely exploiting this famous

272
00:16:51.921 --> 00:16:56.900
actress who's now in like,
you know,
this mental condition.

273
00:16:56.901 --> 00:17:00.870
It's just fun.
It was,
I don't know.
How do,

274
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.830
how do you still sit down and watch that guy's fucking show?

275
00:17:03.831 --> 00:17:06.860
Fuck that guy and everything.
He's fucking connected to

276
00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.920
Jesus.
You don't have enough fucking money.
Get can't.

277
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:16.350
You don't drag enough fucking penniless people onto your fucking show.

278
00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:19.440
You don't have enough honey booboo.
People comment on your fucking show.

279
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:20.880
You got to do that.

280
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.870
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

281
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.890
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ.
But you know,</v>

282
00:17:26.891 --> 00:17:30.490
I've been meditating and I guess I'm not supposed to get upset about this.

283
00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:32.290
I should really,
you know,
I should expect it.

284
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.480
I should expect that behavior out of him.

285
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:41.670
So you're saying that you're hearing these voices in your head or site?

286
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.800
Can I don't,
I'm making up all of this shit.
I couldn't get,
I couldn't get,

287
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.090
I don't think I got

288
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.901
<v 4>20 seconds.</v>

289
00:17:50.901 --> 00:17:53.960
30 seconds and do it the second she said the Robin Williams sing and then they

290
00:17:53.961 --> 00:17:56.960
cut to him.
Go.
So your PSI and once he did that,

291
00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.880
I had to just,
I shut it off.
Shut it off.

292
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.740
Shut it off.

293
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.930
<v 1>Doctor Phil,
have you no shame.
I swear to God,</v>

294
00:18:10.931 --> 00:18:14.590
that fucking guy.
I'm trying to think what he wouldn't interview,

295
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.990
you know,
what wouldn't you like?
First of all,

296
00:18:19.991 --> 00:18:24.991
I love that people watch those shows is I as if they're like watching somebody

297
00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:27.010
trying to help somebody.
They're not,

298
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.890
you can't fix somebody in a half hour episode

299
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.070
on that time when he had that girl on that little girl on there,
the uh,
you know,

300
00:18:36.071 --> 00:18:37.390
catch me,
I sat my dad,

301
00:18:37.391 --> 00:18:41.710
that one that went fucking viral and then he has her back on again.
He's like,

302
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:46.440
people thought,
oh,
explored nurse.
Oh,
we took out the studio audience.
Yeah,

303
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.370
but you still broadcasted it.

304
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.120
I Dunno,
but you know something.
I'm a hypocritical cunt.
All right.

305
00:18:58.121 --> 00:19:03.040
Because I still watched the catch me outside.
How about that?

306
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.420
I just kept seeing it on Twitter and I was like,
I have to see what that is.

307
00:19:07.421 --> 00:19:10.210
And I'm not gonna lie to you.
I did watch it and I did enjoy it.

308
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.380
So maybe I got a knock back.
My criticisms,
criticisms,

309
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.040
why don't you just exploit people that still have their whole life ahead of them

310
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.873
?

311
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.310
<v 4>Okay.</v>

312
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:21.900
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ.
I don't know.</v>

313
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.140
Did I become the asshole by the end of that?
I don't remember.
I don't even,

314
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.970
I didn't know where the fuck that whole thing went.
Um,
so anyways,

315
00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:33.600
I was watching the f one race in Austria,

316
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.030
which by the way,
this,

317
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:40.350
there's something fucking crazy going on in Austria right now.

318
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.050
Uh,
Jewish people relax.
Um,
it's not that,
um,

319
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.380
well,
it's kind of is,
it's kind of related to that.
Then you,

320
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.370
you know,
in fucking in England,

321
00:19:56.371 --> 00:19:59.910
like all this shit is old because they,
you know,

322
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.790
that's the origins of white people.
And like,

323
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.090
she listened to a nas album and somehow we all came from Egypt,

324
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.910
which they're not really black either,
are they?
They're like Arab,

325
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.160
you know what I mean?
But he's like,
yeah,
they're African.
It's like,
all right,

326
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:19.170
well I'm German and Irish.
Do I also claim to be Italian because I'm European,

327
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:23.400
like African as Africa is a continent.
I've never been able to.

328
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:28.430
So you're say in that we all came from Egypt,

329
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.330
um,
day right now.
There's no fucking way I did.

330
00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.840
If you ever saw my fucking legs,
the,
I mean,

331
00:20:37.841 --> 00:20:42.841
I don't know how fucking long ago my ancestors left Africa or how,

332
00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:48.180
and then why we did what we sat in a fucking Snow Jacuzzi fucking 2000 years.

333
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.500
Um,
I dunno,
but I do actually,
I do believe that we all came,

334
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:55.460
we had to all come from the same fucking,
yeah.

335
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.160
<v 5>Uh,
whatever lake.
Okay.</v>

336
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.430
<v 1>Do you know,
you realize what you're listening to right now.</v>

337
00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:06.920
You're listening to a comedian trying to figure out like,

338
00:21:06.921 --> 00:21:10.100
just because he watched like 10 minutes of Neil degrasse Tyson,

339
00:21:10.101 --> 00:21:14.720
whatever fucking name is as he's falling asleep.
And I,

340
00:21:14.721 --> 00:21:18.920
if I can quote de Grasse Tyson,
whatever the fuck his first name is.

341
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.080
Uh,

342
00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.790
I believe he thinks we came from trees and I don't mean like we were living in

343
00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:30.150
trees,
like we will apes A's,
no trees.
Like,

344
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:31.660
<v 0>yeah,</v>

345
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.380
<v 1>I don't know.
I,
I,</v>

346
00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.750
that was one of those things where I was just like falling asleep.

347
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.110
It's like this fucking guy's crazy.
I fell asleep.

348
00:21:38.111 --> 00:21:39.760
I never saw the other other part of it.

349
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:41.580
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

350
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.970
<v 1>Do you know what the deal is?
You'd go over his house and he convince you of it,</v>

351
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.350
you go over and he'd have on a turtleneck with a sport coat over it,

352
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:52.370
like smoking a pipe and there'd be a fire in the fireplace,
right?

353
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.810
He'd come in and he'd have all these fucking artifacts,
you know,

354
00:21:56.811 --> 00:22:01.130
you and your wife show up as these other couples there and you just stick in.

355
00:22:01.131 --> 00:22:01.500
Like,

356
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.330
this guy's either going to fucking tell me the secrets of the world or I'm going

357
00:22:05.331 --> 00:22:09.200
to slowly lose consciousness and end up in one of those sounds of the lambs pits

358
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:10.970
trying to steal his dog.

359
00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.340
Um,
anyways,

360
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:25.710
the fuck am I talking about?
I,
uh,
oh yeah.
So I'm,
I'm why,
Oh,
why?
Oh,
why,

361
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.550
what happened in Austria?
So what's happening in Australia?

362
00:22:28.551 --> 00:22:29.960
It might already been solved.

363
00:22:29.961 --> 00:22:33.840
I just remember seeing it a little while ago because a couple of weeks ago I was

364
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:38.960
trying to see where the f one circuit was taking them next.
And uh,

365
00:22:38.961 --> 00:22:43.880
I guess in Austria,
Hitler's house still exists,

366
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.750
like where he was born,
but it's more like an apartment building.

367
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.900
So I guess all these neo Nazis go there and they do like the Neo Nazi,

368
00:22:53.901 --> 00:22:58.610
like yellow Selfie,
Yo,
instead of doing the peace sign,
I bet this,

369
00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:01.160
but you can't do like a full sieg Heil,

370
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:03.543
<v 5>you know,</v>

371
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.710
<v 1>in a selfie.
That's a hard,
your arms aren't long enough to hold it out.</v>

372
00:23:07.711 --> 00:23:09.630
So they probably do it to the side,
you know,

373
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.120
it's just from the elbow to the tip.
And then they do the duck face.

374
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.710
Right.
I guess they'd been doing that.
I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

375
00:23:19.711 --> 00:23:21.570
They're doing some shit like that in front of it.

376
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.730
And for some reason people feel that if you take that place down,

377
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.030
<v 0>yeah.</v>

378
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:33.320
<v 1>That,
you know,
those guys aren't going to continue to exist.</v>

379
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.330
Um,
I don't know about that,
but

380
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:40.180
<v 0>okay.</v>

381
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.150
<v 1>I mean,
what are people going,
you know,
I was going to be in Neo Nazi,</v>

382
00:23:43.151 --> 00:23:47.540
but de ne took down or hit lose fucking buildings,
so whatever.

383
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.370
So there's somebody that owns it and he's like,
Nah,

384
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:52.110
I'm not tearing this shit down.
And the government's like,
right.
Again,

385
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:55.610
I'm fucking say's it all right.
That's how they talk in Austria too.

386
00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.700
Everybody talks like my bed sort of fucking English accent maybe what?

387
00:24:01.031 --> 00:24:04.850
I don't,
what the fuck it is,
Davy Jones,
whatever I'm doing.
Um,

388
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.670
so there's some big battle about that and they're going to like knock it down.

389
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:10.750
But I gotta be honest with you,
as much as I'm not down with the Nazi.

390
00:24:10.751 --> 00:24:13.580
So like if I went to Austria,
I would go see that place.

391
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:14.900
<v 3>Okay.</v>

392
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.820
<v 1>I would be like the most evil baby,
Eh,</v>

393
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.370
you know the Jordan of evil babies,
you know,

394
00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.950
w fucking came home to that place right there.

395
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.160
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

396
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.510
<v 1>People walked in and saw baby Hitler and we're like,
oh,
isn't he adorable?</v>

397
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.210
Look at his eyes is a lot going on in there.

398
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:44.450
So they want to get rid of that.
Um,
I don't know.

399
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:49.370
I thought that that was fucking interesting.
Like,
ah,
this is what kills me.

400
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.380
He's like,
who fucking,

401
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.180
how do people know that that's what he grew up.

402
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.970
So many people fucking died in World War II.

403
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.090
You think that anybody that even remotely fucking remembered it,

404
00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:06.050
the old people got,
yeah,

405
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:13.190
<v 6>place right down the street.
Always had a funny look on his face.</v>

406
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.130
I never liked him.

407
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.780
<v 1>Right.
They just passed a story on,</v>

408
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.890
it's too juicy a gossip that it just [inaudible].

409
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.890
It just keeps getting passed down to the point they got to knock down this

410
00:25:29.891 --> 00:25:31.750
perfectly good fucking building.

411
00:25:31.751 --> 00:25:34.540
I guess it needs to be read down a little bit like we're doing with the baseball

412
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:36.280
stadiums over here,
and then what happens?

413
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.850
They throw it out and ends up in the ocean,

414
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.760
throw it out in the fucking Mediterranean Sea.

415
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.380
That water,
you know the water that when you go over there,

416
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:51.620
they try to say there's no sharks in them until you go on the Internet.

417
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.480
Is that go?
Yeah.
I just saw there was a couple of attacks.
I am Amy.

418
00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.770
There's been a couple of attacks,
but you know that,
you know that's,
it's rare.

419
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.330
Yeah.
Shark attacks in general.

420
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:07.880
Rare considering most of us are on the fucking land.
I Dunno.

421
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.840
I swam in the Mediterranean.
I absolutely loved it.
It was fucking life changing.

422
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:14.660
But afterwards,
when I was reading about the shark attacks,

423
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.250
there is just this fucking,

424
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.840
it's the scariest thing other than being tortured,

425
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.640
<v 3>you know,
I'm trying,
I'm trying to think,
you know,</v>

426
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.620
<v 1>of stuff equal to that.
Speaking of shark attacks,</v>

427
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:34.560
I was watching this fucking movie that starred Paul Walker.
Rest peace.

428
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:36.120
Jessica Alba,

429
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.323
<v 3>uh,</v>

430
00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.640
<v 1>Scott Conn is other woman.
Her name escapes me.
Her name escapes me.</v>

431
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:51.090
Um,
I was watching that movie and uh,
I don't know what the fuck it's called.

432
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.390
I don't know what the Fuck's calling Jessica Alba.
First of all.

433
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.580
It's so fucking beautiful.
You just,
it's like she doesn't have to do anything.

434
00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.660
He just sits there.
She looks fucking amazing,
Greg.
And uh,

435
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.530
that movie was so fucking ridiculous,
yet entertaining.

436
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:09.150
I don't think I've ever seen people hold their breath longer underwater in my

437
00:27:09.151 --> 00:27:11.610
life.
You know,

438
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.530
there's a fucking crash plane under the water.
They go down there,

439
00:27:15.531 --> 00:27:18.410
they find drugs.
This is even like a spoiler alert.

440
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.780
This is like how many fucking times they'd done the movie.

441
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.910
We're regular people find a bag of money.
Oh,
they find some fucking drugs.
Ooh.

442
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.360
Should we do I think we should weave it?
No,
you should take it,
man.

443
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.970
Did she show shot?
Right.

444
00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:34.000
And then the fucking bad guys figured out that they fucking took it somehow.

445
00:27:34.001 --> 00:27:38.050
Right.
The same classic fucking story,
right?

446
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.650
That Tom Hanks lost his wife and he meets Meg Ryan in Seattle.

447
00:27:41.651 --> 00:27:43.150
It's all the same fucking movie.

448
00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.560
Billy crystal comes in and says a couple of things.
Okay.

449
00:27:47.561 --> 00:27:52.561
Then Rom rider makes a cameo cause he's directed in the thing and then somebody

450
00:27:52.751 --> 00:27:53.620
starts shooting up,

451
00:27:53.621 --> 00:27:56.470
Tom Cruise run through in the dubs come up and as you fucking movie,

452
00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.750
it's every Hollywood movie.
Somebody is getting too old for this shit.

453
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.420
Uh,
the two people that hate each other have realized that they,
they,

454
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:09.760
they now love each other.
Uh,

455
00:28:09.761 --> 00:28:12.760
the two photos that look at each other and they realized that,
you know what,

456
00:28:12.761 --> 00:28:16.200
I respect you.
You know,
the days of thunder ending,

457
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.660
I think.
I think that covers it.
All right.
Um,
anyway,

458
00:28:22.661 --> 00:28:26.760
so we'll watch this fucking movie and at one point the bad guys have scuba gear.

459
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.650
Paul Walker and fucking Scott Conn have no scuba gear.

460
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.760
They just dive down to this fucking played.
But you like,

461
00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.280
I don't like 20 fucking feet under the water.

462
00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.590
So they fucking the scuba guys swimming or the plane looking for him.

463
00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.950
Scott Conn is sitting in one of the,

464
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.980
in the copilot seat pretending to be dead.

465
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.740
He had enough time to sit there and gather himself,
pretend to be dead,

466
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:59.880
holding his fucking breath.
Yeah.
And the scuba guy comes up and looks at him.

467
00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.200
He's like,
well I guess he's dead.

468
00:29:01.201 --> 00:29:04.830
And he keeps going and meanwhile they keep cutting the Paul Walker rest in peace

469
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:05.400
.
Right.

470
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:10.400
He keeps fucking peaking in little more than the windows and the seat is like

471
00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:11.690
five fucking minutes long.

472
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.380
Real time it feels when you just do it in the math of how long it would take to

473
00:29:15.381 --> 00:29:19.700
get down there,
how long you could fucking stay down there and he's like peaking.

474
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.520
And then he would just duck back out of the way.

475
00:29:22.521 --> 00:29:25.700
And all they had the decency to do is have like one or two little air bubbles go

476
00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:26.534
like,

477
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.493
<v 7>yeah,</v>

478
00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.800
<v 1>if I'm underwater and I don't have any fucking air,</v>

479
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.410
I mean your heart's already racing like a fucking lunatic.

480
00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.580
So eating up that oxygen,

481
00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:39.600
forget about the fact that there's these drug dealers with scuba gear that want

482
00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:42.160
to kill you and you're in shark fucking waters

483
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.660
didn't affect Paul Walker or Scott Conn in the least.

484
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.380
Somehow they were able to throw effective punches under the water I made.
It was,

485
00:29:51.381 --> 00:29:56.270
it was unbelievable the leaps of faith that you had to make in that movie yet I

486
00:29:56.271 --> 00:29:59.570
still enjoyed it,
you know,
cause every time you were like,

487
00:29:59.571 --> 00:30:04.550
this is fucking ridiculous.
They would cut to Jessica Alba just going back,

488
00:30:04.551 --> 00:30:09.140
should we keep the jogs or something?
You got,
oh my God.
It's fucking beautiful.

489
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.620
Genius.
The editing of that movie is genius.
I don't know what it's called though.

490
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.700
There's,
she has one scene.
She just leans against the door brushing your teeth.

491
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:18.470
It's like I could watch a movie of that.

492
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:23.780
Jessica Alba gets ready for bed.
Um,
so check it out.

493
00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:27.040
I think that's what that movie is.
It's called something,
something about the Di,

494
00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:30.170
they always called the deep the cove.

495
00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:35.330
I don't know what it was,
but I was just sitting there,
you know,
in my own way,

496
00:30:35.331 --> 00:30:40.130
making fun of the movie,
trying to make Nia laugh.
That was just like jazz gum.

497
00:30:40.131 --> 00:30:44.210
The,
I'm not going to wear a shirt and a z a,
you're going to wear a shirt.

498
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:50.030
Um,
which is probably childish.
That's what I do here.
Wait a second,

499
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.550
I'm going to find out the other name of that actress on that movie and can't

500
00:30:52.551 --> 00:30:56.420
name three of the four stars.
Right.
Can I hang on a second?

501
00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.750
Actually,
you know what?
Fuck that.
I'm not even going to look that up.

502
00:30:59.751 --> 00:31:03.470
I have to give somebody,
I got to give two people a shout out.
Um,

503
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:08.450
I've been watching bloodline,
I'm up to episode eight,
season three.

504
00:31:08.451 --> 00:31:11.450
I got two more episodes to go that show.

505
00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.670
That series is gut wrenching.

506
00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.340
Like I can only watch two of them and then I have to shut it off.

507
00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.860
And I,
I've never watched the show where I get so mad at the characters,

508
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.830
you know,
I guess so fucking mad.
Like why the fuck did you just do that?
Shut up,

509
00:31:27.831 --> 00:31:31.790
stop talking.
All of that stuff.
Most of it's with the Kevin Character.

510
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.273
<v 8>MMM.</v>

511
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.010
<v 1>Norbert Leo Butz,
one of like five people.</v>

512
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.820
Whoever won the best lead male Tony Award.

513
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.193
<v 8>MMM.</v>

514
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:49.560
<v 1>That which is a Broadway Oscar,
basically these amazing fucking actor.
So anyways,</v>

515
00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:53.340
there's a guy on that show who plays Eric O'bannon,

516
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:57.600
who's absolutely killing it.
His name is Jamie Mcshane.

517
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.270
And for breaking bad fans,
if you're wondering,
well,

518
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.940
how do I know that guy's face?

519
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:09.510
Why would his face fucking make,
what am I,

520
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:14.460
how do I know that guy?
If you're a breaking bad fan,
the episode,

521
00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:17.550
I'm not going to give anything away.
The one that involved the train,

522
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.280
all right.
I can't remember.

523
00:32:20.281 --> 00:32:24.460
He played the conductor or the engineer and uh,

524
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:29.520
he was a great fucking guy in his work on this show is fucking unbelievable.

525
00:32:30.911 --> 00:32:33.400
I Dunno,
I want to quote his lines,
but I want everybody,

526
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:37.210
like when they watch movies,
it's like years later.

527
00:32:37.211 --> 00:32:40.890
Do you know my dad just saw,
like I did this movie called stand up guys,

528
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.780
and he calls me up.
You like Christ fail.
Yay.
I tell you,

529
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:46.090
the night I'm sitting there,
I'm like,

530
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.940
I'm like narcoleptic I'm falling asleep on the couch.

531
00:32:48.941 --> 00:32:53.890
I wake up at three in the morning and I'm watching this movie and I'm already

532
00:32:53.891 --> 00:32:57.130
laughing cause I know it's gonna be some shit I did like fucking 10 years ago,

533
00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.720
you guys,
it's got an output.

534
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.660
Chino and Christopher Walken and I'm watching the movie

535
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:06.450
<v 9>and all of a sudden,
there you are.
I'm like,
Holy Shit.
He wakes up.
My mother goes,</v>

536
00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:07.284
Jesus Christ.

537
00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.890
<v 1>That's all my parents bed touch into my career.
They watch shit that I did.</v>

538
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.510
It goes,
there was a great movie.

539
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.060
<v 9>Well,
I'll tell you brilliant all you could do this comedy stuff,</v>

540
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:25.050
you could do the dramatic shit.
Fucking get it all figured out.

541
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.460
<v 1>That's what he said.
You could do the dramatic shit.</v>

542
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:31.780
It's my favorite thing anybody said to me all week.
Yeah,

543
00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.880
you could do the dramatic shit.
Um,

544
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.490
so anyways,
two thumbs up from my dad for a,

545
00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.590
the fucking standup guys.
Check it out if you get a chance.

546
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.340
Um,
anyways,
Jamie McShane is fucking kill everybody's killing it on.
Yeah,

547
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.840
let's show.
And then also,
uh,
John Leguizamo.

548
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:59.590
I mean,
has that guy ever been bad at anything?
He's fucking,
everything he's in.

549
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.230
He makes it better.
The guy's fucking unreal.
And

550
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:08.190
he's like creepy and hilarious all at the same time,

551
00:34:08.191 --> 00:34:10.710
which I don't know how you'd do that unless you're a fucking genius.

552
00:34:10.711 --> 00:34:14.550
Like that guy.
There's a scene.
Um,
uh,
how do I do?

553
00:34:14.551 --> 00:34:19.040
I don't want to fucking ruin it for people.
He goes in and he orders like a,

554
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.620
what we used to call like a slurpee or a frosty,
when one of those see orders,

555
00:34:22.621 --> 00:34:25.740
one of those,
it's one of the funniest fucking scenes I've seen in a long time.

556
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.210
Um,
just start watching bloodline and I'm telling you,

557
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:34.211
if you want to not have your insides get fucking all twisted up,

558
00:34:34.501 --> 00:34:39.480
just you do two episodes at a time.
Okay.
The first season,
you know,

559
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.460
it's like,
all right.
You know,
it starts a little slow.

560
00:34:41.461 --> 00:34:45.090
Like most series do because they got to establish who the characters are,

561
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:49.140
what the background is.
But once that fucking Brock starts rolling down the hill,

562
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.950
so I'm going to watch the last two episodes today.
And um,

563
00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.490
and I,
I dunno,
you know,
I'm excited to see what happens,

564
00:34:59.491 --> 00:35:03.690
but then I also have that,
like,
I almost had the balls to say this.

565
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.160
I almost had the nerve to say like,
you know,
when you finishing a great book,

566
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.263
like I read,

567
00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:14.430
I remember back in the day when I used to read in a book would end and I used to

568
00:35:14.431 --> 00:35:18.570
read a lot of that was that guy who did all the train spotting and Marabou stork

569
00:35:18.571 --> 00:35:23.070
nightmare books.
I used to read all of his shit,
urban Welsh or something.

570
00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:25.680
Then I started reading the classics.

571
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.610
I remember I read the full version of the three musketeers,
the three musketeers,

572
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.530
the count of Monte Cristo.

573
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.530
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

574
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.890
<v 1>It was like 700 something pages of the smallest fucking</v>

575
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.310
typeset or font you've ever seen in life.
And I'm like,

576
00:35:41.311 --> 00:35:45.000
I'm finishing this fucking thing.
I'm finishing this fucking thing.

577
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:47.070
And,
um,

578
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:51.270
I just would try to read like 20 pages a day.

579
00:35:51.271 --> 00:35:55.540
It took me months to finish that fucking book
and,

580
00:35:55.541 --> 00:35:58.420
but I did,
I finished it and I was like,
wow.

581
00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:02.760
Not like I spent a significant part of my life reading this book that's out.

582
00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:02.980
Let's,

583
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.870
how slow I read in all these Vietnam was always proud that I read that book.

584
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:11.200
I read it like 20 years ago
and I remember thinking like,
you know,

585
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.690
this is what people did back then.

586
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:18.190
They had time to read books like this because there wasn't the internet,

587
00:36:18.191 --> 00:36:20.080
there wasn't the TV and all that,

588
00:36:20.081 --> 00:36:22.420
and they were bored and needed to be entertained.

589
00:36:22.421 --> 00:36:25.690
So these guys would just spin these yarns that would go for six,
seven,
eight,

590
00:36:25.691 --> 00:36:29.590
900 fucking pages.
And recently,
I forget where I saw it,

591
00:36:29.591 --> 00:36:31.120
they said that Alexander Dumas,

592
00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.240
so have you say his name was getting paid by the word

593
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:38.250
and at 20 years later,
I'm like,
you fucking asshole.

594
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.540
You could have finished that shit.
Like 200 pages.

595
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.290
I read like the director's cut

596
00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:49.600
of the Count of Monte Cristo.

597
00:36:49.601 --> 00:36:53.200
I still love the book that I love a story of revenge,
you know.

598
00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.610
So anyways,
this is the time when I would usually read some fucking advertising,

599
00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.970
but I'm,
I'm doing this early

600
00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:06.790
because I got shit to do tomorrow.
Um,

601
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.980
I got shit to do tomorrow,
man.
Uh,

602
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:16.570
I've got stuff to pick up the last few pieces of hardware that I need,
um,

603
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.600
for my kit and then I'm good to go there.

604
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:27.040
Um,
let's see.
Let's see.
Let's see.
The advertising has not come in yet.

605
00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.331
So what do I do now?

606
00:37:28.331 --> 00:37:31.060
Do I just pause here and I just pretend like I have reads to do,

607
00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:35.140
how many minutes have I done?
37,
37 minutes.
You don't,

608
00:37:35.141 --> 00:37:37.410
I'm just going to continue talking about this shit.
I want to,
then I'll just do,

609
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:40.480
I'll just hit pause and when the advertising comes in I'll read it and then when

610
00:37:40.481 --> 00:37:44.470
the fucking the questions comes in,
I'll fucking read those too.

611
00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:48.200
So anyways,
um,
uh,

612
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.260
so what you're saying is

613
00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:55.670
I saw this thing,
you know,
when I shut off the f one race,

614
00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.380
which is kind of becoming my teaser here,
like people used to talk about it.

615
00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.030
Are you going to talk about it when I shut it off?
Okay,
well I'll,

616
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.570
I'll talk about the f one race.
Um,
congratulations to,

617
00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.220
uh,
I always want to say Valerie Valtteri,
whatever his fucking name is botox.

618
00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.520
He had such a good start to start that race.
They actually thought he,
uh,
he,

619
00:38:17.521 --> 00:38:21.770
she was a fucking Cheetah,
like the Indianapolis Colts there.

620
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:23.600
Um,

621
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.600
and it was a typical fucking f one race where it was the first guy to turn one

622
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.950
won the fucking race.
There was a fucking accident in the beginning,
right?

623
00:38:33.951 --> 00:38:35.000
The guy in the fucking,

624
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:39.790
the stepchild of the red bull team that that Rojas fucking team,

625
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:42.020
whatever the fuck,
whatever they are,
Jesus built grab,

626
00:38:42.021 --> 00:38:45.490
I almanac grabbed the fucking program.
If you're going to talk about it,

627
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:48.450
have a little bit of respect for the people that actually watched the Goddamn

628
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:53.450
race.
What's the name of their fucking team?
What is it?
What is it?
Wait,

629
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.850
oh,
the Toro Rosso.
Rossa that fucking lunatic.

630
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:02.050
He came in and he fucking slammed into one of the Mclaren's who then slammed

631
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:03.850
into the,
uh,
the red bull guy,

632
00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:08.590
a Max Verstappen and every one of them,
their whole fucking day was over.

633
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:12.610
That was it.
It was over.
Botox was out in front.

634
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.900
Lewis Hamilton got like a five position,
uh,
I dunno.

635
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.290
Penalty because he had to change his gearbox during qualifying.

636
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.060
So even if he was number one,

637
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:26.710
the best he could have done was in qualifying was six.
So he was started eighth,

638
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:30.860
so I guess evidently wait,
there'll be a f five swat.
Yeah.
Yeah.

639
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:34.930
So I guess he came in third anyways,
um,

640
00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:39.940
pretty uneventful race the whole fucking time,
other than,
uh,

641
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.870
than in the end.
It got great.
It got great.
But I assume some,

642
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:47.020
I actually love the shit that Lewis Hamilton was talking.

643
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:52.450
They were talking about the whole,
uh,
his,
his bullshit with the,
what's,

644
00:39:52.451 --> 00:39:56.260
what's his face there?
Sebastian Vettel.
And uh,

645
00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:01.190
he goes,
he goes,
you know what he planned to do?
He goes,
you know,

646
00:40:01.191 --> 00:40:03.760
I'll go out there and try to exploit a few of his weaknesses.

647
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.710
Just floats that out there.

648
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:11.470
So of course the report of bytes it goes,
uh,
what are some of his weaknesses?

649
00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:15.310
Would you say?
A,
his temper is,
uh,

650
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.260
is one of his weaknesses because I guess this guy a valleys,
he's,

651
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.230
he's dangerously approaching 12 penalty points.
If you get 12 penalty points,

652
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:27.310
you have to sit out a race within a calendar year that basically pet points for

653
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:31.900
being a cunt,
driving dangerously,
slamming your car in the Lewis Hamilton,

654
00:40:31.901 --> 00:40:34.420
whatever the fuck it is.
He still would,
um,

655
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.250
he's like those people on the highway out here that pass you on the right to at

656
00:40:38.251 --> 00:40:39.490
90.
He does shit like that.

657
00:40:39.491 --> 00:40:42.370
So if you accrue 12 of those points within a calendar year,

658
00:40:42.371 --> 00:40:44.860
you have to sit out a race,
which is devastating,

659
00:40:44.861 --> 00:40:47.470
especially if the guy you're going up against wins the race.

660
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:51.280
He gets 25 points is just sitting there on your ass,
you know,

661
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.250
sitting on your helmet.
So anyways,
they sent him,
he goes,

662
00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:57.400
I'm exploited a few of his weaknesses.
So the report,
it bites and goes,

663
00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.840
this is temper one of them and Lewis smiles,
it goes,
yes.

664
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.890
Which is the perfect thing you want to do with someone with the temper,
you know,

665
00:41:05.891 --> 00:41:08.890
speaking from experience because all that does is make us more mad and then we

666
00:41:08.891 --> 00:41:11.890
fuck up again.
Right.
So then the,
the uh,

667
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:17.740
the report,
it goes,
well,
what's his other weakness?

668
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.760
And Louis just smiles.
It goes,
he's like,
I'll keep that one in my pocket.

669
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:26.350
And he walked away and I was like,
ah,
that was perfect.
Perfect.

670
00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:31.360
He's in his head.
Um,
but anyways,

671
00:41:31.361 --> 00:41:34.400
like I said,
it was pretty uneventful for the whole time.
Uh,

672
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.550
everybody just cruising around the fucking track.
Um,

673
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:41.750
no big crashes after that turn one and,
uh,

674
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.730
bumped the fucking American team.

675
00:41:44.731 --> 00:41:46.900
The highest team was up front for like two laps.

676
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.900
I ain't know they gave us a little pat on the head.

677
00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:53.130
Like we spoiled able to hold off to Ferrari's for the first three laps of a 71

678
00:41:53.131 --> 00:41:54.900
lap race.
And as an American,

679
00:41:54.901 --> 00:41:59.270
I'm supposed to be excited by that is we have the Ferrari junior engine or

680
00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:03.980
whatever the fuck they give us.
Um,
so anyways,
the uh,

681
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.700
the final like six laps,
Rick,
uh,
um,

682
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.253
<v 0>okay.</v>

683
00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.230
<v 1>Lewis Hamilton was right on fucking Ricardo's ass.</v>

684
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.420
The tires are all fucking chewed up.

685
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.750
I was convinced Hamilton was going to catch him.
Ricardo was able to hold off,

686
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.960
hold them off,
and then,
uh,
Sebastian Vettel was right on.

687
00:42:19.961 --> 00:42:24.340
Botox is asked once again,
no passes were made,
but it was still fucking exciting.

688
00:42:24.341 --> 00:42:27.670
The last six laps of the race was great and that track was fucking cool as hell.

689
00:42:27.671 --> 00:42:31.320
Man,
I love how it starts like uphill.

690
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.410
That bizarre.
I don't mind missing a track laid out like that.
And it's in the,
uh,

691
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.630
the Austrian Alps.

692
00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:45.310
How do you not fucking go to that swing?
Buy Hitler's house.

693
00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:49.060
You go to the f one race and then you get yourself some bean or Schnitzel.

694
00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:52.150
How do you not,
how do you not do that fucking Trifecta?

695
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.780
That's a bucket list thing right there before they tear it down.

696
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.950
I mean,
I was always a fan of the Allmond always.
All those horror movies,

697
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:05.240
those demon babies.

698
00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:09.590
Do you not fucking go there and just be like,

699
00:43:09.591 --> 00:43:11.510
he fucking learned how to walk in that house.

700
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:14.920
It's just fascinating.

701
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.910
Like the first time he lost his temper was in that house.

702
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.650
First Time he realized he had an,
he could draw.

703
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.180
I don't know how long you fucking stayed there.
It's just eerie.

704
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.120
You know what I mean?
Look,
if universal studios,

705
00:43:32.121 --> 00:43:35.570
if you can take the tour over there and they still have the fucking,
uh,

706
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:40.550
the psycho house,
you know,
because everyone just wants to look at that.

707
00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:44.390
This is a real life.
Fucking psycho.

708
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.100
Hey and be glorified.
I'm not glorifying it.

709
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:53.630
It's the same reason why I want to see a great white shark from a boat.

710
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:55.833
<v 0>You know,</v>

711
00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.690
<v 1>I don't fucking,
this is so,
and as much as everybody fucking bitches,</v>

712
00:43:59.691 --> 00:44:01.490
there's no way.
If you walk down the street,
you could,

713
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:04.520
you couldn't fucking look at it.
You couldn't feel that,

714
00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:09.050
that fucking vibe of evil.
We're coming off the side of the fucking house.

715
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.490
Oh,
they'd probably right.
They should probably take the fucking thing down,

716
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.983
<v 0>you know?</v>

717
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.110
<v 1>All right,
well why am I talking about Hitler's house?</v>

718
00:44:20.111 --> 00:44:23.050
Can somebody explain it to me?
So anyways,
the race ends,

719
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:28.150
I shut it off at coming here to go do the podcast.
And um,

720
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:33.810
I ended up,
uh,
as when I shut off the race,
this is woman was short hair,

721
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.720
you know,
she's got the fucking,
uh,
the hit,

722
00:44:37.721 --> 00:44:40.870
same haircut is at one who's the girl come in at.

723
00:44:40.871 --> 00:44:44.800
So you better get the party started.
Uh,
bear with

724
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.880
<v 0>amber,
that pink</v>

725
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:50.220
<v 1>right?</v>

726
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.490
He had the pink hair cut and she's sitting there talking to this guy and I'm

727
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:56.010
looking at it like,
this looks like a fucking therapy session.

728
00:44:56.011 --> 00:44:59.790
What's going on here?
And the show was called the therapist

729
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:05.200
and they then,
and I'm,
and she's sitting there,
it's Katy Perry

730
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.480
<v 0>talking</v>

731
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.170
<v 1>I about herself and like,
yeah,</v>

732
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.500
<v 10>you know,
some people like me,</v>

733
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:17.501
so people go solving all like hair long hair,

734
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.730
<v 1>God.
And I'm just sitting there thinking,
why are you doing this</v>

735
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.350
sweetheart?
You should do this in private.

736
00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:29.980
Why would you put all this shit out of it?
Is she going nuts

737
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.780
but as much you know her,
I felt bad for cause it's just like you,

738
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:36.620
she's fucking obviously going through some shit,

739
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:40.250
but [inaudible] fucking therapist guy,

740
00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.100
they got this whole intro and he's like walking through doors and shit.

741
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.030
Like I'm just say,
we'd say,
and I'm a licensed fucking therapist.

742
00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.960
You're a fucking money grubbing.
Can't.

743
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:53.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

744
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.440
<v 1>Acting like you try to help Katy Perry Adis shut it off.</v>

745
00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.600
I had to shut it off.
I rewound it cause I had to find the,
the,

746
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:03.910
the name of the fucking show and then I had the fucking walk away.

747
00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:09.730
Jesus Christ.
Katy Perry,
if you need therapy,
go to a fucking therapist.

748
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:14.050
Close the fucking door.
Havers shut off her phone

749
00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:19.740
then get,
get it out.
And I hope you get better.
You don't fucking do it on TV.

750
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:21.203
<v 0>Okay.</v>

751
00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:24.250
<v 1>Do you realize what you're doing?</v>

752
00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:25.880
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

753
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.880
<v 1>You're letting the world know what hurts you and you're on the Internet.</v>

754
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.410
Are you out of your fucking mind?

755
00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:37.140
These are my weaknesses and every fucking asshole on the internet,

756
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:41.500
it's going to be coming after you.
It's a bad move.

757
00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:45.850
That is not a good move and like debts,
licensed therapist air quote,

758
00:46:45.851 --> 00:46:46.750
fucking that guy.

759
00:46:46.751 --> 00:46:50.650
That guy should be disbarred that you would do fucking exploit something like

760
00:46:50.651 --> 00:46:52.510
that.
But you know what,
the end of the day,

761
00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:54.250
I mean it was probably her people's idea.

762
00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.560
She greenlit it and then they had to find,

763
00:46:56.561 --> 00:47:01.561
they had a find a therapist low enough on the rung with enough TV presence that

764
00:47:02.021 --> 00:47:04.300
would fucking agree to do that Gig.

765
00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:06.520
I'm trying to think of this standup equivalent to that.

766
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.210
A televised,
you know what it would be?

767
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.780
It'd be like those fucking gigs at Beyonce and all those guys do for like

768
00:47:13.781 --> 00:47:16.180
fucking New Year's.
They go out,

769
00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.810
they sneak out of the country and they'd go do like fuck.

770
00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:24.550
And they sing bootylicious for like 5 million bucks to the son of a fucking

771
00:47:24.551 --> 00:47:28.570
dictator.
You don't want some country that were at odds with,

772
00:47:28.571 --> 00:47:30.940
I guess like the TV version of it.
Maybe.

773
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:34.210
I don't know who the fuck knows speaking and all that shit.

774
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:37.570
Did you see when Trump went to Russia,
any bed flicking Vladimir Putin?

775
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.180
Do you see that?
That was fucking hilarious.
You know what?

776
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:45.670
That's when they fucking was shooting the shit.
It reminded me of Jimmy,
the gent,

777
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:50.710
Nafta,
the left Swansea,
high solver.
The fuck you said when Trump walked in,

778
00:47:50.711 --> 00:47:54.520
Putin should have been like Camilyo come a Yo

779
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.370
love swans.
Loved.

780
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:05.390
How do you say l u f t h Lufthansa Heist

781
00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:11.950
model.
I don't fucking know.
Um,
anyways.
Oh,
by the way,

782
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:16.690
uh,
rest in peace.
Great drama.
Passed away about four days ago.
Jonathon Blackwell,

783
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.440
who uh,
absolutely killed it with prince,

784
00:48:20.441 --> 00:48:24.430
new power generation playboy on Justin Timberlake's big,
I think his first album.

785
00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:28.300
Uh,
that tour,
was it?
Blood sugar,
sex magic?

786
00:48:28.301 --> 00:48:30.630
I can't remember what sexy back tour

787
00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:35.770
I'm stomping on a disco ball,
whatever the fuck it was called.
I can't,
you know,

788
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:41.650
I actually own the album too.
That's the sad thing.
Wham,
Wham,

789
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.910
wham,
wham,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam,

790
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:50.710
Bam are bringing sexy back.
Right.

791
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:55.500
And what's that other one?
The other one,

792
00:48:55.501 --> 00:49:00.290
I always get the words wrong and Neil always laugh.
What does that one,

793
00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.250
uh,
oh,

794
00:49:05.251 --> 00:49:10.251
I always think he says dirty bitch that I let you with me if you misbehave.

795
00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.130
I would say he's going dirty bitch.
And he always laughs God,

796
00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.830
he's not saying dirty bitch.

797
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:24.120
Yeah.
Like,
well,
what's he saying?
She goes a dirty bay or something like that,

798
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:28.050
you know,
is the hardest one to fucking understand.
Is that a Rihanna?

799
00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.110
She got the accent and she doesn't,
uh,

800
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:37.030
she says like the first three letters of every word at the end of a sentence.

801
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.850
What's,
what's our new fuck it hit we,
you know,
me and Neil will,

802
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.230
I forget what the fuck we were going,
but we add on like pop radio,
right?

803
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:49.440
I'm gonna pop stations there.
Is that what it's called?
Top 40.

804
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.851
And it was hilarious.

805
00:49:50.851 --> 00:49:54.630
Like they played the same 10 songs on the way there and the same 10 songs on the

806
00:49:54.631 --> 00:49:59.370
way back.
Um,
isn't that,
and then a lag.
Lag.
Lag.

807
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:03.150
Lag.
Lag.
It wasn't that one,
but it was the same thing.

808
00:50:03.151 --> 00:50:06.720
It began with a w what?
Ours is going to fucking drive me nuts.

809
00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:11.700
I gotta look it up.
All right,
Katie fucking Perry.
Katy Perry.

810
00:50:11.701 --> 00:50:15.870
What a show.

813
00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:28.693
My Ella,

Slowly loading.</v>

816
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.090
I'm running out of shit to talk about.

817
00:50:39.091 --> 00:50:41.070
I might have to fucking hit pause here at this point.

818
00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:46.000
Maybe I can look up the song.
Oh yeah,

819
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:51.000
the devil did a work.
Work,

No,
it's not that one.
She has a lot of WWE songs.

820
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:57.230
Don't stop the music.
Work love on the brain

821
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:01.580
diamonds umbrella.
We found love.

822
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:09.020
Bitch better have my money.
Okay,

Down.

823
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:13.790
All right.
This is,
I'm just,
I'm too fucking old to be looking at this shit.

824
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.450
You know what I mean?
God bless you.
God bless.
She hits.
Okay.

825
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.360
I'm going to fucking shoot.
I like being an old guy and you know something.

826
00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:21.500
When you,
when you're fucking old guy,

827
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.780
you got to know when you're too old to be fucking looking at something.

828
00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:27.920
You just walk away.
You know?
Maybe you see like those fucking,

829
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.670
I don't understand why guys over 40 is take those fucking testosterone pills.

830
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:37.070
It's like you finally clear in your head.
You know what I mean?

831
00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.800
You finally getting out of the fucking bars.

832
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:45.730
You finally really realizing how much more sustained happiness you can get out

833
00:51:46.161 --> 00:51:49.280
of order in a brand new drum kit and set in the fucking thing up.

834
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.200
Then the fucking colossal waste of time that chasing pussy is,

835
00:51:55.190 --> 00:52:00.080
you know,
you see that corner,
you,
you're a guy over 40 try.
Was it new?

836
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:01.813
Genics

837
00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.150
they act like your testosterone dipping is a bad thing.

838
00:52:06.151 --> 00:52:09.030
It's a fucking great thing.
The clouds are finally partic.

839
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.130
Why would you want to take a bottle of that be 18 forever fucking juice?

840
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:19.070
Jesus Christ.
Do you want to go back into the sports bar?

841
00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:24.080
Shorten up that the fucking sporty slash horror themed waitresses,

842

845
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.740
Why would you want to take a fucking pill that's gonna make you think that

846
00:52:36.741 --> 00:52:40.970
that's a good option.
I'm going to go back into that.

850
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:56.180
You got your fuck.

You still get your skinny highschool legs cause you just boozing it up.

852
00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:00.410
You've got that goddamn beer belly.

853
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:04.610
Now you're going to fucking throw some 18 year old fucking testosterone down

854
00:53:04.611 --> 00:53:08.270
your throat as you're walking up there.
You know,

855
00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.230
you gotta die your goatee before you go down there.

856
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:13.580
And what the fuck are you doing?

857
00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:23.720
Just let it go,
man.
Fuck it.
Jesus Christ.

858
00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.290
I will never fucking understand this.

859
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:29.190
I don't want to go back into that fucking world.
Granted,

860
00:53:29.191 --> 00:53:31.410
I experienced it with an orange Afro.
I mean,

861
00:53:31.411 --> 00:53:34.350
maybe you guys had a better time than I did.
I don't fucking know.

862
00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.680
I don't pretend to know.
Um,

863
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.940
anyways,
uh,
I think this is it.
I don't know,
like go any fucking further year.

864
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:49.010
If I talked about everything that I wanted to talk about.
I believe I have,
oh,

865
00:53:49.011 --> 00:53:53.930
coming up this weekend,
me and Dean del Rey,
host of the,
uh,

866
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:58.960
let there be talk podcast are going to be at the Fountain Street church in Grand

867
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.850
Rapids,
Michigan.
This is one of my favorite fucking places to play.

868
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:10.280
It's a a still functioning nondenominational church.

869
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.360
All right.
Which is why they let comedians go in there.

870
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:18.860
If I ever decide to get back into religion,
um,

871
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.510
I think I could,
you know what?

872
00:54:20.511 --> 00:54:23.300
I bet I couldn't go to a non denomination one either cause they'd be so busy

873
00:54:23.301 --> 00:54:26.120
patting themselves on the back about how open minded they are.

874
00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:29.200
Just whatever you want to do.
If you want to stand,

875
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:32.540
you want a deal and I can have all the Catholic in me going,

876
00:54:32.541 --> 00:54:35.690
there's gotta be some sort of structure.
Um,

877
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:39.310
what is this a fucking drum circle anyways,

878
00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:44.450
we're doing two shows Friday,
I think one Saturday or the other way around.

879
00:54:44.451 --> 00:54:46.820
All I know is a third.
The third show is just been added.

880
00:54:46.821 --> 00:54:48.310
There's still some tickets left.

881
00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.990

882
00:54:50.991 --> 00:54:52.730
So thank you to everybody that's showing up.

883
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.290
I can't wait to go up there and run my fucking mouth standing on an altar.

884
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:00.120
You gotta go to this.
If you don't see me,

885
00:55:00.121 --> 00:55:04.050
you have to see a show at this place just to see the fucking venue that it has.

886
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:08.670
An upper deck,
horseshoe upper deck that runs from one side of the altar,

887
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:12.380
right down the hall,
all dump down the side of the fucking,
you know,
the,
the,

888
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:16.170
the windows there to the back of the church and then comes right back up again

889
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:18.360
like a horseshoe.
Right.

890
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:22.800
Like what they still call Ohio State stadium even though they enclosed it.

891
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:28.380
Um,
and like the altar is like the new stands that they stuck in there when they

892
00:55:28.381 --> 00:55:30.300
enclosed it.
Um,

893
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.960
so I'll be up there and then I go to New York to do the acting gig.

My Baby Mama needs a weave.

1121
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:20.900

and then,

1122
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:25.070
and then there's another scene where there's somehow explaining,
I dunno,

1123
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.760
pirates or some kind of behave,
Ian Legend that you know,

1124
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.910
Paul Walker is explaining and then,
um,
what's his name?

1125
01:10:31.911 --> 01:10:34.910
Scott Conn is looking at pictures and he's like,
Scott Love Scott.

1126
01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.410
So this is snoop dog here and these are all his hose and this is pimp cup and

1127
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:42.560
Blah Blah Blah.
And it's like,
really?
He used to be in a rap group.

1128
01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:43.820
He knows the terminology.

1129
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:48.290
You know why c eight mile that was based on him and it was based on m and M and

1130
01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:51.620
I'm not even one of those white guys.
Scott Conn in a rap group.

1131
01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:56.560
Like I'm just not even no less.
I don't even want to talk about that.
Scotty cone.

1132
01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.820
Oh,
did he scratched to that?
Right.

1133
01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:06.040
And he came out.
Oh my,
yeah.
Got,

1134
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:10.190
he goes ridiculous.
The one for you.

1135
01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:12.530
One thing that I liked about that movie,

1136
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:16.680
I can't believe we actually watched the whole thing,
but there was a scene,

1137
01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:21.270
I enjoyed it.
It was.
So Scott Kahn and Paul Walker are talking about the like,

1138
01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:22.510
what are we going to do man?

1139
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:27.250
And the underwater holding their breath or they're above hunching sharks on land

1140
01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.010
and it's daytime as they're talking and the camera slowly pans around them like

1141
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:36.180
really slow and by the time it's done the son has said and it was a really

1142
01:11:36.181 --> 01:11:39.660
beautiful shot.
Other than that,
that movie you can go kick rocks,

1143
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:40.883
<v 1>right?</v>

1144
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:45.090
Oh that's cause you're holding the baby kick rocks can kick rocks or the f word

1145
01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:49.860
in front of her.
We really try not to do that.
No,
I mean,

1146
01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.470
<v 9>but that movie was ridiculous and I really upset at that line.</v>

1147
01:11:54.471 --> 01:11:55.580
It still bothers me.

1148
01:11:56.890 --> 01:11:57.080
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1149
01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:02.030
<v 9>I gotta go.
My Baby Mama needs new weeds.
They want under water for 15 minutes.</v>

1150
01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:05.180
Like I can suspend my disbelief on that.

1151
01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:07.370
That wasn't something that I can just say it.
I mean if,

1152
01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:10.130
if they're going to handle why even making excuses for this,

1153
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.590
that line in that movie,
because am,
why are you making excuses?

1154
01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.230
I meditate now and what I've learned to do with anything,

1155
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:19.640
I'm learning to have patients,
patients with what?
With just people's behavior.

1156
01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:23.030
While you lucky that you have that ability to do that,

1157
01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:25.040
I was very offended and annoyance

1158
01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:29.160
<v 1>by that.
No,
I'm just saying that like if you give them that line,</v>

1159
01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:31.670
not to me.
I'm white.
What?

1160
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:33.520
<v 9>I'm not asking about you as a way</v>

1161
01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:38.240
[inaudible] my head did offend you.
I'm just saying I didn't get it.

1162
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:39.620
I'm telling you what it is,

1163
01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:42.290
so why are you sending your acting brand new like you don't understand what I'm

1164
01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:47.040
talking about?
God,
they,
I'm just trying to be fit.
Some pointed that's not funny.

1165
01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:50.800
Well,
I don't care about it being funny.
I know it's a ridiculous fucking lie,

1166
01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:54.250
but I got to keep the comedy going.
This isn't counterpoint coin coin.
Oh,

1167
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:58.940
counterpoint.
What is it that we of point you got to more for a host?
Yeah.

1168
01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:02.450
Keep the funny for the love of God.
Please.
Let's not lose the funny,

1169
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:06.050
God forbid you actually agree with me on some shit and try Nazi you.

1170
01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.860
You pitch this episode to be your white people for me.
Good Lord.
I got it.

1171
01:13:09.861 --> 01:13:11.660
It's fucking offensive.
I'm agreeing with you.

1172
01:13:11.661 --> 01:13:15.650
I'm trying to fucking keep it funny on some level.
Fine.
I'm fine.

1173
01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.750
I'm just playing the ignorant white guy.
You don't have to play at anything.

1174
01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:25.600
Nia.
I'm the one who said the line first.
I was,

1175
01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:26.500
I was laying there I go,

1176
01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:30.950
<v 1>I gotta get my baby Mama.
Oh,
we've terrible.
It's terrible.</v>

1177
01:13:30.951 --> 01:13:33.230
Writing and making the whole thing.
What the fuck?
It's offensive.

1178
01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:36.520
It's fucking people jumping or they're walking around all naked.
Look good.

1179
01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.390
Holding their breath for fucking four hours.

1180
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:42.470
Do you honestly think that that they're gonna have Maya Angelou or was one of

1181
01:13:42.471 --> 01:13:47.360
those people and then fucking hedge?
Is that the right reference?
I'm sure.

1182
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:52.430
All right.
What else you got?
Um,
I dunno.
Okay.
Norway.
When,
when are you on this?

1183
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:54.500
Appalled by the way.
You know what a stupid is?

1184
01:13:54.501 --> 01:13:58.100
When I was imitating Jessica Alba doing lines,
I'm like,
eh,
she's dumb.

1185
01:13:58.101 --> 01:14:01.280
She's going to billion dollar fucking company.
Where do I get off saying that?

1186
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:06.870
Although my podcast is doing pretty well.
Go on Itunes,
right?
Norway,
when are you

1187
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:11.040
<v 9>coming to Norway,
man,
we love it.
We would love it and we,</v>

1188
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.070
before we end

1189
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.050
<v 1>up like Sweden,
have a nice weekend and go fuck yourself now you man,</v>

1190
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:20.530
we traveled.
You know what that means before we end up like Sweden?
Yeah.

1191
01:14:20.531 --> 01:14:21.430
You know what that means?

1192
01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:25.210
I don't know what you don't remember when they said Sweden.
Sweden used to,

1193
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.220
you know,
Sweden remained neutral during World War II.
Okay,
okay.

1194
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.610
And they looked the other way and they allowed the Nazis to use their train

1195
01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:37.510
system to go into Norway and fuck Norway up.
Is that what's going to happen?

1196
01:14:37.511 --> 01:14:39.220
To know?
Oh,
okay.

1197
01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.230
Norway had right before the war regained the lower third of their company

1198
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:47.170
country from Sweden.
As soon as like whatever,

1199
01:14:47.171 --> 01:14:51.040
we didn't want it anyways or whatever.
Right.
So then they,
during World War Two,

1200
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:53.890
Sweden remained neutral.
Okay.

1201
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.130
Let the Nazis go through the Nazis fucked up.
Norway.

1202
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.460
Sweden became a power after World War II,

1203
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.610
just simply for the fact that their cities were still standing and they could

1204
01:15:03.611 --> 01:15:07.270
function as function in like a,
in a business capacity.
Jesus,

1205
01:15:07.271 --> 01:15:11.770
I'm using some pretty impressive words for me,
right.
So long story short,

1206
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:14.650
Norway ends up finding in no way didn't offer any,
I mean,

1207
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:17.740
Sweden didn't offer in Norway,
are you helping me and stuff.
Long story short,
no.

1208
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:20.110
Ended up discovering all this oil in that land that they got back,

1209
01:15:20.111 --> 01:15:24.820
I believe or northern that,
oh,
that now they make it so much money over there.

1210
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:29.260
Nobody wants to do like lower level jobs.
So Swedes come in and do the jobs.

1211
01:15:29.261 --> 01:15:32.890
Norwegians don't want to do.
You don't remember the Norwegian saying,
Oh,

1212
01:15:32.891 --> 01:15:36.490
the Swedish people saying,
yeah,
we're like
the Mexicans Fund for Norwegians.

1213
01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.180
<v 9>Wow.
Okay.
You don't remember that?
No,
I don't remember that at all.</v>

1214
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:43.820
When would I have,
when was that?
When the guy said it to us,

1215
01:15:43.821 --> 01:15:47.750
we flied thought it wouldn't the Norwegian guy,
when we were in Norway,

1216
01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.600
I gotta be honest with you and you're probably going to jump all over me.

1217
01:15:50.601 --> 01:15:53.800
But when we did Norway,
Finland and sweet,

1218
01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:57.410
like I honestly can't,
I don't know.

1219
01:15:57.411 --> 01:16:01.970
I don't recall which was which country?
Cause it looked the same.
You realize?

1220
01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:06.590
Do you realize?
No,
don't try to cover your tracks.
Don't try to cover your tracks.

1221
01:16:06.591 --> 01:16:11.450
Do you realize if you took me to Rwanda,
uh,
fucking a Honda.

1222
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:14.660
Ecuador.
And what is the other one over there?

1223
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:18.880
You took me three African countries,
right?
The Gambia,
Gambia Fucker,

1224
01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.420
South Africa.
And then we went to Rwanda as I gay.
You know,
to be honest with Ya.

1225
01:16:23.421 --> 01:16:25.850
Ya,
Ya.
I know what you say.
There's a bunch of blue eyed,

1226
01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.370
blonde haired white people.
It looked the same.
Norway,

1227
01:16:28.371 --> 01:16:31.580
Finland and what was the other one we went to?
What was the other one?

1228
01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:36.020
I wouldn't go.
I let it go.
You wish a plane ticket cost me sweet and I love cars.

1229
01:16:36.021 --> 01:16:38.750
I love Stockholm.
But what were the other three?
I don't know.

1230
01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:42.160
Why don't you go get a fucking globe and spin it around a couple of times?

1231
01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:45.530
Figure it out.
I can't remember which country was which.

1232
01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.820
I always wanted to travel as a little girl.
Hey,

1233
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:52.730
here's three was asked where we had that crazy meal that like 10 course meal,

1234
01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:57.140
like the never ending with the cheese at the end with that Norway.
Oh,

1235
01:16:57.350 --> 01:17:01.160
why don't you just move out to Calabasas and knock on the Kardashians door right

1236
01:17:01.161 --> 01:17:03.320
now?
Why don't you just do that and just fit in with them?

1237
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:07.190
What does anything that I'm saying have to do with the card has plos and

1238
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.370
we the cheese.

1239
01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:12.680
<v 1>Remember what Finland versus Norway,</v>

1240
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:16.340
like what we did because they were geographically very similar.
All right.

1241
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:16.971
I'm going to have to do,

1242
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:21.650
I'm going to have to remind you of these places in a way that your little travel

1243
01:17:21.651 --> 01:17:25.520
brain little travel can remember.
Okay.
All right.

1244
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:30.050
Finland was where you've got the coat?
Yes.
Okay.
I'm okay now.

1245
01:17:30.051 --> 01:17:34.820
You remember that?
Norway's what?
You got the cheese?
Yep.
Okay,

1246
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:38.090
great.
Stockholm you loved,
so you remember that.
There you go.

1247
01:17:38.091 --> 01:17:42.260
That's the difference.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
so Finland is the coat country.
Got It.

1248
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:46.940
Oslo's the cheese.
The meal.
Yeah.
We had that 200 course meal.

1249
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:50.570
Yeah.
And then there was that,
the funkiest cheese ever and I was eating it.

1250
01:17:50.571 --> 01:17:53.180
You were telling me to stop and my eyes were watering and yeah,

1251
01:17:53.181 --> 01:17:56.720
before you told me to stop,
the more I had to eat it because it was funny to me.

1252
01:17:57.550 --> 01:18:00.410
All right.
It was cold.
I remember it being cold.
Yeah.

1253
01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.173
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1254
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:07.430
<v 1>All right.
Paris was the place that had the arch like in Washington Square Park.</v>

1255
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:12.560
Yes.
I remember parents restaurant doesn't accept cash,

1256
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:17.030
dear.
Oh dear.
Billy.
Red tits restaurant.
And somebody said this is backwards,

1257
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.320
so it's restaurant doesn't accept cash dear while.
One word,
Billy red tits.

1258
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:24.000
I think it's Billy read tits restaurant doesn't s dear Billy red tents.

1259
01:18:24.001 --> 01:18:27.980
All right.
The other day I went to a very trended solid place in Hollywood.

1260
01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:31.700
Didn't when I went to,
when I say sorry,
trended.
Oh,

1261
01:18:31.701 --> 01:18:35.660
very trendy salad place in Hollywood and when I went to pay,

1262
01:18:35.661 --> 01:18:40.130
I held out a $20 bill and the cashier said,
sorry,
we don't accept cash.

1263
01:18:40.131 --> 01:18:43.280
That's the most ridiculous thing ever.
Have you heard this before?
Yeah.

1264
01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.060
I'm like trains,
planes and shit.
Planes.
I don't think they do.

1265
01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:50.840
What do you think?
Uh,
we have that working towards a cashless society.

1266
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.660
We're all gonna be microchipped and that's going to be it.

1267
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:56.720
And right when they gained control of all human society,

1268
01:18:56.721 --> 01:19:00.200
the robots are gonna take over.
All right.
Lastly,

1269
01:19:00.201 --> 01:19:02.000
but not leastly the last question here.

1270
01:19:02.001 --> 01:19:05.060
Girlfriend wants me to call her daddy during sex.

1271
01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.820
That isn't new one.
Uh,
hey bill.

1272
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:11.570
I just started seeing this girl we'd been dating for about two to three weeks.

1273
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:13.310
She smack attractive.

1274
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:17.810
Everybody says this career driven and generally speaking has her shit together.

1275
01:19:17.811 --> 01:19:19.310
She seems like a girl.

1276
01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:22.910
She seems like a girl that just seems like a girl as far as I could tell.

1277
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:25.640
She got all the lady parts that I could see myself having a longterm

1278
01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:29.420
relationship with.
However,
recently when we were having sex,
sex,

1279
01:19:29.421 --> 01:19:32.390
she insisted on calling me daddy.

1280
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:39.220
I've never been the type to talk dirty all.
Oh,
I see.
Okay.
I get it.

1281
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:45.930
Oh,
okay.
I thought it was the other way around.
I thought she wanted you to.

1282
01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:51.010
Okay.
Okay.
Okay,
I see now.
All right,
well that's pretty pedestrian.
Okay.
However,

1283
01:19:51.011 --> 01:19:52.430
recently about Predella de,

1284
01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:56.140
I've never been the type to talk dirty because it seems kind of silly and takes

1285
01:19:56.141 --> 01:19:56.861
me out of the moment.
Yeah,

1286
01:19:56.861 --> 01:19:59.920
you guys are not compatible if she's gonna want to sale is filthy crazy over the

1287
01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:03.970
top shit and you're going to be like,
oh,
oh,

1288
01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.680
like in your fucking ci,
whatever the fuck you,
you know,

1289
01:20:07.681 --> 01:20:10.320
which neither one of you are wrong.
I don't know if you're compatible here.

1290
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.450
When she started calling me Daddy,

1291
01:20:12.451 --> 01:20:16.080
I was caught off guard but tried to play through it because I didn't want to

1292
01:20:16.081 --> 01:20:18.600
make her feel weird when you're a good person then all right.

1293
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:21.780
Now even attempted to throw in my own lines like,
oh yeah,
you like that.

1294
01:20:21.781 --> 01:20:23.670
But afterwards,
after the words left my mouth,

1295
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:27.840
I had to try not to laugh because it felt like I was in a cheesy porno and it

1296
01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:32.430
started to affect my performance.
Um,
after what she asked me how I felt about it,

1297
01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:34.200
and I just brushed it off like it wasn't a problem.

1298
01:20:34.201 --> 01:20:37.140
But on the inside I was starting to have my doubts and trying to paint a picture

1299
01:20:37.141 --> 01:20:41.400
without giving too much detail because I know you get all the Weirdos,

1300
01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:45.070
you get all weirded out by shit.
But I don't know.

1301
01:20:45.071 --> 01:20:48.040
I don't get weeded out by a lot of shit.
Uh,

1302
01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.320
is it weird that she likes me to call her daddy?

1303
01:20:50.321 --> 01:20:53.740
Am I walking into relationship with underlying daddy issues?
Helped me out.
Bill,

1304
01:20:53.741 --> 01:20:55.950
what should I do?
Oh,
I get to be doctors.

1305
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:59.600
<v 12>Bill.
Um,
so where do you use Howard Sachs?</v>

1306
01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:01.650
Will you all,

1307
01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:05.440
she wants you to call her daddy.

1308
01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.940
<v 1>This is our doctor.
Phil would handle it.
Yeah.</v>

1309
01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:11.420
<v 12>Well,
um,
most of our fan base is female.</v>

1310
01:21:11.421 --> 01:21:14.610
So you're the male in your,
therefore always wrong.

1311
01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:18.360
<v 1>Um,
no,
I would definitely bring it up to her.</v>

1312
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:20.450
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1313
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:21.091
<v 1>I will bring it up to,</v>

1314
01:21:21.091 --> 01:21:24.330
it's difficult to bring up something like that with somebody,

1315
01:21:24.331 --> 01:21:27.180
but if it bothers you,
you got to bring it up.
I would bring up.
Just say,
listen,

1316
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.140
um,
I'm not judging you or anything like that,

1317
01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:35.240
but for me,
you gotta,
you gotta keep an eye on us,

1318
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.760
your side of the bed.
It just feels weird.

1319
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.823
Now how do you say it?

1320
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:46.200
I don't feel comfortable having you call me daddy in bed.

1321
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:51.210
It just,
it makes just say uncomfortable.
Don't say weird.

1322
01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:57.510
And then,
Hey Nia,
I need you to help.

1323
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:05.220
<v 3>Oh,</v>

1324
01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:09.700
<v 1>oh,
you're here.
Keep coming.
I got the go in the other room.
All right.
This guy,</v>

1325
01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:12.940
this guy's with this girl who thinks she's great and everything she wants.

1326
01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:16.510
She wants a him the call,

1327
01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:20.800
she wants to call him daddy during sex and it weirds them out.

1328
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:25.210
How does he bring it up without making her feel like she's got a fucking
problem?

1329
01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.140
<v 9>I don't want you to call me daddy during sex because it makes me uncomfortable.</v>

1330
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1331
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:35.220
<v 9>I don't think it's wrong.
I'm not judging you,
but just for me.
For me,</v>

1332
01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.340
that was perfect.
Yeah,
just be honest.
There you go.
But just say,

1333
01:22:41.341 --> 01:22:42.390
I'm not trying to judge you.

1334
01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:45.480
I don't think you're weird cause I know a lot of people do it cause a lot of

1335
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:47.700
people do do it.
But just I,

1336
01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:51.630
it makes me uncomfortable and I'm not ready to go there just yet.

1337
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:56.280
Can we come up with something else left?
They went different language.

1338
01:22:56.281 --> 01:22:57.730
Like she I papi.
Yeah.

1339
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:04.870
<v 1>Well you just picture some completely random language.
Uh,</v>

1340
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:09.350
I is German.
Random enough German now.
You don't have to go there next to him.

1341
01:23:09.370 --> 01:23:14.120
She's taking a shit in your chest.
I don't know buddy.
You got a uh,
yeah.
Uh,

1342
01:23:14.230 --> 01:23:16.750
however Nia just said it.
That's perfect.
All right,

1343
01:23:16.751 --> 01:23:19.450
I'm going to wrap up the podcast here.
All right,
that's the podcast.
Everybody.

1344
01:23:19.451 --> 01:23:20.410

1346
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.380

but you know,

1347
01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:30.850

um,
I really appreciate it.
That's it.

1348

Um,

Tickets are hopefully going fast,

1350
01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.820
but hopefully there's some left so you can get them.

1351
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:45.460
Cause I'm saying this some left.
All right,
that's it.

1352
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:48.430
I'll talk to you and check in on you on Thursday.
Bye.
