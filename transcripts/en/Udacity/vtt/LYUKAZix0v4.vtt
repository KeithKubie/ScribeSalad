Hi. I'm Andy.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I graduated college in 2009, and I started traveling the world, biking across the country,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and basically living the life of a drifter.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When I found out about Udacity, I decided this was the job for me.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Last semester I TA'd Sebastian's class on Programming a Robotic Car,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and this semester I'm going to be TAing Peter's class on the Design of Computer Programs.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm going to be available in the forums to help you with your questions,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to record supplementary videos when there's things that seem confusing,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I'll be there for you to yell at in case the grading scripts don't work,

00:00:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
though I think we've got most of those bugs ironed out. See you in class.
