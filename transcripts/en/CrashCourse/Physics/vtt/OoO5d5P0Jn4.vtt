00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.820
HANK: So… Physics. Uh, right. Physics, physics,
physics, physics…are you getting all this?

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.069
We have been talking about doing Crash Course
Physics for a long, long, longlonglong time.

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:26.429
You’ve wanted it, we’ve wanted to do it, and now thanks to our friends at PBS Digital Studios, we’re doing it.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.460
There’s just one thing.
I’m hosting Crash Course Philosophy.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.300
But I do know someone super-qualified for the job.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.440
SHINI: Hi!

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.340
HANK: Hi. This is our host for Crash Course
Physics.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.060
Me? I’m gonna go have a corndog and host
Philosophy. Take it away, Shini!

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.500
SHINI: I’m Dr. Shini Somara, a mechanical
engineer and fluid dynamicist by qualification.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.070
For the last few years I've been hosting
science and  tech shows on TV,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.660
like TechKnow, Tomorrow's Food,
and The Health Show.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.420
Wanna know more about me?
There are links in the dooblydoo.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.420
So... let’s talk Physics! I love physics and chances
are you do too, even if you don’t know it yet.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.359
So I’m really excited to host this
series of Crash Course. In this series, we’ll

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:13.079
be covering AP Physics 1 &amp; 2, mostly. But we’ll also
have a little time for other things along the way.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.240
Everything you do, build, or say will be governed
by physics, so wouldn’t it be nice to read

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.640
the rule book? A rule book that will help
you through life. Physics is elegant.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.799
It’s also practical and fun. Understanding
time, position, velocity, and acceleration

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.579
and how they all work together can help you
understand your place in the universe -- literally!

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.320
And I’m sure you’ve heard of Newton’s
Laws, like his first law: An object in motion

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.169
will remain in motion, and an object at rest
will remain at rest, unless acted upon by a force.

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:47.380
But what does that mean?
And what does it have to do with acceleration?

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.289
And what are vectors? Scalars?
And what does this mean?

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.380
Kinetic Friction and Static Friction?
What’s the difference?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.240
We’ll explain all of that. But what’s
more special is getting to figure out why

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.319
understanding these things is so valuable.
Understanding how the world, the universe,

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:09.610
works gives us a richer and more immersive
experience in life. It gives us the opportunity

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.910
to see the beauty in nature in vast and unexpected
ways.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.250
Now a lot of people think physics is hard,
but it's easy!

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.450
Well, it’s as easy as we can make it.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.010
So join me, Dr. Shini Somara, this year on
Crash Course Physics which is produced in

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.230
association with our good friends at PBS Digital
Studios.
