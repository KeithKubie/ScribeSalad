00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.190
All right, Michael.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.935
So the first thing that I want to delve
into is the notion of solution concepts.

00:00:05.935 --> 00:00:08.020
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.110
&gt;&gt; Now, we've actually talked about
various solution concepts and

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.660
game theory one and game theory two but

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.830
we never actually, I don't think,
sort of explained what they were or

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.270
even pointed out that we were talking
about different solution concept.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.930
&gt;&gt; So do we need to talk about
the concept of solution concepts?

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.240
&gt;&gt; That's right, we need to talk
about the concept of concepts

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.870
because it's concepts all the way down.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.100
All right, so here's the basic idea.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:34.160
A solution concept or really just
a concept is basically just a rule for

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.150
predicting how a game
is going to be played.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.960
So the one that we spent the most time
on was Nash as a solution concept and

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.490
particularly Nash equilibrium.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.300
And so in the notion in
the language of solution

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.650
concepts you're basically saying that
there's a rule there's a kind of

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.450
formal process by which some particular
game's going to be played and that is

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.780
you're going to play with the idea that
you're getting into a Nash equilibrium.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.730
An equilibrium in general and

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.900
a Nash equilibrium in particular
because it doesn't makes sense.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.650
So we talked about a few
others mention a few others so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.379
we talked about Nash at length.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.090
&gt;&gt; And
what made Nash a Nash was that that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.760
all the players were playing in a way
that they couldn't unilaterally improve.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.380
Right?
So they were

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.940
doing best responses to whatever
it was the other player was doing.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.200
&gt;&gt; Right but actually that wasn't
really what made it Nash so much.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.620
Well it was but the big emphasis
there is actually on equilibrium.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.900
The idea is that you were
in an equilibrium because

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.000
it was in no individual's best interest
to move or to change in any way.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.510
In the particular kind of equilibrium
we're talking about was Nash.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.080
Okay.
So

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.750
in fact I want to talk about correlated
equilibrium because that's a different

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.080
kind of equilibrium,
that's still in equilibrium,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.420
but is different from Nash and
in some ways turns out to be

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.540
better under certain circumstances and
I'm going to even argue that

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.750
in fact we use correlated equilibrium
all the time in real life.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.610
I'll give you an example
of that at the end.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.490
&gt;&gt; But it's correlated,
so related to Nash?

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.130
Yes it is and
in a very particular way and

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.265
I will tell you how in a moment,
awesome.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:03.460
Okay so we're going to talk about
correlated equilibrium because that's

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.060
what I'm interested in but I shall point
out that there are several others.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.270
There's trembling hand,
there's Stackelberg competitions.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.308
There's subgame perfect.

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:14.720
We actually talked about subgame
perfect and when I say we I mean you.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.420
&gt;&gt; RIght, in the context of
multi-stage game sequential games.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.580
&gt;&gt; Right, game theory too.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.290
But it's still a solution concept so
this notion of concepts and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.340
solution concepts is not limited
to a simple Matrix Games but

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.060
actually all of these work whether
the games are repeated or not.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; There's also Bayes Nash we did not

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.320
talk about that.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.940
Coco you mentioned Coco.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.890
But I'm not going to talk about that and
there are a whole bunch of others and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.150
they just kind of go on and on and on
and I think when I talk about correlated

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.740
equilibrium and explain how this
solution concept entire back in

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.180
you might see various other ways you
might come up with solution concepts.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.810
I mean Trembling Hand sort of
scares me a little bit but

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.810
are we going to go into any
details about that in Stackelberg?

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.997
No I am not going to talk about this,
I'm not going to talk about this,

00:02:54.997 --> 00:02:57.276
I'm not going to talk about this, and
I'm not going to talk about this.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:58.831
And you know what I'm not
going to talk about this,

00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:00.280
I'm going to talk about that,
sound fair?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.000
Sounds like a segue.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.720
&gt;&gt; Sounds like a segue.
