00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:03.677
So you can add code to your app
to track how users view products,

00:00:03.677 --> 00:00:07.820
add products to the cart, checkout,
and finally purchase their products.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.344
You use two classes to label this kind
of tracking, Product and ProductAction.

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:19.396
The Product instances define a product,
and

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:24.380
ProductAction instances define what
the user is doing with the product.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.410
For example, let's say the user
adds a dinner to their cart.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.000
So they've selected their dinner, and
now they're going to put it in the cart.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.630
You'd create product like this,
new Product().

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.320
Set the name, set the price,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.040
set the variant, set the id,
and set the quantity.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.050
And of course, you're app would
actually calculate all these values

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.410
at the point at which the user
added the product to the cart.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.202
Then you'd create
the ProductAction like this.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:58.080
You just create ProductAction and
you specify the action.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.850
In this case, ACTION_ADD indicates that
the user added the product to the cart.

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:07.319
And after you create the Product and
the ProductAction,

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.860
you add them both to an event
to send to analytics, like this.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.685
Get the tracker, create the event hit,
set the category, set the label.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:22.975
And here, we add the product, and
here we set the product action.

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:24.675
So notice that you do these two things.

00:01:24.675 --> 00:01:28.225
You associate the product
action with the product

00:01:28.225 --> 00:01:31.615
when you create the event hit,
not when you create the product.
