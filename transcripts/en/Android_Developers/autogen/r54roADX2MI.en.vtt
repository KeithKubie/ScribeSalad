we're really secure we're really excited
 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.819
we're really secure we're really excited
about that but there are a couple of

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829
about that but there are a couple of
 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.890
about that but there are a couple of
also really important philosophical

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
also really important philosophical
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.750

principles that underlie everything we
 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.300
principles that underlie everything we
do when it comes to security we believe

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
do when it comes to security we believe
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.610
do when it comes to security we believe
in transparency and openness because

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.529
protective capabilities of Android are
now on par with any other mobile

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:09.539
now on par with any other mobile
 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.319
now on par with any other mobile
platform and I strongly believe that the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329
platform and I strongly believe that the
 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.779
platform and I strongly believe that the
power of open will accelerate those

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:14.789
power of open will accelerate those
 

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.640
power of open will accelerate those
protective capabilities for our users

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650

philosophy that underlies our strategy
 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.510
philosophy that underlies our strategy
is measurability

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520
is measurability
 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.969

work that we do to ensure we're
 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.939
work that we do to ensure we're
investing in the right directions but

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949
investing in the right directions but
 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.700

applications we call pH a on devices the
 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.460

bottom curve are devices that load only
 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.550
bottom curve are devices that load only
from play and the top curve our devices

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560
from play and the top curve our devices
 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.830
from play and the top curve our devices
don't load from sources other than play

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840
don't load from sources other than play
 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.170
don't load from sources other than play
and you can see over time it's been

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180
and you can see over time it's been
 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.589
and you can see over time it's been
reducing across all users so we are

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599
reducing across all users so we are
 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.570
reducing across all users so we are

over time we're constantly looking at
that and it's investing in the malware

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150
that and it's investing in the malware
 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.399
that and it's investing in the malware
detection engine itself today 60% of

we've had a 50% reduction in pH a on
 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.580
we've had a 50% reduction in pH a on
play and so we're really happy with the

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590
play and so we're really happy with the
 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.920
play and so we're really happy with the
progress but certainly we're we're not

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930

although I will say that the odds of
loading a PHA from play is about the

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099
loading a PHA from play is about the
 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.310
loading a PHA from play is about the
same as being struck by lightning so it

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320

really important measurement is the

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150
really important measurement is the
 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.420
really important measurement is the
overall ability of the operating system

in any complex product there going to be
 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.279
in any complex product there going to be
bugs but there's no reason why bugs have

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289
bugs but there's no reason why bugs have
 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.499
bugs but there's no reason why bugs have
to lead to exploitation to harm users

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509
to lead to exploitation to harm users
 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.040
to lead to exploitation to harm users
and so we work really hard on building

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050
and so we work really hard on building
 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.899

features and improvements that make it
Android much more difficult and

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310
Android much more difficult and
 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.450
Android much more difficult and
expensive to exploit so how do you

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460
expensive to exploit so how do you
 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.180
expensive to exploit so how do you
measure how well you're doing well

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190

make sure you set a lock screen and also

00:19:16.139 --> 00:19:16.149
make sure you set a lock screen and also
 

00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:18.879
make sure you set a lock screen and also
as an app developer make sure that you

00:19:18.879 --> 00:19:18.889
as an app developer make sure that you
 

00:19:18.889 --> 00:19:21.759
as an app developer make sure that you
do gate sensitive access on user

00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:21.769
do gate sensitive access on user
 

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:28.600
do gate sensitive access on user
presence on user authentication so an

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:28.610

Android P we added a few different

00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:30.769
Android P we added a few different
 

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:32.350
Android P we added a few different
features to help out developers do that

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360
features to help out developers do that
 

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.970
features to help out developers do that

which is the lock screen on Android and

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:51.620
which is the lock screen on Android and
 

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.009
which is the lock screen on Android and
so these keys can be used to encrypt

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:54.019
so these keys can be used to encrypt
 

00:19:54.019 --> 00:19:54.910
so these keys can be used to encrypt
data

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:54.920

and so the lifecycle of these keys are

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.150
and so the lifecycle of these keys are
 

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.200
and so the lifecycle of these keys are
tied to the lifecycle of the lock screen

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.210
tied to the lifecycle of the lock screen
 

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.940
tied to the lifecycle of the lock screen
for example if you have very sensitive
