00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:09.976
&gt;&gt;Peggy: Different than
a traditional classroom,

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:13.186
PBL's gonna integrate
assessment throughout the project.

00:00:13.326 --> 00:00:17.186
Because these projects are multi-week
projects, you need to keep on top

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:19.796
of students and build in
opportunities to assess

00:00:19.826 --> 00:00:22.506
where they are and what
they're learning as you go along

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:26.186
&gt;&gt;Sheela: From the minute a teacher
introduces that learning target

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.476
for the lesson, or engages
in strategic observation,

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.616
we feel that the assessment
process is in play.

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:35.546
&gt;&gt;Liza: It's not a test at the end
of the week or the end of the unit.

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:39.256
You're doing a lot of small
check-ins with the students to see

00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:41.636
where they're at and to see
that they're growing a lot.

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:44.276
So some examples of formative
assessments that I use

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.266
in my classroom is fist to five.

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:49.086
So five is, I feel really good
about this learning target,

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.196
I'm learning what I
need to in class today.

00:00:51.486 --> 00:00:53.466
A zero is, I have nothing.

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:57.956
&gt;&gt;Sheela: You really have to know
what kids know and don't know.

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:03.806
That can often determine what next
steps need to be put into place

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:08.316
in order to support or
differentiate the learning

00:01:08.516 --> 00:01:09.946
for the kids in their classroom.

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.236
&gt;&gt;Marianne: You saw
another form of assessment,

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:15.926
which we call a quick check,
or checking for understanding,

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:17.406
and that's sort of the thumbs up.

00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:20.116
I get it, sideways,
I'm not quite sure,

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.606
or thumbs down, no, I don't get it.

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:25.906
That's for them to reflect,
but it's also for us

00:01:25.906 --> 00:01:27.996
to do a check for their
understanding.

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:31.666
&gt;&gt;Peggy: It's just sharing some of
the responsibilities for assessment

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.716
with those who are most
involved with the project,

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:37.396
so you give students the
opportunity to assess themselves.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:39.856
You give them the opportunity
to assess their teammates.

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:44.776
&gt;&gt;Sheela: We find that some of the
most important and useful feedback is

00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:47.206
when kids can offer it to each other.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.096
&gt;&gt;Peggy: So typically in a PBL unit,

00:01:50.096 --> 00:01:52.696
the culminating event
is what all the students

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.516
and the teacher are working toward.

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:57.936
So usually, this involves
inviting community members,

00:01:57.936 --> 00:02:01.116
inviting other teachers, inviting
parents, to the classroom.

00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:02.886
Or maybe you even do
it in the evening

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:05.196
and you present what the
students have learned,

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:08.446
whether it's the final product,
something that they created,

00:02:08.446 --> 00:02:11.306
whether it's a solution to a
problem facing the community.

00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:14.896
So it's usually a big deal and
the teachers should take advantage

00:02:14.896 --> 00:02:17.216
of that being a big deal, because
the students are very proud

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:18.546
to present what they've learned.

00:02:18.676 --> 00:02:21.696
It really becomes an event where
students are showcasing all

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:25.016
that they've learned through
this big project, and their plans

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:27.016
for how they're going
to pursue it further.
