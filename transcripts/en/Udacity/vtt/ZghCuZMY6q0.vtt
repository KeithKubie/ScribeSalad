00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.969
Although the maternal and paternal lines trace

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.070
different chromosomes, they both converge on the same

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.290
notion of human evolution. All modern humans

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.820
share a common ancestor from Africa. Now with

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.790
early humans populated Africa and migrated up

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.600
the coast, to the north east. An event

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.750
of the Great Human Expansion resulted in

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.870
the human exit to the Eurasian continents and

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.880
the eventual colonization of Oceania and lastly

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.170
the Americas. Over a period of 40

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.850
thousand years, humans migrated and colonized new

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.720
areas. And at every step of the way,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040
each founder population had significantly reduced genetic

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.280
variation compared to the original larger populations from

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.950
which they migrated. Now we talked about this effect in lesson six. So I want

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.780
you to tell me, what is this founder effect

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.010
caused by? I want you to pick one of the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.830
following answers. And remember, that what we're talking about

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.170
here is the transition as humans go from Africa outwards,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.930
each time they colonize a region. It's only a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.510
subset of humans that colonize, so the gene pool is

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.090
a little bit smaller for that given population. As

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.070
they grow out, it expands again but then a new

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.660
region is colonized. And so you have a smaller group. Which

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.010
of the following do you think most appropriately applies to that?
