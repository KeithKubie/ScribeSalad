- Hi, I'm Poppy, do you want
to see something interesting?

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:07.707
- What the?

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.510
Hi, I'm Stryker

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.547
- Hi Stryker, why are you here?

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.783
- I'm pretty sure
you materialized me

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:20.586 align:start size:94% position:6%
with your special glitter,
but I can't remember.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.589
- Oh, are you in a band?

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.059
- No, I'm not that cool.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.226
I'm a DJ.

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.228 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Why aren't you wearing
a silly helmet like

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.297
all the other Djs?

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.133
- I'm not that kind
of DJ, I'm a real DJ,

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.735
I'm a disc jockey.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.071
- Oh wow, like on the radio?

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.607
- Yeah, exactly!

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.041
I talk into a microphone,

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.710
I get to interview
interesting people.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.446
- Don't you think people
should be able to see you?

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.481
If people could see
what you look like,

00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.818
you would be a lot more famous.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:55.789 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Poppy, yes, what an
interesting and remarkable

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.323
idea you have.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.291
- You should take a lot more
selfies, then you wouldn't

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.794
have to work so hard anymore.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:04.129
- Where have you been
the last 23 years?

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.167
I have been doing it
wrong the entire time!

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.004
(photos snapping)

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.779
- Oh you're doing great.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.682
- Hey, I think I got this.

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:24.784
- You got it Stryker, now
you know what it's like

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:27.619 align:start size:97% position:3%
to have a completely
neutral attitude and outlook

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.023
on our meaningless existence.
