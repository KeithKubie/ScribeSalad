00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.540
Bruce Willis.
What a career, right?

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.660
"The Fifth Element,"
"The Sixth Sense,"

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.650
"The Whole Nine Yards,"

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.610
"12 Monkeys."

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.340
Zero Oscars.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.690
[ Laughter ]

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.830
Quentin Tarantino,
M. Night Shyamalan,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.620
Wes Anderson, Michael Bay,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.020
these are just some
of Bruce’s directors

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.720
who refused to be here tonight.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.470
[ Laughter ]

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.490
Bruce Willis is what you get

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.430
if you isolate the white part

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.130
of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.690
[ Laughter ]

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.020
And -- And it’s not just action
movies that made Bruce a star.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.050
He’s actually a great
dramatic actor, too.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.240
I loved "The Sixth Sense."

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.770
It’s a great movie.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.620
And it’s a really
impressive performance.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.540
I don’t know how you pretended
not to be embarrassed

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.750
while a 10-year-old kid

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.320
acted circles around you.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.360
But you did it.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.600
And, uh -- And the ending.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.480
I did not see that twist coming.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.010
I mean I-I shouldn’t spoil it,
but...

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.220
I mean, fuck it.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.420
It’s been like 20 years.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.630
It’s so good.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.130
Okay, so, at the end
of "The Sixth Sense,"

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.290
Bruce goes back
to making shitty movies.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.140
[ Laughter ]

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.670
I had a blast working with Bruce

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.220
in a time-travel movie
called "Looper."

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.470
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.170
Thank you, thank you.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.120
So, in the film, uh,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.130
I play a young Bruce Willis,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.170
and he played
a washed-up Bruce Willis.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.910
But it was this crazy
sci-fi premise

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.290
where I end up in the future

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710
and Bruce ends up
in a good movie made after 1999.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.970
[ Laughter ]

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.860
We want you to have
a good time tonight,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920
but don’t get too comfortable
up here,

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.030
because later,
we’re gonna be replacing you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.140
with Ashton Kutcher.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.580
Relax!

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.340
Relax.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.080
Bruce gets along with him fine.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.610
He was even at Ashton
and Demi’s wedding.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.750
His gift was a toaster
and $90 million dollars.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.030
